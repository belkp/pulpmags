MASON, Associate Editor</p><p> LIFE ON OTHER PLANETS</p><p> By HUGO GERNSBACK</p><p>0	the average science-fiction</p><p>author, it is a foregone conclu- </p><p>sion that life on other planets </p><p>will be found similar to what </p><p>we have on Earth. Writers </p><p>talk about “human beings” </p><p>found on the planets Mars or </p><p>Venus, and these are usually assumed to be </p><p>constituted the same as our own race. </p><p> Modern science scoffs at such notions; be-</p><p>cause the chances are less than one in a mil- </p><p>lion for finding a type even remotely resemb- </p><p>ling the human race on any of the plants that </p><p>could harbor life. There is little doubt, that </p><p>practically none of the planets, with the ex- </p><p>ception of Venus and Mars, are able to sujt- </p><p>port human life as we know it. Of the inner </p><p>planets, only Venus has conditions analogous </p><p>to those on Earth; while Mercury is certainly </p><p>iar too hot to support human life. </p><p> Mars, being a smaller body than the earth</p><p>and not much larger than our Moon, presum- </p><p>ably cooled down millions of years before the </p><p>earth; hence the prevailing notion of science- </p><p>fiction writers is that the intelligence of </p><p>Martians, if there be any, must be far in ad- </p><p>vance of that of earthlings; while life on </p><p>Venus, which has not as yet cooled down and </p><p>has an almost impenetrable atmosphere, is </p><p>probably still in the dinosaur stage. </p><p> Immediately the thought confronts us: if</p><p>Mars is a logical abode for human life, and </p><p>is so far in advance of the earth, then why </p><p>have those “human beings” not made their </p><p>presence known to us before?</p><p> Furthermore, science today concedes that</p><p>interplanetary travel will probably come </p><p>about during the next hundred years. If </p><p>terrestrial beings, therefore, can make a trip </p><p>to the Moon or to Mars it seems absurd to </p><p>believe that the supposed Martians with a </p><p>civilization millions of years in advance of </p><p>hunvan beings should not have done likewise </p><p>during their evolution. If we are so far be- </p><p>hind in the scale of evolution as compared to </p><p>the Martians it would be more than pre- </p><p>sumptuous to believe that we can steal a </p><p>march on the®. </p><p> Logically, then, something is wrong with</p><p>our reasoning. However a solution probably </p><p>is not so difficult to find; and while every- </p><p>thing in connection with this analysis must </p><p>be based on pure guesswork one of the </p><p>thoughts given below may contain the correct </p><p>answer. </p><p> If Mars cooled down millions ©f years ago</p><p>and evolved intelligent life such as we know </p><p>it at that time, it is almost certain in that </p><p>case that the Martians constructed space- </p><p>fliers and visited the different planets. </p><p>They could not then make a landing on </p><p>Earth; for the simple reason that it proba- </p><p>bly had not cooled down or else it was in such </p><p>a state of development that it could not sup- </p><p>port Martian life. The same would be the </p><p>case with all of the other planets that they </p><p>visited. So the chances are that the Mar- </p><p>tians had to return regretfully to their own </p><p>planet and remain there until the race died </p><p>out. In this case, any future earth trav- </p><p>elers to Mars will find the remains of pre- </p><p>historic Martian civilization. </p><p> On the other hand, Mars may contain in-</p><p>telligent life today, but not as we know it. </p><p>It may perhaps take the form of insect life, </p><p>and it is not even impossible that a race of </p><p>insects, similar to our termites or ants, who </p><p>can reason as well as we can, may have </p><p>developed. If the race is blind, as are ter- </p><p>mites, of course they could not know about </p><p>other planets; and would therefore make no </p><p>attempt to visit us. All of this is possible. </p><p>It would also support the theories of the </p><p>Martian canals. Such Martians may have </p><p>high intelligence, yet an intelligence that </p><p>could not conceive a space-flier. </p><p> Third and last: evolution on Mars might</p><p>have taken an entirely different line of devel-</p><p>opment than on earth and it is not at all </p><p>necessary that intelligent life should have </p><p>developed on the planet. In this case, also, </p><p>such life could not conceive of travelling to </p><p>other worlds. </p><p> Any one of the three guesses may be right;</p><p>and somewhere in between them we probably </p><p>have the eerrect solution. </p><p>629 </p><p>The Outpost </p><p> on the Moon</p><p>Illuslraled by Paul </p><p>They believed themselves alone on the desolate Moon♦ </p><p>But then the ray of the Outpost flashed its </p><p>deadly challenge from the skies! </p><p>opening in the line of closely-packed car® </p><p>presented itself. </p><p> The falling darkness brought with it a</p><p>light rain which rendered the highways in- </p><p>creasingly slippery, and as the approach- </p><p>ing cars turned on their headlights one by </p><p>one, the driving became very difficult. The </p><p>pace I was taking was the height of folly, </p><p>but I was cold to the marrow, and reason </p><p>was swept aside in my hurry to reach the </p><p>warmth which awaited. I rushed heedless- </p><p>ly past a sign which read “SHARP CURVE” </p><p>and swung over to the left-hand side of the </p><p>road in order to pass the car ahead of me. </p><p>Too late I saw the coupe roundiiig the curve </p><p>630 </p><p>IT was late on a Sunday afternoon in early </p><p>spring. Impelled by a feeling of rest- </p><p>less loneliness, I had taken my little second- </p><p>hand roadster for a drive, wandering at ran- </p><p>dom over the highways, far from the city. </p><p>The day had been deceivingly mild, and I </p><p>had left my overcoat at home; now the </p><p>lowering sun and a chilling breeze forced me </p><p>to head for my little third-floor room in the </p><p>heart of the great metropolis. The numb- </p><p>ness of my fingers and toes influenced me </p><p>to discard the caution that crowded roads </p><p>and hurrying cars require; my foot rested </p><p>more and more heavily on the accelerator, </p><p>until I was passing the traffic wherever an </p><p>By Joslyn </p><p> Maxwell</p><p>Fascinated I watched the machine climb into the pitiless sky. </p><p>Langley muttered: “Twenty men and one fool pilot!” </p><p>toward me. 1 could not drop back into </p><p>line, there was not time to pass the car </p><p>ahead; I must leave the road or crash. In- </p><p>stantly I chose the former alternative, swung </p><p>my wheel hard to the left and jammed on </p><p>my brakes. There was a moment of jarring </p><p>over rough earth, a violent shock, and I was </p><p>lying on the seat behind the twisted steering </p><p>wheel. </p><p> It was one of those freak wrecks. The car</p><p>was completely demolished, yet I had es- </p><p>caped without a scratch. I found myself </p><p>unable to get out of the machine, which had </p><p>hit a telephone pole and was so bent out of </p><p>shape as to be almost unrecognizable. Pieces </p><p>of glass lay all about me, yet not one had </p><p>touched my skin. In fact, the only injury </p><p>I could discover outside of a severe shaking- </p><p>up was a slight bruise on my left elbow. </p><p> While I was debating the best method of</p><p>escape, I heard voices close to the car, and </p><p>presently a head appeared through an open- </p><p>ing in the wreckage of the top. </p><p> “Are you alive?” the owner of the head</p><p>asked excitedly, and a bit timidly. </p><p> “Quite all right, thanks, but I can’t get</p><p> out,” I replied. The head disappeared, and</p><p> I heard a murmur of voices; people passing</p><p> the news along to the constantly growing</p><p> crowd:—“he’s all right”—“nobody's hurt ’.</p><p> Presently the man who had first spoken re-</p><p> appeared with a fence rail which he used</p><p> as a crow-bar, prying open a hole large</p><p> enough for me to get through, albeit with</p><p> some damage to my clothes.</p><p> I found myself in the midst of a circle of</p><p> curious passers-by, most of whom, to judge</p><p> by their expressions, thought that I had got</p><p> no more than I deserved. Perhaps they were</p><p> right, but I hoped that at least one of them</p><p> would forget his prejudice to the extent of</p><p> offering me a ride back to the city. It was</p><p> in thus looking over the crowd that my</p><p> glance fell on a familiar figure. I recog-</p><p> nized him almost immediately as Barton</p><p> Wiley, a prominent physicist, who during</p><p> my attendance at the City College had been</p><p> a young instructor. That institution had</p><p> now grown to the proportions of a good-</p><p> sized university, though still retaining its</p><p>631 </p><p>632 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>original name; and with its rise Wiley had </p><p>attained considerable fame through his ex- </p><p>periments in electricity. He was now Pro- </p><p>fessor of Physics. After thanking the man </p><p>who had liberated me, 1 spoke to him. </p><p> “Do you remember me, Professor Wiley?</p><p>George Marland—1 was a graduate student </p><p>at the City College nine years ago.” </p><p> “Yes, indeed, Mar-</p><p>land,” he replied. “So </p><p>it was you! Appar- </p><p>ently the laws of man </p><p>do not appeal to you </p><p>as much as those of </p><p>nature!” He laughed. </p><p>“May I give you a ride </p><p>back to town? I see </p><p>you were in a bit of a </p><p>hurry to get there.” </p><p>He indicated with a </p><p>wave of his hand one </p><p>of the autos parked </p><p>alongside the road, and </p><p>noting gratefully that </p><p>it was a closed car, I </p><p>accepted. </p><p> We climbed in, and</p><p>he headed the car for </p><p>the city. On passing </p><p>through a nearby vil- </p><p>lage, I made arrange- </p><p>ments with the local </p><p>garage-owner to col- </p><p>lect such of my car as </p><p>was worth salvaging </p><p>and dispose of it to a </p><p>junkdealer for what </p><p>it would bring. </p><p> As we proceeded to-</p><p>ward the city, there </p><p>was little conversation </p><p>between us, the profes- </p><p>sor being intent on </p><p>watching the road, and </p><p>I had an opportunity </p><p>to reflect on my acquaintance with him in </p><p>the past. During my graduate work, I had </p><p>come in contact with him often, and a </p><p>friendship had grown up between us. He</p><p>had urged me to accept a position as in- </p><p>structor at the college, but I had preferred </p><p>to try my luck in the commercial world. </p><p> He had remained to watch the growth of the</p><p> College; and after an unsuccessful attempt</p><p> to find work in the laboratory of some large</p><p> corporation, I had drifted into the news-</p><p> paper business.</p><p> My chief success in that line had been the</p><p> writing of near-scientific articles for the</p><p> Sunday supplements; but I had wearied of</p><p> the job, and tried mv</p><p> hand at one thing and</p><p> another. The interven-</p><p> ing nintT' years had</p><p> passed quickly, and</p><p> found me no nearer</p><p> to fame and fortune</p><p> than when I had grad-</p><p> uated. Perhaps if I</p><p> had followed his ad-</p><p> vice I should now be</p><p> in a position compar-</p><p> able to his own. He</p><p> was highly regarded in</p><p> scientific circles for</p><p> his research work in</p><p> the field of electricity,</p><p> and had made less</p><p> known, though per-</p><p> haps even more start-</p><p> ling discoveries re-</p><p> garding the structure</p><p> of the atom. Of his</p><p> methods I knew little,</p><p> but his results had</p><p> often been published.</p><p> He had succeeded in</p><p> repeating the experi-</p><p> ments of Rutherford,</p><p> in which atoms of ni-</p><p> trogen were broken</p><p> down into helium and</p><p> hydrogen; and it was</p><p> rumored that he was</p><p> working on the ever-</p><p> fascinating problem of</p><p> getting energy out of</p><p> atoms. I welcomed an opportunity to talk</p><p> over some of these matters with him, as pre-</p><p> sented by our present accidental meeting.</p><p> AS though my thoughts had suggested</p><p> themselves to him, the professor turn-</p><p> ed to me.</p><p> j NE of the greatest ar- v</p><p> I guments in favor of in-</p><p> terplanetary travel comes</p><p> from the lack of ability of</p><p> our scientists to conduct</p><p> complete studies of the</p><p> heavens from the earth.</p><p> The same blanket of at-</p><p> mosphere that protects us</p><p> from the cold of outer</p><p> space and deadly rays, also</p><p> serves as a blanket against</p><p> our telescopes and other in-</p><p> struments of observation.</p><p> What scientists would</p><p> consider as ideal would be</p><p> a place of observation with</p><p> no air or dust whatever</p><p> separating them from the</p><p> heavens.

You </p><p>must have had some experiences during the </p><p>years since you left the College that would </p><p>interest a man like myself, who never gets </p><p>out of the laboratory except to teach </p><p>classes.” </p><p> I told him that I would be delighted, but</p><p>that I was much more anxious to hear more </p><p>of his work than to talk of my own fruit- </p><p>less efforts. </p><p> Accordingly we dined at a neat little res-</p><p>taurant close to the City College, near which </p><p>he maintained his residence. Our conver- </p><p>sation ran to pleasantries and topics of </p><p>current public interest; by common consent </p><p>we deferred deeper sub- </p><p>jects until we had finish- </p><p>ed the meal. </p><p> When we reached the</p><p>professor’s comfortable </p><p>little apartment, and had </p><p>lighted cigarettes and set- </p><p>tled ourselves comfort- </p><p>ably, I again broached </p><p>the subject of his work. </p><p>He said nothing for a </p><p>moment, apparently lost </p><p>in reflection. </p><p> He looked much the</p><p>same as when I had seen </p><p>him conducting classes; </p><p>a tall man, of rather </p><p>slight build, with regular </p><p>features too large to be </p><p>called handsome. His </p><p>hair, now graying slightly, was, as always, </p><p>perfectly combed; and in spite of hie shell- </p><p>rimmed spectacles and slight stoop, his ap- </p><p>pearance suggested rather the distinguished </p><p>man of leisure than the scholar. </p><p> I was startled out of my contemplations</p><p>by his voice, mild and slow, yet with great </p><p>carrying power. </p><p> “I understand, Marland, that you are con-</p><p>nected with a news agency, and if I remem- </p><p>ber rightly you have been the author of a </p><p>number of articles purporting to describe</p><p>the discoveries of research workers.” </p><p> I nodded assent.</p><p> He continued, “In that case I should</p><p>ordinarily have nothing to say. But since </p><p>I take it that your question has been </p><p>prompted more by a personal interest than </p><p>by a desire for news, and provided that </p><p>you give me your word that you will pub- </p><p>lish nothing I may tell you without my </p><p>express permission, I shall be glad to talk </p><p>over some of my experiments with you.” </p><p> I assured him that whatever he said</p><p>would be held as strictly confidential, and </p><p>that my interest was purely that of a student </p><p>of science in the work of a successful re- </p><p>searcher. He smiled. </p><p> “I can hardly be called successful,” he</p><p>said. “For the most part I have merely </p><p>done what others have done before me. </p><p>There was considerable comment in scien- </p><p>tific journals, I believe, </p><p>over my attempts to </p><p>change the structure of </p><p>the nitrogen atom, which </p><p>were in part successful. </p><p>As you doubtless recall, </p><p>the atom consists of a </p><p>number of charges of pos- </p><p>itive and negative elec- </p><p>trcity. These normally </p><p>neutralize each other; but </p><p>occasionally a change in </p><p>the number of negative </p><p>charges, or electrons, as </p><p>they are called, takes </p><p>place in the outer limits </p><p>of the atom; one or more </p><p>electrons may be picked </p><p>up or lost, and the atom </p><p>becomes an ion. This is </p><p>of course familiar to you, but I am merely </p><p>restating it in order that you may be pre- </p><p>pared for what 1 am about to say. </p><p> “With the single exception of experiments</p><p>like those 1 have recently performed, no </p><p>one has been able to redistribute the pro- </p><p>tons, or positive charges. Of course, in the </p><p>very heavy metals, such as uranium, radium, </p><p>and the whole class of radioactive elements, </p><p>this goes on spontaneously; the nuclei of </p><p>helium atoms being liberated in the form of </p><p>alpha-ray8, and electrons in the beta-rays.</p><p>But to do it artificially to any of the other </p><p>elements, or to even speed up the spontan- </p><p>eous processes of radioactivity, is at present </p><p>impossible.” </p><p>JOSLYN MAXWELL </p><p>634 </p><p>WONDER </p><p>STORIES </p><p> J[ nodded, leaning forward interestedly.</p><p>“Even were this accomplished, it would </p><p>not necessarily result in the liberation of </p><p>energy. That is not the end to which my </p><p>efforts have been directed, contrary to cer- </p><p>tain reports. The aim of the modern al- </p><p>chemist—that of transmuting one element </p><p>into another, such as mercury into gold— </p><p>has been my field. As I say, I have as yet </p><p>been unsuccessful. </p><p> “But let us suppose that one could, at his</p><p>desire, separate the protons and electrons </p><p>of an atom, and recombine them. It would </p><p>be possible for such a person to make at </p><p>will any element or chemical compound he </p><p>wished, from any other; or perhaps to cre- </p><p>ate a substance as yet unknown to us—a </p><p>metal whose atomic weight was greater than </p><p>that of uranium, for example. Such an </p><p>element would probably be highly radio- </p><p>active, if we may judge from the behavior </p><p>of those radioactive substances already </p><p>known.” </p><p> “You mean,” I asked, “that it would be</p><p>possible in that manner to liberate the lat- </p><p>ent energy of the atom?” </p><p> “No,” he returned, “that is not what I</p><p>had in mind. But a substance so unbalanced </p><p>in structure might easily be a storage bat- </p><p>tery, so to speak, of vast quantities of ener- </p><p>gy, which could be built up slowly and liber- </p><p>ated quickly.” </p><p>Less Than Nothing! </p><p>HE was silent for a moment, and I took </p><p>the opportunity to ask, “What of your </p><p>experiments in electricity?” </p><p> “That has been more of a hobby with me</p><p>than a subject of real research,” he replied. </p><p>“The two fields are closely related, how- </p><p>ever. We know that electric charges are </p><p>merely unbalanced proportions of electrons </p><p>and protons, and that an electric current is </p><p>nothing more than a stream of moving </p><p>electrons.” Again he paused for a moment, </p><p>looking at me intently. </p><p> “Marland,” he said, “If I remember right-</p><p>ly, you once remarked on the similarity of </p><p>the behavior of astronomical bodies to that </p><p>of electric charges of opposite sign, and </p><p>asked whether it might not be possible to </p><p>discover some sort of ‘negative’ gravity, </p><p>which would repel, and be repelled by, mat- </p><p>ter as we know it. I answered you, I believe, </p><p>by saying that the resemblance was merely </p><p>superficial: and to prove my point I called </p><p>your attention to the fact that when two </p><p>charged bodies approach one another there </p><p>is a redistribution of the electrons, which </p><p>repel each other and consequently are driven </p><p>to the far sides of their respective bodies; </p><p>while no such redistribution takes place </p><p>when two bodies are placed each within the </p><p>gravitational field of the other. Since our </p><p>discussion Einstein has brought out his </p><p>theory on the interchangeability of gravity </p><p>and electricity: and I have found, in the </p><p>laboratory, definite corroboration of his </p><p>views!” </p><p> He stopped, but I remained silent, know</p><p>ing that he had not yet finished. Presently </p><p>he resumed: “We believe that an atom— </p><p>say of hydrogen, since it's the simplest of all </p><p>—consists of a positive charge at the center, </p><p>and a moving negative charge. We’ve as- </p><p>signed a pretty definite size and weight to </p><p>the negative charge—the electron. But the </p><p>hydrogen atom weighs nearly two thousand </p><p>times as much as this electron, so we say </p><p>that the difference must be in the proton; </p><p>and to make it agree with our theories we </p><p>say it has the same charge as the electron, </p><p>but is much smaller. I know it sounds </p><p>rather contradictory to say that the smaller </p><p>body has the greater weight, but that’s all </p><p>covered in the electromagnetic theory of </p><p>mass, some of which has been developed </p><p>9ince your time. </p><p> “I fell to speculating on what would hap-</p><p>pen if the negative charge could be made </p><p>smaller, and therefore heavier, or the proton </p><p>larger and lighter. I devised some exper- </p><p>iments along that line, and with rather </p><p>startling results, I assure you. For when I </p><p>succeeded in exchanging the weight of the </p><p>proton and the electron I found that I had </p><p>actually created a ‘negative element’—one </p><p>which weighed less than nothing! Contin- </p><p>uing along this line, I made another cur- </p><p>ious discovery—that when a proton and an </p><p>electron of the same weight are combined, </p><p>their weight disappears ehiirely (though</p><p>not their inertia); and furthermore, they </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>635 </p><p>absorb the force of gravity, so that matter </p><p>made up of these charges, which I have </p><p>called ‘equi-protons’ and 4equi-electrons\ </p><p>weighs nothing, and is a perfect insulator </p><p>against gravity!” </p><p> “Like Cavorite!” I exclaimed. H. G.</p><p>Wells’ famous story, “The First Man in the </p><p>Moon,” flashed into my mind. Here was </p><p>the very sort of thing that had enabled his </p><p>heroes to make their voyage to our satel- </p><p>lite. Why shouldn’t his dream become a </p><p>reality? </p><p> “No, not Cavorite.” Professor Wiley’s</p><p>amused face brought me back to earth with </p><p>a flush. “Wells’ imaginary compound, if </p><p>you will remember, was made into shutters </p><p>fastened on the outside of his glass space- </p><p>car. But, unfortunately, you can’t make a </p><p>gas into shutters. And that is what I have </p><p>been experimenting with—hydrogen gas!” </p><p> I experience a feeling of bitter disappoint-</p><p>ment. Stories of trips through interplane- </p><p>tary space, independent of the attraction of </p><p>the heavenly bodies as well as that of the </p><p>earth, had always excited my imagination; </p><p>and in the brief flight of fancy which I had </p><p>just experienced, I had hoped to actually </p><p>witness the accomplishment of this dream. </p><p> At length my thoughts returned to Wiley’s</p><p>remarks. 1 was curious to know something </p><p>of the method by which he accomplished this </p><p>wonderful thing. The explanation which he </p><p>gave I shall not reproduce in detail, for </p><p>many reasons; primarily because the pro- </p><p>cess is not protected by patent; and also be- </p><p>cause the mathematics involved would be </p><p>meaningless to the average reader. Let it </p><p>suffice, then, that the procedure consisted </p><p>in passing hydrogen ions through electric </p><p>and magnetic fields of such intensity as had </p><p>not been produced anywhere else on earth; </p><p>and that, in the end, the dimensions of the </p><p>proton wrere expanded to those of the elec- </p><p>tron. Then, their charges being equal and </p><p>opposite, the respective weights became like- </p><p>wise. Wiley offered no explanation of the </p><p>absorption of the force of gravity; he con- </p><p>fessed frankly that it was beyond his ability </p><p>to explain at present. </p><p>WHEN he had finished, speaking, I</p><p>asked him whether he had tried thd </p><p>process on any substance other than hydro- </p><p>gen-ions. He replied that he didn’t believe </p><p>it would work with any others, but that he </p><p>intended experimenting with helium shortly. </p><p> “You see,” he explained, “there are elec-</p><p>trons and protons bound together in the </p><p>nucleus of the atom; and you can’t very </p><p>well affect one without affecting the others.” </p><p>However, he said, he proposed to run the </p><p>test on a number of common elements, in- </p><p>cluding some of the lighter solids. In re- </p><p>sponse to my eager questions, he admitted </p><p>that should one of these last behave in the </p><p>same manner as hydrogen he would indeed </p><p>have a substance similar to Cavorite. </p><p> “But,” said Wiley, “If it should turn out,</p><p>I’d have to keep it dark, else some idiot </p><p>would want to start right off on a trip to </p><p>Mars. Of course, no one with sense enough </p><p>to know the danger would think of it; and </p><p>it would take a man who realizes the danger </p><p>and who understands astronomy to carry it </p><p>through successfully. Yet there’s always </p><p>some fool ready to try it. He'd undoubted- </p><p>ly be lost, thereby giving the hopes of those </p><p>who might be competent a severe setback.” </p><p>“Not necessarily,” I exclaimed. “Why, </p><p>I’d be glad to undertake the trip. I’ve stud- </p><p>ied astronomy enough to plot my course.” </p><p>“You!” exclaimed Wiley. </p><p> “And why not?” I demanded. “After all,</p><p>I’ve been enough of a failure at everything </p><p>else to deserve a chance at success in this. </p><p>And I’ve no connections, no property—noth- </p><p>ing at all to tie me here to the earth.” </p><p>Wiley regarded me steadily for perhaps a </p><p>minute, before speaking. </p><p> “Well,” he said at length, “we’ve let our</p><p>fancies run away with us, since the success </p><p>of the vital element hasn’t been tested yet. </p><p>Our gravitation-screen is merely an idea so </p><p>far.” This was obviously intended to dis- </p><p>courage me and divert my attention from the </p><p>question of a trans-ethereal flight. His next </p><p>words, however, assured me that he expected </p><p>success. </p><p> “If I were you,” he said, “I should let the</p><p>matter drop. In lime it will be accomp- </p><p>lished, but one is foolhardy to anticipate </p><p>developments. The first aviator didn't set </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>off for Paris; he left that to a man better </p><p>trained, and with the equipment and exper- </p><p>ience developed through a quarter of a cen- </p><p>tury.” </p><p> “True enough,” I answered. “The Wright</p><p>Brothers didn’t set off for Paris; but they </p><p>flew as far as they could. A flight to Mars </p><p>would perhaps be too much at present; but </p><p>why not a trip to the moon—only a two- </p><p>hundredth part of the distance?” </p><p> “What would be the object of that?" ask-</p><p>ed Wiley. </p><p> “What was the object of the Wrights in</p><p>flying their few miles?” I retorted. “To </p><p>show the world that it could be done, and </p><p>to encourage others to try it.” </p><p> “Perhaps you're right.” he said slowly.</p><p>“But I must have your promise to say ab- </p><p>solutely nothing of what we have discussed </p><p>toriight.” </p><p> —“Given—on condition that you keep me</p><p>informed of your progress in your experi- </p><p>ments,” I replied. </p><p> We agreed, and I departed exultantly, for</p><p>I knew from his manner that he would be </p><p>successful if he made the attempt to produce </p><p>the gravity-resisting solid; and I knew also </p><p>that he would never allow the opportunity </p><p>for such a discovery to escape him. </p><p> But my thoughts were turned away from</p><p>Wiley and his experiments in an unforeseen </p><p>manner. When 1 reached my residence I </p><p>found a call from the chief of my news bur- </p><p>eau. There were reports that China had </p><p>declared war on Russia; the Washington </p><p>office was short-handed, and I was ordered </p><p>to catch the first train there to cover devel- </p><p>opments. I hastily packed a suitcase, caught </p><p>the midnight train, and reported for duty </p><p>shortly before nine the next morning. </p><p> During the next two weeks I found plenty</p><p>to occupy my mind. I was new at the task </p><p>of reporting political news; consequently I </p><p>spent hours where more experienced men </p><p>would have taken minutes, searching in vain </p><p>through the dark halls and airy rooms of </p><p>the big State, War, and Navy building for </p><p>someone with both authority and inclination </p><p>to speak; attending conferences at the White</p><p>House in company with a dozen or more </p><p>representatives of rival press agencies; or </p><p>waiting in the ante-room of the State Depart- </p><p>ment’s press bureau for a mimeographed </p><p>“handout” radioed from the Consul General </p><p>at Shanghai. </p><p> News is no respecter of the clock, and</p><p>coming as it did from the other side of the </p><p>world, it happened as often as not that the </p><p>most important developments were reported </p><p>to the national capital in the small hours of </p><p>the morning. Time and again my slumber </p><p>was broken by phone calls from the inde- </p><p>fatigable chief of the Press Bureau, inform- </p><p>ing me that a statement was being prepared. </p><p> It was after such a night, spent in trying</p><p>to beat rival reporters to the wire, that I </p><p>returned to my room and found a letter </p><p>bearing Wiley’s name above the return ad- </p><p>dress. I tore it open and read it at a </p><p>glance: </p><p> “Dear Marland:</p><p> “After trying unsuccessfully several</p><p> times to reach you by phone, I was in-</p><p> formed by your office that you were in</p><p> Washington covering the Russo-Chinese</p><p> outbreak and were apt to be there for</p><p> some time. I had hoped to see you soon;</p><p> but I trust you will communicate with</p><p> me immediately upon your return.</p><p> “Referring to our conversation of the</p><p> other night, if you will come to my labor-</p><p> atory at your earliest convenience I may</p><p> be able to show you something of inter-</p><p> est.</p><p> “Cordially,</p><p>“Barton Wiley.” </p><p>He had succeeded! </p><p>CHAPTER II. </p><p>Success! </p><p>WILEY’S letter filled me with an im- </p><p>mense impatience to see him at once. </p><p>A leave of absence from my duties at this </p><p>time was out of the question; the only re- </p><p>maining alternative was to resign. I gave </p><p>notice, and waited with what patience I</p><p>could muster until a man had been found to </p><p>fill my place, meanwhile notifying Wiley </p><p>of my intentions. </p><p> Upon being relieved from duty, I caught</p><p>the first train, and hastened to the labora- </p><p>tories of the City College. I found my </p><p>friend making preparations for another of </p><p>his innumerable experiments, but on seeing </p><p>me he dropped everything and, dismissing </p><p>his assistant, led me to a corner of the room </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>637 </p><p>where there lay a heavy box, apparently </p><p>fastened firmly to the floor. I could feel </p><p>a strong draft of air rising about it, and as </p><p>he unlocked it, the lid flew back apparently </p><p>of its own volition. Observing my surprise, </p><p>Wiley explained these phenomena. </p><p> “As you probably surmised,” he said, “I</p><p>have been successful. I have in this box a </p><p>plate which is perfectly impervious to the </p><p>force of gravity. Nothing above it has any </p><p>weight; hence the vertical air-current and </p><p>the lightness of the lid.” </p><p> He reached into the box and brought out</p><p>what appeared to be a square of blackness, </p><p>and laid it on the table. Do not misunder- </p><p>stand me; it did not in the least resemble a </p><p>piece of black wood or metal; there was no </p><p>reflected gloss, no appearance of solidity; </p><p>it was as though I was looking into a bot- </p><p>tomless hole in the laboratory table, and </p><p>the effect was heightened by the strong up- </p><p>ward draft. I commented on this, and </p><p>again Wiley satisfied my curiosity with a </p><p>simple explanation. </p><p> “The color of this substance differs from</p><p>what we ordinarily refer to as “black’ in </p><p>that it absorbs practically all of the light </p><p>which strikes it,” he said. “Ordinarily </p><p>black paint reflects enough light to make it </p><p>visible, but the human eye is unable to de- </p><p>tect any reflection from this. There is no </p><p>visible surface, and therefore nothing from </p><p>which to judge its location. The effect is </p><p>the same as that of looking into an unlighted </p><p>hole.” </p><p> I was struck by another thought. “If the</p><p>air above it has no w'eight,” I said, “won’t </p><p>ii escape into space?” </p><p> “I hardly think so,” he answered. “This</p><p>plate is six inches square, and removes the </p><p>influence of gravity from a column that </p><p>large directly over it. • However, as the air </p><p>arises, it expands equally in all directions, </p><p>and the greater part by far is forced out </p><p>over the ground again. There are probably </p><p>strong currents high in the atmosphere </p><p>which blow the rising air out of line with </p><p>this gravity-resister. Then, too, think what </p><p>an infinitesimal portion of the globe it cov- </p><p>ers; all the rest is free to attract the air</p><p>after it gets a little way up.” </p><p> “One more question,” I said. “Why</p><p>doesn’t the plate itself fly upward?” </p><p> “I took the precaution to cement it to a</p><p>sheet of iron, on the under side,” said Wiley. </p><p> For a few moments he demonstrated the</p><p>peculiar properties of his discovery; hold- </p><p>ing objects above it and allowing them to </p><p>rise until stopped by the ceiling, where they </p><p>remained until he slid the black plate from </p><p>beneath them, or juggling them up and </p><p>down by passing it back and forth, allow- </p><p>ing the force of gravity to act intermittently. </p><p>At length he returned the plate to its box, </p><p>pushed down the lid and fastened it. Then </p><p>he faced me. </p><p> “Marland,” he said gravely, “think of the</p><p>possibilities of this discovery as applied to </p><p>aviation.” He paused to let his words take </p><p>effect; then he continued: “Suppose an air- </p><p>plane were equipped with enough of this </p><p>material to make its weight practically noth- </p><p>ing. The wings could be reduced to a size </p><p>sufficient to direct its flight upward or down- </p><p>ward, such as the ailerons at present em- </p><p>ployed. The air resistance would be cut </p><p>down enormously and the motive power </p><p>could be increased almost indefinitely, since </p><p>the weight of the engine would cut no fig- </p><p>ure. Think of the great air liners it will be </p><p>possible to build! Ships carrying thou- </p><p>sands of passengers, tons of freight, around </p><p>the world—anywhere!” </p><p> It was a glowing picture he painted. Car-</p><p>ried away by his own thoughts, he enlarged </p><p>on the idea. </p><p> “A plane could rise high into the thin at-</p><p>mosphere many mi^es above the earth, and </p><p>there attain such a speed as would carry it </p><p>across the Pacific in a few hours!” </p><p> These words brought forward again the</p><p>idea which had lingered in my mind since </p><p>our previous talk. </p><p> “What's to prevent such a plane heading</p><p>straight up and flying off through space to </p><p>the moon?” I asked. Wiley’s face became </p><p>grave, and he considered for some time be- </p><p>fore answering. </p><p> “Nothing,” he said at length. “I could</p><p>depend on you to think of that again,” with </p><p>a smile. “But there are a few practical </p><p>objections to the idea. Suppose you did </p><p>head straight up and leave the earth; how </p><p>638 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>would you steer so that you would land on </p><p>the moon?” </p><p> “A matter of starting in the right direc-</p><p>tion,” I replied. “After leaving the atmos- </p><p>phere the plane would continue in a straight </p><p>line until stopped by some other force.*' </p><p>“Such as collision with the surface of the </p><p>moon?” asked Wiley. </p><p> “Exactly,” I replied, “though the contact</p><p>should not be violent enough to cause a </p><p>wreck.” </p><p> “And to avoid a wreck you must either</p><p>slow down before landing or start at a </p><p>low enough speed so that a direct collision </p><p>would not injure the plane. I am not an </p><p>astronomer, but I do know that the moon’s </p><p>atmosphere, if any, is so thin as to go un- </p><p>detected by any means known yet. Too thin </p><p>to slow down in, at any rate. If you adopt </p><p>the other alternative—start at a speed of, </p><p>say, five miles an hour—how long would it </p><p>take you to make the journey?” </p><p> “About 43,000 hours; that is, 2,000 days,</p><p>or roughly five and a half years,” I said, </p><p>calculating mentally. </p><p>4 4 0 ATHER a tedious journey,” com- </p><p>At- mented Wiley. “And when you had </p><p>landed, how would you return, with no at- </p><p>mosphere to start in?” He smiled. “Better </p><p>stick to the earth, Marland, and leave your </p><p>interstellar voyages to the future.” </p><p> “But we haven't exhausted the possibil-</p><p>ities yet,” I protested. “There are other </p><p>means of motive power than a gasoline en- </p><p>gine and screw-propeller. For instance, </p><p>suppose the plane were built like a rocket, </p><p>with discharging explosives to drive it. It </p><p>would be possible to start and stop in a </p><p>vacuum then.”* </p><p> “Perhaps so,” agreed Wiley. “It would</p><p>require a considerable amount of gunpow- </p><p>der to give you much initial velocity, though, </p><p>and the same amount to stop. Then to go </p><p>back you would require still more.” </p><p> “Only half as much as you think,” I re-</p><p>plied. “To start off, it would only be </p><p>•Newton’s third law of motion states: "To </p><p>every action there is an equal and contrary </p><p>reaction, or the two actions are equal and </p><p>opposite.” The small mass and great velocity </p><p>of the discharged explosive are equal to the </p><p>larger mass and smaller velocity of the rocket. </p><p>necessary to interpose the gravity-screen be- </p><p>tween the earth and yourself; the centrifugal </p><p>force of the earth’s rotation would do the </p><p>rest.

Returning with the same velocity </p><p>you need only turn the gravity screen tow- </p><p>ard the earth, and the atmosphere would </p><p>soon stop you. The discharge would be </p><p>necessary only on the moon.” </p><p> “Right again,” said Wiley. “You know,</p><p>Marland, you’re beginning to convince me </p><p>of the practicability of this idea of yours. </p><p>The other factors are not insurmountable, </p><p>light, heat, air, and food. They’ve been </p><p>worked out by submarine builders.” He </p><p>arose and paced the floor nervously, then </p><p>faced me. </p><p> ’“Do you really mean you’d care to try</p><p>try it?” he demanded. </p><p> “Wiley,” I said, “there’d be no better</p><p>man for the job. I’ve been a failure so </p><p>far. I’ve nobody to care what becomes of </p><p>me if I shouldn’t come back, and it would </p><p>be a great help to science if I succeed. I’ll </p><p>start the instant you give your consent.” </p><p>He shook his head doubtfully. </p><p> “I couldn't let the credit go to someone</p><p>outside the College,” he said. My hopes </p><p>fell as he continued, “After all I made </p><p>the trip possible, and I ought to take charge </p><p>of it." He regarded me quizzically. “But </p><p>FI I need an assistant who knows astronomy. </p><p>I can make a job for you in the Physics </p><p>Department; Cosmic Research, shall we </p><p>call it? You'd have to teach a couple of </p><p>classes. What do you say?” </p><p> “Accepted!” I exclaimed. “I could ask</p><p>nothing better. When do we start?” </p><p> “We start, if ever, when I have convinced</p><p>the Trustees of the College of the advisab- </p><p>ility of financing us,” was the reply. “We </p><p>can’t build our machine on knowledge and </p><p>hopes. But your first duties will be to</p><p>make complete specifications for the mach- </p><p>ine and a map of our course. I haven’t </p><p>the time, and your knowledge of Astrono- </p><p>my is much better than mine. I’ll leave </p><p>it to you.” </p><p> Wiley had put it up to me squarely to</p><p>get the plan into presentable form, and I </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>639 </p><p>resolved to do my utmost. The first prob- </p><p>lem was to determine the course we must </p><p>take in order to reach the moon. To the </p><p>layman it might appear to be a simple mat- </p><p>ter of waiting until our satellite was di- </p><p>rectly overhead and starting off, leaving </p><p>fhe rest to gravitation. But such a course </p><p>would probably have ended in our being </p><p>1 educed to gaseous elements in the sun, </p><p>or freezing and starvation as we drifted </p><p>lurlher and further away from the solar </p><p>system. </p><p> The centrifugal force which would set us</p><p>lree would send us in a direction tangent </p><p>to the earth’s surface. To an observer be- </p><p>neath us at the moment of our departure </p><p>we would appear to rise nearly vertically </p><p>for a time, drifting more and more to the </p><p>west; and if he were to follow us with a </p><p>telescope we would disappear below the </p><p>western horizon, or “set”, as does the sun. </p><p>Twenty-four hours after our departure he </p><p>would find us almost due east of himself, </p><p>several thousand miles away. </p><p> Supposing that we started from our own</p><p>latitudes, our initial velocity would be ap- </p><p>proximately seven hundred miles per hour. </p><p>Our course would be bent slightly upwards </p><p>—that is, away from the earth’s surface— </p><p>by the buoyant force of the atmosphere on </p><p>our weightless car, but once#free of the air </p><p>our course would be a straight line. My </p><p>problem, then, was to determine our ulti- </p><p>mate direction, and time our departure so </p><p>that we would meet the moon at whatever </p><p>point on its orbit we might choose. The </p><p>journey would require a little over four- </p><p>teen days. </p><p>Patient Plans </p><p>I NEXT turned my mind to the design of </p><p>the car in which we would travel. The </p><p>first consideration was its shape. The gra- </p><p>\itv screen was difficult and expensive to </p><p>make, so that the smallest surface possible </p><p>desirable. This of course suggested </p><p>a &gt;&gt;'here with its surface covered by the </p><p>gra* it *-opaque substance. It was necessary </p><p>t remove the screen at times, in order to </p><p>land; heoce the screen was to be divided in- </p><p>to hemispheres, one of which could be slip-</p><p>ped above the other. </p><p> A second requisite was that the hull of</p><p>the car must be strong enough to withstand </p><p>the shock of the innumerable tiny meteor- </p><p>ites which fall with great velocity near the </p><p>earth, and are destroyed by the atmosphere, </p><p>but which would strike our craft when free </p><p>of the protecting air. High-grade armor </p><p>steel seemed suitable. </p><p> Next, we must have a means of swinging</p><p>the moving half of the gravity screen from </p><p>beneath us, such as an electric motor; and </p><p>we must have light and heat. Storage bat- </p><p>teries seemed desirable as a source of ener- </p><p>gy, as their weight was no objection. Then </p><p>there must be a means of keeping the air </p><p>in the car breathable. This could be ac- </p><p>complished by driving the stale air through </p><p>limewater, and heating potassium chlorate </p><p>to liberate its oxygen from combination. </p><p> Then there must be the means of stop-</p><p>ping. By storing hydrogen and oxygen at </p><p>high pressure and burning them in the right </p><p>proportions, steam under tremendous pres- </p><p>sure would be generated; and this, directed </p><p>as desired by nozzles, would stop the car </p><p>by the recoil of its departure. I deter- </p><p>mined on hydrogen and oxygen as an ex- </p><p>plosive mixture because of the convenience </p><p>of storing large quantities and ihe rela- </p><p>tively great energy of their combustion. </p><p>Last of all there was the matter of storing </p><p>sufficient food and water to last us during </p><p>the trip. In addition to the four weeks in </p><p>making the journey, we would spend some </p><p>time in exploring the surface of the moon, </p><p>and the return. </p><p> I had entered on my duties as assistant</p><p>instructor, which consisted of taking charge </p><p>of a few laboratory and recitation classes </p><p>each week. The remainder of my time was </p><p>spent in the physics laboratories, sur- </p><p>rounded by drawing instruments, reference </p><p>books, and reams of paper with calculations, </p><p>drawing up plans and specifications, map- </p><p>ping our course and compiling data to pre- </p><p>sent to the Board of Trustees. During sev- </p><p>eral weeks I scarcely ate or slept, and when </p><p>at length the task was finished, I showed </p><p>the results of my work to Wiley with con- </p><p>siderable satisfaction. </p><p>640 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p> In their final form, the plans called for</p><p>a steel shell twenty-five feel in diameter, </p><p>which was to be lined with asbestos. In- </p><p>side this was to be a second shell, with the </p><p>space between the two allotted to the stor- </p><p>age of the hydrogen and oxygen. The in- </p><p>ner shell was also to be lined with asbes- </p><p>tos, and have fastened to it I he storage </p><p>batteries and tanks of water, compressed </p><p>air and purifying chemicals. Next, inside </p><p>these, w'ere to be cupboards fur storing </p><p>food and such equipment as we took along. </p><p> All this occupied a considerable portion</p><p>of the interior of the shell, leaving us but </p><p>a small space in which to live, but with the </p><p>idea of economy I had purposely made the </p><p>machine as small as possible. I had in- </p><p>cluded in my plans a sort of “diving ap- </p><p>paratus” with which to leave the car through </p><p>an air-lock which provided the only means </p><p>of entrance and exit. In the outer door of </p><p>the air-lock was the one glass window, or </p><p>port-hole, I had allowed. More than this </p><p>1 had not deemed advisable because of the </p><p>possibility of their being broken by met- </p><p>eorites. It could be covered with a steel </p><p>cap and need be exposed only for the time </p><p>necessary to make observations. The inner </p><p>door of the air-lock could be left open </p><p>when the port-hole was in use. </p><p> Wiley went over my drawings carefully,</p><p>reading the specifications and estimates. </p><p> “You certainly seem to have considered</p><p>everything,” he remarked. “I see you're </p><p>quite an astronomer; your explanation of </p><p>our course would be clear to anyone. </p><p>These data will help me to put the proposi- </p><p>tion up to the Trustees in a convincing </p><p>manner.” He put the sheaf of papers and </p><p>drawings in his desk, adding: “From now </p><p>on it’s up to me to put it across. I’ve been </p><p>talking to the head of the Physics Depart- </p><p>ment, Dr. Willson, and he’ll back us. </p><p>Heftner can’t see it at all, but you know </p><p>how these old-time astronomers are. He </p><p>predicts that we'll land on the sun, if we </p><p>ever leave the earth, and he’s refused lo give </p><p>us any help in the matter. But we don’t </p><p>need him, as Radner has agreed to check </p><p>your calculations, if necessary, and give us </p><p>any information we want regarding the posi- </p><p>tion of the planets.”</p><p> “They’re allowed for,” I replied, “though</p><p>I'd be glad to have him go over my fig- </p><p>ures. But do you think it’s a good idea </p><p>to talk about this plan to so many people? </p><p>Don’t you think it would be better to keep </p><p>it a secret, at least until we’re reasonably </p><p>sure of success?” </p><p> “I haven’t mentioned it to anyone outside</p><p>the faculty,” replied Wiley, “and I meant </p><p>to caution you not to. By all means we </p><p>must keep it dark. Too many men have </p><p>become the laughing stock of the world </p><p>over their fruitless attempts to plan to do </p><p>what we plan, and publicity would only </p><p>bring ridicule.” </p><p> During the ensuing days I waited with</p><p>considerable impatience for the meeting of </p><p>the Board of Trustees. I devised, in my </p><p>mind, a thousand plans for financing our </p><p>trip independently should the Board turn </p><p>us down, mentally resorting even to specu- </p><p>lation in the stock market and bank rob- </p><p>bery; but the more I thought on the matter, </p><p>the more obvious was the conclusion that </p><p>we must be backed by the College or not at </p><p>all. You may imagine with what eagerness </p><p>I waited for news from Wiley when, on the </p><p>second of April, he went before the Board </p><p>of Trustees with our plan. During my </p><p>morning quiz I found my thoughts miles </p><p>away from the classroom, and twice caught </p><p>myself marking “A” opposite the name of </p><p>a student who reported himself unprepared. </p><p>At length I dismissed the class early, and </p><p>waited in the office of the Physics Depart- </p><p>ment for a phone call from Wiley. </p><p> It was an hour before the bell rang; but</p><p>even as Wiley spoke my name, I knew the </p><p>outcome. </p><p> “Marland, we u in! ' And he banged up</p><p>the receiver. </p><p> CHAPTER III.</p><p> First Flights</p><p>OF THE bustle and feverish activity of </p><p>the next few weeks I remember few </p><p>details. Wiley and I spent most of our time </p><p>in the laboratory making the gravity screen, </p><p>as we would not trust the precious formula </p><p>to anyone else. The contract for the outer </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>641 </p><p>steel was let; and arriving in due time it </p><p>was subjected to every test the Physics De- </p><p>partment could devise. Occasionally Wiley </p><p>or 1 took time to supervise some detail of </p><p>the installation of tanks, batteries and such </p><p>equipment. There were many delays. A </p><p>whole shipment of plates for the batteries </p><p>was defective and had to be replaced; the </p><p>cement which we had ordered to fasten to- </p><p>gether the plates of the gravity-screen was </p><p>lost in transit; and the plate glass port-hole </p><p>had to be trimmed down to fit the frame. </p><p>An unforeseen difficulty, due to our lack of </p><p>knowledge of diving apparatus, arose when </p><p>we tested out the special suits in a vacuum </p><p>chamber. They enabled us to breathe as </p><p>we had expected; but the pressure of nearly </p><p>fifteen pounds per square inch stiffened </p><p>out the fabric so that we could not move, </p><p>the difficulty being solved by placing metal </p><p>joints at the shotrlders, hips, elbows and </p><p>knees. </p><p> The school year was over, and it was</p><p>early summer, before the car was complete- </p><p>ly assembled. Neither Wiley nor 1 taught </p><p>any classes in the summer school, so our en- </p><p>tire time was devoted to the examining and </p><p>testing of the car. I was impatient to be- </p><p>gin our trip at once, but Wiley more pru- </p><p>dently planned to make a series of test </p><p>trips, cruising above the atmosphere for </p><p>awhile in order to determine the behavior </p><p>of the ship while actually free in space, </p><p>and to make observations on the number </p><p>and size of meteorites encountered. </p><p> Our first trial trip nearly resulted in dis-</p><p>aster. The car had been carried to a field </p><p>outside of town, and after a final inspection </p><p>we entered, closed the air-lock and put the </p><p>gravity screen in position. The sensations </p><p>were exactly opposite to what one might ex- </p><p>pect after having ridden in high-speed ele- </p><p>vators, for with the force of gravity sud- </p><p>denly cut off from beneath us we felt as </p><p>though we were dropping rapidly an im- </p><p>mense distance, there, being only the slight </p><p>acceleration caused by the buoyancy of the </p><p>car to hold us to the floor. </p><p> We promptly opened the port-hole and</p><p>found ourselves already some distance above </p><p>the ground (as we could tell only by the </p><p>proximity of the clouds, since our view be-</p><p>low was cut off). We quickly passed </p><p>through these, and by the blackening of the </p><p>sky above us we realized that the air was </p><p>becoming extremely thin. Soon some of </p><p>the brighter stars were visible. Almost ov- </p><p>erhead I recognized Capella, the twinkling </p><p>diamond of our winter nights, and well to </p><p>the east, nearly lost in the sun's glare, was </p><p>Mercury, the most elusive of the planets, </p><p>whom many die without seeing. </p><p> As the diffusion of light by the air grew</p><p>less and less the sky was soon studded with </p><p>stars, and by reference to our watches we </p><p>saw that we were nearing the upper limits </p><p>of the atmosphere. Presently we began to </p><p>hear occasional light taps on the shell of </p><p>the car—falling meteorites of minute di- </p><p>mensions which had not yet penetrated the </p><p>protecting blanket of air far enough to be </p><p>burned by the heat of their passage. We </p><p>closed the cover of the port-hole for safety </p><p>and listened to the slowly increasing patter </p><p>of these wandering particles of metal and </p><p>volcanic rock. Occasionally one, louder </p><p>than the rest, denoted our collision with a </p><p>stone of appreciable dimensions, and once </p><p>a loud crack and noticeable jolt accompan- </p><p>ied the fall of a fair-sized meteorite. </p><p> At length Wiley decided that we need go</p><p>no further from the earth, and reached for </p><p>the switch which rotated the moving half </p><p>of the gravity-screen from its position be- </p><p>neath us. Hardly had he made the con- </p><p>tact, however, when the car lurched violent- </p><p>ly to one side and capsized, throwing us </p><p>into a heap with all the movable objects in </p><p>the car in one corner. </p><p> For a moment I thought we had been</p><p>struck by a large meteor, but presently I </p><p>realized what had happened. Imagine that </p><p>you have a ball balanced on one finger. If </p><p>you move your finger to one side, the ball </p><p>promptly tips to the other side and falls off. </p><p>That was what had happened to us. The </p><p>lower half of our spherical screen had been </p><p>moved, and the moment the force of gravity </p><p>took hold of the edge of the car, it drew </p><p>that side down sharply, upsetting the car </p><p>and turning everything in it upside down. </p><p>We were diving headfirst toward the earth. </p><p> I scarcely had time to be grateful that</p><p>there were some fifty miles between us andl </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>the ground when a new danger presented </p><p>itself. The interior of the car was becom- </p><p>ing uncomfortably warm, due to the fric- </p><p>tion of the air as we passed through it with </p><p>increas.wg speed. The mental picture of </p><p>ourselves landing on the earth reduced to </p><p>cinders in the midst of a blazing steel met- </p><p>eor galvanized me into action. I reached </p><p>for the switch with the idea of turning the </p><p>gravity screen into position, but the futility </p><p>of that soon became apparent. The shock </p><p>of the upset must have jammed it open. </p><p>Then I remembered the tanks of hydrogen </p><p>and oxygen. Shutting'off the current from </p><p>the motors which controlled the gravity </p><p>screen, I reached for the valves, turned the </p><p>gas into the nozzles beneath us and shot am </p><p>electric spark across them. There was- a </p><p>sharp report, a roar, and I was again pre- </p><p>cipitated to the bottom of the car as the re- </p><p>coil of'the burning gases checked our fall. </p><p> We were saved from destruction by fall-</p><p>ing or by incineration, but there was still </p><p>h difficulty. Where, and on what, would </p><p>we land? I could see only one way to ans- </p><p>wer this question. After we had dropped </p><p>slowly for several miles, I shut off the gas </p><p>and opened the porthole for a look. All </p><p>I could see, however, was a bank of clouds </p><p>brilliantly illuminated by the sun. I must </p><p>wait until we were nearer the ground. Ac- </p><p>cording I again opened the gas valves, </p><p>braced myself and touched the igniting but- </p><p>ton. </p><p>WE fell several miles more, slowly pass- </p><p>ing through rarer layers of the atmos- </p><p>phere, until I estimated we were close </p><p>enough so that I could see where we were. </p><p>Moving as quickly as possible I cut off the </p><p>gas and opened the porthole. By pressing </p><p>my face close to the glass I could see the </p><p>city several miles to the east, with the silver </p><p>thread of the river winding close to it. </p><p>This offered an idea; if I could maneuver </p><p>the car to a position over the water and </p><p>drop into it there would be little danger. </p><p>I closed the porthole and startecL the gas, </p><p>this time from the nozzles to the west as </p><p>well as below me. </p><p> My next observation showed that we were</p><p>nearly over the river and about a mile high. </p><p>I allowed the car to descend slowly until </p><p>it was only a few feet above the water, the# </p><p>shut off the gas entirely. There was a shook </p><p>as we hit the surface of the river; then, </p><p>after all motion had subsided I opened the </p><p>porthole once more, and the darkness out- </p><p>side told me that we were resting on the </p><p>bottom. </p><p> During our headlong descent I had not</p><p>had time for more than a glance at Wiley. </p><p>He had been lying amidst the pile of loose </p><p>objects which had tumbled about the car </p><p>on the way down, quite unconscious. I </p><p>found a large bruise on the back of his </p><p>head, but apparently he was only stunned, </p><p>as his respiration and heart action were </p><p>normal. 1 found some water in one of the </p><p>tanks and bathed .his head. Presently he </p><p>came around and sat up. rather unsteadily. </p><p> “Still alive, at any jrate, he observed</p><p>dryly. “What happened? Did we hit a </p><p>meteor?” </p><p> I explained briefly. He nodded, and</p><p>made a hastly inspection. Apparently sat- </p><p>isfied, he turned to the switchboard again </p><p>with a warning to hang on. By means of </p><p>the gas jets he again capsized the car so that </p><p>the gravity screen was beneath us, and with </p><p>the aid of more gas we burst through the </p><p>surface of the water and into the sunlight </p><p> We effected a safe landing on the field,</p><p>to the surprise of the few mechanics and </p><p>assistants waiting for us, who had witnessed </p><p>our drop into the river; and that night </p><p>found us again in the laboratories of the </p><p>College, bruised and shaken but still full </p><p>of impatience to undertake the journey. </p><p> Before making any further trips it was</p><p>apparent that we must change the design </p><p>of the gravity screen. The simplest solu- </p><p>tion appeared to be that of making it in the </p><p>form of four quarter-spherical surfaces </p><p>mounted on common bearings, so that they </p><p>might be manipulated to expose any portion </p><p>of the car in any direction. They could </p><p>now be moved apart separately from the </p><p>lowest portion of the car so as to expose </p><p>equal portions on either side of the center </p><p>of gravity. This design possessed the add- </p><p>ed advantage of stable equilibrium, since </p><p>if the car should turn to either sidle, mere </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>643 </p><p>of that side would be covered by the gravity </p><p>screen and tend to rise. </p><p> The new screen was completed and put</p><p>in position on the car. Thereafter on our </p><p>test trips we met no more mishaps from </p><p>this or any other source, nor did we dis- </p><p>cover any injurious effect from drifting for </p><p>hours free of the earth’s gravitation. At </p><p>length we were satisfied that our car would </p><p>make the trip without mishap, and there re- </p><p>mained only to load it and wait for the </p><p>moon to reach its proper position. We had </p><p>decided that the most advantageous time to </p><p>land there.would be at the full. When our </p><p>tests were completed it was nearing the full </p><p>late in August, and since we would require </p><p>two weeks to reach it, we must start at the </p><p>next new phase. During the two weeks that </p><p>remained we busied ourselves in stocking </p><p>the cupboards with every imaginable kind </p><p>of canned and condensed food, reading </p><p>matter, and similar supplies. </p><p> Finally all was in readiness. Toward</p><p>sunset of a clear autumn afternoon Wiley </p><p>and I bade farewell to those few of the </p><p>College faculty who were in town and pro- </p><p>ceeded to the field where the space-travel- </p><p>ing sphere awaited us. Wiley appeared as </p><p>calm as though he were about to take a </p><p>Sunday afternoon drive, but I must confess </p><p>that I felt considerable nervousness. We </p><p>had regulated our chronometer to a frac- </p><p>tion of a second, and as the orange disc of </p><p>the setting sun touched the horizon we en- </p><p>tered the car and bolted the air-lock fast. </p><p>Wiley took his position by .the switchboard, </p><p>while I kept watch on the chronometer. </p><p>At seventeen minutes, thirty-two seconds </p><p>after sunset he closed the switch that sent </p><p>us on our way, with that now familiar sen- </p><p>sation of dropping. </p><p> We kept the port-hole open until we had</p><p>left the atmosphere, in order to verify our </p><p>direction; then, when the slowly-passing </p><p>stars had shown that we were headed for </p><p>the position the moon would take two weeks </p><p>hence, we closed the steel cap over the glass </p><p>and resigned ourselves to hours of reading </p><p>and sleeping punctuated ba occasional </p><p>meals and observations of the stars. We </p><p>agreed that one of us should always remain </p><p>awake, though for what purpose it would</p><p>be hard to say, since there was no navigat- </p><p>ing to be done. </p><p> We had provided ourselves with shoes</p><p>having magnetized steel soles in order that </p><p>we might have some footing, for, being in- </p><p>sulated from the attraction of all the heav- </p><p>enly bodies, there was not even enough </p><p>gravity to hold water in a glass. Because </p><p>of this, an amusing spectacle presented it- </p><p>self when either of us went to sleep. Fol- </p><p>lowing our terrestrial habits, we lay down </p><p>to rest on whatever surface of the car ap- </p><p>pealed to us, but the slightest movement </p><p>was sufficient to send our heads away from </p><p>the wall of the car while our feet, anchored </p><p>by the magnetic shoes, held fast. One was </p><p>apt to find himself4 in any fantastic attitude </p><p>when he awoke. The sight of the wak- </p><p>ing person was even more grotesque, espec- </p><p>ially if he happened to be on the opposite </p><p>side of the car, for then the sleeper appar- </p><p>ently hung head down in peaceful repose. </p><p>We had brought along a camera and a sup- </p><p>ply of films, and I used several of these </p><p>making time-exposures of Wiley in various </p><p>attitudes, none of which, unfortunately, </p><p>turned out well. </p><p>Nearing the Moon </p><p>TEN days dragged by, marked only by </p><p>the hands of the clock, before the first </p><p>event of real interest occurred. We now </p><p>left the port-hole open continuously, since </p><p>the danger from falling meteorites was </p><p>small, due to their lesser velocity at this dis- </p><p>tance from the earth, and while looking </p><p>through it at the stars at Wiley slept, I </p><p>noticed a thin crescent of light on the outer </p><p>edge of the steel frame of the glass—the </p><p>rays of the moon. By a simple triangula- </p><p>tion I computed its position with respect to </p><p>our own, and knowing our respective velo- </p><p>cities, verified my expectation that we </p><p>would cross its orbit as it reached the full </p><p>phase. </p><p> From then on, Wiley and 1 watched the</p><p>progress of the reflected rays down the </p><p>fiame of the glass until, by pressing our </p><p>faces close to the opening, we could see </p><p>the edge of the sunlit surface. It resembled </p><p>the moon-rise on a dusty evening, its color </p><p>644 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>being a dirty ©range, and tbe disc was </p><p>much larger than as seen from the earth. </p><p>It was already near the full, but since we </p><p>saw it from a different angle than terres- </p><p>trial observers, only a little over half the </p><p>surface visible to us was lighted by the </p><p>sun. The mountain ranges near the ter- </p><p>minator (the dividing line between sunlight </p><p>and darkness) were plainly visible, as they </p><p>are seen from the earth through a small </p><p>field glass, and by employing the powerful </p><p>binoculars we had brought we reduced its </p><p>apparent distance to about thirteen hundred </p><p>miles. </p><p> Because of the small size of the glass</p><p>port-hole we were forced to take turns ob- </p><p>serving it, and while Wiley was using the </p><p>binoculars I checked our position. We </p><p>were about forty thousand miles from the </p><p>moon and had completed five-sixths of our </p><p>journey. At this point the attraction of the </p><p>moon would overcome that of the earth, </p><p>and we would fall toward it unless we </p><p>turned the gravity-screen to that side of the </p><p>car. This would of course cut off our view </p><p>of the moon, except for an occasional neces- </p><p>sary glimpse while landing, when the screen </p><p>would have to be opened for a moment. </p><p> I was about to call Wiley’s attention to</p><p>•this when he uttered an exclamation. </p><p> “Marland, come have a look.” he called.</p><p>I hurried to the glass and he moved aside, </p><p>handing me the binoculars. I examined </p><p>the visible portion of the moon’s surface but </p><p>could see nothing out of the ordinary. I </p><p>was about to say as much, when he directed : </p><p>“Look on the dark side, near the south </p><p>pole.” </p><p> I turned my glasses* toward the lower por-</p><p>tion of the globe. There, perhaps a sixth </p><p>of the distance from the equator to the pole </p><p>and almost on the terminator was a tiny </p><p>speok of light, barely distinguishable even </p><p>to my excellent eyes, and all but lost in the </p><p>glare of the sunlight on nearby mountain </p><p>peaks. At first I though it might be an il- </p><p>lusion in the glass, but I was struck by the </p><p>•The glasses were of course erecting glasses, </p><p>differing in, this respect from astronomical tele- </p><p>scopes through which inverted photographs of</p><p>the moon are made, giving the Impression that </p><p>the moon is “upside down," with the south </p><p>pole at the top of the'picture. </p><p>peculiar color of the light—blue, or blue- </p><p>green, with perhaps a slight yellow tinge; </p><p>but entirely out of keeping with the sur- </p><p>roundings. Even as I looked more closely, </p><p>it faded into the line of sunlight and was </p><p>invisible. </p><p> “Did you see it?” asked Wiley.</p><p> “I did,” I replied, “but it’s gone.”</p><p> “Gone out!” he exclaimed.</p><p> “No,” I returned, “it crossed the termin-</p><p>ator and was lost in the sunlight.” </p><p> “Impossible!” exclaimed Wiley. “How</p><p>could it have crossed the terminator? It </p><p>was miles away when I saw it. Besides, </p><p>how could a volcano move?” </p><p> “Volcano!” I exclaimed. “Do you</p><p>think it was that?” </p><p> “What else could it be?” he demanded.</p><p>“Then why wasn’t it seen before this from </p><p>the earth?” I asked. </p><p> “Plenty of reasons,” he returned. “In</p><p>the first place it was so faint as to be al- </p><p>most invisible, although we have no atmos- </p><p>phere between it and ourselves. The dis- </p><p>tortion produced by the earth’s atmosphere </p><p>would make it invisible. If not, it might </p><p>easily be hidden by a range of mountains; </p><p>you forget that we see the moon from a dif- </p><p>ferent angle now. And finally, it may not </p><p>have existed before now!” </p><p> He seized the glasses and went to the port-</p><p>hole for another look, but after several min- </p><p>utes of close scrutiny he gave up, unable to </p><p>locate the light again. </p><p> I suddenly recalled that it was high time</p><p>that the gravity screen were closed, and </p><p>raeutioned it to Wiley. He gave up his </p><p>position reluctantly, and I closed the. steel </p><p>cap over the porthole and set in motion the </p><p>motors to shift the screen. Wiley returned </p><p>the binoculars to their case 011 the wall and </p><p>remarked, musing: </p><p> “What do you suppose could cause a</p><p>volcano to stop erupting like that?” </p><p> “Probably it's still going, but you can’t</p><p>see it because of the sunlight,” I suggested. </p><p> “No,” he objected, “it was too far from</p><p>athe terminator when I saw it. The sunrise </p><p>doesn’t move that fast.' </p><p> “It might have been on a gentle slope,”</p><p>I said. “The sunlight would travel down </p><p>the slope pretty rapidly.” </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>645 </p><p>FOR answer Wiley went to one of the </p><p>shelves in which were stored, among </p><p>other things, a number of maps of the </p><p>moon’s surface, together ‘'with a number of </p><p>photographs. From these he extracted a </p><p>view of the section we had just been dis- </p><p>cussing which, though seen from a different </p><p>angle, was still fairly recognizable. We </p><p>examined the map closely for some such </p><p>formation as I had suggested but failed to </p><p>find any which might meet the conditions. </p><p>Then we tried to recall the location of the </p><p>point as we had seen it. </p><p> Wiley indicated by a dot the place where</p><p>he had last seen it, and I indicated where </p><p>it had crossed the terminator. We looked </p><p>at each other in considerable amazement, </p><p>for not only did our estimates as to the dis- </p><p>tance from the edge of the shadovT differ, </p><p>but my point was considerably further </p><p>north than his! Nor could we reconcile our </p><p>views. By reference to surrounding land- </p><p>marks it was possible to set limits to our </p><p>possible errors in observation, and we en- </p><p>closed each of our points in a circle which </p><p>made the maximum possible allowance for </p><p>such errors. Yet our two circles were a </p><p>quarter of an inch apart at their nearest </p><p>point! Wiley insisted that the light had </p><p>been well clear of the terminator, while I </p><p>was equally certain that it had crossed the </p><p>terminator. </p><p> Allowing for the motion of the sunlight</p><p>itself while we had changed places—which </p><p>was, in fact, almost negligible, since the ter- </p><p>minator travels on the moon at about nine </p><p>miles per hour—we had still a difference </p><p>ei some fifty miles in our points. There </p><p>was only one inference; the light had </p><p>Moved! </p><p> A further examination of the scant data</p><p>we had on the subject showed even more </p><p>•tArtling results. At the very least, the </p><p>•earce of the light had moved fifty miles </p><p>ia five minutes or less—from the time Wiley </p><p>i*d first called my attention to it until the </p><p>tine I had located it just as it crossed the </p><p>brder of the shadow. In other words, it </p><p>Ml have been traveling at a rate of six </p><p>ba»dred miles an hour! </p><p> In ike face of such figures we were both</p><p>iac lined to question our minds as to the cer- </p><p>tainty of the position of the light. But the </p><p>facts remained unquestionable. Wiley had </p><p>seen it well in the shadow and I had seen </p><p>it pass into the light. It had moved, and </p><p>it seemed likely that its motion had been </p><p>very rapid. </p><p> The subject of this mysterious traveling</p><p>point of light occupied our minds for the </p><p>greater part of the remaining journey. We </p><p>pored over maps and photographs of the </p><p>moon’s surface, speculated on the nature </p><p>of such a high-speed body, and thought erf </p><p>every possibility—so it seemed to us—even </p><p>going so far as to raise the question of </p><p>intelligent inhabitants, living perhaps on </p><p>the interior of the satellite, or even a form </p><p>of life which was not dependent on air for </p><p>existence. </p><p> The thought intrigued us, yet I must con-</p><p>fess that my interest was not unnaixed with </p><p>apprehension. A people sufficiently intel- </p><p>ligent to maintain their existence in spite of </p><p>the evident lack of air or water on the sur- </p><p>face of the moon must necessarily be far </p><p>in advance of the human race in mental de- </p><p>velopment. We should probably be looked </p><p>on much as are the rats which invade our </p><p>homes in their own selfish interest, just as </p><p>we were at present bent on invading the </p><p>moon. The prospect had, at least, its ques- </p><p>tionable angles. </p><p> Wiley, too, was*evidently thinking deep-</p><p>ly on the matter. He had put away the </p><p>maps and photographs and was sitting (in- </p><p>sofar as it is possible to sit without the aid </p><p>of gravitation) on the opposite side of the </p><p>car, his hands clasped around his knees, his </p><p>toes stuck under a projecting valve to an- </p><p>chor himself, gazing into nothingness. Pre- </p><p>sently he spoke, as if addressing himself to </p><p>his thoughts rather than to me. </p><p> “Let’s see what we've got,” he said.</p><p>“First, I saw a light. Then you saw the </p><p>same light cross the terminator. We have </p><p>only estimates of the distance it moved, but </p><p>we agree that it was too far for the sun- </p><p>light to travel so as to cover a stationary </p><p>point. The best estimate gives it a velocity </p><p>of six hundred miles an hour. Suppose </p><p>we’re wrong by half that; it still moves </p><p>faster than anything on earth except bullets</p><p>and some airplanes. -The question is, what </p><p>646 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>was it? A machine driven by some living </p><p>being? What sort of being could live on </p><p>the moon? There is no air—no water. </p><p>Even supposing a creature with a super-in- </p><p>telligence, such that could manage to remain </p><p>there now, how did it develop? The moon </p><p>must have lost its atmosphere and water </p><p>long before the surface solidified. It can </p><p>never have been a habitable globe like the </p><p>earth. Then either the creature, supposing </p><p>there is one, has a body radically different </p><p>from our own, or else he is an immigrant </p><p>from some other planet. But if the for- </p><p>mer, why has he never come to the earth? </p><p>And if the latter, why go to the moon at </p><p>all?” </p><p> He sat huddled, motionless, his eyes half</p><p>closed, and presently he appeared to have </p><p>fallen asleep. I got out paper and pencil </p><p>and was about to re-compute our position, </p><p>as I was constantly doing in order to dis- </p><p>cover any deviation from,- our intended </p><p>course, when he uttered an exclamation. </p><p> “Of course!” he cried. “Nothing sim-</p><p>pler! Mar land, what a pair of idiots we </p><p>are! Super-beings—life without air— </p><p>tommyrot!” </p><p> I wondered what was the cause of this</p><p>outburst, but was quickly enlightened. </p><p> “We have been fortunate enough to find</p><p>a new member of the solar system,” he said </p><p>smiling. “What we saw, Marland, was </p><p>probably a sub-satellite—the moon’s moon. </p><p>A little globe revolving around it at a dis- </p><p>tance of a few thousand miles—probably </p><p>not far from where we are; hence the ap- </p><p>parent rapid motion. It passed between </p><p>us and the dark part of the moon, then across </p><p>to the bright side and was outshone by the </p><p>reflected light of the moon. Too dim to </p><p>have been detected from the earth because </p><p>of the atmospheric refraction.” </p><p> This simple and logical explanation of</p><p>the phenomenon presented such an easy </p><p>solution to the problem that we were both </p><p>surprised we had not thought of it before. </p><p>Wiley and I were both anxious to take a </p><p>further observation in order to determine </p><p>the size and behavior of this lunar satellite, </p><p>but this was out of the question at present.</p><p>Indeed, it was quite a problem to get </p><p>enough data to check our position, as wo </p><p>had to do frequently, without unduly ex- </p><p>posing •urseives to the attraction of the </p><p>moon. </p><p> CHAPTER IV.</p><p> Journey’s End!</p><p>AS THE hours passed, we drew closer </p><p>and closer to the end of our journey. </p><p>We remained awake constantly now, and </p><p>nearly all of our time was spent in calcu- </p><p>lating the exact moment and spot of our ar- </p><p>rival, from the latest observation. We </p><p>found that we should arrive somewhat to </p><p>the south of the equator, on the “sunrise” </p><p>side—that is, the portion on which the sun </p><p>had been shining for less than half of the </p><p>two-w^eks-long day. This section of the </p><p>moon’s surface was more thickly covered </p><p>with mountains than some, but there were </p><p>a reasonable number of level spaces, and </p><p>it was in this quarter that some of the most </p><p>interesting features of the globe were to be </p><p>found, such as the giant craters Tycho and </p><p>Copernicus with their radiating streaks. </p><p> At length there remained only a thousand</p><p>miles or so between us and the moon. At </p><p>our present rate we should reach it in some- </p><p>what more than an hour. We spent the re- </p><p>maining time in arranging the loose articles </p><p>in the car, such as dishes, bottles, reading </p><p>matter, and similar debris, so that they </p><p>would not pile up on the downward side of </p><p>the car when we landed and opened the </p><p>gravity screen. </p><p> The amount of junk which we had</p><p>amassed was tremendous: we had not both- </p><p>ered more than once or twice to make use </p><p>of the air-lock to throw out our trash, and </p><p>there were empty meat-cans, bottles and </p><p>such stuff which were of no use to us what- </p><p>soever. Wiley suggested that we pile them </p><p>into the air-lock so that they would be out </p><p>of the way and could be thrown out as soon </p><p>as we landed. We began this at once, but </p><p>the action immediately called our attention </p><p>to another fact; the air-lock was turned </p><p>toward the moon, and was covered by the </p><p>gravity-screen, since we had been looking </p><p>through its glass port-hole. It would be </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>647 </p><p>down when we landed, and would make it </p><p>unpossible to leave the car. This gave us </p><p>a moment’s worry, until we recalled our </p><p>former startling success in turning the car </p><p>upside down during our first trial trip. </p><p>Accordingly we took our final observation </p><p>of position when we were but a few miles </p><p>from the surface, over one of the great </p><p>plains, termed “&amp;as” by the early observers </p><p>because of their darker color. </p><p> This one was known as “Mare Nubium”</p><p>Ithe sea of clouds), and we were approach- </p><p>ing the center of it. We quickly calculated </p><p>our velocity from two observations a few </p><p>minutes apart, then closed the port-hole for </p><p>the last time until landing and turned the </p><p>gravity-screen until the car rotated through </p><p>180 degrees under the influence of gravity; </p><p>then closed it entirely, shutting ourselves </p><p>off once more from all attraction. Then </p><p>we opened the valve controlling the flow of </p><p>gas into the jets pointed toward the moon </p><p>and touched the electric spark. </p><p> Having become accustomed during our</p><p>two weeks’ journey to move about the car </p><p>as we pleased \yith no regard to the relative </p><p>directions of “fop and down”, we- had neg- </p><p>lected to hold on while doing this, and we </p><p>found ourselves in rather laughable circum- </p><p>stances as a consequence. However, the ac- </p><p>celeration of the gas was not sufficient to </p><p>throw us very violently to the bottom of the </p><p>car. and the situation was more humorous </p><p>than unpleasant. We had just picked our- </p><p>selves up and endeavored to become accus- </p><p>tomed to the strange sensation of direction </p><p>once more, when there was a moderate jar </p><p>announcing our landing. Wiley jumped to </p><p>&gt;hut off the gas while 1 opened the gravity- </p><p>screen. The jar was repeated, the car hav- </p><p>ing “bounced” a little from the surface, </p><p>but it promptly settled down on an even </p><p>keel, and we were on the moon! </p><p> So far our journey had been carefully</p><p>planned, but now that we had reached our </p><p>objective we were rather at a loss as to our </p><p>next step. “Exploration” had been vague- </p><p>i \ mentioned, but we had outlined no route. </p><p> v.ever, our bodies had been cramped in</p><p>lue snail interior of the car long enough to </p><p>ct- -ire action, so with one accord we un-</p><p>packed our “diving suits” ^tbe term is poor- </p><p>ly applied, but we never gave them any </p><p>other name) and put them on. They were </p><p>unwieldy things, but with the slight gravity </p><p>of the moon we managed them quite well- </p><p> 1 was ready firsl, and released the fast-</p><p>enings of the inner door of the air-lock. </p><p>As 1 lowered this, I was showered by the </p><p>refuse which had been hastily piled into the </p><p>opening and forgotten in the excitement of </p><p>our landing. I took an armload with me, </p><p>leaving Wiley to bring as much as possi- </p><p>ble with him, and climbed into the air-lock. </p><p> The doors to this could be fastened from</p><p>inside or out, so as to remove the necessity </p><p>of an operator inside the car. Once inside </p><p>the lock with the air-tight doors bolted fast, </p><p>a pump exhausted as much of the air as pos- </p><p>sible into the interior of the car, in order </p><p>to conserve our not over-abundant supply </p><p>of the vital gases. I had crowded into the </p><p>small space, fastened the door, and soon </p><p>afterward the swelling of my suit to its in- </p><p>terior pressure told of the pump at work. </p><p>1 waited with as much patience as I could </p><p>muster until the air was thinned out to a </p><p>near-vacuum, and released the catches to </p><p>the outer door. </p><p> A blaze of sunlight such as I had never</p><p>seen before met my eyes. I wore dark </p><p>glasses, but even so the brilliant light re- </p><p>flected from the rocky plain about me was </p><p>almost intolerable. 1 stepped out onto the </p><p>top of the spherical machine, reclosed the </p><p>door, and after kicking the rubbish over the </p><p>edge began to survey the surrounding ter- </p><p>ritory while waiting for Wiley. </p><p>WE were situated approximately in the </p><p>center of a vast plain extending in all </p><p>directions to the horizon, broken here and </p><p>there by low elevations. The smaller and </p><p>closer ones presented an appearance sug- </p><p>gesting the crater formation familiar, to </p><p>those who have seen the moon through a </p><p>telescope, while those in the distance resem- </p><p>bled lines of jagged cliffs, being too remote </p><p>and too high to be seen in their true form. </p><p>The floor of the plain itself resembled a </p><p>mud flat from which the water has receded, </p><p>leaving its surface dried and cracked by the </p><p>sun. Indeed, we soon foun4 out that it was </p><p>much like that, the surface rock being split </p><p>648 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>and checkered by ages of boiling heat fol- </p><p>lowed by cold unknown to the earth. </p><p> The sky was even more remarkable—jet</p><p>black, with thousands of stars blazing with </p><p>a splendor beyond description. The sun </p><p>was dazzling, even more so than on earth; </p><p>by peeping over my arm I could see the cor- </p><p>ona, and a red spot which might be a huge </p><p>prominence. The earth was faintly dis- </p><p>cernible as a pale circle of light close to the </p><p>sun, visible only by the light refracted </p><p>through its atmosphere. </p><p> My observations were interrupted when</p><p>Wiley’s head appeared through the air-lock, </p><p>and after blinking for a moment in the sun- </p><p>light he stepped out beside me. We had </p><p>no method of communication other than ges- </p><p>tures, supplemented by what lip-reading we </p><p>could do through the glass of our helmets, </p><p>but he presently made me understand that </p><p>he wished to descend and explore the plain </p><p>about us. We made our way cautionsly </p><p>along the curving surface of the sphere to </p><p>the ladder which extended up the outside. </p><p>I started to climb awkwardly down, but </p><p>Wiley made a flying leap from the twenty- </p><p>foot height on which we stood. I turned in </p><p>startled amazement, having forgotten the </p><p>slight attraction of the moon, and watched </p><p>him float as if on a parachute, landing with </p><p>perfect ease on the ground. </p><p> I followed his example, but with less</p><p>grace, landing on my hands and knees, but </p><p>with no discomfort. We started off at a </p><p>brisk walk, but our first step lifted us clear </p><p>of the ground and we coasted several feet </p><p>before touching. Our muscles, accustomed </p><p>to earth-travel, instinctively exerted enough </p><p>pressure to bear our normal weight, but </p><p>meeting with little resistence lifted us clear </p><p>off the ground. We experimented a bit and </p><p>found that by leaning slightly forward we </p><p>could travel at a fast trot with practically </p><p>no effort. </p><p> We set off in this manner toward the near-</p><p>est of the little craters. We must have </p><p>resembled a slow-motion picture of a pair </p><p>of sprinters, so leisurely were our move- </p><p>ments. Our feet raised clouds of the fine </p><p>dust which covered everything, but like ev- </p><p>erything else on the moon, this dust be-</p><p>haved in a strange manner. It rose to A </p><p>greater height than on earth; then, instead </p><p>of remaining suspended, large and small </p><p>particles alike fell to the ground, leaving </p><p>not the slightest haze behind us. </p><p> Until now 1 had been so absorbed in the</p><p>new sensations which surrounded me that I </p><p>had not noticed a growing sense of discom- </p><p>fort, but suddenly I realized that it was </p><p>becoming intolerably hot inside my protect- </p><p>ing suit. The temperature increased as I </p><p>went a few steps further, and I realized that </p><p>if I did not find shelter from the sunlight </p><p>soon I would suffocate. I tapped Wiley’s </p><p>arm and started for the shadow of the near- </p><p>est rock. It was some distance away, and I </p><p>realized that I was rapidly losing conscious- </p><p>ness when 1 stumbled headfirst from the </p><p>glare into the blackness of night and fell </p><p>to the ground. </p><p> My exhaustion perhaps saved my life, for</p><p>I had barely gotten into the inky-black </p><p>shadow of the rock, and lay with my face </p><p>only a few inches from its edge. As 1 re- </p><p>covered possession of my faculties I saw </p><p>that the glass of my helmet had become </p><p>coated with frost condensed from my breath. </p><p>The temperature around me was many de- </p><p>grees below zero; the effect of extreme </p><p>changes of heat on glass is well known. </p><p>No doubt the heat reflected from the sun- </p><p>lit ground a few inches away had saved my </p><p>glass from cracking and letting out the air. </p><p> A few moments' cooling sufficed to set</p><p>my teeth chattering, and Wiley and 1 set </p><p>off once more, being careful to stop in a </p><p>shadow once in a while. We reached the </p><p>little crater toward which we had been </p><p>walking, and skipped up its side as easily </p><p>as two mountain goats. It was perhaps one </p><p>hundred feet high, the sides sloping at an </p><p>angle of about sixty degrees. The rim was </p><p>jagged and split by many fissures, while </p><p>pieces of rock had scaled off and slid into </p><p>the interior. From where we stood we had </p><p>a good view of the entire crater. It was </p><p>about five hundred feet in diameter, and the </p><p>floor was studded with tiny replicas of the </p><p>crater itself, a few feet in diameter, while </p><p>in the center was a small cone, rising to * </p><p>height of some thirty feet. </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>649 </p><p>A Puzzling Phenomenon </p><p>AS we stood looking at the crater, an odd </p><p>thought ran through my mind. “Pan- </p><p>cakes,” I said to myself. Pancakes were </p><p>one of my weaknesses, and 1 had had ample </p><p>opportunity to make them during our trip. </p><p>The interior of the crater resembled a vast </p><p>pancake on the griddle. Bubbles of escap- </p><p>ing gas had burst, leaving holes as the sur- </p><p>face stiffened and solidified. Perhaps the </p><p>crater itself was such a bubble left by a </p><p>larger uprush of gas. </p><p> We descended into the crater and exam-</p><p>ined the formations more closely. Every- </p><p>thing seemed to bear out my idea. As the </p><p>surface of the moon had cooled, gas had </p><p>formed in spots under the hardening crust, </p><p>and presently burst through, piling up the </p><p>semi-solid lava in a circle around the erup- </p><p>tion. Later, as the cooling proceeded, the </p><p>crust of the interior of the crater, being </p><p>thinner, was more easily broken; hence the </p><p>many small pit6. All this activity had long </p><p>since ceased, and the dust of ages of ex- </p><p>posure to heat and cold covered everything. </p><p> At length we started back.to the car, for</p><p>despite the ease of travel we found the heat </p><p>quite enervating and the need of rest and </p><p>a meal was pressing. We had been gone </p><p>several hours, and we could not be sure just </p><p>how long the air in our suits would last. </p><p>We hurried along, going from rock to rock, </p><p>resting a few minutes in the shadow of each </p><p>and taking a slightly different route on our </p><p>way back. </p><p> We had covered perhaps half the distance</p><p>to our machine when I felt Wiley touch my </p><p>arm. Looking in the direction he indicated, </p><p>I saw that not far to our right there were evi- </p><p>dences of the all-pervading dust having been </p><p>disturbed. We walked in that direction and </p><p>came to a patch of bare rock some fifty </p><p>yards across. The dust had been swept </p><p>clean, piling up around the edges of the </p><p>bare spot as if a circular windstorm had </p><p>blown it away. But that obviously was not </p><p>the cause of this phenomenon, as we well </p><p>know. What could have caused it? As I </p><p>turned the matter over in my mind, the </p><p>thought of meteorites occurred to me, and </p><p>1 started for the center of the space to look</p><p>for traces of meteoric stone. I examined </p><p>the ground closely, but found nothing what- </p><p>soever except a few scars on the rock itself, </p><p>as if it had been melted by some tremendous </p><p>heat. They seemed fresh, and might possi- </p><p>bly have been caused by the fall of a meteor. </p><p> We continued our journey with no further</p><p>events, and presently were once more within </p><p>the car with a meal cooking on the electric </p><p>stove. Neither of us referred to the events </p><p>of our trip until we had finished eating and </p><p>settled down to enjoy a smoke. Then Wiley </p><p>spoke. </p><p> “What do you make of that bare spot?”</p><p>“Probably the mark of a meteor,” I re- </p><p>plied. “It looks quite recent.” </p><p> “Recent, yes.” He paused. “But why</p><p>haven’t we noticed any more meteors?” </p><p> I thought for a moment before answering:</p><p>“Perhaps the earth gets most of them—its </p><p>superior gravity, you know, and so close. </p><p>They would have to be headed just right to </p><p>get here.” He nodded. </p><p> “But why didn’t we find the meteor it-</p><p>self?” after a moment. </p><p> “It probably hit hard enough to be heated</p><p>to gas,” I answered. </p><p> “It would take considerable speed,” he ob-</p><p>served. “By the way, what velocity would a </p><p>meteor have, landing here?” </p><p> “If you assume it to fall from rest an in-</p><p>finite distance away, it would be going a mile </p><p>and a quarter a second,” I said. </p><p> “The Big Berthas did better than that</p><p>during the war,” he remarked. “Ever hear </p><p>of a shell turning to gas when it hit?” </p><p>“No,” I admitted. “But the meteor might </p><p>have exploded like a shell.” </p><p> “Not likely,” he said, “but it’s possible,</p><p>I grant you. Perhaps our friends at the </p><p>City College are dropping us a note.” With </p><p>which remark he ended the discussion; but </p><p>long after I lay down for a sleep he sat up, </p><p>engrossed in his thoughts. </p><p> I was awakened by the smell of food, and</p><p>found I had a prodigious appetite.</p><p> “About time to get going, old timer,” said</p><p>Wiley. “You’ve slept the clock around and </p><p>then some.” </p><p> We quickly dispatched the meal, donned</p><p>our “diving” outfits, and were soon out on </p><p>the surface of the moon. Despite the pasa- </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p> of more than twelve hours since we had</p><p>last seen it, the son bad moved but little, </p><p>and everything was much the same. This </p><p>time we set out in a different direction to- </p><p>ward another of the small craters. This one </p><p>was more distant and somewhat larger than </p><p>the first, but we made better time in reach- </p><p>ing it and climbing its steep sides, having </p><p>kecome more accustomed to the strange </p><p>mode of travel. We sj&gt;ent a little time ex- </p><p>ploring its interior, which was much the </p><p>same as that of the other crater, and pres- </p><p>ently made for the little cone which so often </p><p>is found in these formation in the center of </p><p>the circular hollow. Its sides were steep, </p><p>and on reaching its summit we found a vent </p><p>extending down inside to an unknown depth. </p><p>The sunlight penetrated a few yards, in </p><p>which the walls narrowed slightly, suggest- </p><p>ing a funnel; beyond this we could see noth- </p><p>ing. </p><p> Wiley motioned me to follow him and-</p><p>started to pick his way cautiously down the </p><p>steep side of the funnel. I followed to the </p><p>edge of the sunlight, and we stood for a </p><p>moment trying to fathom the inky depths. </p><p>Presently our eyes became more accustomed </p><p>to the darkness and we could see the faint </p><p>gleams reflected from footholds just below </p><p>us. We took a few steps downward and were </p><p>surrounded by darkness. </p><p> Suddenly I was startled to see the side of</p><p>the pit opposite me illuminated. 1 looked </p><p>for the source of the light, and discovered </p><p>that Wiley had succeeded in withdrawing his </p><p>arm from its covering into his suit, and had </p><p>taken a flashlight from his pocket and di- </p><p>rected it through the glass of his helmet. He </p><p>turned it into my face, then away, and I </p><p>could see that he was laughing at my sur- </p><p>prised look.* Then he turned the light below </p><p>him and led the way further into the depths. </p><p> We descended for perhaps another hun-</p><p>dred feet, the walls of the funnel narrowing </p><p>until we could brace our feet against one </p><p>side and our backs on the other. We paused, </p><p>and Wiley turned the light downward. The </p><p>shaft continued toward the center of the </p><p>moon, no one could say how far, without </p><p>becoming much narrower. 1 would have </p><p>liked to continue, but it was inadvisable, </p><p>as we had quite a climb back to the surface </p><p>and must consider our air-suppty.</p><p>I looked up. The funnel framed a circu- </p><p>lar patch of sky above us, in which the </p><p>brighter stars blazed with brilliant splendor </p><p>on a jet-black background powdered with </p><p>other stars too small to be distinguished one </p><p>from another. </p><p> It was now some twenty-four hours since</p><p>we had landed, and for the first time I saw </p><p>the surface of our mother earth. Not very </p><p>much, to be sure, only a thin sliver of fight </p><p>was visible, like a huge day-old moon. The </p><p>crescent shone with a brilliance far sur- </p><p>passing everything in the heavens except </p><p>the sun. I wondered what what it would be </p><p>like at the full, when the sun would have </p><p>set on our side of the moon. </p><p> One moment 1 was looking at the silver</p><p>thread of the earth; the next I was blinded </p><p>by a glare of light sweeping across my field </p><p>of vision. The heavens were obscured by a </p><p>broad fan-tail of flame, blue, or blue-green, </p><p>with a tinge of yellow in it. 1 closed my </p><p>eyes for a moment to let the dancing spots </p><p>on my overtaxed retinas fade and looked </p><p>again, but it was gone. In the glimpse I </p><p>had had it seemed to be moving to the south- </p><p>ward. 1 thought I could detect a glow on </p><p>the northern side of the funnel above me, but </p><p>my eyes were still too blinded to be certain. </p><p> I felt Wiley below me pushing me upward</p><p>urgently, and with as much speed as pos- </p><p>sible I scrambled up the side of the pit. It </p><p>required perhaps five minutes to reach the </p><p>top. We faced south with one accord, and </p><p>there, over the rim of the crater, far in the </p><p>distance, could be seen a faint blue-yellow </p><p>glow. It did not strike me as strange at the </p><p>moment, but Wiley pointed out its meaning </p><p>later. </p><p> We had retraced our steps to the car and</p><p>were discussing the appearance of the light. </p><p> “Did you notice the after-glow?” he asked,</p><p>and as I nodded, ‘*Do you realize what that </p><p>means? Gas, Marland. There must have </p><p>been gas. You know that light cannot be </p><p>diffused in a vacuum. The air does it on </p><p>earth, but we have no air here. There must </p><p>have been a body of gas attached to that </p><p>light, or the light gave off gas, which glow- </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>651 </p><p>ed. Now what could be liberating glowing </p><p>gas so near the moon?” </p><p> We sat silent for many minutes. Finally</p><p>Wiley answered his own question, in part. </p><p> ‘Tt may have been a small comet,” he</p><p>suggested, and made haste to bury himself </p><p>in a book. Obviously he did not wish me to </p><p>point out that the comet, if comet it were, </p><p>had passed between the earth and the moon, </p><p>and with a velocity heretofore unheard of. </p><p> f must have fallen asleep, for presently</p><p>I had a sensation of motion, and awoke to </p><p>find Wiley manipulating the controls. He </p><p>answered my questioning look with a sin- </p><p>gle phrase: “Heading south.” Further ex- </p><p>planation was unnecessary. I knew he had </p><p>closed the gravity screen and given the car </p><p>a start to the southward; we were drifting </p><p>under our momentum in the direction of the </p><p>light which we had seen, once before land- </p><p>ing and later over the nearby crater, cruis- </p><p>ing about the southern section of the moon’s </p><p>surface. </p><p>CHAPTER V. </p><p>An Awesome Sight! </p><p>WILEY had inverted the car so as to take </p><p>an occasional look at the moon </p><p>through the port-hole. I left the running of </p><p>it to him and caught up my notes on the two </p><p>trips we had made. We traveled for eighteen </p><p>hours in this manner. There was no way of </p><p>telling our exact speed, but Wiley estimated </p><p>it in the neighborhood of a hundred miles </p><p>an hour. This increased from time to time </p><p>slightly, due to our changing course to meet </p><p>the curvature of the moon. If we had con- </p><p>tinued on our original course we would </p><p>have left the surface on a tangent and contin- </p><p>ued in a straight line, but our views below </p><p>served the double purpose of giving us our </p><p>bearings and allowing us to fall toward </p><p>the surface enough to maintain an altitude </p><p>of three to five miles. The velocity of our </p><p>fall was in part added to our speed of travel. </p><p> Thus we arrived over the moon’s south</p><p>pole, which could be located from the ap- </p><p>pearance of the terminator beneath us, be- </p><p>\ ond which the sunlight did not reach. Here </p><p>Wiley brought the car to a stop and de-</p><p>scended gently to the interior of a fair-sized </p><p>crater. It was his purpose, lie said, to re- </p><p>main there for half a month, when the other </p><p>side of the moon would be illuminated. Then </p><p>we would continue our search for the mys- </p><p>terious light. </p><p> The spot had been ideally chosen, for</p><p>here the sun never completely set, never </p><p>showed more than part of its disc above </p><p>the horizon. The extremes of heat and cold </p><p>were therefore less evident. Our car rested </p><p>on a little knoll where the rays of the sun </p><p>seldom struck it directly but were always </p><p>reflected from a nearby rock. The earth, </p><p>part of which showed above the mountain- </p><p>tops, was nearing its “first quarter”, and </p><p>added to the illumination. The stars of the </p><p>southern sky showed brilliantly overhead. </p><p>Neither of us was much inclined to explor- </p><p>ation, preferring tc spend our time reading </p><p>or lolling about the car, smoking and med- </p><p>itating. We settled ourselves comfortably </p><p>for a two weeks’ stay. </p><p> Our living quarters were given a much-</p><p>needed overhauling, and put in perfect or- </p><p>der. We checked our supplies of food, gas </p><p>and air, tested the storage batteries, and sat- </p><p>isfied ourselves that everything was ship- </p><p>shape. Then we caught up on our sleeping </p><p>and eating. Thus we passed the hours </p><p>serenely, awaiting the sunrise on the hidden </p><p>half of the moon. </p><p> Five terrestrial days had passed since our</p><p>first arrival. Wiley was immersed in a book </p><p>and I was peeling potatoes preparatory to </p><p>getting a meal, when the walls were flooded </p><p>with a bluish-yellow glare from the port- </p><p>hole. I jumped erect, but Wiley was at the </p><p>glass first. </p><p> “It’s coming down,” he shouted, making</p><p>a rush for his diving-suit. I climbed into </p><p>mine as he disappeared into the air-lock, and </p><p>waited impatiently for the pump to stop, </p><p>signifying that he was out. I followed as </p><p>quickly as I could, but by the time I emerg- </p><p>ed, he was already a quarter of a mile away, </p><p>going at a fast trot toward a bright glow </p><p>beyond the mountains. When we had gone </p><p>a mile or more it faded out gradually, but </p><p>we had located it well enough to be sure of </p><p>finding its source. We reached the wall of </p><p>the crater and climbed quickly up, Wiley </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>several rods in the lead. He reached the sum- </p><p>mit and passed out of my sight, while I </p><p>paused from exhaustion. </p><p> When at length I resumed my climb and</p><p>reached the summit, I was first too startled, </p><p>then too horror-stricken, to move. For at </p><p>the foot of the slope, two hundred yards </p><p>from me, sat an awesome and marvelous ob- </p><p>ject. It was in the shape of a cone of fifty- </p><p>foot base and somewhat greater altitude, </p><p>with circular windows around the sides and </p><p>particularly at the top; while from the </p><p>base, which was pierced at regular intervals </p><p>by semi-circular vents resembling culverts, </p><p>there issued a cloud of luminous gas, bluish- </p><p>yellow in color. </p><p> This much I saw in a swift glance. Then</p><p>I discovered that Wiley was running down </p><p>the slope toward it. Suddenly from the apex </p><p>©f thfe cone there issued a jagged flash which </p><p>struck Wiley as he ran, tumbling him head- </p><p>long on the rocks. I shouted in an agony </p><p>of horror and apprehension, and in a futile </p><p>rage seized a fragment of rock and hurled </p><p>it at the unknown thing. This evidently </p><p>drew attention to me, for it emitted another </p><p>flash which seemed to burst into myriads </p><p>©f stars; there was a crash, and blackness. </p><p>***** </p><p> To my mind the oddest feature of com-</p><p>plete insensibility is one’s total ignorance </p><p>of the passage of time. My sensations on </p><p>awakening followed immediately upon the </p><p>flash which had stunned me, yet when I </p><p>was able to talk I discovered th&lt;|t over fifty </p><p>hours had elapsed, and my life had once </p><p>been despaired of. </p><p> I was alone with Wiley, who was fully</p><p>dressed but minus his diving suit. It was </p><p>lying in an amazingly comfortable bed, in </p><p>a small but attractive room such as one may </p><p>find in many American hotels. The walls </p><p>were painted in a solid color which was </p><p>restful to the eyes. There were no pictures, </p><p>and the room was devoid of useless decor- </p><p>ations, but contained many conveniences. </p><p>The furniture was of metal, attractively up- </p><p>holstered and colored. A shaded electric </p><p>lamp shed a remarkably good counterfeit </p><p>©f sunlight, and though there were no win- </p><p>dows the whole effect was inviting and cheer- </p><p>ful. </p><p> Wiley spoke to me: “Glad t® see you’re</p><p>awake again, old man. You had a rather </p><p>tough time. The doctor had a pulmotor on </p><p>you for an hour, and would have given up </p><p>if I hadn’t kept after him.” </p><p> “Doctor?” I echoed, dazed. “Pulmotor?</p><p>Where are we?” </p><p> “This is the headquarters of those fellows</p><p>in the flying-machine,’’ he replied. “They </p><p>knocked us out with a high-tension spark. I </p><p>came around in a few minutes, but you had </p><p>broken the glass on your helmet, and they </p><p>had a nice time getting air back into your </p><p>system and teaching you to breathe again. </p><p>They’re prepared for such things, but you </p><p>were a pretty bad case.” </p><p>44TATHO are ‘they’?"’ I asked. </p><p> YY “I don't know much about them,”</p><p>he answered. “I talked to the doctor some, </p><p>but he keeps his mouth shut. It seems there </p><p>are a lot of them here, and they’ve been here </p><p>for years. A man wrho calls himself -‘For- </p><p>scher’, meaning ‘searcher’, is the guiding </p><p>spirit. I’m fo have a talk with him soon. </p><p>He, and they, are human, of course, from </p><p>the earth. They came here in machines like </p><p>the one you saw: quite an ingenious bit of </p><p>machinery, by the way. </p><p> “I had a look around it after they’d fin-</p><p>ished working on you. It gives off gases </p><p>at a tremendous velocity, and the recoil </p><p>drives it. Same piinciple as the gas jets on </p><p>our car, but much more powerful. Appar- </p><p>ently they haven’t any gravity-screens, but </p><p>the force of the discharge from their ma- </p><p>chine is sufficient alone to lift it free of the </p><p>ground, and they get up some pretty big </p><p>velocities. We re two thousand miles from </p><p>the pole, yet they got here in three hours.” </p><p>“What are they doing here?” I asked. </p><p> “I couldn’t say,” replied Wiley. “The</p><p>crew that picked us up was sent out to do </p><p>just that. They found our machine on one </p><p>of their trips and reported it. We saw the </p><p>mark of their landing—where your ‘meteor’ </p><p>had blown away the dust. They got orders </p><p>to bring us back, and here we are. That’s </p><p>all they’ve told me, and apparently it’s all </p><p>we’re to know until I talk to Dr. Forscher.” </p><p>As he finished speaking, the door opened </p><p>and a man in a white coat entered. He was </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>perhaps forty, tall, with close-cropped blond </p><p>hair, and wore rimless spectacles. From the </p><p>bag he carried, I judged he was the doctor </p><p>Wiley had referred to. He nodded pleasant- </p><p>ly to Wiley, and turned to me. </p><p> “I am pleased to see that you are again</p><p>conscious,” he said. His slight accent con- </p><p>firmed my impression that he was of German </p><p>birth. He produced a stethoscope and set </p><p>about an examination of my heart and lungs </p><p>which was as rapid as it was thorough. </p><p> “There will be no danger,” he announced</p><p>presently. “Some food will taste well—is </p><p>it not so? Then a long sleep, and you will </p><p>be as good as before.” </p><p> His prescription suited me perfectly. He</p><p>took his departure, and in the course of a </p><p>few minutes a dapper Frenchman appeared </p><p>carrying a tray of food. </p><p> “Pour le malodey said he, indicating me;</p><p>then to Wiley, “Monsieur will follow me to </p><p>the dining hall?” </p><p> “I’ll see you after you’ve had some</p><p>sleep,” said Wilev, as he departed. </p><p> I turned to the dinner which had been</p><p>brought me. There were dishes I had not </p><p>seen for weeks—fresh green vegetables, fresh </p><p>meat, butter, milk! Evidently there were </p><p>farms and dairies on the moon. I attacked </p><p>the meal with considerable appetite and </p><p>made a respectable impression on it; then, </p><p>more comfortable and very tired, I fell </p><p>asleep. </p><p> When I awoke Wiley had returned. His</p><p>face shone with a a smile of satisfaction, and </p><p>I was filled with curiosity. </p><p> “Have you seen Dr. Fdrscher?” I asked.</p><p>He nodded. </p><p> “I have,” he replied, “and a good deal be-</p><p>sides. I had dinner with some of the higher- </p><p>ups and was shown around a bit. Then I </p><p>talked to the Doctor and found out some </p><p>more. We’re scheduled to be guests of </p><p>honor here for awhile, to get acquainted </p><p>with the place. I don’t know what will </p><p>happen then, but you may be sure that </p><p>we’re quite welcome, much more so than </p><p>when we first arrived. 1 didn’t mention it</p><p>to you, but we were considered as inter- </p><p>lopers, and weren’t very popular at first. </p><p> ‘"You see, this Dr. Forscher is a rather</p><p>reclusive sort, and while he supposed that </p><p>some day someone would succeed in getting </p><p>to the moon, he hoped it wouldn’t be until </p><p>aftfer he had finished his business here and </p><p>passed on. But he was much relieved to </p><p>find out that we weren’t the advance guard </p><p>of a sizable expedition, and that no one </p><p>knows the secret of the machine except our- </p><p>selves.'’ Wiley paused to light a cigarette, </p><p>then continued: “They picked up the old </p><p>space-traveler and brought it here to find </p><p>out what makes it work. But they can’t, un- </p><p>less I help them, and the Doctor knows it </p><p>by now. So they're keeping it for us—to </p><p>make sure we don’t run away before he's </p><p>ready to let us.” </p><p> “What sort of a man is he?” I asked.</p><p>“And why is he here?” </p><p> “As to the latter, I don’t know,” replied</p><p>Wiley. “Nobody seems willing to^tell me, </p><p>and I can’t guess. But as for the doctor, </p><p>he’s quite an odd sort. Not very attractive </p><p>physically; about five-feet-two, as a guess, </p><p>with a head all out of proportion. He just </p><p>sits like a statue while he talks to you, but </p><p>I really believe he can look right into your </p><p>mind. He has the most marvelous intellect </p><p>I’ve ever seen.” </p><p> This, from Wiley, was a real tribute, for</p><p>the world can count on one hand the men </p><p>with minds equal to his. </p><p> “He’s what you might call a super-scien-</p><p>tist,” he continued. “He knows more phy- </p><p>sics than the whole department at the City </p><p>College: the world’s best chemists are mere </p><p>tyros compared to him. As a physician or </p><p>surgeon he could have made a fortune on </p><p>earth. The science of psychology is mere </p><p>A-B-C to him; and he can solve problems in </p><p>mathematics without putting a mark on </p><p>paper that would take me an hour or more. </p><p>That is by no means a comprehensive list </p><p>of his achievements. He had specialized in </p><p>none of the sciences, but he knows them all, </p><p>and better than any man on earth. Every- </p><p>thing in this colony is the product of his </p><p>mind; he conceived it, engineered it, built </p><p>it, and now he rules it. </p><p>Many Wonders </p><p>4tT’VE seen enough of the place to appre- </p><p>X ciate what a man he is. For instance, </p><p>there’s the air. Perhaps you’ve noticed its </p><p>654 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>freshness. It should be fresh— it was made </p><p>a few hours ago! He makes the oxygen and </p><p>nitrogen right out of the rocks around us. </p><p>There’s plenty of oxygen to be found in the </p><p>quartz but its hard to get out, and there’s </p><p>little, if any, nitrogen to be found in any </p><p>form. Nevertheless, he makes both of them, </p><p>by a kind of atomic chemistry. He gave me </p><p>a general idea of the process. He uses high </p><p>temperatures and strong electric and mag- </p><p>netic fields to break up the atoms of some </p><p>elements and then recombines them into </p><p>others. Silicon seems to suit the purpose </p><p>well, and there's plenty of it, in combina- </p><p>tion with oxygen, all around us in the form </p><p>of sand and quartz. </p><p> “He uses the same principle, indirectly, in</p><p>driving those flying machines, which they </p><p>call tractors. Do you remember our talk, </p><p>the night you wrecked your car, when I </p><p>mentioned that if anyone could find a way </p><p>to build up a radioactive atom more com- </p><p>plex than uranium he would have a storage </p><p>battery for unlimited power? It’s a sub- </p><p>stance like that which drives the tractors. It </p><p>takes millions of horsepower to make a </p><p>pound of it, but the power all comes out </p><p>again as it’s wanted. </p><p> “Did you enjoy your dinner? Perhaps</p><p>you’re interested in knowing where it came </p><p>from. There are acres and acres of artifi- </p><p>cial soil where plants and animals live un- </p><p>der quartz-glass roofs, receiving light from </p><p>the sun and from arc-lamps. The cattle, </p><p>hogs and chickens he raises would be the </p><p>despair of our best farmers, and the ‘tall </p><p>corn from Iowa’ isn’t even in it compared </p><p>with the crops he harvests the year around. </p><p>Marland, that man has everything there is </p><p>to be found on earth, and he’s gone nature </p><p>one better in every way. </p><p> “I found out, loo, where the power Comes</p><p>from. The most obvious source—the sun; </p><p>and very simply. Prom sunrise to sun- </p><p>set there are hundreds of boilers heated by </p><p>huge burning glasses, which generate elec- </p><p>tric energy. Part of it is stored in batteries </p><p>for the dark period. </p><p> “This colony lives underground, in a sys-</p><p>tem of excavations and tunnels that extends </p><p>for several miles around. There are hun-</p><p>dreds of men, but no women or children. I </p><p>don’t know how he intends to replenish his </p><p>labor supply when age and accident take a </p><p>hand. They've been here eleven years, </p><p>building and digging. There are a corps of </p><p>scientists who are the Doctor’s assistants and </p><p>share his confidence to a considerable ex- </p><p>tent. The rest are mechanics, artisans and </p><p>laborers. One of ihem told me where they </p><p>all came from. There are French, Germans, </p><p>Belgians, English, Austrians—^Imost every </p><p>white nationality on earth. They have </p><p>enough to do, but never too much, and </p><p>enough variety to make it interesting. </p><p>They’ve provided with facilities for recrea- </p><p>tion, comfortable quarters, and plenty of </p><p>food. They seem contented with their lot, </p><p>and indeed they may well enough be. </p><p> “Some of this the Doctor told me, and</p><p>some I found out from other men. But the </p><p>most interesting ihing of all—the reason </p><p>for this tremendous establishment so far </p><p>from the earth—no one has mentioned. He </p><p>wants us to become acquainted, and then </p><p>he’s going to have a talk with both of us. </p><p>Meanwhile there's nothing much to do but </p><p>make ourselves at home.” </p><p> He sat in silence for a time, while my</p><p>head whirled from the multitude of wonders </p><p>he had described. But I was anxious to be </p><p>up again, and see for my self this strange </p><p>subterranean world of humans a quarter of </p><p>a million miles from their birth-place. I </p><p>set about exploring our apartment, and </p><p>found a completely equipped bathroom with </p><p>facilities for shaving and a shower-bath. I </p><p>immediately availed myself of these, and </p><p>once more dressed and moving about, I </p><p>found that my appetite had returned. In </p><p>answer to my question, Wiley informed me </p><p>that there would be a meal in the dining </p><p>hall in half an hour or so. Meanwhile, he </p><p>suggested that we take a stroll around the </p><p>hallways, which suited me perfectly. </p><p> I found that the corridors formed a large</p><p>H, with the laboratories and farms opening </p><p>from the parallel passages and the living </p><p>quarters, dining-hall, etc. along the connect- </p><p>ing corridor. The doors in most instances </p><p>bore only numbers, though a few had </p><p>legends in many languages over them. One </p><p>of these was the dining-room, to which we </p><p>presently returned. </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>655 </p><p> We were led to a table at which were</p><p>seated several men of various nationalities </p><p>who, Wiley told me, were Dr. Forscher’s </p><p>6cientiftc assistants. The Doctor himself </p><p>preferred to eat alone, seldom joining the </p><p>others in the dining-hall. Wiley introduced </p><p>me to each of the men at the table. They </p><p>were for the most part unknown to me, </p><p>though in a few I recognized men whose </p><p>names had once been familiar on earth. </p><p> They had best remain anonymous, for</p><p>reasons which will presently be understood. </p><p>There was also the Chief Engineer, whom I </p><p>shall call-Dr. Langley, who stood highly in </p><p>the estimation of Dr. Forscher, and who </p><p>had been partly responsible for the feats of </p><p>construction at which we marveled. He told </p><p>of the difficulties which had been overcome </p><p>us. during the course of the meal, of some </p><p>since their arrival. It seems that he had </p><p>come in company with Dr. Forscher and </p><p>some of the scientific staff, together with a </p><p>part of their present labor force, some eleven </p><p>or twelve years before. They had establish- </p><p>ed a small headquarters, digging a cave into </p><p>the rock, fitting it with an air-lock, setting </p><p>a small power-plant in operation, and con- </p><p>verting the cave into a work-shop. </p><p> With this as a starting-point they had de-</p><p>signed and constructed the vast subterran- </p><p>ean labyrinth which formed the present </p><p>dwelling of the colony, increasing the power- </p><p>plant as necessary. At present there were </p><p>accommodations for nearly twice as many </p><p>inhabitants as it now held, and no more con- </p><p>struction was under way, their activities be- </p><p>ing directed into other channels. Here he </p><p>stopped, as if fearful of having said too </p><p>much, and we could learn nothing more. </p><p>THAT there was some purpose to this </p><p>organization as yet unfulfilled, we had </p><p>no doubt, but every time the subject came </p><p>up we ran into a blind wall. Wiley and I </p><p>had made conjectures as we explored the </p><p>corridors, but we could arrive at no reason- </p><p>able supposition. In the list of laboratory </p><p>directors the sciences were nearly all repre- </p><p>sented, yet none seemed to predominate. </p><p>Thes scientists, we learned, had all come of </p><p>their own volition; yet with every oppor- </p><p>tunity for fame on earth, with greater facil- </p><p>ities than could possibly be presented here, </p><p>why had they chosen an existence on this </p><p>barren satellite, so inaccessible, so cut off </p><p>from communication, so fraught with dan- </p><p>ger? For solitude? It hardly seemed like- </p><p>ly. In fact, one might find comparatively </p><p>greater privacy on earth than here, pent up </p><p>with a few hundred fellow-beings whose </p><p>daily association was unavoidable. There </p><p>must be some more powerful motive, which </p><p>was so far wrapped in secrecy, guarded by </p><p>the trusted few who surrounded Wiley and </p><p>myself at the dinner-table. </p><p> The repast was finished, and at Dr. Lang-</p><p>ley’s suggestion we adjourned with him to </p><p>his own apartment. We settled ourselves for </p><p>a chat, and discussed further the work of </p><p>constructing the colony. He told us in de- </p><p>tail how the air-plant operated, leaving out </p><p>only the vital principle which enabled Dr. </p><p>Forscher to destroy and reconstruct atoms, </p><p>which, he confessed, was known only to the </p><p>doctor, the head of the physics laboratory and </p><p>a few others. He described also how a con- </p><p>tinuous circulation of water was maintained; </p><p>the sewage being filtered and boiled so as </p><p>to render it pure again. It was of course </p><p>simple to supply more, uniting hydrogen </p><p>and oxygen by combustion, but it was sel- </p><p>dom necessary. </p><p> We found out many other interesting</p><p>things; how, after the glass covered pastures </p><p>had been made for for them, a few cattle, </p><p>sheep, hogs, etc., had been brought from the </p><p>earth and allowed to multiply to the pre- </p><p>sent herds; how it had been necessary, for </p><p>the first year or to, to live almost entirely </p><p>on synthetic food, made there in the work- </p><p>shop; how they managed to procure the </p><p>materials for their work. Some minerals, he </p><p>told us, they .found it easier to mine, as they </p><p>were found in large quantities about the </p><p>moon. Iron was one-—they had several iron </p><p>mines. They were reached by flying- </p><p>machines, and maintained separate power, </p><p>air, and water plants. </p><p> Some substances too, could not he found</p><p>on the moon, and were too difficult of man- </p><p>ufacture, notably organic substance?. Chief </p><p>among these was wood. Dr. Forscher pro- </p><p>jected the planting of a forest of timber </p><p>in the near future, but it would take inaay </p><p>656 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>years to reach maturity. In most cases a </p><p>more durable substitute had been found— </p><p>metal for furniture, doors, etc.; concrete </p><p>stairs and floors. The indispensible mater- </p><p>ials of this sort had been brought from the </p><p>earth and used as sparingly as possible, but </p><p>at some future time it would doubtless be </p><p>necessary to renew the supply. </p><p> Dr. Langley added, too, that the need for</p><p>occasional communication with the earth </p><p>was growing increasingly evident, as a great- </p><p>er labor force was needed, especially since </p><p>time and accident had contrived to mater- </p><p>ially reduce its original numbers. </p><p> At this point we were interrupted by the</p><p>ringing of the wall phone, and Dr. Lang- </p><p>ley answered it. We gathered from his re- </p><p>marks that something was amiss. As he </p><p>hung up we prepared to take our departure </p><p>but he detained us. </p><p> P</p><p> “Would you care to take a trip to one</p><p>of the mines?” he asked. “The airplant </p><p>has broken down, and I must go there to </p><p>supervise repairs and of course remove the </p><p>men.” </p><p> Wiley turned to me. “How about it,</p><p>Marland,” he asked. “Have you energy </p><p>enough, after your siege?” </p><p> “Try to count me out!” I exclaimed.</p><p>Dr. Langley nodded his approval and turn- </p><p>ed to the phone again. Getting in touch </p><p>with the Chief of Transportation, he ordered </p><p>two tractors made ready for flight; then he </p><p>gave directions to a corps of mechanics, and </p><p>finally signified his readiness. We follow- </p><p>ed him to one of the corridors near the cen- </p><p>ter of the main tunnel, and for some dis- </p><p>tance along this to a store-room. He took </p><p>out three of their “air-envelopes,” which </p><p>served the same purpose as our diving suits, </p><p>and illustrated the method of donning </p><p>them. We found them much better than </p><p>our own in many respects. Besides great- </p><p>er ease of movement, each was equipped </p><p>with a small radio apparatus consisting of </p><p>microphone and miniature loud-speaker, </p><p>having a range of a half a mile or more, </p><p>so that conversation was easily carried on.</p><p>They were also heat-insulated, to guard </p><p>against the unpleasantness which we had ex- </p><p>perienced, and the helmets were entirely of </p><p>colored glass, which permitted greater </p><p>ranges of vision, yet prevented possible sun- </p><p>blindness. </p><p>CHAPTER VI. </p><p>A Tragedy! </p><p>DR. Langley now conducted us through </p><p>the smaller of two doors into a cylind- </p><p>rical chamber which served the double pur- </p><p>pose of air-lock and elevator. The doors, </p><p>when closed, were hermetically sealed, </p><p>and by touching a button we were carried </p><p>rapidly a hundred feet or so to the surface. </p><p>Meanwhile a pump had been exhausting the </p><p>air in the chamber, and we now stood in a </p><p>nearly perfect vacuum, with only another </p><p>air-tight door between ourselves and the </p><p>exterior of the moon. On stepping out we </p><p>saw before us two of the huge conical flying </p><p>machines, each with a wisp of vapor issu- </p><p>ing from the semi-circular openings at the </p><p>base. Following Langley, we approached </p><p>the nearer, and 1 was startled to hear his </p><p>voice, loud as a gun-shot, from the radio </p><p>speaker: “Aboard the tractor! Open up!” </p><p> “Yes sir!” came a response, and in a</p><p>moment a door opened in the side just above </p><p>the ground. Passing through another door </p><p>to the right to the interior of the machine, </p><p>we found ourselves in a circular runway </p><p>extending entirely around the base of the </p><p>machine. A tall man might have had dif- </p><p>ficulty standing erect in it, as there was lit- </p><p>tle more than six feet head room. The </p><p>sides slanted toward the apex of the mach- </p><p>ine at slightly different angles, the inner </p><p>more nearly vertical. The floor was ap- </p><p>proximately ten feet wide, and. the roof </p><p>somewhat less. On our left, directly out- </p><p>side the air lock door, was a ladder lead- </p><p>ing to compartments above. We mounted </p><p>through two more compartments differing </p><p>from the first only in that they were con- </p><p>tinuous, having no air-lock. </p><p> Dr. Langley mentioned in passing that</p><p>they served as cargo space or as accommo- </p><p>dations for passengers. The ladder con- </p><p>tinued up to a trap-door in the floor of </p><p>the fourth compartment. This was open, </p><p>and we climbed into the engine room of the </p><p>tractor. Here we removed the air-enve-</p><p>lopes, and Dr. Langley showed us through </p><p>THE OUTPOST ON THE MOON </p><p>657 </p><p>the room, explaining the driving principle </p><p>and the apparatus in the engine room. It </p><p>was much larger than those below, and jam- </p><p>med with machinery which nevertheless oc- </p><p>cupied a minimum of space, so well was it </p><p>arranged. There were eight huge genera- </p><p>tors, covered with aluminum cases which </p><p>served the double purpose of protecting the </p><p>occupants from injury and preventing pos- </p><p>sible leakage of air, as the machinery was </p><p>driven by turbines which connected with </p><p>the interior conical well of the car. It was </p><p>through this interior well that the gas which </p><p>we had seen escaped, being given off by the </p><p>driving element. </p><p> It has often been said that there is nothing</p><p>new under the sun; but the author of this </p><p>famous saying had never heard of Dr. For- </p><p>scher. The driving element was literally </p><p>new; not in the sense that it consisted of a </p><p>hitherto unknown substance, nor of a new </p><p>combination of old substances. It was en- </p><p>tirely a new element, above uranium in the </p><p>periodic system. It was appropriately call- </p><p>ed “synthium”, being a manufactured ele- </p><p>ment— the ultimate achievement of Dr. </p><p>Forscher’s dexterity in atomic physics. Not </p><p>content with changing the elements one in- </p><p>to another, he had added protons and elec- </p><p>trons to the uranium atom, and created syn- </p><p>thium. Undisturbed, its half-life period </p><p>was a matter of minutes only, but if kept </p><p>at an extremely low temperature its activity </p><p>was greatly reduced. It was necessary to </p><p>cool it constantly, as its very activity re- </p><p>sulted in heat, and heat bringing more ac- </p><p>tivity, it gathered speed like a rolling snow- </p><p>ball, and was quite as apt to wreak havoc. </p><p>Kept under control by electric refrigera- </p><p>tion, however, it was a willing and mighty </p><p>slave. It gave off molecules of gas which </p><p>glowed with the heat of their liberation. </p><p>They were given off in all directions equal- </p><p>ly, but those which encountered the walls </p><p>of the conical container rebounded out- </p><p>wards. So great was the recoil of their de- </p><p>parture that they easily lifted the huge </p><p>tractor.* </p><p> The method of driving was simplicity it-</p><p>self, the chief difficulty being to retain the </p><p>liberated energy within controllable lim- </p><p>its. The synthium was allowed to attain</p><p>a temperature of some three hundred de- </p><p>grees Centigrade**, and here it was main- </p><p>tained by the eight generators, which sup- </p><p>plied current to a system of electric cool- </p><p>ing. These generators were driven by tur- </p><p>bines in the path of the escaping gas. </p><p>When the tractor was to be brought down, </p><p>more current was supplied, the resulting </p><p>lessened discharge, which also affected the </p><p>turbines, being compensated by the opening </p><p>of valves which at full power diverted all </p><p>but a fraction of the stream from the vanes. </p><p>At rest, a slight discharge continued, which </p><p>served merely to run the cooling system. </p><p>When the machines were returned to their </p><p>hangars, the driving element was removed to </p><p>cold-storage far beneath the ground. </p><p> There were also in the engine room the</p><p>gyroscopic balancers, and the necessary ap- </p><p>paratus for renewing the air, which need </p><p>not be further described. Above the en- </p><p>gine room, at the apex of the cone, was the </p><p>pilot house. It was practically sound-proof, </p><p>and darkened save for hooded lanlps over </p><p>instruments which indicated the tempera- </p><p>ture of the driving element, the accelera- </p><p>tion of the tractor, condition of the air, etc. </p><p>A little to one side of the center wras the </p><p>tube of a small refracting telescope, which </p><p>was used in long flights away from the </p><p>moon to examine the path of the tractor </p><p>and reveal possible obstructions. </p><p> We stayed but a moment, for the pilot</p><p>house was sacred to its occupant, and since </p><p>the corps of mechanics were now on board </p><p>it was time to depart. </p><p>♦Another illustration of Newton's Third Law of </p><p> Motion.</p><p>**572° Fahrenheit. </p><p>(To be continued) </p><p> The End of Time</p><p>By Henry F* Kirkham </p><p>Seven Million Years into Time They Travelled To </p><p>Discover The Fate of The Human Race! </p><p>I SAT up suddenly, startled out of a deep </p><p>sleep by the unexplainable feeling that </p><p>someone was very close to me, and that this </p><p>individual, whoever he might be, had no </p><p>right to enter my room in the dead of night. </p><p>For a moment I allowed my eyes to become </p><p>accustomed to the faintly luminous gloom </p><p>of a moonlit night in midsummer. My at- </p><p>tention had been focused at once on a </p><p> shadowy figure seated in my armchair. I</p><p> strained my eyes in that direction; then I</p><p> reached my hand up to the wall behind me</p><p> and switched on the room lights.</p><p> As the face and figure of the man in my</p><p> chair leaped suddenly into prominence in</p><p> the bright light, I gasped in amazement.</p><p> “‘Brown!'’ 1 exclaimed. “What in the</p><p> world—"</p><p>658 </p><p>We were looking with amazement into faces that gazed at </p><p>us without surprise and without emotion. </p><p> One of those mocking smiles which had</p><p>always irritated me flitted across Mr. </p><p>Brown’s lips. He seemed to be enjoying </p><p>my discomfiture. </p><p> “You who know me so well,” he said,</p><p>“should never be surprised at anything I </p><p>may do. How I came here is of no import- </p><p>ance. What concerns you is why 1 came </p><p>here.” </p><p> Instantly my mind flashed back across</p><p>time to that terrible, that incredible adven- </p><p>659 </p><p>ture of ours in lost Atlantis, when Brown </p><p>and I fought for our lives against men who </p><p>had been dead ten thousand years! Of late </p><p>months I had begun to doubt the whole </p><p>amazing affair; 1 had begun to doubt the </p><p>very existence of Brown, since he had dis- </p><p>appeared completely, he and his house and </p><p>his laboratory; and not even the blue mark </p><p>on my finger, or the half-empty fire extin- </p><p>guisher on the wall could convince me that </p><p>I had once actually saved his life by putting </p><p>660 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>out a blaze in his abode. Those who have </p><p>read my* “Time Oscillator” will recall my </p><p>undignified return to the world of today. </p><p>When I picked myself up from the floor </p><p>of my own laboratory the astounding Brown </p><p>had vanished; and a man less scientific than </p><p>I would have dismissed that fantastic jour- </p><p>ney backward into time as a freak of the </p><p>imagination. All the weight of deliberate </p><p>reason stamped the events as altogether out- </p><p>side the pale of prob- </p><p>ability. If I admitted </p><p>to myself that such </p><p>events had taken place, </p><p>then I considered my- </p><p>self stark mad; and, </p><p>naturally, I could not </p><p>admit the latter as- </p><p>sumption to be true. </p><p> The reappearance of</p><p>Brown—I had almost </p><p>said the apparition of </p><p>Brown—came, there- </p><p>fore, as a blow at my </p><p>very reason. But I </p><p>realized, once and for </p><p>all, that I really had </p><p>gone back to Atlantis, </p><p>and that this man sit- </p><p>ting quietly at my bed- </p><p>side, with that cynical </p><p>smile of his, was the </p><p>wizard who had taken </p><p>me there. </p><p> “Awake, my friend,”</p><p>continued the master </p><p>of time. Then he </p><p>chuckled: “How typi- </p><p>cal ! Mankind sleeps, </p><p>while the stars gyrate </p><p>in the heavens!” </p><p> Accustomed as I was</p><p>to Brown’s bitterness, </p><p>I merely smiled, and </p><p>then got out of bed and donned a dressing </p><p>gown. Between Brown and myself there </p><p>were none of the usual formalities of hand- </p><p>shaking. Such was the power of this re- </p><p>markable man that the empty months seem- </p><p>ed to vanish, and it seemed as though I had </p><p>seen him that very day, and that we were</p><p>•December 1929 issue Science Wonder Stories </p><p>resuming a conversation begun in the twi- </p><p>light. </p><p> “I called upon you ,in this rather informal</p><p>fashion,” began my friend, in his offhand </p><p>manner, “because you are the only man on </p><p>earth who knows me and trusts me.

Before I go any farther I wish to </p><p>know whether I can depend upon you as I </p><p>have in the past — </p><p>whether you are will- </p><p>ing to accompany me </p><p>on my greatest adven- </p><p>ture.” </p><p> Some of the old</p><p>spirit of courage and </p><p>daring, some of the </p><p>old love for the biz- </p><p>arre, rose up in me, </p><p>and I nodded. </p><p> “As my disciple/'</p><p>continued Brown, “t </p><p>want you to share the </p><p>dangers and joys of </p><p>this adventure—and I </p><p>warn you, there will </p><p>be more danger than </p><p>you have ever faced </p><p>before. Compared to </p><p>the trip upon which </p><p>we are to launch our- </p><p>selves, the journey to </p><p>Atlantis was a mere </p><p>visit next door, so to </p><p>speak, and the dangers </p><p>we faced were nothing. </p><p>The dangers Xve are to </p><p>face you cart imagine. </p><p>But the joy of this ad- </p><p>venture will lie in </p><p>viewing what no man </p><p>has ever viewed be- </p><p>fore — the ultimate </p><p>wonders of the time dimension. Watson” </p><p>—he paused to give emphasis to what he </p><p>was about to say—“I intend to venture even </p><p>to the end of the world! To the end of </p><p>time!” </p><p> The terrific possibilities of what Brown</p><p>mentioned staggered me for a moment; yet</p><p>not for an instant did I disbelieve him. Why </p><p> human race, scien-V</p><p> 'S tists tell us, is only a</p><p> creature of his environ-</p><p> ment. ^4s long as things</p><p> go well, and nature is kind,</p><p> he will progress. But if an-</p><p> other ice age should come</p><p> there is no assurance that</p><p> he will not disappear and</p><p> the supremacy of the earth</p><p> pass on to the termite or</p><p> the—cockroach !</p><p> But even granting that</p><p> he can withstand the on-</p><p> slaughts of nature, he pos-</p><p> sibly carries within him-</p><p> self the seeds of his own</p><p> doom. Just as an individual</p><p> becomes mature, middle</p><p> aged and then senile so it</p><p> happens with a race and a</p><p> species. Man is still now in</p><p> the flush of his youth. But</p><p> what will be the situation</p><p> seven million years from</p><p> now when his primitive</p><p> strength is gone and he can</p><p> no longer do such an ele-</p><p> mentary thing as bring</p><p> children into the world?</p><p> This fascinating story</p><p> thrills by its vivid pictures</p><p> of the human race AT THE</p><p> •s^END OF TIME.</p><p>THE END OF TIME </p><p>661 </p><p>•hould I hesitate, I who had accompanied </p><p>him before, especially since I knew how he </p><p>yearned for human sympathy—a common </p><p>veakness among great men? </p><p> “Brown,” I answered, trying to keep the</p><p>excitement out of my voice, “no matter </p><p>what you do you can count on me—to the </p><p>end!” </p><p> And so Brown came once again into my</p><p>life. Against my better judgment I felt </p><p>bound to this strange man, and if I believed </p><p>in Destiny, as do the Mohammedans, I </p><p>would say that I had been destined to fol- </p><p>low him to the ends of time. </p><p>I had projected into the future in Brown’s </p><p>first time machine, the same one which </p><p>had taken me back to the French Revolu- </p><p>tion, and which had nearly </p><p>brought me to my death in </p><p>lost Atlantis. It was a far </p><p>cry from that block of cry- </p><p>stal in Brown’s laboratory </p><p>to the stupendous creation I </p><p>was privileged to see a few </p><p>weeks after the lost inventor </p><p>appeared in my room that </p><p>nw'ht in midsummer. </p><p> In a far mountain retreat,</p><p>hundreds of miles from my </p><p>prosaic office, I met the man </p><p>of the time machine. With- </p><p>out ceremony he led me to </p><p>a cavern that ran into the </p><p>side of a lofty cliff, and </p><p>there, deep in the earth, I </p><p>came upon his laboratory. </p><p> “Brown”, I said, with a smile, “you re-</p><p>mind me of a gnome who performs his won- </p><p>ders underground, away from the light of </p><p>men. Vulcan worked his forge in the dark- </p><p>ness. The magicians and the alchemists </p><p>teemed to think that darkness was part of </p><p>their stock-in-trade. Really—” </p><p> “Never mind all that,” said Brown, wav-</p><p>ing his hand at the amazing machine which </p><p>stood in a natural grotto. In no wise did </p><p>ri resemble the time machine of our first </p><p>adventure. That incredible creation which </p><p>introduced me to the possibilities of the</p><p>time plane and initiated me into the myster- </p><p>ies of time travel was a great block of pure </p><p>crystal, illuminated by myriads of lights </p><p>within and without; a cube which appeared </p><p>to have an infinite number of cubes within </p><p>itself, one inside the other. In spite of its </p><p>divisions it was an entity, a single device. </p><p>Brown’s new machine appeared to consist of </p><p>three distinct parts. </p><p> The core of the mechanism—if it can be</p><p>called a mechanism—was in the form of a </p><p>small hollow pyramid, surrounded by a </p><p>winding glass spiral. Around both pyramid </p><p>and spiral glittered a spherical globe of </p><p>brilliant, transparent crystal. As the crystal </p><p>globe radiated the light of the glowing arcs </p><p>that were focussed upon it—lights which </p><p>gave the time machine its boundless energy </p><p>—I could not help laughing aloud at the </p><p>impression which struck me. I w7as re- </p><p>minded of nothing so much </p><p>as an ordinary goldfish </p><p>globe, with a toy house in </p><p>the center through which the </p><p>fish could swim when they </p><p>got tired of swimming </p><p>around the bowl itself. </p><p> “You laugh,” said Brown</p><p>suspiciously. “Perhaps I </p><p>should not have trusted you </p><p>after all.” </p><p> 1 hastened to rea^ure him,</p><p>and explained the cause of </p><p>my ill-advised mirth. </p><p> “You smile,” he repeated</p><p>seriously, “at a magnificent </p><p>new conception. You are </p><p>looking with amusement at </p><p>the three mathematical sym- </p><p>bols typical of natural laws,—the curve, the </p><p>spiral, the apex. Nowhere in creation is </p><p>the straight line a part of nature.” </p><p> “What about the level surface of a body</p><p>of water?” I interjected. “This surface is a </p><p>plane, and a plane consists of an infinite </p><p>number of straight lines.” </p><p> “I was not speaking of planes, but of</p><p>lines in and by themselves,” answered </p><p>Brown. “By means of these three visible </p><p>manifestations I hope to penetrate the </p><p>earth plane to a point far distant in the un-</p><p>explored future—to a point where animate </p><p>life shall cease to exist. That will not be </p><p>the end of time; but as far as conscious </p><p>HENRY F. KIRKHAM </p><p>662 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>beings on the earth are concerned, it will </p><p>be the end of time and the beginning of </p><p>eternity.” </p><p> “You mean—the end of evolution—the</p><p>termination of processes which have been </p><p>working themselves out for millions and </p><p>millions of years? I don’t believe it,” I </p><p>said, warmly. “I cannot conceive of the </p><p>human race dying out unless some terrific </p><p>natural catastrophe takes place—another </p><p>glacial age, or the collision of the earth </p><p>with some other heavenly body. And even </p><p>then I believe man will be sufficiently ad- </p><p>vanced to turn back an advancing glacial </p><p>period. Disease will be conquered by then </p><p>—as a physician I predict it with confi- </p><p>dence. Unless all the natural resources of </p><p>the earth are exhausted, I cannot conceive </p><p>of suph a thing—and when they are ex- </p><p>hausted, science will find a way to replace </p><p>them. </p><p> “I have absolute faith in the future of</p><p>man. I cannot understand how you expect </p><p>to come to the end of the race unless you </p><p>come to the end of the world as well—and </p><p>in that ease, it will be safer not to make the </p><p>trip at all, for we will never return. Re- </p><p>member that in Atlantis we were nearly </p><p>murdered by men who have been dead for a </p><p>hundred centuries!” </p><p>To the End of Time </p><p>BROWN smiled wearily. “As I have </p><p>never been to the end of time,” he an- </p><p>swered, “I cannot say with certainty when </p><p>the human race will vanish, and when the </p><p>earth will become a dead world; but this </p><p>much I can tell you—that it will happen. </p><p>You think of space as infinite, but space is </p><p>curved. We can measure the curve. I be- </p><p>lieve in cycles. I believe the cycle of life </p><p>on the earth has a definite limit.” </p><p> Since it was impossible to argue on the</p><p>point and get anywhere, I turned my atten- </p><p>tion once more to the marvellous new time </p><p>machine. As I came under the glow of the </p><p>battery of lights I felt the same abounding </p><p>vigor race through me which had once be- </p><p>fore filled me with courage for a mad ad- </p><p>venture. Undoubtedly, both machines had </p><p>the same motive power. I mentioned this</p><p>to Brown, who nodded. Then I explored </p><p>the interior of the globe, so different from </p><p>that cube in which we had visited the dim </p><p>past. </p><p> As in the original time machine, I observ-</p><p>ed a camera obscura, a series of charts and </p><p>electric controls, and a curious arrange- </p><p>ment of mirrors. One piece of equipment </p><p>especially attracted my attention. It re- </p><p>sembled a portable searchlight—something </p><p>like the powerful special lights on automo- </p><p>biles—and it was attached to what looked </p><p>like a metallic helmet. </p><p> “What is this?” I asked; “I never saw it</p><p>before.” </p><p> “An atomic disintegrator,” he replied.</p><p>“One of my own inventions. It is more than </p><p>likely we will need some deadly weapons </p><p>where we are going, and since I couldn’t </p><p>take a battery of field guns I invented some- </p><p>thing better. This is a very effective weapon </p><p>indeed. I have a theory of my own about </p><p>the future races of man. I rather imagine </p><p>that man will not progress as far as we </p><p>think he will; and that at some periods in </p><p>his history he will not progress at all. The </p><p>cycle idea again. In case we run foul of </p><p>a race of throwbacks, we won’t be defense- </p><p>less. Automatic pistols were good enough </p><p>in Atlantis, but the men of the future will </p><p>laugh at them. And even this disintegra- </p><p>tor will be no novelty—but it’s nothing to </p><p>laugh at!” </p><p> “It will be a bad day for humanity/’ I</p><p>said, “when a man of our generation has </p><p>to help kill off the last human beings on </p><p>earth.” </p><p> “Let’s hope it never comes to that,” an-</p><p>swered Brown solemnly, yet with a trace of </p><p>his usual disillusioned mockery. </p><p> “Are we to wear the wire mesh suits we</p><p>used at Atlantis?” I asked. </p><p> “We won’t be able to frighten anyone with</p><p>electricity a million years from now,” said </p><p>Brown meditatively, a9 though he thought </p><p>of it for the first time, “but I’ve got them </p><p>aboard. You never can tell what you’ll </p><p>need. For all I know we may run into a </p><p>second Jurassic age, and we may be attacked </p><p>by reptiles that will have to be taught to</p><p>keep their distance. Yes, by all means we </p><p>take the suits. And two automatics.” </p><p>THE END OF TIME </p><p>663 </p><p> “What will we do,” I asked, “if we find</p><p>ifcat the seas have covered the continents— </p><p>they did millions of years ago? Do you </p><p>think we stand a chance of getting back?” </p><p>“That’s part of the adventure,” responded </p><p>Brown, his eyes lighting up. “We may find </p><p>a race of human beings who have accus- </p><p>tomed themselves to an amphibian exist- </p><p>ence—1 believe it’s possible. We came from </p><p>the water—why can’t we go back to it? </p><p>What will actually happen if we should </p><p>land in the middle of an ocean I can’t say </p><p>—and what’s more, I don’t like to think </p><p>about it. But since you think of so many </p><p>objections to this trip—perhaps you would </p><p>rather not take the chance? There is still </p><p>time for you to change your mind.” </p><p> Deep in my heart I knew I was setting</p><p>oat on a mad enterprise; for, whereas on </p><p>my first trip I believed in Brown implicitly, </p><p>in this case I was firmly convinced that he </p><p>was wrong in his original hypothesis. But </p><p>my idiotic pride, or my vanity, kept me </p><p>*ilent, and I followed Brown into the time </p><p>machine. </p><p> Almost before I realized it, he had sealed</p><p>tfee globe and turned the control. I recog- </p><p>nized the blurring of the lights, the sense </p><p>of flying upward, away from the world, in- </p><p>to a new, boundless, element. 1 seemed to </p><p>epiral into space as the mirrors revolved </p><p>with incredible rapidity. Against my will </p><p>I had been projected headlong into the fu- </p><p>ture, and at terrific velocity I was approach- </p><p>ing the end of time! </p><p>ALOW chuckle behind me made me </p><p>turn on Brown in a fury. But the ut- </p><p>ter calm of his countenance, and the care- </p><p>less smile which played around his lips made </p><p>me remember myself in time. After all, </p><p>he had never been wrong before, and it </p><p>seemed as though I were fated to share </p><p>with him one adventure more; the best, and, </p><p>1 hoped—the last. </p><p> “Now that you’ve got me here, you may</p><p>as well show me how to operate this </p><p>machine of yours,” I said to Brown. “After </p><p>a!!, something is liable to happen to you, </p><p>considering the dangers we are to face, and </p><p>I ought to have a chance to get back to my </p><p>own world.’*</p><p> “Judging by your attitude,” answered the</p><p>omniscient Brown, with his bitter smile, </p><p>“you wouldn’t be sorry if something hap- </p><p>pened to me right now. I should have </p><p>known better than to take you into my con- </p><p>fidence a second time. You don’t trust me </p><p>any more; you think I’m crazy, and this </p><p>time you think you have proof of it. Well, </p><p>before this trip is over, I hope to convince </p><p>you that I’m as sane as you are—and per- </p><p>haps a lot saner.” </p><p> “I’m sorry, Brown,” I said, genuinely re-</p><p>gretting by hasty conclusion. “Say no </p><p>more about it. I’m with you here and I’ll </p><p>be with you to the end.” </p><p> “That’s the way to talk!” exclaimed the</p><p>inventor enthusiastically. “And now that I </p><p>know you won’t try anything, I’ll try to </p><p>teach you how the machine works.” </p><p> And for what appeared to be a long time,</p><p>as the crystal globe tore through time to its </p><p>inevitable destination, Brown instructed me </p><p>in the intricate workings of his marvellous </p><p>mechanism. </p><p> “I wonder if I can see that wonderful city</p><p>again,” I remarked. “You remember I saw </p><p>one upon our first trip which seemed to be </p><p>built of glass, and another that had a vast </p><p>spinning globe in the center.” </p><p> “We are far beyond those,” said* Brown</p><p>solemnly. “We are two million years in </p><p>the future as we speak!” </p><p> I gasped, and then turned to the camera</p><p>obscura and flashed off the interior lights. </p><p>A vast panorama spread before us. It was </p><p>night upon the world. A full moon shone </p><p>coldly on a vast city of gleaming glass, shin- </p><p>ing l*ke crystal in the white rays. It seemed </p><p>more like a continent than a city; for when </p><p>one looks down upon a city from the air, </p><p>he can discern its boundaries. But here, as </p><p>far as the eye could see, was that one vast </p><p>dome of glass, beneath which the teeming </p><p>life of a nation pulsed and seethed. Through </p><p>the mighty arched roof, which seemed to </p><p>cover the entire earth, flashed the myriad </p><p>lights that turned night to day inside the </p><p>magic structure. The entire city, or state, </p><p>or nation—we could discern no distinguish- </p><p>ing characteristics—was one immense chain </p><p>of structures, all connected, like the apart-</p><p>ment houses we had left behind two million </p><p>664 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>years before. But these were of stupendous </p><p>size, and it was quite evident that elevators </p><p>were unnecessary, for any number of people </p><p>rose from the glittering floor of the enclosure </p><p>and apparently without effort, and in defi- </p><p>ance of the laws of gravity, shot up to any </p><p>ledge of apartments they wished to reach. </p><p> “They have conquered gravity,” said</p><p>Brown. “Apparently they use nullifiers. If </p><p>I saw any wings I could explain the mechan- </p><p>ism, but as it is, I rather think they have </p><p>miniature atomic energy devices strapped </p><p>to their backs, which drive them through the </p><p>air.” He adjusted the lens of the camera </p><p>to obtain a clearer focus, and exclaimed, “I </p><p>knew it! You can see they all carry some- </p><p>thing on their backs—something nature </p><p>never put there.*’ </p><p> “And I was right after all!” I joined</p><p>in. “Didn’t I say man would conquer the </p><p>advancing glacial ages? Evidently this glass </p><p>dome is used to protect the people from the </p><p>elements. You can see the snow on parts of </p><p>it. How they get their fresh air I don’t </p><p>know, but it’s a pretty sure thing that human </p><p>beings have learned to conquer the elements. </p><p>I think you’re wrong, Brown. Man will </p><p>never die out!” </p><p> “You think so?” asked Brown. “Well,</p><p>that remains to be seen.” </p><p> CHAPTER II.</p><p> Into the Earth!</p><p>THE words had hardly left his mouth </p><p>when he suddenly put his hand to his </p><p>head, staggered, and fell. At the same mo- </p><p>ment the time machine gave a splintering </p><p>crash and shuddered in every part. </p><p> I sprang to the controls to stop our flight</p><p>through time. There was no need to do so. </p><p>The machine had stopped of its own ac- </p><p>cord. </p><p> From the base of Brown’s skull trickled a</p><p>little stream of blood. Evvidently he had </p><p>been dazed by a sliver of crystal. With my </p><p>medical skill and with my first-aid kit, it </p><p>was a matter of a few moments to restore </p><p>him to consciousness. He sat up and looked </p><p>at me accusingly.</p><p> “We can’t be at the end of our journey,”</p><p>he said. “I might have known better than </p><p>to trust you with the controls. Henceforth </p><p>you will leave the navigating to me, and </p><p>take the controls only after I am killed.” </p><p>He rubbed the back of his head ruefully. </p><p>“A little farther down and you might have </p><p>come to the last men bearing an unusual </p><p>gift—a corpse!” </p><p> The inventor picked himself up and ex-</p><p>amined the controls. “I thought so,” he </p><p>said. “Smashed! ” </p><p> “Does that mean—” I asked, feeling the</p><p>blood leave my extremities and congeal </p><p>around my heart. </p><p> “Does that mean that you are stranded</p><p>out here in time?” mimicked Brown. “No, </p><p>it does not. Your precious skin is safe. It </p><p>means only that I must replace this delicate </p><p>little mechanism with another—and I have </p><p>only two. Thank heaven I exercised my </p><p>usual foresight! Otherwise—but I am sure </p><p>you can imagine the rest for yourself.” </p><p> He opened a locker and from it carefully</p><p>lifted a replica of the damaged control. </p><p>“There is only one left,” he said significant- </p><p>ly, pointing to another in the locker. “You </p><p>will please confine your activities to obser- </p><p>vation, not manipulation.” </p><p> I was too angry to attempt to explain.</p><p>Never in my life did I feel so impelled to </p><p>express myself in blistering profanity. </p><p>Brown’s contemptuous treatment of me—as </p><p>thought I were some specimen of imbecile </p><p>—made me sorrier than ever that I had ac- </p><p>companied him. As the machine shuddered </p><p>on its way I turned my back on him and </p><p>walked to the camera obscura. Once more </p><p>we were hurtling forward through centuries </p><p>unborn, and as the glittering globe tore on- </p><p>ward I gazed again into the future. </p><p> “You will probably notice,” said Brown’s</p><p>mocking voice from behind me, “that the </p><p>earth is growing colder and colder, and that </p><p>the glacial areas are spreading. I am afraid </p><p>we will soon come to the end of all life.” </p><p>I glanced over my shoulder. Brown waa </p><p>not looking into the camera; yet he had </p><p>predicted precisely what was happening be- </p><p>fore my eyes! As I watched I realized thal</p><p>the extinction of human life was inevitable; </p><p>for even the glass cities I had seen could </p><p>no longer protect man from the mortal chill </p><p>THE END OF TIME </p><p>665 </p><p>of a cooling earth and a dying sun. Dying </p><p>the sun might not be; and yet the earth was </p><p>cooling, losing some of the solar heat, giv- </p><p>ing way to eternal ice and perpetual gloom. </p><p>The sun shone down at noon no stronger </p><p>than the moon I had observed. Perhaps, I </p><p>thought, the earth had been drawn from its </p><p>orbit by another body, and was as far from </p><p>the sun as Mars. But whatever the cause, </p><p>the effect was plain. Not a living thing was </p><p>visible. Everywhere ice, gleaming, smooth, </p><p>cold, implacable; nowhere the cheering </p><p>sight of a solitary creature that drew breath. </p><p>Involuntarily I shuddered and turned away. </p><p> “You have stopped for a moment at two</p><p>way stations on our journey,” said Brown, </p><p>with grim and almost inhuman humor, with </p><p>an appalling callousness. “The next stop </p><p>will be the last. Better get your baggage </p><p>ready, because this is as far as we go.” </p><p>“Why,” I almost shouted, “you’re mad! </p><p>“You’re a monster in human form! I wish </p><p>I had never seen you or heard of your in- </p><p>fernal machine! I—.” I stopped. Some- </p><p>thing had happened. The time machine </p><p>cames to rest with a grinding jar. But still </p><p>I felt it moving—in what direction, I could </p><p>not tell. I dashed to the camera and dimmed </p><p>the lights of the car; and before my eyes </p><p>the various strata of the earth seemed to </p><p>pass in rapid, in bewildering procession. </p><p>We seemed to be sinking, down, down, into </p><p>the very bowels of the earth; past the outer </p><p>strata, the deposits of the fern age, the fos- </p><p>silized skeletons of fabulous monsters; </p><p>down, until I noticed a perceptible increase </p><p>in the temperature. Were we heading for </p><p>the center of a dying planet? </p><p> OU didn’t expeot this,” chuckled</p><p>X Brown. “Did it ever occur to you </p><p>that human beings could live inside the </p><p>earth, as well as on its surface? We’ve </p><p>reached the end of life on the earth, my </p><p>friend; we’re on our way to the last rem- </p><p>nants of it beneath the surface. This was </p><p>the best surprise of all,” he continued, un- </p><p>able to restrain his mirth, in spite of the </p><p>horrible things he tossed off so casually. </p><p>“Well—who’s crazy now?” </p><p> “Brown,” I said, my hatred and contempt</p><p>drowned in sheer admiration, “you’re the </p><p>greatest genius the world has ever known— </p><p>but I wish I had never met you, and I wish </p><p>to heaven I had never made this horrible </p><p>journey. The thought of what mankind is </p><p>coming to, the idea that glorious man, with </p><p>all his magnificent achievements, is coming </p><p>to this refuge under the earth, the idea that </p><p>the sun will go out of human life, and that </p><p>only hideous cold and darkness will remain, </p><p>is too much. It will haunt me the rest of </p><p>my days. I would rather be an ignorant </p><p>South Sea Islander, laughing at the sun, </p><p>secure in the knowledge that my descendants </p><p>will laugh in the sun for generations to </p><p>come, than the greatest scientist in the </p><p>world, working on with the realization that </p><p>all my discoveries will come to naught, and </p><p>that everything I do for mankind, and </p><p>everything mankind has ever done, will some </p><p>day disappear in the eternal ice of a dying </p><p>planet.” </p><p> “Bravo!” exclaimed Brown, smiling cyni-</p><p>cally and applauding at the same time. </p><p>“Excellent! And now that you have deliv- </p><p>ered yourself of a sentiment such as the </p><p>world has never heard before, you may as </p><p>well realize that you will have very little </p><p>time to be haunted by anything, least of all </p><p>by an idea of what the world will come to </p><p>in seven million years! Please realize that </p><p>you are at the end this very minute! If </p><p>you don’t live to return to your own world, </p><p>you won’t have to worry about this. And </p><p>what’s gotten into you? I thought you were </p><p>a man of science, an explorer in the ab- </p><p>stract. I’ve been talking this way only </p><p>because it seems you have been metamor- </p><p>phosed into a sentimental fool, rather than </p><p>an alert man of science. Pull yourself to- </p><p>gether—there’s enough to do right now </p><p>without weakening. You were a strong man </p><p>in Atlantis—don’t fail me now!” </p><p> “Oh, so that’s why you acted so strange-</p><p>ly,” I said, rather relieve at his outburst. </p><p>“I was about to ask what had gotten into </p><p>you, to change you so. However—.” .... </p><p>What I was about to say was obvious, but </p><p>I never said it. As we stood facing each </p><p>other, in the midst of the crystal globe, the </p><p>walls of our time machine seemed to melt </p><p>away into invisibility as a red glow all </p><p>around the device grew stronger and </p><p>666 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>stronger; and we found ourselves lookking </p><p>with amazement into a ring of venerable </p><p>faces that gazed at us without surprise and </p><p>without emotion. </p><p> “We have arrived!” exclaimed Brown,</p><p>with his old laugh. And, gripping my arm </p><p>as if to reassure me, he stepped boldly for- </p><p>ward, and drew me after him into the </p><p>enchanted circle. </p><p> “Wait a minute,” I said. “We’ve for-</p><p>gotten the automatics and everything else. </p><p>I don’t fancy going among these ghosts </p><p>empty-handed.” </p><p> “Well, we can’t go back for anything</p><p>now. Don’t forget for a moment this isn’t </p><p>Atlantis; it’s the very opposite; and any </p><p>false move on our part may result very un- </p><p>pleasantly—for us.” </p><p> I oast longing eyes at the atomic disin-</p><p>tegrator; and somehow I didn’t feel com- </p><p>pletely dressed without my holster and its </p><p>deadly black burden. But. a number of </p><p>expressionless pairs of eyes were upon me; </p><p>they seemed peaceful enough, but 1 was </p><p>taking no chances with the advanced science </p><p>of the final product of human evolution. </p><p> Meanwhile, as at Atlantis, the time</p><p>machine had vanished. Had I not known </p><p>from past experience that it was still there, </p><p>invisible, I would have given up all hope </p><p>of ever returning to my own age. Brown, </p><p>apparently oblivious of everything else, </p><p>was studying the quiet figures before him. </p><p>Into my mind flashed a thought which 1 am </p><p>sure was duplicated in his: that these strange </p><p>men were robed very like the ancient Greeks </p><p>and Romans, in the toga; and that the simi- </p><p>larity was heightened by the sandals they </p><p>wore strapped to their feet and ankles. It </p><p>was a most remarkable resemblance. </p><p> “Perhaps we’ve unwittingly gone back to</p><p>the time of Plato,” I whispered to Brown. </p><p>“Or we may be in the presence of Cicero. </p><p>These outfits are pretty familiar.” </p><p> “Nonsense,” he said, sharply. “No Greek</p><p>or Roman ever had a head such as you see </p><p>here.” </p><p> And indeed he was right. No ancient, not</p><p>Aristotle himself, could possibly have pos- </p><p>sessed the cranial development of these </p><p>silent figures. And surely no one, in those </p><p>times of sunlit paganism, appeared so inhu- </p><p>man, so free from passions and desires; no, </p><p>not Plato himself, who is said never even </p><p>to have lost his temper in eighty years of </p><p>life. What was most curious, they had ut- </p><p>tered not a single word since oift arrival. </p><p>As I had remarked to Brown, they were </p><p>more like ghosts than men. </p><p>A World-Weary Race </p><p>AS if reading my thoughts, Brown sudden- </p><p>ly exclaimed: “I have it! They don’t </p><p>ned to talk—they have developed thought </p><p>transference, and by this time they must </p><p>have agreed among themselves as to who </p><p>we are, where we come from, and to what </p><p>species we belong. I feel as though I have </p><p>been catalogued in a dozen different minds.” </p><p> Always a good psychologist, Brown was</p><p>willing to let the other side make the first </p><p>move; and so he simply held up his right </p><p>hand, palm outward, in the universal gesture </p><p>of peace and friendliness. As this was evi- </p><p>dently meant for them, the silent spectators </p><p>raised their own finely moulded hands in a </p><p>similar salute, and then slowly lowered </p><p>them and remained looking at us in the same </p><p>owlish silence. </p><p> I felt tempted to latigh. The situation</p><p>was more than ludicrous—it was a perfect </p><p>comic opera setting. There is nothing that </p><p>can be so disconcerting, and at the same </p><p>time so farcical, as a silent examination by </p><p>a group of total strangers. </p><p> When the silence reached a point beyond</p><p>the power of human beings to endure, I cast </p><p>all discretion to the wind and announced, in </p><p>a ringing voice: “Lafayette, we are here!” </p><p> Brown himself smiled; and an individual</p><p>directly opposite me advanced immediately </p><p>and seized my hand. A curious affinity </p><p>seemed to spring up between us. Travelers </p><p>who had been through India used to tell me </p><p>of the remarkable feats of the Hindu jug- </p><p>glers. Some of these magicians can com- </p><p>municate, by genuine mental telepathy, with </p><p>people hundreds of miles away, and deliver </p><p>messages to them in that manner; but first</p><p>they must be “in sympathy” with them— </p><p>that is, they must have had physical con- </p><p>tact. A clasp of the hand, for example, </p><p>would be sufficient to establish the “rap- </p><p>THE END OF TIME </p><p>667 </p><p>port” between the juggler and the subject. </p><p>So it was with me and this man of the last </p><p>race of men. The moment our hands clasped, </p><p>a subtle electrical connection seemed to be </p><p>established between us; and I felt distinctly </p><p>the influence of an extremely powerful in- </p><p>tellect working on my own. Brown prob- </p><p>ably realized what was going on, but he </p><p>merely watched me; evidently he wished to </p><p>see what would happen before he himself </p><p>submitted to the process. </p><p> Thought images were flowing into my</p><p>mind, clear-cut and unmistakable; and </p><p>though I could not translate them into </p><p>words, I received the unmistakable impres- </p><p>sion that the man looking deep into my eyes </p><p>with ancient, world-weary orbs was offering </p><p>me welcome. I seemed, also, to catch the </p><p>impression that a long wait had come to an </p><p>end, and that Brown and I had appeared on </p><p>the scene in time for something momentous. </p><p> “I think they’re friendly,” I reported to</p><p>Brown, “but don’t try to pose as a god </p><p>again. They wont fall for your bluff.” </p><p> Brown did not notice what I said—or he</p><p>pretended not to. Instead, he displayed once </p><p>more his amazing knowledge of root words, </p><p>as he had done at Atlantis. Apparently he </p><p>was asking a question. The men looked a </p><p>trifle surprised; then one of them clasped </p><p>his hand and it was obvious that my com- </p><p>panion, also, was receiving thought images. </p><p>I saw him nod; then he beckoned to me; and </p><p>Brown and I and the welcoming committee </p><p>moved off in the direction of a powerful </p><p>light. </p><p> “It seems they have been expecting us,”</p><p>said Brown, “and before we go any farther </p><p>they want us to undergo a treatment which </p><p>will purge us of some of the taints of our </p><p>gross twentieth-century bodies. Apparent- </p><p>ly they are afraid we will bring them some </p><p>forgotten disease. I don’t believe there’s </p><p>anything to be afraid of.” </p><p> Brown and I were delivered to the care of</p><p>two attendants arrayed in curious protective </p><p>garments, who conducted us into a small </p><p>chamber in an edifice of some gleaming </p><p>material unknown to me, and shut the door </p><p>on us. Instantly we were conscious of the</p><p>action of powerful, invisible rays. I felt as </p><p>though a mild electric current were run- </p><p>ning through the body. I was filled with a </p><p>sense of exalted physical vitality. The years </p><p>seemed to fall away; it was as though I </p><p>sloughed off my former skin and assumed a </p><p>new one more easily than a snake sheds its </p><p>old coat. As a physician, the process </p><p>aroused my curiosity. Could I but carry </p><p>the secret back with me—that is, if we ever </p><p>found the time machine, which had disap- </p><p>peared—what a wonderful addition it would </p><p>make to the medical lore of the twentieth </p><p>century! </p><p>THEN we were forced to submit to a </p><p>change of attire. I felt ill at ease in </p><p>my fluttering toga; but Brown seemed to </p><p>enjoy the experience, and, when he was </p><p>completely clad in the curious garments, he </p><p>looked remarkably like an Athenian of the </p><p>golden age of Pericles. I had never noticed </p><p>before how finely cut were his features, or </p><p>how imposing the cast of his head. </p><p> “Have you noticed,” asked Brown, “how</p><p>terribly old these men are—how their eyes </p><p>seem to be weary with the weight of cen- </p><p>turies? I think we have fallen among peo- </p><p>ple who realize they are the last men, and </p><p>who have learned to prolong life indefinite- </p><p>ly. One thing I have not noticed—have you </p><p>seen any young person, or persons who </p><p>might, by a stretch, of the imagination be </p><p>considered young?” </p><p> “No, I haven’t,” I answered. “We seem</p><p>to have come down to a race which exists </p><p>in a state of senile decay. In Atlantis there </p><p>was youth, and beauty, and strife, and </p><p>hatred, and war. This place reminds me of </p><p>the more repulsive ideas of heaven I ac- </p><p>quired many years ago. Every inhabitant </p><p>of that blessed abode was venerable and </p><p>saintly, but unless I’m very much mistaken, </p><p>these old men are the very opposite of </p><p>saintly. They eyed me as I myself might </p><p>eye a culture of scarlet fever germs. And </p><p>in more than one world-weary eye, as you </p><p>term it, I rather think I detected a glitter </p><p>which reminded me of a cat looking at a </p><p>mouse.” </p><p> “I got the same impression,” agreed</p><p>Brown, “but we must never allow them to </p><p>realize that we know more of their charac- </p><p>ters—if they have any—than we did before</p><p>668 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>we landed. Our best bet is to act gullible </p><p>and innocent. Now that I’ve seen what the </p><p>last men will look like, I want to find out </p><p>just a little more about them before we go </p><p>back.” </p><p> “If we ever get that far,” I amended.</p><p>“And if we ever find the time machine </p><p>again.” </p><p> Brown suddenly smote his forehead. “By</p><p>Jove! I thought I had forgotten something! </p><p>They surrounded us so suddenly I didn’t </p><p>have a chance to mark the place! I laid </p><p>stones in front of the machine in Atlantis. </p><p>As far as I know, 1 didn’t mark the spot </p><p>here at all.” </p><p> As Brown spoke, I felt myself growing</p><p>pale. And while he realized the seriousness </p><p>of our situation as well as I did, it was </p><p>not his custom to give way to qualms and </p><p>quakings. “We may find it again,” he con- </p><p>tinued. “I have a pretty good idea where </p><p>we left it, but of course, most places look </p><p>alike down here. We may not need the </p><p>weapons, but how will we ever get back to </p><p>where we came from?” </p><p> “Perhaps we can live here forever and</p><p>let time catch up with us,” I ventured. “I </p><p>am convinced those rays are used to increase </p><p>the life-span. I should say that the fel- </p><p>lows we have seen are centuries old—each </p><p>one of them.” </p><p> “Very probable,” said Brown. “They</p><p>remind me of changelings. You remember </p><p>the story of the Irish woman whose infant </p><p>was stolen by the fairies—Irish mythology </p><p>is full of them. In place of the human </p><p>child they left a fairy changeling which </p><p>was its exact double. But the mother knew </p><p>at once what it was simply because, out of </p><p>its innocent face, looked malicious eyes that </p><p>burned with the knowledge of fifteen centur- </p><p>ies. Well, that’s how our new friends ap- </p><p>pear to me. Their faces are innocent, but </p><p>their eyes give them away. I wouldn’t be </p><p>surprised if they tried to experiment on us, </p><p>just as we use frogs for vivisection.” </p><p>CHAPTER III. </p><p>The Intercepted Message</p><p>OUR two attendants approached and </p><p>Brown addressed them in English. </p><p>They continued to stare, and he tried the </p><p>other European languages with equal fail- </p><p>ure. Then he went back to his root words, </p><p>the same he had used at Atlantis, and I de- </p><p>tected a glimmer of recognition in the deep- </p><p>set, tired eyes. </p><p> “You notice,” said Brown to me, “that</p><p>the fundamentals of language scarcely ever </p><p>change.” And, just as he had spoken to </p><p>the men of the lost continent, so now he </p><p>spoke to the survivors of the last race. As </p><p>we walked toward what was apparently the </p><p>council chamber of this underground race, </p><p>he talked easily and surely with the amazed </p><p>centenarians, whose answers, in low, flat </p><p>monotones, seemed to please him immense- </p><p>ly. I gathered from what he let drop at </p><p>intervals that speech was not their usual </p><p>method of communication, as they had de- </p><p>veloped thought transference to a degree </p><p>unthought of in backward times like our </p><p>own. </p><p> “I was right, after all,” said Brown, be-</p><p>tween pauses. “It seems they have been </p><p>expecting our arrival. I presume they, too, </p><p>have mastered the mysteries of time. When </p><p>the glacial age became so destructive to life </p><p>—in spite of their cities of glass—the more </p><p>enterprising members of the human race, </p><p>with untold centuries of science at their </p><p>command, turned to their last refuge. </p><p>Some of them ventured to other planets— </p><p>some to Venus, some to Mercury; but they </p><p>were never heard from, and the great mass </p><p>of the people were compelled, through </p><p>force of circumstances, to follow the lead </p><p>of their greatest scientists and delve beneath </p><p>the earth for their only certain shelter </p><p>against the advancing age of ice. We may </p><p>hear a great deal more a little later. I </p><p>have my own theory as to how they got here, </p><p>how they live, and how old they really are. </p><p>But one thing I cannot understand—why </p><p>they should act as though they were expect- </p><p>ing us, and why they should be so unusual- </p><p>ly happy to see us. It seems to me as </p><p>though they were waiting for someone to </p><p>pul to their own uses.” </p><p> The council chamber, if that is what it</p><p>was, looked like any other immense room— </p><p>except that it was equipped with devices f</p><p>had never seen before; that it had an arti- </p><p>THE END OF TIME </p><p>669 </p><p>ficial heaven, in which glittered stars so </p><p>realistic I had to rub my eyes before I real- </p><p>ized we were not in the open air above the </p><p>earth at night; and that at one end was an </p><p>enormous astronomical device, something </p><p>like the planetarium I had seen in Chicago </p><p>in my own lime. Through this I was to </p><p>learn later that the earth had changed its </p><p>course, and that the stars, constellations, </p><p>and planets were not where I had been ac- </p><p>customed to look for them. </p><p> Some had changed their places entirely—</p><p>that magnificent spectacle known as the </p><p>Southern Cross was one of them—and oth- </p><p>ers were obviously on their way to oblivion. </p><p>I do not say the stars were dying; but per- </p><p>haps the erratic course of the earth made </p><p>il impossible for them to be seen. </p><p> More astounding still, the windows of the</p><p>room looked forth on what appeared to be </p><p>a wonderful garden of tropical foliage. It </p><p>was more than a garden; it looked like a </p><p>tiny jungle, with the trees and the flowers </p><p>gone wild. I fancied the palms were stir- </p><p>red by a gentle breeze. But I felt sure that </p><p>this vision was, like the starry heaven, an </p><p>illusion. I did not believe it possible that </p><p>any sort of plant life had survived the sub- </p><p>arctic cold of the earth’s surface. I was </p><p>ready to admit that this world underground </p><p>had ample light and moist, balmy air, all </p><p>under perfect control, it appeared; but I </p><p>saw here a flat contradiction to the science </p><p>of my own day, which assumed that the low- </p><p>er orders of life could endure longer than </p><p>the higher. </p><p> The entire display, I felt, was for artistic</p><p>reasons; a nostalgia for the ancient heritage </p><p>of man, lost long ago; the sun, the skies, </p><p>the pure air, the winds, the seas, the sweet </p><p>smell of young grass and budding flowers. </p><p>And yet I knew these things had been den- </p><p>ied them time out of mind; and again I won- </p><p>dered by how many centuries each man </p><p>reckoned his age. </p><p>MEANWHILE Brown, as spokesman for </p><p>the adventurers of a backward age (as </p><p>the venerable inquisitors termed us) was </p><p>speaking familiarly to the most impressive </p><p>specimen of humanity I have ever seen. The </p><p>ancient root words stood him in good stead;</p><p>and where his language failed he seized the </p><p>other’s hand and they understood each oth- </p><p>er perfectly at once. Brown was so ab- </p><p>sorbed in his conversation that I deemed it </p><p>wise to keep myself in the background; and </p><p>after almost a half hour of palaver, dur- </p><p>ing which the leader and several of his com- </p><p>panions had addressed themselves to the </p><p>time wizard, I saw Brown suddenly seize the </p><p>right hand of the chief, and the left hand </p><p>of the man who sat next to him. </p><p> I was mystified, and drew nearer my</p><p>companion to be with him in case of troub- </p><p>le, allhough, unarmed as I was, my aid </p><p>would have been in vain. Brown still re- </p><p>tained the hands of these two men; and as </p><p>he spoke, uttering words that he seemed to </p><p>have memorized, I saw a look of amazement </p><p>cross his face, and then a frown of perplex- </p><p>ity‘ </p><p> The magnificent brows of the last men</p><p>gleamed in the soft, cold light; their amaz- </p><p>ingly large crania, covered with silvery </p><p>hair, nodded slowly and impressively at </p><p>every pause. And still Brown held the </p><p>hands of the two men as he talked into the </p><p>air. These two seemed not to be listening </p><p>to him, whereas ihe others appeared to pay </p><p>attention. </p><p> As Brown stopped speaking—for lack of</p><p>anything further to say, I imagine—the con- </p><p>clave rose. He dropped the'hands he was </p><p>holding and stepped back to where I had </p><p>remained. “The plot thickens,” he an- </p><p>nounced laconically. “These fossils are not </p><p>as saintly as they look—not by a long shot. </p><p>I rather admire fcheir brains, though.” </p><p> “What were you telling them?” I asked.</p><p> “Oh, the usual thing—that I come from</p><p>another age, millions of years back—which </p><p>they understand perfectly. They have been </p><p>expecting someone for centuries, and they </p><p>are surprised no one came before this, in </p><p>view of the fact that they themselves know </p><p>so much about time travel. When I asked </p><p>them why they didn’t travel back to a </p><p>warmer age, they declared that, while they </p><p>knew it was quite possible, their time expert </p><p>had departed this life, and they confessed </p><p>frankly that, with all their millions of years </p><p>of science and with all their tremendous </p><p>brain power, they were incapable of con-</p><p>670 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>atructing an apparatus which would take </p><p>them all to a milder period of history. </p><p>Quite a compliment for me, I think.” </p><p>“You should be flattered,” I answered. </p><p>“Did you offer the use of your own ma- </p><p>chine?” </p><p> “Am I insane?” asked Brown. “I want</p><p>to get back some time myself—I want them </p><p>to forget all about my own invention. They </p><p>may decide to keep me here to build one for </p><p>them, and I don’t think I can do it.” </p><p> “Then why did you suddenly become so</p><p>affectionate as to grasp the hands of those </p><p>two old fellows?” </p><p> “Ah,” said Brown, with satisfaction. “This</p><p>time I have put one over on them. I told </p><p>them that I was honored beyond words to </p><p>be the first to grasp the hands of the two </p><p>leaders of a race so advanced. You may </p><p>have noticed that I recited something I had </p><p>memorized. And you may also have noticed </p><p>that they paid very little attention to me. </p><p>Allowing me to hold their hands was an act </p><p>of diplomacy on their part. I must find </p><p>other occasions for hand-holding. It’s too </p><p>bad there aren’t any pretty girls here. I </p><p>might have a legitimate excuse if there </p><p>were.” </p><p> “That reminds me,” I said. “I haven’t</p><p>seen any women.” </p><p> “Oh, they probably exist,” said Brown.</p><p>“But what I learned is of more importance. </p><p>You know they communicate by telepathy, </p><p>which in this place is an art and a science. </p><p>Well, holding the hands of both of them, </p><p>1 intercepted their messages! And all the </p><p>time they were pretending to listen to me, </p><p>they were in reality deciding that you and </p><p>I were to go on a long journey to some </p><p>other race in this underground world—and </p><p>unless I am very much mistaken, we are to </p><p>go as hostages for something!” </p><p> “Hostages?”</p><p> “I only think so,” said Brown. “We will</p><p>find out very shortly. I have an idea I can </p><p>worm some information from one of our </p><p>guides. I will ask them to take me on a </p><p>tour of the place, and if I find out what I</p><p>imagine I’ll find out—that is, unless they </p><p>are too wary for me—then I’ll know that </p><p>I’m not making any mistake.” </p><p> I found I was growing sleepy, and Brown,</p><p>too, was wearied by the events of our jour- </p><p>ney. But nowhere in the spacious halls did </p><p>we find anything approximating a bed. </p><p>Brown soon learned from the attendants that </p><p>sleep had been mastered thousands of years </p><p>before, and that the last men required none </p><p>of it. I suppose their ray treatments re* </p><p>moved the poisons of fatigue. At any rate, </p><p>Brown and I stretched out in the most con* </p><p>venient spot, and our guides, understanding </p><p>perfectly what troubled us, withdrew and </p><p>left us to our slumbers. </p><p>A Struggle For Existence </p><p>THE next morning—I call it morning </p><p>simply because I’m used to it, although </p><p>there was neither night nor aay in that </p><p>phantom land—we were fed on capsules </p><p>containing high-powered food content. I </p><p>discovered that our hosts ate on an an aver- </p><p>age of twice a week, and as a physician I </p><p>could understand the state to which they </p><p>had brought themselves. </p><p> On our tour of inspection—on which</p><p>Brown had insisted— my companion spoke </p><p>easily and carelessly to the guides, leaving </p><p>me to take my notes alone. And everywhere </p><p>was ample evidence of the wonderful mind </p><p>of man. The atmosphere was supplied as </p><p>1	had imagined—vast pumps, of a size and</p><p>structure unknown in my own day, drew </p><p>in the clean, cold, air at one opening in the </p><p>earth’s surface and expelled it at another </p><p>under high pressure. Everywhere the il- </p><p>lusion was preserved that the inhabitants of </p><p>Ultima—as Brown termed it—were walk- </p><p>ing on the surface of the planet. </p><p> The earth enclosure was artfully dis-</p><p>guised, giving the illusion of vast distance, </p><p>even to the mirage of a horizon line, with </p><p>trees and buildings standing out against the </p><p>sky. How much labor must have been ex- </p><p>pended in the construction of this under- </p><p>ground world staggered the imagination. I </p><p>understood, however, the motive for all this: </p><p>The last men, realizing that their hour had </p><p>come, had devoted themselves to work, as </p><p>the only means of keeping alive their spirit,</p><p>the the only salvation from the maddening </p><p>realization that with them the human race, </p><p>the pride of the universe, had reached its </p><p>THE END OF TIME </p><p>671 </p><p>last representatives. And so these inhabi- </p><p>tants of a plate which never knew the sun, </p><p>fabricated for themselves cold light from </p><p>myriad sources which replaced the blessed </p><p>light to which I was accustomed; and in </p><p>their planetaria they set suns which never </p><p>ceased to throw their light on the surround- </p><p>ing planets. </p><p> The broad streets, designed obviously for</p><p>air space, were almost deserted, in spite of </p><p>the fact that once a populous race must have </p><p>passed over them; people who walked from </p><p>these thoroughfares into tunnels for quick </p><p>transportation to other parts of the city. </p><p>Evidently the last men had returned to the </p><p>realization that walking was not an evil </p><p>unmodified; for they encouraged this mild </p><p>exercise on every occasion, and reserved in- </p><p>credibly swift mechanical transportation for </p><p>long distances. Yes, the race was shrink- </p><p>ing; for while I saw aged countenances </p><p>everywhere, the faces of men who outlived </p><p>Methuselah, nowhere did I see the erect </p><p>figures and the radiant countenances that de- </p><p>noted youth. </p><p> Brown, observing all this, shook his head</p><p>sadly. “It’s a pity,” he repeated, again and </p><p>again. “It seems they are unable to repro- </p><p>duce. A race of young men, with the scien- </p><p>tific knowledge of their ancestors, could yet </p><p>make this planet the proud home of man.” </p><p>“Have you discovered anything?” I asked. </p><p>“Anything that concerns us, I mean?” </p><p>“Nothing that concerns us directly,” he </p><p>answered. “But I am putting two and two </p><p>together, and I rather imagine the result </p><p>will be four. I have learned that there is </p><p>another race living underground here—on </p><p>the other side of the planet, as far away as </p><p>possible from this one; an inferior race, </p><p>regarded with contempt by the people </p><p>among whom we have fallen; but a race </p><p>which, of course, is far ahead of our own. </p><p>These people, whom we have never seen, </p><p>outnumber our kind hosts ten to one, and </p><p>as far as I can gather, there is no love lost </p><p>between them.” </p><p> “Why can’t they live together in amity?”</p><p>1	asked. “1 should think that at the end</p><p>of the world, all personal enmities would </p><p>be forgotten in the struggle to maintain the</p><p>race of man on or in the planet as long as </p><p>possible. Why should there be any hostil- </p><p>ity between the last two races of man?” </p><p> “Why?” echoed Brown. “Well, I admit</p><p>there shouldn’t be. One would think the </p><p>brotherhood of man would reach its highest </p><p>point now, if ever. But I adhere to my </p><p>cycle theory. I believe that as the circle </p><p>closes, as the last point on the circle moves </p><p>toward the first, differences are swept away, </p><p>and the last men become like the first. Oh, </p><p>J don’t mean primitive; I mean that in spite </p><p>of all the science of the ages, the essential </p><p>nature of man has not changed, sad to say; </p><p>and while all men may have been brothers </p><p>a couple of million years ago, the spirit of </p><p>nationalism—call it that for want of a bet- </p><p>ter name—is still rampant. </p><p> “The superior race, instead of aiding and</p><p>uplifting the inferior, despises it; the infer- </p><p>ior race instead of trying to imitate the </p><p>other, instead of working its way into its </p><p>good graces, merely hates and fears. And </p><p>so it stands. The same old situation all over </p><p>again, from the moment one man showed his </p><p>superiority over another—the same old en- </p><p>mity that existed between the Neanderthals </p><p>and the Cro-Magnons. I think my cycle </p><p>theory is right.” </p><p>THE guides were beckoning to us again. </p><p>“Drop behind,” ordered Brown. “I’ve </p><p>got to discover some more al)out our unseen </p><p>friends on the other side of the world.” </p><p> I	walked slowly after him, trying to ap-</p><p>pear indifferent to what he was saying. My </p><p>own attempts at conversation were carried </p><p>on by telepathy, which was quite easy as </p><p>long as I held the hand of the guide. I must </p><p>have cut a ridiculous figure, walking hand- </p><p>in-hand with this patriarch, like a child with </p><p>its nurse. </p><p> After showing us around the outward bat-</p><p>tlements of the city, our guides escorted </p><p>us to a building which seemed to contain </p><p>nothing but elevators. We shot up at dizzy </p><p>speed—miles, it seemed,—and emerged into </p><p>the most splendidly-equipped observatory </p><p>the human mind can imagine. The elevator </p><p>had been run through a mountain peak, and </p><p>this observatory, high above the surface of </p><p>the earth, was the last point of contact with </p><p>the outer world.</p><p>672 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p> Here a few fortunates, protected from the</p><p>intense cold by a great dome of crystal, so </p><p>vast that the giant telescopes worked with- </p><p>in it, and so clear that visibility was not </p><p>interfered with in the least, surveyed the </p><p>heavens. Instruments unheard of in my time </p><p>noted and recorded the slightest variations </p><p>in sidereal and stellar motions. For cen- </p><p>turies this system had produced the most </p><p>complete and minutely accurate system of </p><p>star maps in existence; and so powerful </p><p>were the telescopes that these men of the </p><p>future had been able to study animate life </p><p>on the nearest planets. </p><p> Mars, I noted, had sustained life of a</p><p>high order long past my time-dimension. </p><p>Venus supported a limited life cycle of a </p><p>low type. But at the time I saw these charts, </p><p>Mercury, the only planet suitable for any- </p><p>thing like human habitation, in view of the </p><p>waning' powers of the sun, had developed a </p><p>system of life and evolution similar to what </p><p>we know of the beginning of life on the </p><p>earth. </p><p> Ten planets were listed in all—eight of</p><p>which I had known; one had been discovered </p><p>in my life-time; and as for the one unknown </p><p>to me, I could not doubt its existence. It </p><p>was to this observatory and its calculations </p><p>that the planetaria beneath the earth’s sur- </p><p>face owed their superhuman accuracy. At </p><p>any period, the marvellous mechanisms </p><p>miles beneath this mountain-top contained </p><p>exact replicas of what the astronomers re- </p><p>corded. Wireless telephony, television, and </p><p>mental telepathy all combined to keep the </p><p>lower astronomical stations accurate to the </p><p>fraction of a minute. Through these record- </p><p>ings, also, I learned that my old friend the </p><p>North Star no longer occupied his place as </p><p>a cardinal point, but that he had been re- </p><p>placed millions of years before by another </p><p>sun. </p><p> “What is the use of all this?” I asked</p><p>Brown. “With the exception of the astron- </p><p>omers no one here ever sees the stars. Why, </p><p>then, all this trouble to map the heavens </p><p>day after day, when the race is dying off?” </p><p> “The will to live, probably,” said Brown.</p><p>“Even though they know the race is dying </p><p>off, they still remain men, proud to the</p><p>last But they have one hope—they have a </p><p> means to continue the race, if only they can</p><p>lay hands on—or rather, if they can get </p><p>enough of—a radioactive substance of un- </p><p>usual properties—a substance of which I </p><p>never heard before.” </p><p> “How can they use this to reproduce?”</p><p>“Well, as I see it,” answered Brown, “their </p><p>females are too old and too sterile—through </p><p>long habit—to be of any use in that respect; </p><p>and as you saw, the men themselves are en- </p><p>tirely too aged. But for centuries they used </p><p>ectogenesis*—and this substance will either </p><p>fertilize the females, unattractive as they </p><p>are, or else it will react on, let us say, a </p><p>uterus which has been separated from the </p><p>body. In either case the result will be the </p><p>same.” </p><p> “I heard something about that back in our</p><p>own time,” I answered thoughtfully, “but </p><p>as a physician I could never understand how </p><p>the offspring could develop away from the </p><p>mother’s body—without the necessary blood </p><p>stream to nourish it.” </p><p> “Apparently things have developed in</p><p>medicine since your time,” said Brown. </p><p>“But the important thing—as far as we are </p><p>concerned—is something else, something </p><p>only remotely connected with this method </p><p>of producing life. What I have discovered </p><p>is that this radioactive element is used to </p><p>manufacture the food capsules, and that </p><p>only a certain amount of it is allowed for </p><p>food and for use in the ray treatments.” </p><p>“What do ycra mean by ‘allowed’?” I </p><p>queried. “Who can say how much or how </p><p>little shall be taken?” </p><p> “Have you forgotten the other race I told</p><p>you of?” asked Brown, with his irritating </p><p>smile. “It appears that this radioactive de- </p><p>posit, while very large, and consisting of </p><p>something I never heard of—Something in- </p><p>deed discovered only a thousand centuries </p><p>ago—is the last of its kind in the earth. </p><p>The Plutonic regions have been pretty well </p><p>searched, and this is the last source of life. </p><p>Well, the hostile race is afraid that if our </p><p>old friends get an oversupply of this ele- </p><p>ment, they will fertilize their females, or </p><p>produce offspring in the other way I men- </p><p>tioned, and that will be directly contrary to </p><p>•A Method of breeding children apart from the</p><p>body of the mother. </p><p>THE END OF TIME </p><p>673 </p><p>their interest. Yon see, like all inferior </p><p>races, the one I am speaking of fears an in- </p><p>crease in the superior race. They are </p><p>afraid—needlessly, perhaps,—that with an </p><p>increase in the population,, the greater race </p><p>will fall upon them and exterminate them, </p><p>taking for itself the radioactive deposits </p><p>which are vital to both races. Even here </p><p>the law of the primitive holds good. Self- </p><p>preservation is said to be the first law of </p><p>nature. Apparently, it is also the last.” </p><p>“And you say this alien race outnumbers </p><p>the greater at least ten to one?” </p><p> Brown nodded.</p><p> “Then it requires ten times the amount</p><p>of the element that this one requires?” </p><p>“Your reasoning,” said Browrn, “would </p><p>do credit to a Newton. “Such, indeed, is </p><p>the case.” </p><p> “Then why doesn’t this lower species ex-</p><p>terminate the higher and keep all the miner- </p><p>al for itself?” </p><p> “Ah,” said Brown, “there you have it.</p><p>Our friends run the earth—what is left of </p><p>it. Without their science, I doubt whether </p><p>the other race would survive very long. Our </p><p>guide has informed me that we are going </p><p>to see something more wonderful still. I </p><p>imagine that the scientific work done here </p><p>keeps their enemies from falling on them. </p><p>As far as I can judge, the matter was fought </p><p>out not very long ago—only a few centuries </p><p>ago—and both sides realize the futility of </p><p>further loss of life. The superior weapons </p><p>of this side just about balance the superior </p><p>number on the other. A sort of armed neu- </p><p>trality exists. An increase in the population </p><p>here would mean war, and the final destruc- </p><p>tion of one side or the other. And so the </p><p>circle goes, one point leading to another, </p><p>and all leading back to the beginning.” </p><p> “But where do we come in to act as host-</p><p>ages, as you said?” </p><p> “That,” said Brown, “I haven’t thought</p><p>out yet, but I have a pretty good idea. I’ll </p><p>know it before long.” </p><p>CHAPTER IV. </p><p>Hostages!</p><p>ON our way down in the elevator I </p><p>thought it prudent to change the sub- </p><p>ject. Wherever I went, I felt the cold eyes </p><p>of my guide upon me. It was as though he </p><p>were looking through me into my inmost </p><p>being. </p><p> “Did you notice the two planets with rings</p><p>around them?” I asked Brown, as we shot </p><p>earthward. </p><p> “Yes,” he answered, “and one of them is</p><p>the earth! At this moment the earth has a </p><p>ling like Saturn, and the moon has vanished </p><p>from the heavens. You probably know that </p><p>the moon receded from the earth, and then </p><p>approached it, and that at a critical point </p><p>the gravity of the earth and the gravity of </p><p>the sun, acting upon it, split it apart, and </p><p>its fragments formed an orbit around this </p><p>planet. Shapley was right, after all.” </p><p> The elevator had reached the underworld;</p><p>but instead of stopping, it continued down- </p><p>ward, until the heat became almost unbear- </p><p>able. And there, perhaps, was the ultimate </p><p>achievement of man, the tapping of the incal- </p><p>culable supply of heat still remaining in the </p><p>depths of the earthcore. What had been a </p><p>great dream in my own day was an every- </p><p>day reality here. In an enormous cavern </p><p>illuminated with cold light—a cavern be- </p><p>yond the black confines of which red tongues </p><p>of flame writhed and roared as they had in </p><p>the imagination of Dante—gigantic, pol- </p><p>ished, engines throbbed to the terrific power </p><p>pulsing, even then, through the,center of the </p><p>icy planet. What a contrast! </p><p> What purpose the power generated was</p><p>put to, I did not imagine at the moment, </p><p>unless it was for driving the vast air pumps </p><p>and for assisting in the manufacture of the </p><p>artificial, moistened, atmosphere. But I </p><p>noted that whatever work was necessary was </p><p>performed by robots of superbly ingenious </p><p>construction, working in heat which no hu- </p><p>man being could long endure. And then </p><p>we were shown one of the most amazing </p><p>feats of engineering in the entire under- </p><p>ground world. It seemed incredible that </p><p>Brown could be talking of his own unim- </p><p>portant affairs when he viewed the magni- </p><p>ficence of the achievements of the last men. </p><p> I	had long known that the earth, as it</p><p>rushed through space, generated millions of </p><p>volts of electrical power, and that this power </p><p>flowed around it in a great stream. To har- </p><p>ness this intangible and yet tremendous </p><p>674 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>force would have seemed out of the ques- </p><p>tion; and yet, as their supreme achievement, </p><p>the last men had done just that. </p><p> Brown and I were shown seven immense</p><p>helices of tightly wound wire that extended </p><p>upward, it seemed, for an infinite distance. </p><p>These were the bases of seven mighty hills </p><p>that, in happier days, had been wrapped in </p><p>the copper coils—wires of a nature to excite </p><p>the magnetic fields induced by the fields of </p><p>the sun. That immense and perfect dynamo, </p><p>the earth, the nearest approximation to per- </p><p>petual motion, had been harnessed to keep </p><p>alive the men who had vanished from its </p><p>surface. The incalculable electrical energy </p><p>derivd from the rotation of the earth was </p><p>put to working the machines that tapped the </p><p>earth’s heat, and these, in turn, giving power </p><p>to so many other devices, in reality made </p><p>life possible. And so at the very end, man </p><p>had cheated the earth which had cheated </p><p>him of life on its surface my making its </p><p>very vitals serve his needs. One thing alone </p><p>he could not do—and that was reproduce his </p><p>own kind. The most elementary function of </p><p>nature he could not perform! </p><p> When Brown and I returned to the coun-</p><p>cil chamber, we were informed that our </p><p>education was not yet complete; that we </p><p>were to take a journey to the people on the </p><p>other side of the world, and that we would </p><p>remain there for some time. Brown winked </p><p>at me. I began to get the drift of the ar- </p><p>rangement. </p><p> As I understood from what Brown trans-</p><p>lated for me, we were to be shot through a </p><p>long, straight tunnel in a magnetic car </p><p>drawn forward with incredible rapidity, by </p><p>powerful electric currents. Although the </p><p>world under ground had been pretty well </p><p>hollowed out, making it possible for one </p><p>race to attack another in deadly combat, </p><p>rapid transportation was still carried on </p><p>through tunnels. I understood that one tun- </p><p>nel led directly to the deposit of radioactive </p><p>material, and that at regular intervals both </p><p>races sent out cars for supplies. These </p><p>times were agreed upon in advance; and as </p><p>an evidence of the absolute trust the last </p><p>two races of men reposed in each other, the </p><p>deposit was protected by an array of photo- </p><p>electric cells and television devices, making</p><p>it impossible for one party to carry away </p><p>the element without the other knowing of </p><p>it. This, then, was what prevented my hosts </p><p>from stealing enough of the mineral to cause </p><p>reproduction. But something told me that </p><p>was not enough. </p><p>&lt;£T see it all now,” said Brown, “and I </p><p>A must say it’s devilishly clever. Our old </p><p>people here must send two of their members </p><p>every period as hostages, with the under- </p><p>standing that if they try to abstract any </p><p>of the stuff, the hostages will be put to </p><p>death. The old Roman idea all over again. </p><p>The only reason they don’t go back on these </p><p>two victims is that human life here is so </p><p>terribly precious, it isn’t worth the risk to </p><p>cause the death of a great scientist simply </p><p>to bring about the birth of a lot of potential </p><p>scientists.” </p><p> “Then that means . . . .” I began.</p><p>“Exactly,” said Brown. “With these robes, </p><p>and with the benefit of the ray treatments, </p><p>we resemble them to an amazing degree. </p><p>These enemies of theirs will never know the </p><p>difference. Our good friends can steal all </p><p>the stuff they want, and you and I will pay </p><p>the price! Capital! I wonder whether that </p><p>was why they welcomed us so eagerly!” </p><p>“This is what comes,” I said bitterly, “of </p><p>trying to put your wits against creatures </p><p>millions of years in advance of you. What </p><p>are we to do now? We can’t escape to the </p><p>time machine because we don’t know where </p><p>it is; and even if we did know, I doubt </p><p>whether we could get away. I never dream- </p><p>ed that I was to die seven million years after </p><p>my time!” </p><p> “Oh, I’ll find a way out,” said Brown</p><p>easily, with superb self-confidence. “It </p><p>would be easy enough if we had our weap- </p><p>ons, but this adds a little more fun to the </p><p>adventure. Imagine escaping from the fu- </p><p>ture and returning to the past!” </p><p> “You’re only saying this to keep up my</p><p>spirits,” I answered, gloomily. “You don’t </p><p>believe it yourself.” </p><p>“I don’t, eh?” asked Brown, with his con- </p><p>temptuous smile. “Then look at this!” </p><p>From beneath the folds of his toga he </p><p>drew a long sliver of crystal, strong as steel </p><p>and sharp as a needle. “You don’t think I </p><p>THE END OF TIME </p><p>675 </p><p>let myself go unprepared, do you?” he </p><p>v eered. ltThose who accompany us are </p><p>I ing to get the surprise of their lives. I </p><p>c n't suppose anyone has been stabbed down </p><p>fy-re for ages, but I intend to introduce an </p><p>it novation.” </p><p> “Put it away,” 1 ordered, looking hastily</p><p>around. “You won’t gel anywhere with </p><p>t/iat. You haven’t a chance in the world.” </p><p>“Now you listen to me,” said Brown, “and </p><p>listen closely. “When we get in that car </p><p>we're as good as dead, unless we can con- </p><p>vince. the people at the other end of the </p><p>♦•arth who we are, and what sort of a trick </p><p>being played on them. 1 have an idea </p><p>that they’re not such a bad sort after all. </p><p>But I don’t want to do that. I’ve seen as </p><p>much of the last men as 1 want to, and I’m </p><p>Mtisfied. I don’t mind not seeing the other </p><p>race—I can imagine what it’s like. My only </p><p>desire is to get back to our own century, </p><p>and I’ll get back there if I have to kill off </p><p>every man in Ultima!” </p><p> Already our diplomatic hosts were ap-</p><p>proaching us, laden with curious objects. </p><p>“Timeo Danaos el dona ferentes,” chuckled </p><p>Brown. </p><p> “What?” I asked.</p><p> “Don’t you remember your Latin?” asked</p><p>Brown, in amusement. “I fear the Greeks— </p><p>even when they come bearing gifts.’ If these </p><p>fellows don’t look like Greeks bearing gifts, </p><p>then I don’t know anything. If they were </p><p>besieging a town, I would expect to see a </p><p>wooden horse!” </p><p> Our ancient friends led us to the mouth</p><p>of a large tunnel, and indicated to us a </p><p>curiously shaped car, completely enclosed </p><p>on top by a covering of crystal, which re- </p><p>minded me faintly of the torpedo-shaped </p><p>racing cars favored by Barney Oldfield, of </p><p>revered memory. The car stood on a shin- </p><p>ing metal track, like a monorail affair. It </p><p>was apparent that a large wheel beneath the </p><p>center of the vehicle was the only means of </p><p>propelling it; and while I sought for a </p><p>rocket attachment, I saw none. </p><p>ALREADY two of the Ultimates had </p><p>taken their places in the machine.</p><p>Brown and I, in the face of a score of an- </p><p>cients, who looked remarkably vigorous </p><p>for their age, and who undoubtedly had </p><p>weapons concealed under their flowing </p><p>robes, thought it the part of wisdom to en- </p><p>ter also. Into our hands they thrust cur- </p><p>ious vessels of a metal like beaten gold— </p><p>probably peace offerings to distinguish the </p><p>hostages from their conductors. </p><p> Brown, sitting next to one of the guides,</p><p>watched intently as his companion pressed </p><p>down a lever. The car seemed to spring </p><p>forward. There was none of the backward </p><p>pull of inertia, in spite of the fact that the </p><p>pull of gravity was greater, because we </p><p>were closer to the center of the earth than </p><p>are the trains of my own generation. I </p><p>could not realize the speed at which we </p><p>were traveling; first, becausc there was no </p><p>noise, second because there was no vibra- </p><p>tion, and third because, whenever I looked </p><p>through the windows, the blackness outside </p><p>remained uniform—I could see nothing </p><p>rushing past. The car, I judged, was bal- </p><p>anced by gyroscopic control which derived </p><p>its power from the track. </p><p> I began speaking to Brown in the most</p><p>natural way in the world, taking care not </p><p>to touch my guide, and hoping I would not </p><p>be understood. </p><p> “Suppose we overpower these two birds</p><p>and make them take our places?” I asked. </p><p>“Then we could bring 'the car back our- </p><p>selves with some sort of story.” </p><p> “I thought of that,” said Brown, “but I</p><p>have a better plan. I don’t think I can </p><p>get the other people to attack our friends; </p><p>they wouldn’t believe me, and they would </p><p>only imagine I was drawing them into a </p><p>trap. With men of superior intellect it </p><p>doesn’t pay to attempt ordinary means. I </p><p>want to get hold of some of the weapons </p><p>our hosts have hidden, and I think I know </p><p>a way to do it. This isn’t Atlantis, don’t </p><p>forget; here it’s brain against brain, and </p><p>mine is the second best, by a long shot.” </p><p> I remained silent, and Brown engaged his</p><p>companion in conversation, pressing one </p><p>line of questions. The other stooped and </p><p>drew from beneath the seat two peculiar </p><p>objects. I had never seen their like be- </p><p>fore, except in museums. They resembled</p><p>nothing so much as the corselets the knights </p><p>676 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>used to wear when they went forth to kill </p><p>dragons and to knock their opponents from </p><p>their horses. But I knew very well that </p><p>these devices were something different. </p><p>Brown seemed to be intensely interested; </p><p>he toyed with it, examined it, and finally </p><p>tried it on. It covered him from throat to </p><p>waist. </p><p> “This is used to ward off the peculiar</p><p>bullets they use down here,” he explained </p><p>to me. “It will be handy to have around </p><p>when things start popping. I understand </p><p>that our not-so-distant enemies have weap- </p><p>ons like pistols from which they can shoot </p><p>devastating rays—some »ort of concentra- </p><p>ted cathode ray, I imagine. These rays </p><p>are effective at a distance, and when they </p><p>don’t kill they exert a paralyzing effect. </p><p>These protectors turn the rays aside. They </p><p>neutralize them. My guide tells me that </p><p>the rays of our enemies are not as deadly </p><p>as the explosive bullets of those we thought </p><p>were our friends. I must get hold of the </p><p>latter weapons—they’ll be very important </p><p>to us. </p><p> “Meanwhile, I must say I am terribly</p><p>disappointed—I really expected something </p><p>unusual in the way of a deadly device. </p><p>Why, even in our own backward day men </p><p>had learned to kill each other on the mass </p><p>production principle! I really don’t know </p><p>what the world is coming to!” </p><p> On Brown’s face was his most cynical</p><p>smile. He seemed to enjoy his grim jest. </p><p>I took heart at his attitude; it always pre- </p><p>saged that he had found a way out of our </p><p>difficulties. </p><p> How long we were traveling I do not</p><p>know; it may have been an hour, or it may </p><p>have been two, or three; but the car halted </p><p>as suddenly as it had started, as we rolled </p><p>into an illuminated open space. A group </p><p>of men, looking more vigorous and a great </p><p>deal younger than our late hosts, stood </p><p>awaiting our arrival. I noted that they </p><p>were all armed—another graceful tribute </p><p>to international amity—and that in their </p><p>midst were two men of the race I had just </p><p>visited. Evidently these were the hostages </p><p>that were to be returned—in exchange for </p><p> Brown turned to me with a smile. “Be</p><p>us. </p><p>ready to leap into this car at any moment," </p><p>he said, in the most matter-of-fact way. </p><p>“This is the most exciting game of chess 1 </p><p>was ever in.” </p><p>CHAPTER V. </p><p>Cornered </p><p>WE alighted from the vehicle and ap- </p><p>proached the group of soldiers, who </p><p>in,turn advanced to us. Our guides ad- </p><p>dressed them in their own language; </p><p>Brown handed over the gold vessels; and </p><p>the two former hostages prepared to take </p><p>our places in the car. As I stood on one </p><p>side, I was amazed to see one soldier and </p><p>then another crumple silently to the ground </p><p>and lie still! </p><p> It was all over before I could realize</p><p>what had happened. They fell like nine- </p><p>pins, tumbling over each other in grotes- </p><p>que heaps, and I could swear I detected a </p><p>look of astonishment on their faces! The </p><p>last man standing faced Brown and reached </p><p>for his ray pistol. Brown laughed as the </p><p>man’s hand closed over an empty holster. </p><p>The next moment he, too, lay on the ground, </p><p>and before our astounded friends could say </p><p>a word, they, also, had joined the platoon </p><p>of the silent and the prostrate. </p><p> Brown surveyed his achievement with</p><p>evident pleasure—nay, with relish. He </p><p>played with the ray pistol he had abstracted </p><p>from the soldier’s belt as the gifts were </p><p>handed over. “Well,” he asked, with his </p><p>quizzical smile, “how does it strike you?” </p><p>“Speechless,” I answered. “Are they all </p><p>dead?” </p><p> “I hope not,” he answered, “but if they</p><p>are, their blood is on their own heads. </p><p>Well, we’re going back.” </p><p> “What?” I exclaimed. “Back where we</p><p>came from?” </p><p> “Certainly. Do you want to remain here</p><p>and get caught? Hop in.” </p><p> We climbed into the car, after we had</p><p>provided ourselves with a holster and pistol </p><p>apiece. Brown ordered me to don one of</p><p>the protective garments, as he did; and </p><p>rumaging under the seat he found head- </p><p>protectors, like close-fitting helmets, which </p><p>we saved for emergency. </p><p>THE END OF TIME </p><p>677 </p><p> Brown stepped on the lever, and the car</p><p>darted back on the path it had come. As </p><p>we sped back to Ultima the time master </p><p>outlined his plan to me. Making sure the </p><p>corselets were carefully concealed under our </p><p>robes, he battered the inside of the car with </p><p>the butt of his weapon, chipped the crystal, </p><p>dented the outside; then he held out his </p><p>robe and put a few holes through it where </p><p>they would be immediately noticed. 1 fol- </p><p>lowed suit, wondering at the audicity which </p><p>had carried him alive from Atlantis, and </p><p>which was now to lead him into conflict </p><p>with men even million years ahead of him </p><p>in the scale pf evolution! It was like a </p><p>man of the old stone age fighting a modern </p><p>soldier; but then Brown was so far ahead </p><p>of his own generation that he could not </p><p>really be said to belong to any age. </p><p> As we dashed into the illuminated circle</p><p>we had left a few hours before, Brown stood </p><p>up, fcis hair disheveled, his aspect wild, and </p><p>shouted again and again in the tongue of </p><p>the last race. If ever I beheld astonish- </p><p>ment on those impassive faces, this was the </p><p>moment. “We are being attacked!” he or- </p><p>atorized, in his most effective manner. At </p><p>least that is what he told me he said; I, for </p><p>one, could not understand him. </p><p> “They killed our friends before our very</p><p>eyes!” he continued. “They are bent on </p><p>destroying you and keeping the planet for </p><p>themselves! No longer do they need you! </p><p>You are doomed! Even at this moment </p><p>your lives are approaching their ends!” </p><p> With resignation on their faces, but with-</p><p>out haste, and without apparent fear, the </p><p>Ultimates made a concerted move for a </p><p>building which stood apart. “That’s what </p><p>I wanted to know,” whispered Brown. </p><p>‘That’s where they keep their arms. I rath- </p><p>er thought they would rush for them!” </p><p> With the basest ingratitude, the ancient</p><p>warriors forgot us entirely—at least, they </p><p>forgot to supply us with weapons. Per- </p><p>haps they considered us incapable of using </p><p>them. Strangely glittering side-arms dang- </p><p>led at the sides of venerable scientists; ev- </p><p>ery man carried on his shoulder enough </p><p>power to decimate an army. In an incred- </p><p>ibly short space of time, the entire city had</p><p>been surrounded with protective photo- </p><p>electric devices arranged to explode mines </p><p>of terrific power outside its gates. De- </p><p>tachments went below, down into the earth </p><p>itself, to watch over the precious machinery </p><p>that gave the underground world its breath </p><p>of life. Others went up into the observa- </p><p>tory, to defend to the last the noblest pur- </p><p>suit of mankind. But on every face was a </p><p>look of utter resignation, as though this </p><p>were the end, indeed; but on every face, </p><p>also, I noted the stony determination to pre- </p><p>serve the highest achievements and aspira- </p><p>tions of the human race to the very last. </p><p>IN the general bustle and excitement </p><p>Brown and I were unnoticed. We had </p><p>failed in our destined function, and these </p><p>men had no further use for us. </p><p> “I think I know where we left the time</p><p>machine,” said Brown. “If we can get </p><p>there unobserved, it will be easier than I </p><p>expected. After all, why should they want </p><p>us to remain here?” </p><p> We moved in the direction indicated.</p><p>Our way lay directly past the great eleva- </p><p>tors which connected the ground with the </p><p>observatory. Unnoticed, we paused at our </p><p>car to pick up the helmets we had found. </p><p>As we repassed the elevators, one of the </p><p>lightning-fast cars descended, and the chief </p><p>of the council chamber stepped forth. He </p><p>looked at us curiously. Suddenly he step- </p><p>ped forward and caught my hand in his, </p><p>and looked deep into my eyes. I tried to </p><p>struggle away from him, but it was too late. </p><p>In that moment he had read what was in my </p><p>mind; he saw, clear as day, the deceit and </p><p>the trickery. With a dramatic movement </p><p>he tore open my robe, and as the enemy </p><p>pistol met his gaze, he raised his voice in </p><p>command to his subordinates. </p><p> He started to speak; then he suddenly</p><p>sank to the ground, a burning hole in his </p><p>forehead. “Run for it,” said Brown, hold- </p><p>ing his pistol. “He’s told them we are ene- </p><p>mies within their gates, in league with the </p><p>enemies without; and the discovery of that </p><p>enemy pistol spilled the beans. Put on </p><p>your helmet, and follow me.” </p><p> As we adjusted the protective metal and</p><p>backed away, he said: “1 could shoot up in </p><p>an elevator and smash the dome of the ob-</p><p>678 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>servatory, and let in the cold to kill them </p><p>all; but it’ll probably kill us before we find </p><p>the time machine, and I don’t dare take the </p><p>chance.” </p><p> Something struck me in the chest—some-</p><p>thing that exploded and emitted poisonous </p><p>fumes. “Lucky we have these armor </p><p>plates!” said Brown, turning his ray gun on </p><p>our pursuers. </p><p> Instead of falling, they continued to ad-</p><p>vance, slowly, methodically, knowing that </p><p>we were trapped, and enjoying the cat-and- </p><p>mouse situation. Their own protective </p><p>corselets and helmets were more than suffi- </p><p>cient to ward off the rays. </p><p> “Aim for their legs!” ordered Brown, fir-</p><p>ing over his shoulder as he turned and ran </p><p>at full speed in the direction of a rosy glow. </p><p> I turned once to fire as he had ordered.</p><p>The leader of the party wavered and fell on </p><p>his face, struggling to rise; and then I, too, </p><p>ran in the direction of the glow. </p><p> Explosive bullets scorched us through</p><p>the projectors; a score of times my helmet </p><p>withstood the impact of a projectile. At </p><p>intervals Brown and I stopped for a frac- </p><p>tion of a second to fire another round; but </p><p>whenever we did, our erstwhile friends </p><p>threw themselves flat on the ground, and </p><p>presented nothing vulnerable. It became </p><p>a game of tag, more grim than anything I </p><p>had ever imagined. </p><p> Suddenly Brown screamed. A bullet</p><p>better aimed than the rest, had glanced off </p><p>his unprotected left arm, and the explosion, </p><p>while it did not tear off the unfortunate </p><p>member, disabled it at once. Still we ran, </p><p>toward the strengthening glow, and Brown </p><p>staggered and would have fallen had 1 not </p><p>caught him. We held our arms before our </p><p>bodies now, firing only at intervals. A </p><p>bullet struck an inch behind my heel, and </p><p>the flame burned like the fixes of hell. </p><p>Limping as I was, I had to support the al- </p><p>most unconscious Brown, more seriously </p><p>wounded than I was. </p><p> Suddenly I realized why none of our</p><p>shots took effect. The pistols had been dis-</p><p>charged; the limited amount of energy was </p><p>gone! </p><p> In a fit of fury I turned, ignored all dan-</p><p>ger, and hurled the weapon full at the on- </p><p>coming Ultimates. The heavy pistol, flung </p><p>with the desperation of insanity, thudded </p><p>with a satisfying crunch against the knee- </p><p>cap of a leader; and if I am any sort of </p><p>physician, it was a smashed knee that </p><p>brought him crashing to the ground. And </p><p>then, as we hurried forward, Brown and I </p><p>received a crushing blow from before 'us, </p><p>something that sent us reeling back! </p><p> “Quick!” he gasped. “We must have</p><p>run into the time machine!” I pressed for- </p><p>ward cautiously, found the door of the in- </p><p>visible mechanism, and shoved him through </p><p>it, just as a bullet whistled over his head, </p><p>struck the delicate controls, and demolished </p><p>them with a blinding flash! </p><p> “Curse you!” I shouted, following Brown</p><p>into the machine and shutting the door. </p><p>My friend lay on the floor, a bloody sight, </p><p>heaving convulsively. “Brown,” I said, </p><p>“can you still work the disintegrator?” </p><p> Something like a smile appeared on his</p><p>face. I lifted off his helmet and replaced </p><p>it with the helmet of the deadly atomic </p><p>weapon. Then I seized one of my substan- </p><p>tial automatics, opened the door, and fired. </p><p>The heavy slug ploughed through the ar- </p><p>mor as through silk; it was a pleasure to </p><p>see the honest lead crumple up a soldier </p><p>who was aiming at the invisible time mach- </p><p>ine something I had not noticed before—a </p><p>field piece which would have blown us, and </p><p>the great crystal globe, to atoms! </p><p>Hitting the Mark! </p><p>MY automatic spurted flame and death </p><p>among the last men of the world. Be- </p><p>hind the eye-pieces of their helmets I could </p><p>imagine their deep eyes wide with amaze- </p><p>ment at the efficiency of a forgotten weap- </p><p>on. As I reached for the other loaded gun, </p><p>I heard a terrific roar, and the ground shook </p><p>beneath us. Brown, laughing weakly, lay </p><p>prone on the floor. And where a host of </p><p>enemies had stood, was nothing but a gap- </p><p>ing hole in the earth, and the reek of burn- </p><p>ing flesh; and, here and there, a fragment </p><p>of a body, a piece of armor plate, a shred of</p><p>clothing, a length of rifle! </p><p> “Belter than I thought,” gasped Brown</p><p>with a chuckle, as he lapsed into uncon- </p><p>THE END OF TIME </p><p>679 </p><p>•ciousness. “I could have—blown the </p><p>whole—damn—nation—to hell!” </p><p> I slammed the door shut and pulled the</p><p> unconscious Brown into a corner. For a</p><p> few moments, at least, we were safe from</p><p> further attack. I darted for the locker that</p><p> contained the last set of controls. I knock-</p><p> ed off the damaged mechanisms, cleaned the</p><p> horizontal plates, set the new controls on</p><p> them, and turned the lever. Nothing hap-</p><p> pened. Were we to be stranded forever</p><p> here in time?</p><p> Looking round wildly, I glanced at</p><p> Brown. He was too far gone to be revived in</p><p> a moment. To my practised eye, his con-</p><p> dition seemed to be serious. Then my mind</p><p> flashed back to the time he had rebuked</p><p> me. Had I seen a key? Was it not true</p><p> that he had distrusted me to the extent of</p><p> taking the key from the controls?</p><p> I felt around his neck. There was a</p><p> chain; on the chain was a peculiar key. I</p><p> jammed it into the lock on the control</p><p> board, moved the lever, and listened.</p><p> There was a faint vibration. The lights</p><p> above me shed a flood of strengthening</p><p> radiance. And then, looking down, I dis-</p><p> covered I was naked! And Brown, lying</p><p> on the floor, his left arm bleeding and swell-</p><p> ing, the flesh charred and horrible to see,</p><p> was as unclad as a satyr in the far-away,</p><p> pagan days of classic myth.</p><p> As in ancient Atlantis, whatever we took</p><p> with us disappeared as soon as we were in</p><p> another time dimension. In that case we</p><p> took with us things long since turned to</p><p> dust, which vanished; and here we wore</p><p> garments which had as yet no real existence!</p><p> But 1 was more concerned with Brown; and</p><p> after setting the control for our own cen-</p><p> tury, I shut off the camera obscura, which</p><p> had been left in operation—so as not to be</p><p> distracted—and gave all my attention to</p><p> the unconscious wizard.</p><p> Brown’s arm was fractured at the elbow.</p><p> 1 washed the wound with antiseptic solution</p><p> from my medical kit, taped the broken skin,</p><p> and improvised a splint for the burned and</p><p> shattered bone. As far as I judged, the</p><p> work consumed the better part of an hour.</p><p>Brown was still unconscious, probably from </p><p>the ria’KsSi’	&amp; f j3n explosive bullet;</p><p>and I deemed it wisest to leave him in mer- </p><p>ciful oblivion. I prepared a hypodermic </p><p>to deaden his pain when he came to him- </p><p>self. In order to keep up his strength I </p><p>forced between his lips a little hot concen- </p><p>trated soup we had brought in vacuum bot- </p><p>tles. </p><p> Then I cleaned myself up as well as I</p><p>could, patched up my scorched heel, swal- </p><p>lowed a few cups of the strengthening liq- </p><p>uid, and rummaged in the inexhaustible </p><p>locker for decent apparel. No matter </p><p>where we came, we could never emerge in </p><p>our embarrassing state, and Brown might </p><p>die for lack of prompt hospital attention. </p><p> In the locker I found three pairs of an-</p><p>cient trousers, such as men love to go fish- </p><p>ing in. Brown had his human side, after </p><p>all. I slipped into one of the garments my- </p><p>self, pulled the other up over Brown’s </p><p>limbs, and felt once more like a human be- </p><p>ing. The locker yielded one flannel shirt, </p><p>which I appropriated for myself. I judged </p><p>it better for Brown to leave his injured arm </p><p>free. </p><p> Then, and then only, did I flash on the</p><p>camera obscura. But what I saw convinced </p><p>me that we had still a long way to go, hun- </p><p>dreds of thousands of years: and I inspected </p><p>the controls, put my faith in Brown’s mach- </p><p>ine, and stretched myself out on* the floor </p><p>for a little rest. </p><p> Presently I began to grow drowsy. The</p><p>machine vibrated onward, through century </p><p>after century, hurtling invisible through the </p><p>fourth dimension to an age long past. Un- </p><p>der the glowing roof lights I felt invigora- </p><p>ted and refreshed, and basked in them as I </p><p>would in a flood of sunshine. The sun! </p><p>How long was it since I had seen the sun— </p><p>the one I knew and loved, not the sickly, </p><p>dying dwarf star of the Ultimates? </p><p>AND then the vibration died down and </p><p>stopped. The machine, I sensed, gently </p><p>came to rest. As in the time when I visited </p><p>the dungeons of the French Revolution, I </p><p>stood in another room; I stood invisible, but </p><p>1 grasped the controls, so as not to lose</p><p>myself. </p><p> The room in which I stood, and in which</p><p>lay the unconscious Brown, was vaguely </p><p> (Cmc/iuted o/i Page 750)</p><p>The Silent Scourge </p><p>By Morrison Colladay </p><p> Marckioni</p><p> Down the hill they came—like</p><p> flying shadows. “There's thous-</p><p> ands IM exclaimed Perkins.</p><p>Undefeated—The Scourge Was Supreme in the Town. </p><p>An Army Was Held At Bay! </p><p>THE chief of police was having an un- </p><p>pleasant time. His face was flushed </p><p>and he was frowning under the questioning </p><p>of the Citizens’ Committee. Benson, the </p><p>chairman, was his most insistent tormenter. </p><p> “What do you expect us to do, Mr. Ben-</p><p>son? We even borrowed men from the New </p><p>York Department. If they can’t find out </p><p>anything, it proves that it ain’t our fault, </p><p>don’t it?” </p><p> Benson shook his head. “We’re tired of</p><p>alibis, Hennessy, Ten or twelve men dis- </p><p>appeared again last week. If you can’t </p><p>find out what’s back of it all, we’ll have to </p><p>get someone who can.” </p><p> While the chief paused to think up the</p><p>most effective reply there was a knock at </p><p>the door. “Come in,” he growled. </p><p> A plainclothes man thrust his head into</p><p>the room. “Say, Chief, there’s a guy out- </p><p>side claims he just seen a man carried off </p><p>by a big bug or something. I guess he’s </p><p>nuts, but I thought mebbe you’d want to </p><p>see him. Says his name’s Henry Todd.” </p><p>“Lock him up,” ordered Hennessy im- </p><p>patiently. “I got no time for nuts or </p><p>drunks tonight.” </p><p> “Wait a minute, Chief,” interrupted Ben-</p><p>son. “I know Todd. Better bring him in </p><p>and let’s hear what he has to say.” </p><p> Hennessy looked his disgust. “Saw a</p><p>man carried off by a big bug, did he?, </p><p>That’s the craziest story yet. All right, </p><p>Mr. Benson, anything to oblige. Bring the </p><p>guy in, Dugan.” </p><p> A minute later a white-faced little man</p><p>evidently badly frightened, entered the </p><p>room followed by a group of reporters. </p><p> “You can’t come rn here,” growled the</p><p>chief to the reporters. “We’ll let you </p><p>know later what we got to give out.” </p><p> “Better let us stay, Chief,” said one of</p><p>them. “We’ve got this guy’s story already </p><p>and it’s a wow!” </p><p> “I don’t see any objection to the reporters</p><p>being here,” said Benson. </p><p> People are always disappearing and nev-</p><p>«r being heard of again. Sometimes one </p><p>of these disappearances get? in the news- </p><p>papers, but usually not. A man grows tired </p><p>681 </p><p>of the monotony of life and wanders off to </p><p>start a new and more exciting life else- </p><p>where. Women disappear for much the </p><p>same reason. Most of these cases are re- </p><p>ported to the police who as a rule pay lit- </p><p>tle attention to them. They are pigeon- </p><p>holed for reference in case a body is dis- </p><p>covered floating in the river. </p><p> However, ten persons disappearing from</p><p>a small town in one week was a different </p><p>matter. South Change is a fairly aristo- </p><p>cratic suburb of New York and many of the </p><p>inhabitants are well-known people. It is </p><p>true that three of the missing were servants, </p><p>but the other seven were the kind of persons </p><p>who are regarded as important. One was </p><p>a bank president, two were manufacturers </p><p>and one a Wall Street broker. The remain- </p><p>ing three were men who had retired from </p><p>682 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>business with comfortable incomes. </p><p> It seemed unlikely that these ten persons</p><p>should drop out of sight voluntarily. Sin- </p><p>ister rumors began to circulate. At first </p><p>an effort was made to keep the matter from </p><p>the newspapers. A private detective agen- </p><p>cy was called in and its operatives could be </p><p>seen day and night </p><p>gumshoeing through </p><p>the Oranges. Then at </p><p>the end of another </p><p>week it was found that </p><p>five of the private </p><p>detectives had disap- </p><p>peared as well as sev- </p><p>eral more of the resi- </p><p>dents of the town. </p><p> That Sunday the</p><p>New Y ork Mirror </p><p>published a sensation- </p><p>al account of the dis- </p><p>appearances. It sug- </p><p>gested that an organ- </p><p>ized blackmail and </p><p>murder gang was at </p><p>work in the vicinity of </p><p>New York, and gave a </p><p>list of the men who </p><p>had dropped out of </p><p>sight. </p><p> This first article</p><p>blew off the lid. The </p><p>other newspapers fol- </p><p>lowed with sensational </p><p>write-ups. Most of </p><p>them dwelt on the </p><p>blackmail - murder </p><p>gang theory. The </p><p>Times was the first to </p><p>suggest that there </p><p>might be something </p><p>even more serious at </p><p>the bottom of the mys- </p><p>tery. </p><p>ALL the men had disappeared at night. </p><p>Some of them had started from the </p><p>railroad station to their homes and never </p><p>arrived. One had left his house about nine </p><p>o’clock to go a few blocks to a drug store. </p><p>He never reached the store. Two had step- </p><p>ped out of tlieir houses for a moment into</p><p>the surrounding grounds. They did not re- </p><p> turn. The three servants had been sent on</p><p> errands. The detectives who disappeared</p><p> had been on night duty.</p><p> One difficulty about the kidnapping the-</p><p> ory was that so far as was known, there</p><p> had been no outcry or struggle in connec-</p><p> tion with any of the disappearances. It</p><p> seemed hardly possi-</p><p> ble that a considerable</p><p> number of men had</p><p> been carried off</p><p> against their wills</p><p> without at least one of</p><p> them putting up</p><p> enough of a fight to at-</p><p> tract attention.</p><p> Two or three ser-</p><p> vant girls were badly</p><p> frightened by things</p><p> they claimed to have</p><p> seen.

There </p><p>are many places deeply shadowed by trees. </p><p>Todd stopped for a moment to light his pipe </p><p>and Lewis got a few feet ahead. Todd was </p><p>sure there was no unusual sound, but some- </p><p>thing caused him to look up. He saw Lew- </p><p>is in the grasp of a monster which he had </p><p>difficulty describing. </p><p>“It was dark there under the trees,” he </p><p>explained, “but it looked like a big worm </p><p>with a hundred legs, like a caterpillar.” </p><p>“What was it doing to Lewis?” asked </p><p>Benson. </p><p> “It seemed to be holding him with its</p><p>front legs. It was sort of standing up the </p><p>way a caterpillar does, if you know what </p><p>I mean.” </p><p> “How big was it?”</p><p> Todd frowned in perplex-</p><p>ity. “I know it couldn’t </p><p>have been as big as it look- </p><p>ed there in the dark, Mr. </p><p>Benson. I don’t know what </p><p>to say.” </p><p> “Well, how big did it look</p><p>to you?” </p><p> Todd considered the ques-</p><p>tion for a moment. “It </p><p>held Lewis up pretty near </p><p>as high as the lower branch- </p><p>es of the trees and there was </p><p>a lot of it on the ground. I </p><p>guess it was about thirty feet </p><p>long. Its body was at least </p><p>three feet thick through, be- </p><p>sides the legs on each side.” </p><p> “Did it see you?”</p><p> “I don’t know. I was so surprised and</p><p>everything happened so quick—” </p><p> “What happened? Did it start after</p><p>you?” </p><p> Todd shook his head as he tried to re-</p><p>member. “I guess it didn’t pay any atten- </p><p>tion to me. It went through the hedge of</p><p>the Albertson place and I came running </p><p>here.” </p><p> “What about Lew,is? Did he make any</p><p>effort to get away?” </p><p> “He looked dead to me. He never moved</p><p>or made a sound.” </p><p> Hennessey had been regarding Todd with</p><p>increasing disfavor. “Say, Mr. Benson, this </p><p>guy’s either drunk or crazy. You ain’t go- </p><p>ing to swallow any fairy story like that, </p><p>are you?” </p><p> Todd was still too frightened to be indig-</p><p>nant. He looked helplessly from the chief </p><p>to Benson. “I never took a drink in my </p><p>life and I’m not crazy,” he asserted with </p><p>quiet dignity. “You know that, don’t you </p><p>Benson?” </p><p> “Yes, I know it,” said Benson, "and I be-</p><p>lieve your story.” </p><p> Benson was an important man in that</p><p>meeting and represented even more import- </p><p>ant men. Hennessey became less truculent. </p><p> “If you know him personally, Mr. Ben-</p><p>son, of course that’s different.” </p><p>“One of the Things!” </p><p>IFTEEN minutes later a </p><p>group of men started </p><p>from police headquarters </p><p>with Todd leading the way. </p><p>All were armed with revol- </p><p>vers or automatics and two </p><p>of them carried Thompson </p><p>machine guns. </p><p>Presently Todd paused at </p><p>a dark, tree-shadowed </p><p>stretch of road. “This is </p><p>where it happened.” </p><p>Flashlights revealed noth- </p><p>ing suspicious. “Where </p><p>were you standing when you </p><p>saw the worm?” asked Ben- </p><p>son. </p><p>Todd walked over to a </p><p>tree. “I stood right here so I could light</p><p>my pipe. It’s died down now, but there </p><p>was quite a wind blowing.” </p><p> “Now show us where the worm was.”</p><p>Todd advanced gingerly to a spot near </p><p>a hedge about twenty feet ahead. “It was </p><p>right about here. Its head was waving </p><p>around in the air when I saw it and it was </p><p>holding Lewis with its front legs.” </p><p> “Where did it go?”</p><p> Todd pointed to the grounds of a con-</p><p>siderable estate. “It went through that </p><p>hedge there.” </p><p> “You didn’t try to do nothing when you</p><p>saw it carrying this guy away?” interrupt- </p><p>ed Hennessy. </p><p>684 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p> “What could I do?” asked Todd sullen-</p><p>ly. “I didn’t even have a pen knife.” </p><p>Hennessy examined the hedge. “There’s </p><p>a hole here all right,” he acknowledged. </p><p>“It’s big enough for a cow to go through. </p><p>Come along, you fellows.” </p><p> “Hold on there a minute, Chief,” said</p><p>Benson. </p><p> “What’s the matter?” demanded Hennes-</p><p>sy. “Not getting cold feet, are you?” </p><p>“Don’t you smell a strong animal odor </p><p>around here?” </p><p> Hennessy sniffed. “Smells like a skunk,”</p><p>he said. “What about it?” </p><p> “It doesn’t smell like a skunk to me,”</p><p>said Benson. </p><p> “It was strong enough to knock you down</p><p>when I was here before,” Todd volunteered. </p><p>“You noticed it then, did you?” </p><p> “It was when I was lighting my pipe. I</p><p>got a whiff of it and I guess that’s what </p><p>made me look up to see where it was com- </p><p>ing from.’’ </p><p> “Mebbe the smell frightened you and</p><p>made you run away,” suggested Hennessy </p><p>sarcastically. </p><p> Todd flushed. “I know it sounds rot-</p><p>ten, but I think that smell had something </p><p>to do with it. It made me sort of dizzy. </p><p>I guess I lost my head.” </p><p> “Lucky for you you did,” said Benson.</p><p>“You couldn’t have done anything for Lew- </p><p>is and if you hadn’t run away there’d have </p><p>been two disappearances instead of one.” </p><p>“You figuring the smell knocks ’em out?” </p><p>asked Hennessy. </p><p> “Maybe. If it does, it explains why no</p><p>one has put up a fight, doesn’t it?” </p><p> Hennessy frowned in thought. “You un-</p><p>derstand, Mr. Benson, I ain’t convinced by </p><p>this guy’s story that there’s any such ani- </p><p>mals. I’m only following it up on your </p><p>say-so.” </p><p> At this moment there was a dramatic in-</p><p>terruption. “What’s that?” shouted one of </p><p>the men, pointing down the road. “Look </p><p>out! It’s coming this way!” </p><p> “My God!” exclaimed Hennessy. “What</p><p>is it?” </p><p> Afterwards the man were able to give a</p><p>fairly good description of the creature by </p><p>comparing their impressions. The road </p><p>was dark except for the light of an occa- </p><p>sional street lamp. The millepede — for </p><p>that is what the naturalists eventually call- </p><p>ed it, in spite of its size—was running tow- </p><p>ard them with a man clasped in its forward </p><p>legs. The front part of its body was there- </p><p>fore raised from the ground. The body it- </p><p>self was about three feet wide, but the legs </p><p>added another three feet on each side. It </p><p>looked about forty feet long and ran like </p><p>the wind in spite of the weight it was car- </p><p>rying. </p><p> The men crowded to one side of the road,</p><p>paralyzed with fear, until it passed. Then </p><p>Benson grabbed a machine gun from a po- </p><p>liceman. The stream of bullets caught the </p><p>millipede where its body was elevated from </p><p>the ground. It was not killed—in fact it </p><p>was afterward found that it was impossible </p><p>to kill them with bullets—but it was suffi- </p><p>ciently hurt so that it dropped the body it </p><p>was carrying. </p><p> The men, police and citizens alike, were</p><p>so shaken by what they had seen that it was </p><p>not until fifteen minutes later that some of </p><p>them cautiously advanced to inspect the </p><p>partly consumed body. “Is it your friend </p><p>Lewis?” Benson asked Todd. </p><p> Todd shook his head. “No, it’s not Lew-</p><p>is. He’s bigger than that.” </p><p> “How about the rest of you fellows?</p><p>Any of you recognize it?” Some of them </p><p>still hung back. “Don’t waste any time,” </p><p>continued Benson impatiently. “It isn’t </p><p>pretty to look at, but there’ll be worse things </p><p>if we don’t face this situation now.” </p><p>CHAPTER II. </p><p>The Fight Begins </p><p>ANn hour later a white-faced, serious </p><p>looking lot of men, representing the</p><p>town’s influential citizens were gathered in </p><p>the chiefs uncomfortably crowded office at </p><p>police headquarters. Reporters from out </p><p>of town were constantly arriving. The </p><p>news of the night’s discovery had reached </p><p>the papers as a flash from one of the press </p><p>associations. Benson had been tacitly ac- </p><p>cepted as the leader of the gathering. The </p><p>police were intent on disclaiming respon- </p><p>sibility for a fight on the giant insects. </p><p>THE SILENT SCOURGE </p><p>685 </p><p> Hennessy stated their position. “We</p><p>couldn’t do nothing even if we had the </p><p>whole New York force here. If it was men, </p><p>we’d get ’em for you, but these—these—” </p><p>Ben Finkel, president of the Central Bank, </p><p>jumped up and shook his fist in Hennessy’s </p><p>face. “You’re yellow rats? That’s what’s </p><p>the matter with you. We’ll kick you off </p><p>the force—the whole bunch of you!” </p><p> “Well, you see it’s this way, Mr. Finkel,”</p><p>explained Hennessy. “We all want to do </p><p>anything we can, but we ain’t much good in </p><p>a case like this. It ain’t a police case. </p><p>What you need is a man like Mr. Benson </p><p>here to take charge of things. Put him in </p><p>charge and we’ll all take his orders. We’ll </p><p>show you we ain’t yellow.” </p><p> There was a murmur of approval from</p><p>the anxious-faced men. “Sounds as if it </p><p>might be a good idea,” admitted Finkel, </p><p>“if Benson will take the job.” </p><p> AH eyes turned to Benson.</p><p> “Every man is subject to draft when an</p><p>emergency as serious as this occurs,” said </p><p>Benson slowly. “However, you’ll have to </p><p>give me authority to take any steps I see </p><p>fit and agree to carry out all orders with- </p><p>out question.” </p><p> “That’s good enough for me,” said Fin-</p><p>kel. “How about the rest of you gentle- </p><p>men ? ” </p><p> There were no dissenting voices.</p><p> “There’s no use deceiving ourselves as to</p><p>the seriousness of the situation,” said Ben- </p><p>son. “Something has occurred to produce </p><p>this race of gigantic creatures that feed on </p><p>human flesh. I imagine, because of the </p><p>limited territory in which they have been </p><p>operating, that at present there are not many </p><p>of them. Our only hope is to find some </p><p>way of exterminating them before they mul- </p><p>tiply. If we don’t, they’ll proceed to eat </p><p>us at their leisure.” </p><p> At this point one of the committeemen</p><p>became violently ill. </p><p> “I know it isn’t pleasant to think about,”</p><p>continued Benson, “but it’s the condition </p><p>we’re up against. We haven’t any time to </p><p>waste.” </p><p> “What are we going to do first,” asked</p><p>Finkel. </p><p> “We’ll wait here until the rest of the re-</p><p>porters arrive and give them all the infor- </p><p>mation we have. Everyone in South Orange </p><p>who has a telephone must be notified to re- </p><p>main indoors until daylight. Tomorrow </p><p>we’ll have a meeting in New York of all </p><p>the scientists we (.an gather together at such </p><p>short notice.” </p><p> The scientists met at Columbia University</p><p>at three o’clock in the afternoon. Benson </p><p>had given a general invitation through the </p><p>newspapers to anyone who had any ideas </p><p>he thought might be valuable. It was sure </p><p>to bring some cranks, but it would not do </p><p>in a case like this to ignore any sugges- </p><p>tions. In addition Benson had telegraphed </p><p>and telephoned certain biologists and engin- </p><p>eers he wanted to be present without fail. </p><p> He addressed the gathering briefly. One</p><p>of the newspapers had a stenographer pre- </p><p>sent so there is an accurate report of the </p><p>address extant. The salient points he made </p><p>were two: First, that the giant millipedes </p><p>were apparently a recent development from </p><p>the smaller species with which we are fam- </p><p>iliar. Therefore the task for the biologists </p><p>was to determine what new condition or </p><p>what new food was responsible for their </p><p>growth. As so far the millipedes appar- </p><p>ently lived only in the vicinity of South </p><p>Orange, the field for investigation was com- </p><p>paratively limited. </p><p> Second, that a method of destroying the</p><p>giant creatures already in existence must </p><p>be found by the chemists and engineers. </p><p>Whatever the biologists eventually discov- </p><p>ered as to their origin, it was necessary </p><p>to devise immediately some way of destroy- </p><p>ing the monsters who were already in exis- </p><p>tence. </p><p>PROFESSOR Lucien Shepard of Colum- </p><p>bia suggested that two committees of </p><p>six members each be appointed by the chair- </p><p>man, one composed of biologists and one </p><p>of engineers. This was done. </p><p> There were several developments during</p><p>the afternoon. The governor of New Jer- </p><p>sey declared martial law in South Orange </p><p>and the adjoining communities. To make </p><p>it effective he called out the state militia, </p><p>which established a cordon around South </p><p>686 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>Orange. No one was allowed to enter the </p><p>town and arrangements were immediately </p><p>made to evacuate the inhabitants. </p><p> As it was impossible to carry out this</p><p>latter order before dark, all persons were </p><p>ordered for the second successive night to </p><p>remain indoors. The ordinary millipede is </p><p>a lover of darkness and apparently their </p><p>giant brothers shared this characteristic, for </p><p>none of them had so far appeared during </p><p>the day. The soldiers on duty that night </p><p>kept bright fires burning. None wandered </p><p>far from his companions. In the flickering </p><p>light from the fires, gigantic shadowy forms </p><p>were seen flashing through the streets. </p><p> When morning came the evacuation of the</p><p>inhabitants was begun, much against the </p><p>will of some of them. At the same time the </p><p>two committees appointed the previous af- </p><p>ternoon .got to work. Benson was ex-officio </p><p>a member of both of them. In a joint meet- </p><p>ing they decided that it was necessary to </p><p>secure immediately one of the giant milli- </p><p>pedes, alive or dead, no matter what the risk </p><p>involved. The risk could hardly be over- </p><p>estimated. The ordinary millipede can run </p><p>at a terrific speed, considering its size. If </p><p>the larger ones possessed this ability in pro- </p><p>portion, they could undoubtedly run rings </p><p>around any living creature. </p><p> The biologists wanted to be definitely</p><p>sure that the giant was a development from </p><p>the smaller individuals instead of a new </p><p>species. The chemists and engineers who </p><p>had assumed the stupendous task of exter- </p><p>minating them wanted a specimen to study. </p><p>Doubtless a reasonably safe way to kill or </p><p>capture one could be devised in time, but </p><p>time was the one thing the two committees </p><p>did not have at their disposal. </p><p> Apart from the fact that until they were</p><p>exterminated the millipedes would go on </p><p>multiplying, their appetite for human flesh </p><p>probably could not be satisfied by any other </p><p>food. When South Orange was evacuated </p><p>and it was no longer possible to capture </p><p>human beings there, they would almost cer- </p><p>tainly extend their activities. The process </p><p>of removing people from their homes could </p><p>hardly be continued indefinitely. </p><p> Directed by the engineers, the soldiers</p><p>started a foot by foot search of the country </p><p>for the dens of the millipedes. They lived </p><p>below the surface and any hole big enough </p><p>for them to emerge from must be fairly con- </p><p>spicuous. </p><p> The afternoon’s work yielded four suspi-</p><p>cious looking tunnels. These were marked </p><p>and plans were made to place at each of </p><p>them an ingeniously constructed net strong </p><p>enough to hold anything that became en- </p><p>tangled in it. However, the events of the </p><p>next forty-eight hours made this unneces- </p><p>sary. </p><p> The searchers left the evacuated area as</p><p>it began to grow dark and the soldiers again </p><p>took up their duties as guards. All resi- </p><p>dents had been removed from South Orange. </p><p>As an added precaution, the fires that night </p><p>were built only ten feet apart. A rampart </p><p>of them extended entirely around the ter- </p><p>ritory where the millipedes had manifested </p><p>themselves. </p><p>All Unreasonable </p><p>THERE were a number of disappearances </p><p>that night from such widely separated </p><p>points as Caldwell and Elizabeth. When </p><p>they were reported the next day Benson </p><p>was inclined to doubt that the millipedes </p><p>had any connection with most of them. It </p><p>was natural to expect the millipedes to ex- </p><p>tend the range of their forays, but it was </p><p>unlikely that they would make jumps of so </p><p>many miles in twenty-four hours, presum- </p><p>ing they all belonged to the one colony. It </p><p>was a tempting opportunity for dissatisfied </p><p>men and women to escape from their respon- </p><p>sibilities and start a new life in some other </p><p>part of the country. Undoubtedly a certain </p><p>proportion of the disappearances could be </p><p>accounted for in this way. </p><p> The really important news of the day,</p><p>though no one realized it then, was an ob- </p><p>scure item on an inside page of the New </p><p>York Times telling of mysterious thefts at </p><p>the plant of a certain chemical company. </p><p>Benson’s eyes lighted on the item and there </p><p>rested thoughtfully. It was headed “Mys- </p><p>terious Thefts Continue.” </p><p> The Bauxite Products Company have</p><p> been unable to discover the methods by</p><p> which thieves night after night ab-</p><p> stract large quantities of a certain</p><p>THE SILENT SCOURGE </p><p>687 </p><p> chemical which is being manufactured</p><p> under contract for the United States</p><p> government. Secret Service agents</p><p> have been on guard for some time past,</p><p> but the thefts continue. A puzzling</p><p> feature of the case is the discovery of</p><p> a number of curious tunnels in the vi-</p><p> cinity of the plant which may have</p><p> been used by the thieves.</p><p> Benson frowned and re-read the article.</p><p>Then he called up the Times office and af- </p><p>ter considerable trouble got hold of a man </p><p>able to give him the information he wanted. </p><p> “Where is the plant of this Bauxite Pro-</p><p>ducts Company?” he asked after explaining </p><p>who he was. </p><p> “Back in the hills somewhere beyond</p><p>West Orange.” </p><p> “Funny place for a factory. Know what</p><p>they’re manufacturing for the government?” </p><p>“Search me. Whatever it is, they’re </p><p>keeping it under cover.” </p><p> “I have a hunch I’d better find out,”</p><p>said Benson after a moment’s thought. </p><p> “Think it might have something to do</p><p>with the millipedes?” asked the newspaper </p><p>man eagerly. </p><p> “Well, it occurred to me as a possibility.”</p><p>“I tell you what I’d do if I were you, Mr. </p><p>Benson. I’d get in touch with Washington. </p><p>You’re in South Orange now?” </p><p> “At police headquarters at the moment.</p><p>Why?” </p><p> “We have a man there, Bill Gregory. If</p><p>there’s anything we can do at this end, let </p><p>Bill know.” </p><p>AN hour later Benson and three other </p><p>men got out of a car before a series of </p><p>low frame buildings surrounded by a high </p><p>double barbed wire fence. Two guards </p><p>were stationed inside a closed gate while </p><p>others could be seen patrolling the grounds. </p><p> “What’s the idea of keeping us waiting</p><p>out here?” called Benson when the guards</p><p>made no move to open the gate. </p><p> “Ain’t no visitors allowed. You fellers</p><p>get back in that car and get out of here.” </p><p>“Send for the superintendent of the plant,” </p><p>demanded Benson. </p><p> “And who might you be?”</p><p> “Never mind who we are. You do as I</p><p>told you.” </p><p> The guard stared steadily at Benson for</p><p>a minute. Then he turned to his compan- </p><p>ion. “Jim, go bring the chief here. Tell </p><p>him there’s four nuts outside. Tell him I </p><p>want to know whether to shoot ’em or let </p><p>’em die natural.” </p><p> Ten minutes later the second guard re-</p><p>turned with a man whose face was dimly </p><p>familiar to Benson. He frowned at the </p><p>visitors. “Sorry, but no strangers are al- </p><p>lowed within three miles of the plant. </p><p>“Brady,” he called to a uniformed man </p><p>standing beside a motorcycle. “Go with </p><p>these men as far as the road.” </p><p> He started to -turn away but paused at</p><p>Benson’s impatient demand. “My name’s </p><p>Benson. I haven’t any time to fool with </p><p>you or your regulations. If you give me </p><p>any trouble I’ll have the state militia take </p><p>possession of your plant.” </p><p> The face of the man inside the gate</p><p>changed. “You the Benson in charge of </p><p>this millipede campaign?” </p><p> “Yes,” responded Benson curtly.</p><p> ‘T guess I can let you in. I don’t know</p><p>about the men with you. Who are they?” </p><p>“What’s all the mystery about?” </p><p> The man flipped back the lapel of his</p><p>coat, revealing a badge. “My name’s Kel- </p><p>ly. Government service.” </p><p> “That’s different,” said Benson. “I’ll</p><p>vouch for these other men. This is Profes- </p><p>sor Sharpe of Columbia and Mr. Dowd, </p><p>one of the chemists at the Edison plant. </p><p>Also Bill Gregory of the New York Times.” </p><p>“Afraid I can’t let you bring a reporter </p><p>in here, Mr. Benson.” </p><p> “That’s all right. I’ll vouch for Mr.</p><p>Gregory too. He won’t print anything </p><p>without your permission.” </p><p> Kelly ushered the four visitors into the</p><p>office of the plant. He gazed at them keen- </p><p>ly. “What makes you think this place has </p><p>anything to do with your giant millipedes?” </p><p>“We’re investigating every possible lead,” </p><p>said Benson. “It was an item in this morn- </p><p>ing’s paper about your plant being robbed </p><p>of a certain chemical that sent us out here— </p><p>that and the reference to your finding some </p><p>mysterious tunnels.” </p><p> “It’s damn funny about those tunnels,”</p><p>said Kelly. “We come across new ones all </p><p>the time and no one has a chance to dig </p><p>688 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>them. No man we don’t know gets inside </p><p>the fence.” </p><p> “Yet somebody steals your stuff every</p><p>night, if this newspaper story is right.” </p><p>“That’s the damnable part of it,” said </p><p>Kelly, flushing angrily. “It’s true.” </p><p> “This chemical that’s being stolen —</p><p>what’s it used for?” </p><p> “I can’t tell you that. It’s a government</p><p>secret.” </p><p> Benson looked thoughtful. “Give us</p><p>some idea. You needn’t violate orders. </p><p>The situation down at South Orange is so </p><p>serious that we can’t waste any time on a </p><p>wild goose chase.” </p><p> “What do you want to know?” asked Kel-</p><p>ly- </p><p> “I’ll explain. The biologists believe that</p><p>the giant millipedes are small ones which </p><p>have got hold of some substance which im- </p><p>mensely stimulates their growth.” </p><p> “It doesn’t sound reasonable to me,” said</p><p>Kelly. </p><p>44tT doesn’t sound reasonable to anybody. </p><p> 1 The whole affair’s unreasonable. We</p><p>don’t know that there is any such substance. </p><p>If the giant millipedes are a new species </p><p>coming from underground to attack human </p><p>beings, I don’t believe there’s much we can </p><p>do. On the other hand, if they are just </p><p>ordinary millipedes grown to gigantic size </p><p>because of some substance they’ve got hold </p><p>of, all we have to do is to find out what </p><p>the substance is and remove it beyond their </p><p>reach.” </p><p> “Well, I’ll take a chance on telling you</p><p>this much,” said Kelly. “We’re manufac- </p><p>turing here an ingredient of a new poison </p><p>gas for use in war. It’s at least five times </p><p>as destructive as any hitherto discovered.” </p><p>He smiled grimly. “It’s a great peace pre- </p><p>server as long as we can keep its composi- </p><p>tion a secret from other nations.” </p><p> The four men stared at him. “It’s this</p><p>ingredient that’s being stolen?” asked Ben- </p><p>son. </p><p> Kelly nodded. “That’s why most of the</p><p>Secret Service is working on the case now. </p><p>We’ve got to keep the stuff from getting </p><p>into the hands of any person who might ana- </p><p>lyze it.” He paused. “I guess that’s about </p><p>all I can tell you.” </p><p> “Mind if 1 ask a few questions?” said</p><p>Benson. </p><p> “Ask ahead, but I don’t know that I’ll</p><p>answer them.” </p><p> “What relation does this material which</p><p>is disappearing bear to the final product, </p><p>the gas itself?” </p><p> “I can tell you this much,” said Kelly.</p><p>“Bauxite is used here to produce a material </p><p>which is added to a certain other material. </p><p>This second material is manufactured at </p><p>another plant. They are mixed under pres- </p><p>sure at still a third plant. When this pres- </p><p>sure is released, the combined substances </p><p>vaporize into the gas.” </p><p> “I see,” said Benson. “The two mater-</p><p>ials are manufactured and kept separate un- </p><p>til they are needed.” </p><p> “Exactly. They are both stable except</p><p>when combined.'’ </p><p>CHAPTER III. </p><p>The Experiment Works! </p><p>LATE that afternoon a dozen men gath- </p><p>ered around a cage constructed of fine </p><p>wire netting in one of the buildings of the </p><p>West Orange Edison plant. On the wooden </p><p>floor of the cage two ordinary millipedes </p><p>about an inch long were darting around, </p><p>trying to find a way out. </p><p> Benson carefully opened a lead-lined box</p><p>which was filled with a sort of pinkish clay. </p><p>The other men crowdcd closer to look at it. </p><p> “You say this stuff is extracted from</p><p>bauxite?” said one of them, reaching over </p><p>to pick up a fragment. </p><p> Benson seized his hand. “This was fur-</p><p>nished by the government under the express</p><p>agreement that no effort will be made to </p><p>analyze it, and that whatever portion of it </p><p>is not used in this experiment will be re- </p><p>turned.” </p><p> “Don’t be so damned suspicious, Benson.</p><p>I’m not a spy and neither is anyone else </p><p>here.” </p><p> “No, I suppose not, but the stuff’s too</p><p>important to take any chances with it.” </p><p>“You’re going to put some of it in the </p><p>THE SILENT SCOURGE </p><p>689 </p><p>cage with the millipedes,” 9aid one of the </p><p>younger men present. “Suppose it has the </p><p>effect you anticipate? That wire cage </p><p>won’t be much protection.” </p><p> “That’s all been prepared for. Even if</p><p>this stuff makes little millipedes into big </p><p>ones, it can’t work instantaneously. We can </p><p>fill this room with cyanogen gas in five min- </p><p>utes. That will take care of millipedes, </p><p>big or little.” </p><p> He carefuly opened a little door in the</p><p>top of the cage and dropped some fragments </p><p>of the pinkish substance to the floor. The </p><p>two millipedes darted toward it and rolled </p><p>in it with a kind of frenzy. “Like a cat </p><p>with catnip,” said Dowd, “only more so.” </p><p>Benson looked at his watch. “It’s now </p><p>four o’clock. We have a great deal to do </p><p>and I suggest we meet here at eight tomor- </p><p>row morning to observe results, if there are </p><p>any.” </p><p> “You think it’s safe to leave the milli-</p><p>pedes?” asked Dowd. </p><p> “One of the laboratory men will be on</p><p>duty here all night. We’ll all sleep a few </p><p>blocks away so we can easily reach here </p><p>if it should be necessary.” </p><p> Benson did not get to bed until midnight</p><p>and he was very tired. He had a disturbed </p><p>dream of an earthquake which was shaking </p><p>down all the buildings in the city. Trying </p><p>to escape a wall which was toppling on his </p><p>head, he wakened to realize the noise was </p><p>someone pounding on his door. </p><p> He jumped out of bed and found a white-</p><p>faced bellboy standing in the hall. “They </p><p>want you over at the laboratory right away, </p><p>Mr. Benson. Something’s happened.” </p><p>“Come in and tell me,” said Benson </p><p>sharply, dragging on his clothes. </p><p> “They didn’t say much over the phone,</p><p>except to tell you to come down as soon as </p><p>you could.” </p><p> “That’s all you know?”</p><p> “Well, I know what the men say that</p><p>left the plant when it happened.”</p><p> “Damn it, boy, when what happened?”</p><p>“The centipedes got loose and et up a </p><p>couple men.” </p><p> “God God! Go wake up Professor</p><p>Sharp and Mr. Dowd and tell them what </p><p>you’ve just told me, and say I’ll meet them </p><p>at the laboratory.” </p><p>THE lobby of the hotel was filled with </p><p>men, most of whom were trying to get </p><p>out of the windows. The clerk hurried up </p><p>when he saw Benson. “Better be careful, </p><p>sir. The things they’ve been having in </p><p>South Orange are here and they say they’re </p><p>eating people up!” </p><p> Benson hurried outside. He glanced ner-</p><p>vously into the shadows and walked in the </p><p>middle of the deserted street. He knew </p><p>this was a useless precaution because of the </p><p>millipedes’ speed, but it made him feel </p><p>safer. He had been carrying a gun for sev- </p><p>eral days past but he was not now depend- </p><p>ing on it for protection. lie carried in his </p><p>right hand a large flashlight. </p><p> He thought lie saw something slinking</p><p>along in the darkness and pressed the but- </p><p>ton of light. The beam revealed a giant </p><p>millipede fifty feel away. It was stand- </p><p>ing with the forward part of its body ele- </p><p>vated, holding some object as Benson had </p><p>seen one hold a human body a few nights </p><p>before. When the dazzling beam of light </p><p>fell on the creature it darted to one side </p><p>and as the beam followed, slithered oil the </p><p>road. </p><p> Benson had had an idea that the milli-</p><p>pedes were afraid of light, but he had not </p><p>cared to take the responsibility of asking </p><p>someone else to experiment. He swuni; the </p><p>beam around as he walked rapidly toward </p><p>the laboratory. Suddenly he realized the </p><p>danger Professor Sharp and Dowd would </p><p>run with millipedes in the street and no </p><p>way of frightening them off. He turned </p><p>and hurried back toward the hotel. </p><p> Sharp and Dowd were just coming out</p><p>of the door when he arrived. “What’s the </p><p>trouble-” shouted Dowd. </p><p> “1 don’t know yet.”</p><p> “Haven’t you been to the laboratory?”</p><p> “I started, but I thought I’d belter come</p><p>back for you two.” He related his encount- </p><p>er with the millipede and the effect of the </p><p>light beam. Sharpe and Dowd went back </p><p>for two flashlights and then the three hur- </p><p>ried off to the laboratory. </p><p> The plant worked twenty-four hours a</p><p>690 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>day and all the windows were brilliantly </p><p>lighted when they arrived. The laboratory </p><p>looked as if a cyclone had struck it. There </p><p>was no trace of the wire cage in which the </p><p>millipedes had been confined. The furni- </p><p>ture was demolished and the partitions torn </p><p>down, and the floor was covered with frag- </p><p>ments of bottles and retorts. A trail of red </p><p>zigzagged across the floor. </p><p> “Looks bad,” said Sharpe. “Wonder if</p><p>the men all ran away? There isn’t a sign </p><p>of anyone here.” </p><p> “Someone must be around,” replied Ben-</p><p>son. “They phoned for us to come down </p><p>you know.” </p><p> “Let’s try the office. That’s probably</p><p>where they telephoned from.” </p><p> The offices were on the second floor of</p><p>a building a block away. As they tramp- </p><p>ed up the stairs the door at the top was </p><p>cautiously opened and a man stuck his head </p><p>out. </p><p> “Hurry!” he said nervously. “We saw</p><p>you coming across the yard.” </p><p> “What did you do, shut down the works?”</p><p>asked Benson. </p><p> “The works shut themselves down when</p><p>your millipedes got out.” </p><p> Inside the room were gathered six white-</p><p>faced men, and among them was the one </p><p>who had been left on guard at the labora- </p><p>tory. “Hello, Roberts, I thought they’d </p><p>got you,” said Benson. He frowned. “Why </p><p>didn’t you turn on the cyanogen gas when </p><p>things began to look dangerous?” </p><p> “They didn’t look dangerous to me,” re-</p><p>plied Roberts. “The millipedes rolled </p><p>around in the pink stuff and got bigger, but </p><p>I thought there wasn’t enough of it so </p><p>they’d grow much.” </p><p> Roberts paused uncertainly. “What hap-</p><p>pened?” demanded Benson impatiently. </p><p> “I suppose it’s all my fault, but I thought</p><p>I was doing the right thing. I don’t know</p><p>now what actually happened.” </p><p> “You were there, weren’t you?”</p><p> “I was over here at the office, telephon-</p><p>ing for you. I thought you’d better come </p><p>down when I found the experiment was </p><p>working.” </p><p> “What was the matter with the telephone</p><p>in the laboratory?” </p><p> “There’s no switchboard operator at</p><p>night. The office is the only place to get </p><p>an outside wire.” </p><p> “I didn’t get any message until after the</p><p>millipedes had broken loose.” </p><p> “I know, they said at the hotel you were</p><p>asleep and they wouldn’t call you. Before </p><p>1 got back to the laboratory the millipedes </p><p>broke out of the cage and smashed things </p><p>up.” </p><p> “Did you see them?” asked Benson.</p><p>Roberts shook his head. “They were </p><p>gone before I got back, but Wilson here </p><p>saw them.” </p><p>Fruitless Efforts </p><p>ILSON was a young workman in jump- </p><p>er and overalls. He was still white </p><p>and shaken from the experience. </p><p> “How big were they?” asked Benson.</p><p> “The biggest things I ever saw, Mr. Ben-</p><p>son. Forty or fifty feet long and as wide </p><p>as this room. They were brown and had </p><p>about a million legs.” </p><p> Benson nodded. “That’s what I thought.</p><p>They weren’t the two millipedes from the </p><p>cage.” </p><p> “Of course not. Wilson may be exag-</p><p>gerating the size of the creatures he saw, </p><p>but still they must have been a lot bigger </p><p>than any millipede could grow in a few </p><p>hours, even with an unlimited supply of this </p><p>magic food. These, you remember, had on- </p><p>ly a few fragments of the bauxite deriva- </p><p>tive.” </p><p> Roberts looked relieved. “I’m sure glad</p><p>to hear you say that, Mr. Benson. The oth-</p><p>er fellows are thinking I’m responsible for </p><p>the deaths of the two poor boys that were </p><p>carried off.” </p><p> “Well, you aren’t, so don’t worry about</p><p>it. The millipedes that did the damage </p><p>came in from outside. They were after that </p><p>pinkish stuff I left in the cage. I don’t </p><p>know how they found out it was in the cage, </p><p>of course. Maybe they can smell it from </p><p>a distance. They entered the laboratory </p><p>and destroyed the cage to get at it. The </p><p>little millipedes escaped. The big ones car- </p><p>ried off a couple of the men. That’s what </p><p>happened, as far as I can reconstruct it.” </p><p>THE SILENT SCOURGE </p><p>691 </p><p> “Then the experiment’s been a success,”</p><p>said Dowd. “We’ve found out how to keep </p><p>any more giant millipedes from growing </p><p>up.” </p><p> “It looks like it. All we have to do is</p><p>get rid of the stuff that produces them. </p><p>That's simple enough, now we know what </p><p>it is.” </p><p> “We ll get rid of all the bauxite product,</p><p>this X-material,” said Sharpe. “Then </p><p>we’ll go after the monsters already in ex- </p><p>istence.” </p><p> The next day the Federal government</p><p>acted. The machinery at the factory back </p><p>in the hills was dismantled. All of the </p><p>“X” material on hand was sealed in leaden </p><p>cases and shipped to an arsenal in the Mid- </p><p>dle West. </p><p> Benson directed the operation and it was</p><p>not until late afternoon, when the soldiers </p><p>began arriving in trucks, that he learned </p><p>the Federal authorities had also taken con- </p><p>trol of the evacuated towns. </p><p> He immediately realized the danger of</p><p>having these additional men in the danger </p><p>zone with the millipedes becoming raven- </p><p>ous for food. He got in touch with the </p><p>governor at Trenton and later with the </p><p>War Department at Washington. He was </p><p>not able to impress the authorities with the </p><p>seriousness of the danger to which they </p><p>were exposing the troops. The soldiers had </p><p>been specially armed with rifles, grenades </p><p>and gas bombs. It was the confidence of </p><p>the army authorities in the effectiveness </p><p>of these weapons against the millipedes </p><p>that resulted in the tragedy of that night. </p><p>IN a final effort to reduce the risk to the </p><p>troops, Benson approached Colonel Zc- </p><p>rnurry, the commanding officer. “We’ve </p><p>tried to have the War Department withdraw </p><p>the troops from the danger zone, Colonel,” </p><p>he said, “but evidently some of your men </p><p>will have to be killed before the Department </p><p>&lt; ondescends to accept advice.” </p><p> Colonel Zemurry frowned slightly. He</p><p>had the professional soldier’s disdain for </p><p>civilians, but because of Benson’s position</p><p>be made an effort to be courteous. “It </p><p>teemed best to concentrate on exterminating </p><p>ike millipedes when they emerge tonight. </p><p>There are enough troops to police the in- </p><p>fested area and by tomorrow morning we </p><p>should have it pretty well cleaned up.” </p><p>“By tomorrow morning, if you carry out </p><p>your present plans, you will have fed a lot </p><p>of your soldiers to the millipedes and have </p><p>made our job that much harder.” </p><p> “I’ll have to obey orders, Mr. Benson,”</p><p>said the Colonel shortly. “Besides, you’ve </p><p>been using the state militia yourselves, </p><p>haven’t you?” </p><p> “We’ve used the militia to establish a cor-</p><p>don around the infested district, with fires </p><p>every few feet to keep the millipedes from </p><p>getting out.” </p><p> “What’s your objection to the plan of</p><p>patrolling all the streets and roads in the </p><p>district with soldiers armed with grenades </p><p>and gas bombs? They’ll kill all the milli- </p><p>pedes they can and follow the rest to locate </p><p>their lairs.” </p><p> Benson smiled grimly. “It’s evident you</p><p>haven’t seen any of the millipedes. They </p><p>run so fast that hitting them with anything </p><p>will be an accident. Besides, a pistol or a </p><p>rifle bullet won’t hurt them. I don’t believe </p><p>a machine gun will do one of them much </p><p>harm, unless he’s obliging enough to stand </p><p>still and let you cut him to pieces. Remem- </p><p>ber, Colonel, they’re thirty feet long and </p><p>seven or eight feet wide. Wait till you see </p><p>one.” </p><p> Colonel Zemurry rose, terminating the</p><p>interview. “I’m afraid, Mr. Benson, the </p><p>troops will have to carry out the plan that </p><p>has been arranged. I don’t feel that I have </p><p>authority to change it.” </p><p> “Then at least, Colonel, have every sol-</p><p>dier carry a powerful flashlight. The milli- </p><p>pedes don’t like light.” </p><p> The Colonel frowned again. “How are</p><p>we going to dispose of them if we frighten </p><p>them away? We want them to come out of </p><p>their dens and we’ll be able to take care </p><p>of them.” </p><p> “Very well,” said Benson, “I’ve done all</p><p>I can. I’ve told the governor of the state </p><p>and the War Department at Washington ex- </p><p>actly what I’ve told you. There won’t be </p><p>any question tomorrow as to where the res- </p><p>ponsibility lies for what’s going to happen </p><p>tonight.” </p><p>692 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>CHAPTER IV. </p><p>A Night of Terror </p><p>THE state militia, which had been on </p><p>duty for several nights, had no illusions </p><p>as to the kind of enemy they were up against. </p><p>Consequently when Benson asked for co- </p><p>operation from Colonel Moultrie, the com- </p><p>manding officer, he got it. </p><p> All the portable searchlights that could</p><p>be secured were stationed at strategic </p><p>points. Magnesium flares and rockets </p><p>were got ready. The commanding officer </p><p>of the federal troops tolerantly agreed that </p><p>the militia should still maintain its guard </p><p>around the south, north and east sides of </p><p>South Orange while the federal troops </p><p>would occupy the town itself and the terri- </p><p>tory 4o the west as far as the plant of the </p><p>Bauxite Products Company. </p><p> Much of this territory was mountainous</p><p>and wild. Exactly what arrangements were </p><p>made for the soldiers detailed in this section </p><p>lo maintain communication with one anoth- </p><p>er has never been made known. Events </p><p>proved that the entire plan of operations </p><p>was a mistaken one. </p><p> As soon as it grew dark Benson went to</p><p>the militia headquarters which had been es- </p><p>tablished in a large private house on the </p><p>border of South and Wrest Orange. It was </p><p>built on the top of a mountain and had ex- </p><p>cellent automobile roads leading from it in </p><p>all directions. Field telephone stations had </p><p>been established on the picket line around </p><p>South Orange. A switchboard in the en- </p><p>trance hall enabled Colonel Moultrie to </p><p>keep in touch with every sector of the line. </p><p> Benson found the officers seriously wor-</p><p>ried. “There won't be any way of finding </p><p>cut what’s happening out there in the moun- </p><p>tains,” said Colonel Moultrie. </p><p> Benson shrugged his shoulders. “What</p><p>could you do anyhow?” </p><p> “Nothing. Thai’s the damnable part of</p><p>it.” </p><p> He strode out on the terrace followed by</p><p>Benson. To the south was the glow of the </p><p>fires lighted by the militia. To the west </p><p>there was nothing except an occasional </p><p>flash and rumble. </p><p> “Damn fools to use artillery fighting</p><p>bugs,” grumbled Colonel Moultrie. </p><p> It was ten-thirty when the first report</p><p>of trouble came in. The telephone stations </p><p>had been reporting “all quiet” every fifteen </p><p>minutes. “Colonel.” called the operator* </p><p>“station eleven reports that they can see the </p><p>millipedes among the trees and there’s hun- </p><p>dreds of them!” </p><p> “Tell them to build up their fires and</p><p>have the flares ready. Notify all the other </p><p>stations.” </p><p> Five minutes later reports came in of</p><p>frantic regulars making efforts to reach the </p><p>militia picket line. The searchlights re- </p><p>vealed the millipedes in immense numbers </p><p>darting around outside the line of fires. </p><p> Soon the fugitive soldiers stopped com-</p><p>ing. “Some of them are safe in buildings,” </p><p>said Benson, “but I’m afraid for the rest;” </p><p>For the next hour there was silence ex- </p><p>cept for routine leports. Finally Colonel </p><p>Moultrie turned to Benson. “I guess it’s </p><p>all over by this time.” </p><p> Benson had been impatiently pacing up</p><p>and down the terrace. “It seems as if we </p><p>ought to be doing something,” he said. </p><p> Colonel Moultrie frowned in thought as</p><p>he gazed down over the dark and silent </p><p>country which the federal soldiers had oc- </p><p>cupied. Then he turned to the man at the </p><p>switchboard. “Order the tank corps to be </p><p>ready in ten minutes. We’ll go in and </p><p>see what the situation is.” </p><p> “When did the lanks arrive?” asked Ben-</p><p>son in surprise. </p><p> “Several hours ago. You made more im-</p><p>pression on the governor than you realized </p><p>this afternoon. He couldn’t do anything </p><p>with the War Department but he ordered </p><p>the six tanks the state owns over here. </p><p>They’re small and intended for mobs but </p><p>they’H just suit us. They have two search- </p><p>lights apiece and machine guns. They’ll </p><p>make about twenty-five miles an hour over</p><p>rough country. </p><p>THE six tanks, two abreast, with search- </p><p>lights playing ahead, made a formidable </p><p>appearance as they roared down the road </p><p>leading to the center of the silent town. Ben- </p><p>son was stationed at an observation slot </p><p>THE SILENT SCOURGE </p><p>693 </p><p>in one of the forward two. The search- </p><p>lights revealed no sign of life in the streets </p><p>or the deserted buildings until the railroad </p><p>station came into view. Here the tanks </p><p>slowed down and stopped. </p><p> The first man out shouted “Gas!” Ad-</p><p>justing masks distracted the attention of </p><p>the men for a moment from the scene of </p><p>horror revealed by the massed searchlights </p><p>directed across the tracks and centered on </p><p>the red brick station. </p><p> The ground around the building, includ-</p><p>ing* the railroad tracks, was covered with </p><p>a loathsome mass of dead millipedes. </p><p>Scattered among them were the bodies of </p><p>men in grotesque positions. Many of them </p><p>had been partly consumed by the milli- </p><p>pedes. </p><p> To see better Benson slipped off his mask</p><p>for a second but had to replace it, choking </p><p>with the gas which still filled the depression </p><p>of the railroad tracks and overflowed the </p><p>road. </p><p> The legs of the millipedes twitched as the</p><p>battery of searchlights was turned on the </p><p>mass of liquefying flesh. Colonel Moultrie </p><p>motioned toward the machine guns mounted </p><p>in the tanks. Benson shook his head. </p><p> He started to pick his way toward the</p><p>nearest human body which happened to be </p><p>unmutilated. It was lying face downward </p><p>and he rolled it over. As a matter of form </p><p>he put his hand inside the shirt, though </p><p>the body was already stiffening. Then he </p><p>got up and spread his hands toward the </p><p>watching men to indicate the futility of try- </p><p>ing to render any assistance. </p><p> Colonel Moultrie ordered the men back</p><p>into the tanks which started slowly forward </p><p>while he and Benson removed their masks </p><p>and consulted as to the next thing to do. </p><p>The faces of both were set in grim lines. </p><p> “I counted ninety-seven bodies,” said Ben-</p><p>son. “There’s no telling how many more </p><p>are in the station or covered by the bodies </p><p>of the millipedes.” </p><p> “Or eaten by them,” interjected the Col-</p><p>onel. </p><p> Benson nodded somberly. “I can’t un-</p><p>der stand what happened at the station. I </p><p>never dreamed of their having a set battle </p><p>with them.” </p><p> “It looks to me,” said Colonel Moultrie,</p><p>“as if the regulars finally realized what </p><p>they were up against and gathered in the </p><p>station to defend themselves. Here they </p><p>were attacked in the one-story building by </p><p>an overwhelming force of the millipedes.” </p><p>Benson nodded. “Ravenous, because </p><p>their food supply had been cut off. Guns </p><p>and grenades weren’t any good against </p><p>them, and gas not much better.” </p><p>“The gas did kill the millipedes,” said </p><p>the Colonel. “The trouble was it didn’t kill </p><p>them quickly enough to save the men.” </p><p>There was a sudden exclamation from the </p><p>lookout at one of the observation ports. </p><p>The tanks were approaching a large brick </p><p>building which stood back from the road. </p><p>“Looks like a schoolhouse,” said Benson. </p><p>“And there’s a light in the upper story,” </p><p>added Colonel Moultrie. “Somebody alive </p><p>there?” </p><p> “Look at them things running along the</p><p>ground,” said the lookout. “They was run- </p><p>ning all over the walls a minute ago.” </p><p>Colonel Moultrie gave a grunt of dis- </p><p>gust. It was his first glimpse of live milli- </p><p>pedes. The ground was covered with them, </p><p>a squirming mass of hideous legs and more </p><p>hideous bodies. The searchlights made </p><p>them uncomfortable and they tried to dart </p><p>away, but there were too many* of them. </p><p>They got in one another’s way.* After a few </p><p>seconds' effort to escape the glare of the </p><p>searchlights they turned and made a fren- </p><p>zied rush toward the tanks. </p><p> Benson remembered the paralyzing odor</p><p>the creatures emitted. The men had fol- </p><p>lowed the Colonel’s example in taking off </p><p>their gas masks. </p><p> “Put on your masks,” he warned. He</p><p>leaped for one of the observation ports and </p><p>shouted the same warning in the hope that </p><p>the men in the other tanks would hear. </p><p>The Survivors Gather </p><p>HE felt a searing pain and the blood</p><p>poured from a jagged wound in his </p><p>cheek. As he fell backward he saw two of </p><p>the men slashing at half a dozen legs which </p><p>were reaching through t^ie port. One of the </p><p>legs fell inside the tank, severed by a sharp </p><p>jack-knife. It was three feet long and armed </p><p>694 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>with sharp claws. It wriggled and jumped </p><p>around on the floor of the tank while the </p><p>men beat at it with their rifles. There came </p><p>a yell of pain from the other side of the </p><p>tank. A man had had his face badly </p><p>slashed by legs inserted through another </p><p>port. </p><p> All openings were hurriedly closed and</p><p>Colonel Moultrie, who was a physician in </p><p>civil life, started to work 011 the two wound- </p><p>ed men. Benson had a nasty cut across one </p><p>cheek but it was nothing to worry about un- </p><p>less the millipedes’ claws should prove to </p><p>be poisonous. Colonel Moultrie swabbed it </p><p>with iodine and fastened a dressing on it </p><p>with adhesive tape. The other man’s wound </p><p>was more serious, for his eye was badly </p><p>torn. </p><p> “I'll have to get him to a hospital as soon</p><p>as I crfn,” said the Colonel in a low voice </p><p>to Benson. </p><p> Benson shook his head. “Can’t be done.</p><p>Whoever tries to drive will be torn to pieces. </p><p>He’ll have to see where he’s going and yet </p><p>you daren’t uncover an opening.” </p><p> Colonel Moultrie frowned. “You think</p><p>we can’t make it?” </p><p> “If you try you’ll have a lot of us to take</p><p>to the hospital.” </p><p> “Well, I suppose we can stay here until</p><p>morning if we have to.” </p><p> “Yes, that’s one thing to do,” agreed Ben-</p><p>son. “The millipedes will leave at day- </p><p>break. I have a better idea though. You’ve </p><p>got a couple of tanks of gas. Why not use </p><p>it? It killed them back there at the sta- </p><p>tion.” </p><p> “We might try it,” said Colonel Moultrie,</p><p>“though it’s going to be hard for you to </p><p>wear a mask on that face of yours and </p><p>harder still for this boy here.” </p><p> “We’ll manage somehow,” said Benson.</p><p>The wounded man nodded and swore softly </p><p>under his breath. </p><p> The men in the tanks sat silently, masks</p><p>on, listening to the hiss of the gas as it es- </p><p>caped from its cylinders. Benson kept his </p><p>eyes fixed on his wrist watch. At the end </p><p>of thirty minutes he carefully opened one </p><p>of the observation ports and jumped aside. </p><p> Nothing happened. He advanced cauti-</p><p>ously to the port again and gazed out. The </p><p>searchlights of all the tanks were still di- </p><p>rected toward the schoolhouse. For a mo- </p><p>ment Benson did not notice the piles of </p><p>dead millipedes. Curiously enough, there </p><p>was never very much left of them after they </p><p>were dead, except the legs. The bodies </p><p>quickly disintegrated. Now as he looked </p><p>downward the ground as far as he could see </p><p>was covered with them, their legs still feeb- </p><p>ly waving. </p><p> Benson glanced around at the men in the</p><p>tank. They all looked half asleep. “The </p><p>millipede odor,” he muttered to himself. </p><p>“Didn’t get their gas masks on soon </p><p>enough. I’ll wake them up.” He had been </p><p>in one of the first tank corps organized dur- </p><p>ing the war and he had not forgotten how </p><p>to drive. He climbed to the seat and threw </p><p>in the clutch. </p><p> The tank slowly straddled the ditch be-</p><p>side the road and crushed down the stone </p><p>wall which surrounded the school grounds. </p><p>It crawled over the millipede bodies which </p><p>covered the campus and brought up against </p><p>the steps leading to the building. </p><p>BENSON scrambled down and was the </p><p>first man outside. He was relieved to </p><p>see the other five tanks crawling across the </p><p>campus. That meant there was probably </p><p>not much wrong inside them. A few minutes </p><p>later their crews, still a little groggy, </p><p>poured out. There were a few cut faces and </p><p>arms but no serious casualties. Colonel </p><p>Moultrie made a hasty inspection and </p><p>nodded his head in satisfaction. </p><p> Meanwhile the great double doors of the</p><p>school remained closed, though the upper </p><p>floor was still lighted. When pounding on </p><p>them brought no response a machine gun </p><p>easily smashed the lock. The tank crews </p><p>made a concerted rush up the stairs to the </p><p>third floor. Here they found twenty-five </p><p>badly frightened soldiers. </p><p> “Why didn’t you come down when you</p><p>saw us?” demanded Colonel Moultrie. </p><p> A sergeant who was the only officer in the</p><p>party explained. “Gas. We haven’t any </p><p>masks.” </p><p> “What did you do with them?”</p><p> The sergeant shrugged his shoulders. We</p><p>couldn’t run fast enough with ’em on.” </p><p>THE SILENT SCOURGE </p><p> “Did-the millipedes get any«of -you?”</p><p> “Plenty.”</p><p> “Well, I guess you’ll have to stay here</p><p>until morning. Any more of you in the </p><p>buildings around here?” </p><p> “Some, I guess. It was every man for</p><p>himself when them things got after us. We </p><p>don’t know how many got away.” </p><p>ORNING revealed about two hundred </p><p>survivors from the two regiments, </p><p>barricaded in buildings. Searching parties </p><p>during the day picked up the bodies of the </p><p>dead wherever they could be found. The </p><p>extent of the tragedy was not known in time </p><p>for the morning papers, but the evening pa- </p><p>pers gave it flaming headlines. Benson's </p><p>futile protest against the massing of troops </p><p>in the area was revealed by the governor at </p><p>Trenton and condemnation of the War De- </p><p>partment for the needless slaughter of reg- </p><p>ular was violently expressed in Congress. </p><p> There was a spontaneous demand from a</p><p>number of quarters simultaneously that the </p><p>federal troops be placed under Benson’s </p><p>control and that he be given officially dic- </p><p>tatorial powers. This was accomplished </p><p>a few hours after the demand was made, by </p><p>the President’s declaring martial law in </p><p>northern New Jersey and appointing Ben- </p><p>son military governor. There was no pre- </p><p>cedent for this action, but there was no pre- </p><p>cedent for the appalling situation which ex- </p><p>isted. </p><p> Benson immediately ordered a concentra-</p><p>tion at South Orange of all the tanks in the </p><p>eastern part of the country. In view of the </p><p>destructive effect of gas on the millipedes, </p><p>this seemed the best way to fight them. Pre- </p><p>sumably with the removal of the X-sub- </p><p>stance no new millipedes were being pro- </p><p>duced. If those already in existence con- </p><p>tinued to attack as they had at the railroad </p><p>station and at the schoolhouse, they could </p><p>be exterminated in a short time. </p><p> No attempt to attack the millipedes was</p><p>made the night after the massacre. The </p><p>militia kept its fire-studded picket line </p><p>around the town. In the meantime the </p><p>tanks were gathering, each supplied with </p><p>cylinders of compressed gas.</p><p>CHAPTER V. </p><p>A Nation Aroused </p><p>THE following night the advance into the </p><p>infested territory began. In long or- </p><p>derly rows were over a hundred tanks, large </p><p>and small. At a rocket signal they started </p><p>into life, roaring, clanking iron monsters </p><p>with searchlights playing in all directions, </p><p>inviting an attack by the millipedes. </p><p> They traversed the territory where the</p><p>millipedes had been seen and returned to </p><p>their starting point without getting more </p><p>than a distant glimpse of shadowy giant </p><p>forms which sped away before they could </p><p>be attacked. </p><p> Morning came with nothing accomplished.</p><p>This procedure was followed for three more </p><p>nights with the same results, before Benson </p><p>acknowledged that it was a failure. Why </p><p>the millipedes attacked the first night and </p><p>ran away afterward was and remained a </p><p>mystery. </p><p> It was evident, however, that some new</p><p>way of attacking them must be found. They </p><p>were beginning to appear in the surround- </p><p>ing country and again people were being </p><p>carried off. Their numbers had been great- </p><p>ly reduced and they were perhaps less ag- </p><p>gressive, but their appetite for human flesh </p><p>had not been curbed. </p><p> It was a suggestion in a letter written to</p><p>the New York Times by a man whose identi- </p><p>ty was never discovered that indirectly ended </p><p>the menace. The letter read: </p><p> Editor New York Times: Sir: If</p><p> these so-called scientists ain’t absolute</p><p> fools why don’t they use a little Horse</p><p> Sense. I am a Vermin Exterminator</p><p> and I could kill all the Millipedes in</p><p> twenty-four hours. They ain’t got sense</p><p> enough to hire me to do it so I’ll tell</p><p> them how for nothing. Here it is. Get</p><p> some of that X-stuff and put it where</p><p> the Millipedes will find it. When they</p><p> come after it shoot the gas into them.</p><p> Everything’s easy if you know how.</p><p> The letter was signed “Bug Killer.” It</p><p>immediately attracted country-wide atten- </p><p>tion. Strong pressure was brought to bear </p><p>on the government to try the suggested plan,</p><p>without success. Spokesmen for the War </p><p>Department announced that the risk was too </p><p>great. Exposing enough of the X-substance </p><p>696 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>to serve as bait would, if there were any </p><p>defect in the plana, be the means of creating </p><p>another generation of the giant millipedes. </p><p>There would be a new crop added to the </p><p>survivors of the old lot. </p><p> It was while matters were at this impasse,</p><p>with public opinion becoming more bitter </p><p>as the newspapers told day after day of new </p><p>victims of the millipedes, that the idea oc- </p><p>curred to Benson which brought the war to </p><p>a close. </p><p> He embodied it in a memorandum to the</p><p>War Department. Briefly it was to use the </p><p>secret XY gas in an effort to exterminate the </p><p>remaining millipedes. He suggested that it </p><p>was at least possible that the X-substance </p><p>retained its attraction for the creature even </p><p>after it had entered into its XY combination. </p><p>If this were the case, it would only be neces- </p><p>sary to release a quantity of the gas in some </p><p>isolated place. The millipedes would be </p><p>attracted by the X-ingredient in the gas and </p><p>would be destroyed. </p><p> Benson was summoned to Washington</p><p>where he met the head of the Chemical War- </p><p>fare Division. </p><p> “Your idea is plausible enough,” said</p><p>General M., “but unfortunately it is im- </p><p>practical.” </p><p> “Impractical?” repeated Benson. “Why?”</p><p>“For several reasons. One is that we do </p><p>not know how long the gas will make the </p><p>place where it is released uninhabitable. </p><p>You see, it is too dangerous to experiment </p><p>with and we know very little about it. It </p><p>has been manufactured as a threat to poten- </p><p>tial enemies with no real idea that it will </p><p>ever become necessary to use it.” </p><p>&lt;4T SUPPOSE you saw in this morning’s </p><p>JL paper that several more children had </p><p>been carried off,” said Benson. “It seems </p><p>the millipedes have acquired a taste for </p><p>children.” </p><p> “Yes, it’s horribly distressing.”</p><p> “Is it so distressing that you’ll take a</p><p>chance on making some place uninhabitable </p><p>for awhile?”</p><p> “There’s still another difficulty, Mr. Ben-</p><p>son. We don’t know whether any of our </p><p>gas masks are effective against this gas. The </p><p>men who attempted the experiment you sug- </p><p>gest would practically be committing sui- </p><p>cide.” </p><p> “You supply the gas,” said Benson, “and</p><p>I’ll get enough volunteers to use it.” </p><p> Several nights later, Benson with two com-</p><p>panions entered an especially prepared tank. </p><p>As soon as it was known that an effort to </p><p>destroy the millipedes was to be made which </p><p>would be particularly dangerous to those </p><p>taking part in it, there were hundreds of </p><p>volunteers. Benson’s task was simply to </p><p>select those he wanted to take. His choice </p><p>fell on a man named Williams who had been </p><p>in the Tank Corps during the war, and Per- </p><p>kins, a gas expert of the Chemical Warfare </p><p>division. </p><p> The tank was hermetically sealed and all</p><p>observation ports were covered with thick, </p><p>non-shatterable glass. Instead of gas masks </p><p>each man was supplied with a helmet very </p><p>much like a deep sea diver’s to which was </p><p>attached a cylinder of compressed oxygen. </p><p>These were for use if for any reason it be- </p><p>came necessary to leave the tank after dis- </p><p>charging the gas. </p><p> Cylinders of the deadly XY gas had been</p><p>rushed by airplane from an arsenal in the </p><p>Middle West.* </p><p> The tank with ihe volunteers proceeded</p><p>slowly through the darkness to an uninhab- </p><p>ited valley in the hills beyond South Orange. </p><p>No searchlights were used because the ob- </p><p>ject was to attract the millipedes instead of </p><p>driving them away. </p><p> When it reached this agreed on spot the</p><p>three men shook hands with one another. </p><p>Benson and Perkins opened simultaneously </p><p>the two petcocks which released a stream </p><p>of gas from each side of the tank. Then </p><p>they stationed themselves at the observation </p><p>ports and watched. If the gas still possessed </p><p>the attraction of the X-substance the milli- </p><p>pedes would be drawn to their destruction. </p><p>If it did not—there would be another fail- </p><p>ure to add to the increasingly long list since </p><p>the war with the millipedes started.</p><p> Benson’s gaze was fixed on the distance</p><p>•Any detailed description of the special ap- </p><p>paratus devised for discharging the gas with </p><p>a minimum of risk to the men in the tank Is </p><p>prohibited.

It was rather like the red fire of </p><p>a torchlight parade, except that it was more </p><p>evenly diffused. </p><p> “Damned funny,” exclaimed Perkins.</p><p> “Must be the gas,” said Benson. “It’s</p><p>evidently luminous in the dark.” </p><p> Now they could see it spreading from the</p><p>nozzles through which it was being discharg- </p><p>ed into the air. Gradually the entire valley </p><p>became alight with its rosy glow. </p><p> “1 guess we’re going to see the whole</p><p>show,” said Perkins. </p><p> “If there’s any show to see,” doubted Ben-</p><p>son. “So far I don’t see any signs of milli- </p><p>pedes.” </p><p> “There’s one now!”</p><p> A great shadowy creature like a mediae-</p><p>val dragon came sweeping down the side of </p><p>the hill. In a second it was beside the tank </p><p>with its head pressed against the glass of the </p><p>p^rl. All three men started back in sudden </p><p>disgust and horror. It was impossible for </p><p>a human being to look calmly at those pro- </p><p>truding eyes and s?obbering lips. The head </p><p>was pressed against the glass for only a </p><p>moment. The gas immediately got in its </p><p>deadly work. The millipede sank back and </p><p>the giant body turned over, leaving the legs </p><p>feebly waving in the air. </p><p> “It works!” exclaimed Perkins.</p><p> “I guess it does,” Benson agreed. “Here</p><p>are some more of them.” </p><p>DOWN the side of the hill and up the </p><p>valley they could be seen coming like </p><p>flying shadows. They bathed for a moment </p><p>in the rosy glow and then sank helpless to </p><p>the ground. “It’s like dead leaves falling </p><p>in a high wind,” said Williams. </p><p> “God, there’s thousands of them!” ex-</p><p>claimed Perkins a few minutes later. </p><p>“They’ll bury the tank!”</p><p> “Looks as if we might get them all this</p><p>time.” </p><p> Soon the bodies reached to the port and a</p><p>little later covered it. </p><p> “How long are we going to stay here?”</p><p>asked Williams. </p><p> Benson kept his eyes on his wrist watch</p><p>as the minutes slowly passed. Finally ho </p><p>stooped down and turned off petcocks in the </p><p>two cylinders. “We’ll get out of this now, </p><p>if we can,” he said to Williams. </p><p> Slowly the caterpillar treads began te</p><p>move and the tank started forward. Benson </p><p>switched on a searchlight but it did not il- </p><p>lumine the darkness as the tank crushed its </p><p>way through a mountain of dead millipedes. </p><p>It travelled a hundred yards before it reach- </p><p>ed the open air. Now the searchlight show- </p><p>ed a concrete road ahead. Behind it re- </p><p>vealed the entire valley a writhing mass of </p><p>quivering bodies and waving legs. </p><p> “Think they’re really dead?” asked Per-</p><p>kins doubtfully. </p><p> “Dead enough,” said Benson. “The legs</p><p>may keep that up for an hour.” </p><p>* # * # </p><p> This was the final rout of the millipedes.</p><p>For forty-eight hours no one visited the </p><p>valley, to give the XY gas a chance to dissi- </p><p>pate. - On the morning of the third day a </p><p>cautious advance was made by a group of </p><p>men headed by Benson. They were ready </p><p>to stop at the first indication of ill effects </p><p>from any remaining gas. They found none. </p><p> The little company came to the valley of</p><p>the massacre. Scarcely any trace of the </p><p>mountain of dead millipedes was to be seen. </p><p>The scavengers of the earth and air had done </p><p>their work. </p><p> That afternoon the two committees of</p><p>scientists sent out their first optimistic re- </p><p>port. They stated that ihey believed all dan- </p><p>ger was over, that practically all of them </p><p>had been destroyed and any remaining speci- </p><p>mens would be exterminated as the result</p><p>of measures to be put into immediate effect. </p><p> A careful exploration of the entire coun-</p><p>try which had been infested was begun. </p><p>Wherever a hole or cave was found cyano- </p><p>gen gas was forced into it under pressure. </p><p>Then the opening was filled up with con- </p><p>crete.

It would have been an excellent </p><p>place for an exponent of black art or sor- </p><p>cery, and at this time the shadows of night </p><p>had stolen into the room making it even </p><p>more spectral. But the blackness was </p><p>somewhat relieved by a single, frosted elec- </p><p>tric lamp that cast a pale, phosphorescent </p><p>glow over a paper-littered desk in a dismal </p><p>corner. </p><p> Hanging along the wall on the right was</p><p>a row of four human skeletons, complete </p><p>and erect.

The scientist</p><p> eyed him with a con-</p><p> templating glance.</p><p> “Don’t like them, do you, young man?”,</p><p> he asked seriously.</p><p> Douglass shuddered. “I always feel</p><p> strange in the presence of human skeletons,</p><p> Dr. Pontius; and these things”, he added</p><p> pointing to one of the creatures.</p><p> “Quite natural,” said the scientist. “Ev-</p><p> ery living thing has some horror for skele-</p><p>THE SYNTHETIC MEN </p><p>701 </p><p>tons of its kind. Even a dog will avoid its </p><p>dead. But you don’t feel that way about </p><p>my children,” he smiled nodding toward </p><p>the figures in the test tubes. </p><p> “They don’t appear to annoy or bother</p><p>you,” the reporter commented. “Where </p><p>did you get them—the skeletons?” </p><p> Dr. Pontius settled back in his chair and</p><p>filled his pipe with the same deliberate cool- </p><p>ness that he performed the other act. </p><p> “The first one is all that remains of ‘Kill-</p><p>er’ Garth who was executed at Sing Sing </p><p>■five months ago,” Pontius remarked cas- </p><p>ually. </p><p> Douglass’s eyes flashed and he squirmed</p><p>uneasily in his chair as he regarded the de- </p><p>signated skeleton. Pontius </p><p>continued: “Number two was </p><p>an unidentified laborer who </p><p>was drowned six months </p><p>ago at Camden, New Jersey. </p><p>Note the curvature of the </p><p>vertebrae at the neck—” </p><p> “No thanks, Dr. Pontius,”</p><p>said Douglass, turning his </p><p>head. “I’ve had enough. </p><p>But why all the skeletons?” </p><p> Pontius realized that</p><p>Douglass was purposely </p><p>avoiding the subject of the </p><p>meeting—his two synthetic </p><p>men. He snapped a tiny </p><p>lighter into flame and igni- </p><p>ted his pipe, contemplated </p><p>the reporter silently for a </p><p>moment and then blew out </p><p>a cloud of smoke. With a nod he drew the </p><p>young man’s attention to the test tubes. </p><p> “I am using them to obtain in the sur-</p><p>rounding jelly a substance which I need for </p><p>the making of my synthetic man.” There, </p><p>he had shot his bolt. He regarded Doug- </p><p>lass’ awe-struck face as he continued. “In </p><p>other words, the skeletons will dissolve into </p><p>my fluid until they are all gone. The fluid </p><p>will be enriched by a substance necessary</p><p>to the production of life.” </p><p> Douglass almost jumped out of his chair</p><p>when he comprehended what the two test </p><p>tubes in the shadow contained. He stared </p><p>at them for fully five minutes before it </p><p>dawned upon him that the contents were </p><p>really living men. His handsome face went </p><p>strangely pale and took on a ghostly ap- </p><p>pearance under the glow of the feeble lamp </p><p>that scarcely touched the gloom enshroud- </p><p>ing the tubes. So this was the mysterious </p><p>story Amesbury had sent him for! </p><p> But could it be true? He felt a shiver</p><p>steal up his spine as he contemplated the </p><p>grotesque creatures and turned quickly to </p><p>see the scientist studying him intently. </p><p> 6T DON’T envy your job,” Douglass said</p><p>X in a half whisper. “But do you mean </p><p>that you can make new men; living, thinking </p><p>men out of that green jelly and bones?” </p><p>“Partly, yes,” replied Pontius, sucking at </p><p>his pipe. “The creation of </p><p>life is no longer a mystery, </p><p>at least to me, but the solu- </p><p>tion lies deeper than dead </p><p>men’s bones.” </p><p> “Of course,” commented</p><p>Douglass with a strange </p><p>sense of reality. “Still, I </p><p>think, if I were you, I would </p><p>be afraid of the wrath of the </p><p>Super Intelligence that creat- </p><p>ed all life at the beginning. </p><p>Synthetic creation of human </p><p>life by man, it seems to me, </p><p>is a violation of all the laws </p><p>of God.” </p><p> Dr. Pontius shrugged.</p><p>“The Super Intelligence is </p><p>the mind, young man,” he </p><p>said bluntly. “All life ori- </p><p>ginally evolved through the crystallization </p><p>of a colloid. The idea that one creator </p><p>made all things is a primitive superstition. </p><p>At least that is my opinion and it i3 founded </p><p>on two generations of research and experi- </p><p>mentation in the realms of material physio- </p><p>logy, by my father and myself.” </p><p> “You are an atheist, then?” Douglass in-</p><p>quired, amazed. </p><p> Dr. Pontius’ pipe had gone out. He scru-</p><p>tinized his guest with an amused look as he </p><p>applied the lighter again. </p><p> “I’m afraid my views on religion would</p><p>be uninteresting to you, Douglass,” he said </p><p>simply. “It is a delicate subject to discuss </p><p>and not injure the feelings of another; so </p><p>ED EARL REPP </p><p>702 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>let us get down to the business of your vis- </p><p> Douglass’ face brightened. He had dis-</p><p>covered himself forming unkindly opinions </p><p>of this old scientist for his seemingly dog- </p><p>matic views. The idea that the Creator had </p><p>made all things had been drilled into Doug- </p><p>lass from childhood by devout parents and </p><p>he resented anything to the contrary—des- </p><p>pite his broad-mindedness. He was glad to </p><p>change the subject, for he had no stomach </p><p>for an argument with the scientist and, above </p><p>all, he wanted the story. </p><p> The reporter nodded. “Then you can</p><p>proceed, Dr. Pontius,” he said, taking a </p><p>sheaf of folded foolscap from his inner </p><p>pocket in preparation to take notes. “You </p><p>need not deviate from scientific parlance. </p><p>I am well schooled in science and will un- </p><p>derstand your terms quite amply. Biology </p><p>has always fascinated me. I am glad of </p><p>this opportunity to hear an expert discuss </p><p>it.” </p><p> “That’s fine,” applauded Dr. Pontius with</p><p>a mischievous grin. “I want you to get it </p><p>right. Don’t hesitate to interrupt if 1 get </p><p>too deep for you.” </p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p>The Story of Pontius </p><p>FOR two solid hours the scientist’s voice </p><p>droned out in the dismal room. It </p><p>seemed smothered and stifled by the close- </p><p>ness of the place. The reporter’s pencil </p><p>literally flew over his papers. Dr. Pontius </p><p>talked steadily, touching many details of </p><p>his discoveries. But he talked about it ab- </p><p>stractly. He did not seem eager to have the </p><p>world know that he, of all men, had been </p><p>the first to solve the mysteries of life. </p><p> If Douglass had thought himself well-</p><p>schooled in science, he soon discovered that </p><p>he was pitifully ignorant. Many times was </p><p>he forced to interrupt the scientist for a </p><p>simpler explanation of a detail. Dr. Pon- </p><p>tius rallied to his aid on each occasion. </p><p>Again and again he gestured toward the test </p><p>tubes. Each time the reporter experienced </p><p>chilling sensations running up and down </p><p>his spinal columu. </p><p> The story that Pontius told was, in effect,</p><p>the history of two generations of unremit- </p><p>ting devotion to an idea. Two men, father </p><p>and son, following each other in the silence </p><p>of this laboratory, watching over bits of mi- </p><p>crosopic material, that were finally to be- </p><p>come men. Not perfect men. Pontius em- </p><p>phasized this fact to Douglass. And to </p><p>illustrate it, he took the fascinated reporter </p><p>in front of one of the bodies and switching </p><p>on the globe suspended above, illuminated </p><p>the internal structure of the creature. He </p><p>showed Douglass that instead of having </p><p>blood coursing through his veins, the crea- </p><p>ture had a green fluid that Pontius called, </p><p>Xyone. And further, as a memento that </p><p>the hand of the potter might occasionally </p><p>shake, he showed that the synthetic man’s </p><p>heart was on the right side instead of the </p><p>left. There were other differences, too, that </p><p>set the synthetic man apart from our own </p><p>flesh and blood, but these differences only </p><p>served to Douglass to heighten the reality </p><p>of this amazing creation. Leaving the crea- </p><p>ture who, seemed to be asleep in his enve- </p><p>loping green fluid, the two men returned to </p><p>their seats and Pontius went on with his </p><p>story. </p><p> The original discovery that the elder Pon-</p><p>tius had made was the creating of a single- </p><p>celled organism from agar, a derivative of </p><p>sea weed, that had been treated at various </p><p>temperatures and in various solutions. It </p><p>was all part of a preconceived idea of Ed- </p><p>ward Pontius that under the proper condi- </p><p>tions animal life could be produced from </p><p>plants. That was where the Q-Ray came in. </p><p> Edward Pontius had experimented with</p><p>the effect of cosmic rays on animal life, and </p><p>found that they were fatal in large doses. </p><p>So were the much longer radium rays and </p><p>the still longer X and ultra-violet rays. </p><p>But each of these in proper doses was </p><p>beneficial to life. Here indeed was the be- </p><p>ginning of a puzzle that the giant mind of </p><p>the elder Pontius could unravel. Might </p><p>not one of these short wavelength radiations </p><p>be the one that coming from outer space </p><p>had caused plant life to .change miraculous- </p><p>ly into animal protoplasm. </p><p> The Q-Ray was the answer. Lying be-</p><p>tween the gamma rays from radium and the </p><p>THE SYNTHETIC MEN </p><p>703 </p><p>cosmic ray,* they were found to be a nar- </p><p>row band of radiations unexplored by </p><p>science. Perhaps they were unexplored be- </p><p>cause of the peculiar conditions necessary </p><p>to their propagation- And further, because </p><p>the conditions necessary to produce them </p><p>were so delicate, their praeence had not ev- </p><p>en been detected. </p><p> But Edward Pontius had discovered that</p><p>on projecting the Q-Ray on the agar he pro- </p><p>duced a microscopic bit of living matter. </p><p>And when the ray was intensified, the mic- </p><p>roscopic organism, in a miraculous way, </p><p>began to subdivide and grow and become </p><p>more complex. The process of the increas- </p><p>ing complexity of simple organisms that </p><p>took hundreds of thousands of years in na- </p><p>ture took days in the laboratory of Edward </p><p>Pontius. </p><p> Feverishly he set to work to yest this</p><p>amazing fact to the fullest. After inadver- </p><p>tently telling the world about his Q-Ray </p><p>he saw his mistake and retired to his labora- </p><p>tory for the rest of his life. Month after </p><p>month, year after year—testing, retesting, </p><p>discarding, starting over; he finally evolved </p><p>a process that had finally culminated in </p><p>the two synthetic men his son had produced. </p><p> What it meant was that the process of</p><p>the evolution of a single-celled organism </p><p>into a mature man, which had taken hun- </p><p>dreds of millions of years had been com- </p><p>pressed under the action of the Q-Ray into </p><p>sixty-five years! Douglass gasped when the </p><p>significance of these words penetrated his </p><p>mind. </p><p> “Of course,” Pontius said slowly, “when</p><p>my father died and left me his experiments </p><p>I knew I would succeed. All I had to do </p><p>was to carry them on; and allow the half- </p><p>formed creatures to continue evolving. But </p><p>now they are finished, badly finished, per- </p><p>* Radiant energy is classified according to the </p><p>wavelengths of the rays. There are the visible </p><p>light rays whose wavelength is between .0000206 </p><p>and .0000155 inches. Wavelengths of energy </p><p>longer than the longest light wave gives us </p><p>the infra-red heat waves and still longer waves </p><p>gives us radio. Waves shorter than the short </p><p>waves of light are the ultra-violet, still shorter</p><p>are the X-ray which are about .0000004 inches </p><p>in length. Gamma rays of radium arc still </p><p>shorter being about 1/1000 the length of the </p><p>X-ray while at very end of the spectrum we </p><p>have so far discovered, are the cosmic rays </p><p>being less than a thousandth of the length of </p><p>the gamma rays. The Q-ray therefore is an </p><p>extremely short wavelength lying between the </p><p>gamma ray and the cosmic ray. </p><p>haps. But I know that they live. I can </p><p>arouse them to life at any moment I wish.” </p><p>He paused. “I am old. I have no heir; </p><p>and I want the result of this work to be </p><p>given to the world. The world must do </p><p>with it as it will.’' </p><p> “And your creatures really live,” Doug-</p><p>lass said when he could find his voice. </p><p> Pontius nodded. “Only yesterday I saw</p><p>that one there,” and he pointed to one of the </p><p>imprisoned men, “making efforts to get out </p><p>of his tube. The human desire for freedom, </p><p>of course, and that fellow is a particularly </p><p>pugnacious member of his species.” </p><p>FROM the streets outsidd came a sudden </p><p>shriek of police sirens. Douglass sat </p><p>up with a jolt. The scientist appraised him </p><p>quizzically and glanced at the tubes. The </p><p>reporter heard him mutter something in- </p><p>comprehensible as he tensed in his swivel </p><p>chair. He glanced toward the two synthe- </p><p>tic men. </p><p> The green, fire-shot eyes of one were rov-</p><p>ing over the room. Douglass clutched his </p><p>papers and pencil lightly in a trembling, fist, </p><p>and watched silently in awe. Dr. Pontius </p><p>half-rose from his chair in a tense attitude; </p><p>Then the synthetic creature lifted a feeble </p><p>hand and ran it.nervously across his face; </p><p>A cry of fear clogged the reporter’s throat. </p><p>He struggled to down it, but it came forth </p><p>in a terrified grunt. </p><p> “Good God!” he groaned. “He’s coming</p><p>to!” </p><p> “Silence!” hissed Dr. Pontius severely.</p><p>“Those damned sirens! Their vibrations </p><p>have awakened my subjects before I was </p><p>ready for them!” </p><p> Douglass watched the synthetic beings in</p><p>peculiar fascination. His brows were con- </p><p>tracted into a frown that bordened on stark</p><p>terror. It seemed to him that something </p><p>like an electric current passed from the </p><p>tubes to Dr. Pontius, making him as rigid </p><p>as steel. The scientist gripped the arms of </p><p>his chair so tightly that his knuckles showed </p><p>white and bloodless. </p><p> So distinct was the impression of the re-</p><p>porter that there was some mystic, unfath- </p><p>omable tie between Dr. Pontius and his syn- </p><p>thetic creations, that he almost dropped his </p><p>704 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>pencil. With a startled gasp he pocketed </p><p>it safely with his papers and fumbled ner- </p><p>vously for a cigarette. His taut nerves were </p><p>shattering and he had a strange premonition </p><p>that something was going to happen. </p><p>Something dire and untoward. A weird </p><p>chill seemed to permeate the room suggest- </p><p>ing violence and death. It made the re- </p><p>porter experience hot and cold sensations </p><p>from head to foot. </p><p> Dr. Pontius watched his subjects in si-</p><p>lence. A sense of awe and apprehension </p><p>placed itself upon him. There was a mark- </p><p>ed change of expression in the faces of the </p><p>synthetic men in the tubes. Gone was their </p><p>seemingly lifeless sleep. Their emerald- </p><p>green eyes that were flecked with fire stared </p><p>out into the gloomy laboratory with un- </p><p>blinking steadiness. The bodies began to </p><p>squirm suddenly, weakly. The creature </p><p>that had appeared on the verge of death </p><p>had strangely taken on new life. He show- </p><p>ed even more strength now than the other. </p><p> Then Douglass felt the full force of their</p><p>stare. As they swung their fiery eyes upon </p><p>him, he felt a sensation of nausea in his vit- </p><p>als. His stomach seemed to turn over com- </p><p>pletely. There was a powerful something </p><p>in the eyes of the creature that made him </p><p>shudder and feel sick. It seemed to him </p><p>that a faint, diabolical grin formed on their </p><p>lips, remaining as if glued there. </p><p> “God!” he mumbled under his breath.</p><p>“What a terrible curse they are to human- </p><p>ity!” </p><p> His eyes flashed grimly as he fought to</p><p>remove them from the leering faces behind </p><p>the glass. Dr. Pontius eyed him thought- </p><p>fully and laughed quietly. He spoke in an </p><p>almost inaudible whisper that made the re- </p><p>porter start. </p><p> “I will ask you to remain as my guest</p><p>tonight, Douglass,” Pontius hissed softly, </p><p>tensely. “I will need your help.” </p><p> The reporter stiffened. He stared for a</p><p>moment apprehensively at the scientist, then </p><p>shook his head. </p><p> “I’m sorry, sir,” he whispered nervously.</p><p>“I cannot possibly remain. The service is </p><p>waiting for my press copy—” </p><p> “Tut! Tut!” Pontius countered. “Un-</p><p>mistakeably you are afraid.” </p><p> Douglass smiled grimly, his lips feeling</p><p>strangely tight across the teeth. “I am </p><p>uneasy,” he snapped in muffled tones, “but </p><p>not afraid. I have seen men hanged and </p><p>electrocuted, and dead, decayed bodies in </p><p>the police morgues. As a reporter I’ve had </p><p>to handle some, but never have I encoun- </p><p>tered such a horrible experience as this. </p><p>No, Dr. Pontius, I am not afraid. I beg </p><p>to be excused, nevertheless.” </p><p>Help Needed </p><p>DR. Pontius shrugged resignedly. “Of </p><p>course I would not hold you here </p><p>against your wishes,” he muttered disap- </p><p>pointedly. “I thought you would welcome </p><p>the chance to aid me as a means of better- </p><p>ing your story. It will be necessary to re- </p><p>move my subjects from the tubes tonight. </p><p>It is too big a job for me to handle alone. </p><p>I will have to call on my niece for help if </p><p>you insist on going.” </p><p> “You mean you would get a woman’s</p><p>help?” Douglass inquired dumbly, incred- </p><p>ulously. “Why, you don’t even know what </p><p>the creatures might do!” </p><p> “You are correct, young man,” said Pon-</p><p>tius stiffly. “I don’t know what will hap- </p><p>pen. But Allanna, my niece, has often </p><p>helped in the laboratory- In fact she seems </p><p>quite fond of my subjects.” </p><p> Douglass shuddered again and cursed his</p><p>own emotions of fear. He was afraid to </p><p>remain and knew it. Something in his sub- </p><p>conscious mind advised him to go, but a </p><p>greater force held him. He could hardly </p><p>picture a woman, doubtlessly young, hand- </p><p>ling such awful creatures as the tubes con- </p><p>tained. He realized that if the subjects </p><p>became uncontrollable, old Dr. Pontius </p><p>would be little protection for his niece. </p><p>What then? He would never be able to </p><p>forgive himself if anything happened in the </p><p>place after his departure. </p><p> Before he could prevent himself from</p><p>giving his final answer, the words fairly </p><p>splurged from his tight lips. “Then I’ll</p><p>remain, Dr. Pontius,” he whispered, squirm- </p><p>ing uneasily in his seat, “not because I </p><p>want to, but for your protection. Some- </p><p>thing might happen. I have a hunch—” </p><p>THE SYNTHETIC MEN </p><p>705 </p><p> “That’s fine, Douglass,” the scientist in-</p><p>terjected. “Just remove your coat. I’ll </p><p>give you a robe after I call Allanna.” </p><p> “You—you are going to bring your niece</p><p>in anyhow?” the reporter gasped brokenly. </p><p> Dr. Pontius nodded grimly. “She</p><p>wouldn't want to miss it,” he mumbled. </p><p>“In fact she asked that I let her in on the </p><p>work. I’ll need her, too, for she’s a trained </p><p>nurse.” </p><p> The scientist turned to his desk phone,</p><p>lifted the receiver and pressed a button on </p><p>the call-box. Douglass thought he heard </p><p>the faint tinkle of a bell not far away and </p><p>wondered if Allanna lived with her uncle </p><p>in the big house that was built around the </p><p>laboratory. His thoughts were diverted by </p><p>Pontius’ muffled voice. </p><p> “Allanna,” the scientist half-whispered.</p><p>“Can you come to the laboratory at once? </p><p>The lime has arrived to remove the subjects </p><p>from the tubes.” </p><p> The reporter shivered slightly as he be-</p><p>gan removing his coat. The sound of a </p><p>musical voice reached him as it came over </p><p>the wire to the scientist. </p><p> “Why of course,” he heard Allanna’s</p><p>reply. “I was just wondering when it </p><p>would happen. But isn’t it a trifle early?” </p><p> “Ordinarily they should not have been</p><p>removed until the end of this week,” Dr. </p><p>Pontius said, controlling a voice that was </p><p>filled with excitement and suspense. “The </p><p>awakening is a bit premature due to the vib- </p><p>rations from some sirens. Then you will </p><p>be right down?” </p><p> “Right away, Uncle Cliff,” she replied</p><p>a trifle eagerly. “Anyone there to help?” </p><p> Dr. Pontius automatically glanced at the</p><p>reporter. Douglass stood coatless, rolling </p><p>his sleeves. </p><p> “Mi”. Douglass, a reporter, is here, Al-</p><p>lanna,” responded the scientist. “He will </p><p>help.” </p><p> “Oh,” said the feminine voice. “Not</p><p>much there, but it will come in handy. </p><p>I’ll be right down.” </p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p>The Creatures Live </p><p>TIE reporter’s face reddened and his ears </p><p>stung at the insinuation of the invisible </p><p>woman. Before he had time to decide if he </p><p>resented it, Dr. Pontius grinned up at him, </p><p>went softly to a closet and handed him a </p><p>linen gown. </p><p> “Protect your clothes, Douglass,” he said</p><p>quickly. “You’ll find this an unpleasant </p><p>job.” </p><p> Douglass agreed silently that it was not</p><p>the least bit inviting. Inwardly he re- </p><p>belled at the thought of touching the greasy </p><p>subjects in the huge tubes, but he steeled </p><p>himself to the impending ordeal. Quickly </p><p>he donned the gown, then glanced at the </p><p>synthetic creatures. </p><p> The diabolical grins that had been on</p><p>their lips had given away to murderous </p><p>leers. The reporter recoiled a trifle when </p><p>one of them cast him a side-long glance. </p><p>Twin jets of fire seemed to come from those </p><p>fiery eyes to sear his very soul. They bit </p><p>into him like blades. He turned to Pon- </p><p>tius. </p><p> “Are you sure that it will be safe to re-</p><p>lease them, doc?” he inquired tensely. </p><p> The scientist tied the belt of his gown be-</p><p>hind his back and looked at the reporter </p><p>calmly. </p><p> “Certainly!” he replied nonchalantly.</p><p>“Moreover it must be done, otherwise they </p><p>will die and rhy life’s work will go for noth- </p><p>ing.” </p><p> “What do you plan to do with them?”</p><p>Douglass blurted. </p><p> “That, I have not fully decided,” Dr. Pon-</p><p>tius stated, advancing. “For the present, </p><p>I’m going to try to teach them to be house </p><p>servants and drill a little sense into them.” </p><p> “Then they will emerge from the tubes</p><p>dumb and witless?”</p><p> Dr. Pontius laughed quietly, but Doug-</p><p>lass noticed that it was a dull, humorless </p><p>laugh. Then his face sobered and his eyes </p><p>sparkled with the mysterious light of func- </p><p>tioning genius. </p><p> “An infant is dumb and witless when it</p><p>is born, Douglass,” he nodded. “My sub- </p><p>706 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>jects are men in stature but will emerge </p><p>from the test tubes with the intellect of a </p><p>five-year old. I will be forced to develop </p><p>their brains, such as they have. The brain </p><p>runs second in all human mysteries and </p><p>while 1 have succeeded in creating synthe- </p><p>tic life, I do not profess to have solved the </p><p>mystery of thought and subconscious phen- </p><p>omena. Perhaps the next experiment will </p><p>show better results in that line.” </p><p> The reporter gasped aloud with a sucking</p><p>in of breath. “Then you are actually going </p><p>to try it again?” he asked, mouth agape. </p><p> Dr. Pontius was on the verge of making</p><p>a reply when the door bell tinkled. His at- </p><p>tention was diverted and drawn to the lock </p><p>control. He went to his desk hurriedly </p><p>and pressed the button. Douglass glanced </p><p>at the door expectantly and in a moment it </p><p>swung open. Into the dismal room walked </p><p>the only bit of sunshine he had seen since </p><p>arriving hours before. </p><p> Allanna was like a beautiful flower in an</p><p>ugly vase. She was young and fairly rad- </p><p>iated sunshine. Her cheeks seemed to glow </p><p>even under the subdued illumination of the </p><p>dreary, dismal laboratory; and her eyes, a </p><p>deeper shade of blue than the scientist’s, </p><p>sparkled with a frank, understanding ten- </p><p>derness. She was dressed in the spotless </p><p>white of a trained nurse. From under her </p><p>starched cap protruded curling whisps of </p><p>auburn hair. </p><p> Douglass felt that never before had he</p><p>beheld such a beautiful girl. Before her </p><p>arrival, he had mentally visioned her as </p><p>skinny, curt and undemonstrative. He was </p><p>completely bowled over now and he gaped </p><p>at her in astonishment when she paused a </p><p>few feet away from him. </p><p> “Good evening!” she said in a soft, musi-</p><p>cal voice. “You are Mr. Douglass?” </p><p> The newspaper man shook his head eag-</p><p>erly, forgetting entirely that he was im- </p><p>mersed in the dreary gloom of a womb of </p><p>science. </p><p> “Douglass—Morton Douglass,” he stam-</p><p>mered. “You are Allanna, Dr. Pontius’</p><p>niece?” </p><p> She smiled warmly. “Uncle calls me Al-</p><p>lie,” she said. “I’ve read and digested many </p><p>of your scientific articles, Mr. Douglass, and </p><p>found them charmingly written and precise- </p><p>ly correct.” </p><p> “Thank you, Miss Allanna,” he grinned.</p><p>“There's nothing more disgusting than rot- </p><p>ten scientific reports. I strive to get mine </p><p>correct. That is why I am here tonight— </p><p>to get your uncle’s startling discoveries first </p><p>hand.” </p><p> They were interrupted by Dr. Pontius.</p><p>“No need to introduce you two,” he chuck- </p><p>led quietly. “You’ll get along. Now let’s </p><p>get busy. Allie, you know what to do. </p><p>Mr. Douglass will help me with the tubes.” </p><p>SUDDENLY Dr. Pontius snapped an </p><p>electric switch. Instantly the labora- </p><p>tory became a place of brilliant light. The </p><p>young Mr. Douglass gave a start. His pulse </p><p>beat a tattoo at his temples. Quickly he </p><p>glanced around the room. The gloom had </p><p>vanished and he found that the place was </p><p>not so sal as it had been under the glow </p><p>of the single frosted desk lamp. Yet the </p><p>peculiar revulsion for it all still clung to </p><p>him. The four human skeletons stood out </p><p>now in high relief against the wall. Their </p><p>sightless sockets seemed concentrated upon </p><p>him. He winced at a discovery. </p><p> The skeletons were not wired at all as</p><p>he had suspected! They were indeed fr&lt;¥sh, </p><p>green bones partly dissolved in the devas- </p><p>tating green jelly! With a sinking feeling </p><p>he withdrew his popping eyes from them </p><p>and glanced at Allie. She was making </p><p>ready two operating tables in the center of </p><p>the room. Her back was turned to him so </p><p>that she did not observe the panicky look in </p><p>his eyes and the pallor in his cheeks. </p><p> He was glad of it for he did not want her</p><p>to think him a coward. He could have </p><p>faced death easily knowing what confronted </p><p>him. But here in this place of unknown </p><p>things, unnatural life and inhuman sorcery, </p><p>he was all but completely unnerved. Nor </p><p>could he have been blamed for it. Only </p><p>long association with such dreadful things </p><p>could make a man or woman indifferent to </p><p>them. Neither Allie or her uncle minded</p><p>the strange combination of life and death </p><p>in the least. </p><p> The place now seemed like a sepulchre.</p><p>The silence was oppressing. The very at- </p><p>THE SYNTHETIC MEN </p><p>707 </p><p>l&amp;osphere was filled with a high tension, as </p><p>if a bomb lay in the middle of the place </p><p>with a burning fuse nearing the deadly </p><p>charge of explosives. Douglass sensed dan- </p><p>ger of an unknown degree and turned to </p><p>the tubes to see the synthetic creatures ap- </p><p>praising him greedily. </p><p> Dr. Pontius motioned to him from where</p><p>he stood, just beside the first tube. Inside </p><p>of it the creature leered, his lips curled into </p><p>the snarl of a savage jungle beast. The </p><p>reporter looked hard at him and found that </p><p>he* was no longer transparent. He glanced </p><p>at the other man. Gone also was his trans- </p><p>parency and he appraised the scientist </p><p>questioningly. As though he sensed what </p><p>lay in the reporter’s mind, Dr. Pontius vol- </p><p>untarily enlightened him. </p><p> “They were made transparent by this N-</p><p>Ray projector,” he pointed to the globe </p><p>above them. “I arranged that so I could </p><p>see what was taking place within their ana- </p><p>tomies at all times. But you will find that </p><p>they have a healthy look now.” </p><p> The newspaperman looked at them again.</p><p>Indeed they did appear healthy. Their skin </p><p>seemed like green silk and as smooth as </p><p>silk. But it still seemed ghastly and un- </p><p>earthly. Something about it created a sense </p><p>of horror in the reporter. His soul rebelled </p><p>against them and he wondered if Miss Al- </p><p>lanna or her uncle had any such feelings. </p><p> Before he had time to inquire about it,</p><p>Dr. Pontius announced himself ready to re- </p><p>move his subjects. The reporter’s blood </p><p>pounded. His lips lightened across his </p><p>teeth again and his hands went into balls of </p><p>muscle and bone voluntarily. He watched </p><p>the scientist as he began removing the sus- </p><p>taining bands from about the tube. Doug- </p><p>less felt his flesh creep. He stiffened </p><p>strangely when Allie came up and stood be- </p><p>side him, their elbows brushing. She spoke </p><p>to him in a very low whisper. </p><p> “Aren’t you thrilled, Mr. Douglass?'’ she</p><p>asked, bubbling over with excitement. “I </p><p>think it’s wonderful!” </p><p> “Yes, er—I am, Miss Allanna,” he replied</p><p>shakily. “I’m so thrilled that my spine</p><p>shivers! ” </p><p> She gave an almost silent laugh and he</p><p>felt her deep-blue eyes upon him. Fearful </p><p>lest she discover his weakness, he did not </p><p>look at her, but watched instead, the crea- </p><p>ture within the tube that Dr. Pontius was </p><p>working on. The leering subject was gaz- </p><p>ing at his creator now, the tips of his fin- </p><p>gers working convulsively as though eager </p><p>to get at the throat of the scientist. </p><p> “Aren’t you the least bit afraid, Miss Al-</p><p>lanna?” Douglass blurted suddenly. She </p><p>chuckled. </p><p> “Not in the least,” she replied sincerely.</p><p>“Are you, Mr. Douglass?” </p><p>Delicate Work </p><p>HE ventured a glance at her. She was </p><p>watching her uncle. Her face was </p><p>aglow with expectantcy. Not a single quiv- </p><p>er of revulsion ran through her and the re- </p><p>porter marvelled at her remarkable equam- </p><p>nity in the face of such horrors. She was </p><p>as calloused to them as her distinguished </p><p>uncle. </p><p> “Now,” said Pontius crisply. “One more</p><p>thing to do, and then we’ll be ready to re- </p><p>move them.” </p><p> He wheeled over to the tube a large stand,</p><p>the lower part of which held a box on which </p><p>were a row of black buttons. A long thick </p><p>rod projected upward to a qpeer-looking </p><p>metal globe. Pontius adjusted the stand in </p><p>front of his creation, and sighting along </p><p>it for a moment, pressed one of the black </p><p>buttons. Instantly a sharp dazzling beam </p><p>of light, emanating from the globe, bathed </p><p>the synthetic man in its glow. For a mo- </p><p>ment, as Douglass gazed in awe, the crea- </p><p>ture remained motionless then his arms be- </p><p>gan to move slowly up and down through </p><p>the confining liquid, and his features took </p><p>on the look of one awakening from a long </p><p>sleep. </p><p> “Now, Douglass,” said Pontius suddenly,</p><p>“on the other side of the tube, you will find </p><p>a crank. Turn it slowly in a clockwise di- </p><p>rection until the tube is inclined fifteen </p><p>degrees. Then we’ll open up the tube and </p><p>release our good friend.”</p><p> Hesitantly the reporter went to obey. He</p><p>grasped the handles as directed and was </p><p>amazed to feel ihe tube slowly incline. </p><p>When the inclination had reached fifteen </p><p>708 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>degrees, he opened up the tube, leaving the </p><p>synthetic man exposed as though he stood </p><p>upright in a glass coffin. </p><p> Expecting to see the creature fall out of</p><p>the tube and at him, Douglass quickly set </p><p>the half-tube aside and partly crouched. </p><p>The being stared at him strangely but made </p><p>no effort to get out. </p><p> “I don’t believe Joe Agar would hurt a</p><p>flea,” laughed Allanna, amused at the re- </p><p>porter’s actions. </p><p> Douglass calmed easily. “Joe Agar?”</p><p>he squinted at her, curiously. “Is that </p><p>what you are going to call the creature?” </p><p>“What else could we name him, Mr. </p><p>Douglass?” Allanna smiled. “Agar is the </p><p>substance from which they sprung. Hence </p><p>the name. The other one is Jack. Their </p><p>names are Joe and Jack Agar.” </p><p> “Brothers under the skin?” the reporter</p><p>grimaced. </p><p> “Deeper than that, Mr. Douglass,” the</p><p>girl replied quickly. </p><p> Her attention was suddenly drawn to her</p><p>uncle who spoke softly at her. </p><p> “Are you ready to receive him, Allie?”</p><p>the scientist asked without pausing in his </p><p>work. “Strait-jackets for emergency, ether </p><p>and all that?” </p><p> “Yes, doctor,” she responded, dropping</p><p>all interest in everything but her profes- </p><p>sional duty as a trained nurse. </p><p> “Then take your post,” Dr. Pontius or-</p><p>dered curtly. He turned to the reporter. </p><p>“Douglass, you stand ready to support the </p><p>subject in event his weakness causes him </p><p>to topple when I let the jelly out into the </p><p>hole at the bottom of the tube.” </p><p> “Weak, eh?” Douglass muttered to him-</p><p>self. “I’m damned glad of that. Makes </p><p>me feel better.” </p><p> “What’s tBat, young man?” Dr. Pontius</p><p>snapped sharply. </p><p> “Nothing, sir,” responded the reporter.</p><p>“I was just humming a tune.” </p><p> “Good!” ejaculated the scientist. “I like</p><p>to have around me, men who are fearless </p><p>and callous. You are improving, sir.” </p><p>“Thank you, doc,” Douglass said evenly. </p><p>Then to himself: “If he only knew the </p><p>truth!” </p><p> Douglass was so utterly startled by a sud-</p><p>den groan from the curled lips of Joe Agar </p><p>that his face turned even more pale. The </p><p>creature sagged forward a trifle as the jelly </p><p>slowly filtered through the now opened </p><p>hole. Instinctively but revulsively, the re- </p><p>porter reached forward to support him. </p><p>His hands touched the greasy body. It felt </p><p>as clammy as the skin of a snake and it </p><p>made him tremble. He felt his flesh creep, </p><p>but stood rigid, both hands under the arm- </p><p>pit of the artificial man. </p><p> CHAPTER IV</p><p> The First Death</p><p>JOE Agar swung his steady unblinking </p><p>gaze upon the newspaper man. Doug- </p><p>lass avoided the green eyes by concentra- </p><p>ting on the creature’s hairless head and </p><p>aboriginal brow. He shook almost violent- </p><p>ly, for the somber, ominous atmosphere with </p><p>its invisible menace, was striking deeply at </p><p>his soul. Danger seemed to lurk on every </p><p>hand and the reporter sensed it even more </p><p>when the final protecting fluid had slipped </p><p>from the creature’s body. </p><p> Instantly Joe Agar toppled limply into</p><p>the reporter’s arms. The scientist quickly </p><p>went to his aid *:nd together they carried </p><p>the weak synthetic creature to a table. Al- </p><p>lanna had spread upon it clean sheets and </p><p>blankets. She stood at its head, a mask </p><p>in one hand and an ether container in the </p><p>other. Evidently they had not expected the </p><p>creature to emerge in such a weakened con- </p><p>dition and they were ready to subdue him </p><p>if need be. He was placed under the blan- </p><p>kets and the girl laid aside her instruments </p><p>of mercy. </p><p> “He is too weak to be harmful,” she</p><p>said calmly, “and too feeble to stand an </p><p>anasthetic.” </p><p> “That is correct, Allie,’' said her uncle.</p><p>“His respiration is dangerously low. Just </p><p>cover him well and let him sleep until morn- </p><p>ing. I think he’ll be alright. Now Mr. </p><p>Douglass, if you don’t mind, we’ll remove </p><p>the other one.” </p><p> Silently they returned to the tubes leav-</p><p>ing Miss Allanna bending over Joe Agar </p><p>with a stethoscope attached to her ears. </p><p>THE SYNTHETIC MEN </p><p>709 </p><p>He heard her gasp and glanced over his </p><p>shoulders. She was looking after her uncle </p><p>questioningly but said nothing. There came </p><p>a dismal groan from the table. Dr. Pon- </p><p>tius turned suddenly and retraced his steps </p><p>toward it. </p><p> “What was that, Allie?” he asked appre-</p><p>hensively, as though sensing something un- </p><p>toward in the sound that had escaped his </p><p>subject’s lips. </p><p> Miss Allanna looked up at him curious-</p><p>ly. “I—I don’t know,” she replied softly. </p><p>“Unless he is dying.” </p><p> Douglass came up beside her and looked</p><p>into the grotesque face on the sheets. Joe </p><p>Agar seemed to be breathing his last. His </p><p>lips were still curled into a foreboding </p><p>sneer and his lids were wide. A purple </p><p>rash stood out on his brown and a greenish </p><p>liquid perspiration fairly surged from his </p><p>over-large pores. </p><p> “Why, he’s dying!” exclaimed the re-</p><p>porter with a feeling akin to genuine joy. </p><p>Through his mind raced a wild thought. </p><p>“I hope he does!” he thought. “A thing </p><p>dies, then we’ll only have one, his brother, </p><p>to reckon with! No doubt about it, they </p><p>seemed to have taken a form of life to pur- </p><p>posely revenge themselves on man who vio- </p><p>lated all laws of nature!” </p><p> “Silence!” snapped Dr. Pontius with a</p><p>scowl. He reached up suddenly and took a </p><p>green bottle from the shelf. As if ordered </p><p>to do so by mental telepathy, Allanna pull- </p><p>ed one of Joe Agar’s arms out into the open. </p><p>Dr. Pontius emptied the contents of the bot- </p><p>tle into a glass tube under the table and </p><p>calmly began to transfer it to the veins of </p><p>the dying subject. Douglass shuddered as </p><p>a silver tube was inserted in the artery of </p><p>the arm, and turned away, appalled. Some- </p><p>thing drew him to the other creature. He </p><p>paused in front of the big tube, to stare </p><p>meditatively at the leering features of Jack </p><p>Agar. </p><p> He felt an urge to bolt the place, then</p><p>suddenly he came down to earth. If he ran </p><p>out on this terrifying experiment, he would </p><p>never hear the end of it. After all, he was</p><p>a newspaper man on an important story. </p><p>He must continue with the ordeal whether </p><p>he wanted to or not despite the fact that Jack </p><p>Agar was going to be more difficult to han- </p><p>dle than the other. </p><p> Jack Agar virtually chewed at his lips in</p><p>a strange, sinister emotion of savagery. </p><p>Muscles seemed to bulge under his silky </p><p>skin. His fingers twitched with the rest- </p><p>lessness of a mad man. Douglass realized </p><p>that there was nothing weak about him. He </p><p>heard Dr. Pontius emit a dismayed groan </p><p>and turned. Allanna was working a small </p><p>pulmotor frantically, but the scientist waved </p><p>her aside. </p><p> “Never mind, Allanna,” he said omin-</p><p>ously. “He’s done! Dead!” </p><p>THE reporter shrugged as she pulled a </p><p>sheet over the greenwhite face. Across </p><p>his lips flashed a smile. Piously he glanc- </p><p>ed upward and shook his head as though </p><p>to offer thanks to the invisible Creator of </p><p>all things, for having interfered with this </p><p>horrible violation of nature’s laws. He </p><p>heard Allanna stifle a sob, and wondered </p><p>if she mourned the death of the synthetic </p><p>creature. But no, it was not that. She </p><p>sympathized with her uncle who stood be- </p><p>side the bed dejectedly, like a man who has </p><p>lost his all. He jerked erect suddenly and </p><p>came toward the reporter. </p><p> “We’re not beaten yet, Douglass!” he</p><p>muttered. “I rather suspected Joe Agar </p><p>would pass on, but I have little fear for </p><p>Jack. He’ll live to prove my father’s dis- </p><p>coveries to the world.” </p><p> “I hope so, Dr. Pontius,” lied Douglass</p><p>glibly. Yet he felt genuine sorrow for the </p><p>old scientist who had spent his life to evolve </p><p>man, then be forced to watch the results of </p><p>his genius die at the point of success. “He </p><p>is indeed filled with vigor and—uncon- </p><p>trolled deviltry.” </p><p> “You are right!” Dr. Pontius replied</p><p>promptly. “He has developed far beyond </p><p>his brother. That is why I valued his life </p><p>more. Though he has scarcely less than </p><p>the brute capacity of the simians and will </p><p>be hard to control. Still, I have no fear </p><p>of him, for I will bend him to my will by </p><p>hypnotic suggestion.”</p><p> Douglass somewhat doubted the genuine-</p><p>ness of the scientist’s expressed fearlessness. </p><p>There was something in his tone now that </p><p>710 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>belied a kind of fear for the creature in the </p><p>tube, but the reporter argued with himself </p><p>that it might be a tone of sadness at the </p><p>death of Joe Agar. Yet his uneasiness in- </p><p>creased and he stirred restlessly while Dr. </p><p>Pontius dismantled the tube. He watched </p><p>with unrestrained forebodings. </p><p> Jack Agar possessed the strength of a</p><p>maniac. This might appear strange con- </p><p>sidering the fact that the creature had never </p><p>been permitted to move freely. But Dr. </p><p>Pontius had used special care to build up </p><p>his muscular system. Scarcely had the re- </p><p>porter removed the front section of the tube </p><p>than the synthetic man lashed out with a </p><p>frenzied left hand to clutch at him. </p><p> “Hadn’t you better use a hypodermic</p><p>needle on him, Dr. Pontius?” he asked, </p><p>trembling. Then he' added in a grim whis- </p><p>per: ‘Til sock him square on the button if </p><p>I have to!” </p><p> “No! No! No!” said Dr. Pontius severely.</p><p>“The shock may forever weaken his senses. </p><p>Do not raise a hand against him, young </p><p>man! I warn you!” </p><p> Douglass suddenly sensed the nearness</p><p>of Allanna. She had crept up unnoticed to </p><p>watch the work of releasing the bestial sub- </p><p>ject and had sen Jack Agar’s savage thrust </p><p>at the reporter. There was an unmistakable </p><p>expression of alarm on her features, yet she </p><p>seemed calm and collected. She peered in- </p><p>tently into the maniacal face of the strug- </p><p>gling creature, her deep-blue eyes boring in- </p><p>to him steadily. </p><p> As though compelled to do so by some</p><p>powerful, invisible force, Jack Agar grad- </p><p>ually ceased his struggles. The green fire </p><p>seemed to vanish from his eyes. They be- </p><p>came soft and languid as the eyes of a child </p><p>looking up into his mother’s kindly face </p><p>appealingly. Still, Douglass thought he </p><p>detected an evil gleam in the look. His </p><p>gaze traveled from the creature to Allanna. </p><p>Across her lips flashed a pleased smile. </p><p> “Be a good boy, Jack,” she whispered soft-</p><p>ly, never moving her eyes from him for an </p><p>instant. But whether Jack Agar understood </p><p>what she said, Douglass could not decide.</p><p>He very much doubted it however and won- </p><p>dered what force she had applied to him </p><p>to bring him to submission. Had she used </p><p>hypnotic suggestion or just plain hypnotism </p><p>on a weaker will? Or was the creature </p><p>merely fascinated by the charm of the girl </p><p>and did the evil gleam in his eyes spell ill </p><p>for her? Whatever it was, she had certain- </p><p>ly subdued him, her eyes soothing him like </p><p>music soothes the savage beast. </p><p> Dr. Pontius glanced at her presently.</p><p>“He’ll be alright now, Allie,” he said </p><p>smoothly. “You may rest a moment. You </p><p>must be tired now.” </p><p> “Oh, I’m alright, Uncle Mark,” she re-</p><p>sponded, trembling slightly. “You can go </p><p>ahead. The table is ready.” </p><p> CHAPTER V</p><p> Uneasy Hours</p><p>THE scientist gave her a warm, affection- </p><p>ate smile and turned again to the tube. </p><p>Quickly he surveyed the silent, foreboding </p><p>subject whose eyes followed Allanna as she </p><p>turned away. Douglass crouched instinc- </p><p>tively expecting the creature to leap from </p><p>his coffin of glass. But Jack Agar made </p><p>no such move. He seemed thoroughly fas- </p><p>cinated by the girl and watched her stead- </p><p>ily through unblinking eyes. The reporter </p><p>was amazed to see Dr. Pontius lead him eas- </p><p>ily from his container directly to the table. </p><p>He followed cautiously, tensely, ready for </p><p>any sudden outbreak from the synthetic </p><p>man. </p><p> With his subject prone on the table, Dr.</p><p>Pontius lost no time in strapping him down </p><p>by the ankles and wrists. Jack Agar made </p><p>no protest but kept his orbs glued on Al- </p><p>lanna. Reaching to the wall quickly, the </p><p>scientist grasped a cord and lowered a </p><p>great, green-shaded lamp of the same pro- </p><p>portions as the table. Without hesitation </p><p>he switched on a biilliant light that sprayed </p><p>the subject with an emerald glare. Jack </p><p>Agar writhed as though he lay on a bed of </p><p>coals. His muscles bulged and snapped; </p><p>then Dr. Pontius flicked his open hand be- </p><p>fore his face like a hypnotist working on a </p><p>subject. The synthetic man ceased his strug- </p><p>gles and lay still under the flood of light. </p><p> The reporter heaved a sigh of relief. He</p><p>opened his clenched fists and relaxed his </p><p>THE SYNTHETIC MEN </p><p>711 </p><p>numbed fingers. The nails had bitten into </p><p>the palms, leaving crescent scars. His </p><p>hands trembled in reaction to the released </p><p>tension. Suddenly he found himself weak, </p><p>very weak. Dr. Pontius appraised him, </p><p>glancing at his watch. </p><p> “It is after midnight, Douglass,” he said,</p><p>showing no reaction to the strain and un- </p><p>certainly of his work. “Perhaps you had </p><p>better retire. Allie will show you to a </p><p>guest room.” </p><p> “You sure you won’t need me again to-</p><p>night, Dr. Pontius?” the reporter inquired </p><p>dismally. </p><p> The scientist nodded. “No, Douglass,”</p><p>he said simply. “I will not need you. Let </p><p>me thank you for your help.” </p><p> They shook hands. “Then if you don’t</p><p>mind, I will retire,” replied Douglass, ris- </p><p>ing. He walked over and stood beside the </p><p>table for a moment to stare at the synthetic </p><p>man. Jack lay perfectly still now, as still </p><p>as his sheet-covered brother near him. His </p><p>unblinking eyes stared upward at the bril- </p><p>liant, illuminated tubes in the flood-lamp. </p><p> Douglass felt a nauseating sensation surg-</p><p>ing through him as he peered into those </p><p>dread orbs. They reminded him of a pic- </p><p>ture of Satan he had once seen. The eyes </p><p>had been wide and menacing. He felt the </p><p>roots of his hair tangle. He turned away </p><p>with a desire to quit the place forever. </p><p>When he confronted Allanna he recalled </p><p>quickly that he had a hunch, a persistent </p><p>premonition that something was going to </p><p>happen. Seeing her again caused him to </p><p>forget instantly his desire to leave. Her </p><p>sunny smile again captivated him. </p><p> She held his coat and hat in her hands.</p><p>“You will not need the gown any more, Mr. </p><p>Douglass,” she said. Her voice was soft </p><p>and cheery. He had forgotten about the </p><p>white linen gown he wore and quickly shed </p><p>it. She helped him with his coat and to- </p><p>gether they went out of the ghostly labora- </p><p>tory, leaving Dr. Pontius alone with his </p><p>skeletons and his subjects, life and death </p><p>and evil shadows hovering about him. </p><p> “Is your uncle going to work all night,</p><p>Miss Allanna?” the reporter inquired as </p><p>they entered a door leading off from the </p><p>hallway and began mounting a pair of wind- </p><p>ing stairs that creaked under their weight. </p><p>The sounds made the reporter shiver, for </p><p>they sounded mysterious, spectral. </p><p> “I do not believe so,” she said promptly.</p><p>“But he has much work to do. You see, he </p><p>plans to preserve the body of Joe Agar and </p><p>intends to place it in the preservatives to- </p><p>night.” </p><p> “Going to pickle him?” the reporter</p><p>gasped. </p><p> The clear ring of her corresponding laugh</p><p>made him turn to look at her. She flashed </p><p>him a serious glance. Could nothing ruffle </p><p>this girl’s cool indifference to the stark real- </p><p>ities of the place? lie wandered if anything </p><p>could suspend or break her callousness even </p><p>temporarily. </p><p> “That’s it precisely,” she commented soft-</p><p>ly. “The delicatc texture of artificial flesh </p><p>makes preservation necessary at once. Now </p><p>that Joe Agar is dead, Uncle Cliff wants </p><p>the preserved body to go to Tyburn Col- </p><p>lege.” </p><p>THE house of Dr. Pontius, the reporter </p><p>soon discovered, was almost as weird </p><p>and spectral as his laboratory. Indirect il- </p><p>lumination made it a place of lurking shad- </p><p>ows that seemed to blend perfectly with the </p><p>mystery of the man himself. In the living </p><p>room to which Allanna guided him were </p><p>many preserved specimens of life, arranged </p><p>in glass containers on shelves and pedestals. </p><p>The entire room shrieked silence and dark </p><p>mystery. Allanna was the only bright ob- </p><p>ject in the place and Douglass was glad to </p><p>rest his tired eyes upon her sunny face and </p><p>supple form. </p><p> She invited him to the divan and for the</p><p>first time since his arrival he regained some </p><p>of his composure. </p><p> “Did I hear you say you were busy every</p><p>evening, Miss Allanna?” he inquired </p><p>strategically to pave a way for future meet- </p><p>ings. She appraised him cooly. </p><p> “Oh, no,” she replied, suppressing a</p><p>yawn. “I have several nights open.” </p><p> “That’s excellent!” he applauded happi-</p><p>ly. “Flow about the others?” </p><p> “Well,” she said mischievously, “you</p><p>wouldn’t expect a girl to be without at </p><p>least one boy friend, would you?” </p><p>712 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p> The reporter felt a vague feeling of jeal-</p><p> ousy surge through him. His lips tightened</p><p> strangely again, but in jealous embarrass'</p><p> ment.</p><p> “Not a beautiful girl like you,” he said,</p><p> slightly confused. “But I was hoping that</p><p> I might see you more than several nights a</p><p> wekk.”</p><p> Allanna shrugged and was about to re-</p><p>ply when Dr. Pontius came suddenly into </p><p>the room. He was smiling oddly. </p><p> “You are indeed a fast-working young</p><p>man, Douglass,” he said. “1 wish you </p><p>luck!” He turned to his niece. “Hadn’t </p><p>you better retire for your beauty sleep, </p><p>Allie?” </p><p> Allanna yawned and stood up. “I believe</p><p>I shall, Uncle Mark,” she responded. “If </p><p>Mr. Douglass will excuse me . . . . </p><p> “Of course,” 3aid the reporter, his face</p><p> stinging. “Good night!”</p><p> Dr. Pontius cut him short. “Come along,</p><p>young man,” he ordered. “I’ll take you to </p><p>your room. The butler will call you for </p><p>breakfast.” </p><p> [' Side by side they followed Allanna to the</p><p> second floor. The house was as silent as a</p><p> tomb. Allanna flashed them a warm smile</p><p> as she turned into a room from the hall</p><p> above. Douglass’ blood raced at it, for it</p><p> had told him much.</p><p> As he entered his room directly across the</p><p> hall from the. one taken by Allanna, Doug-</p><p> lass felt a strange feeling come over him.</p><p> Just why, he did not understand, but he</p><p> seemed to sense the presence of death.</p><p> Something akin to a cold current shot</p><p> through his veins as he picked up a pair of</p><p> silken guest pajamas. He managed to con-</p><p> trol himself as he spread them out and spec-</p><p> ulated on the size. After undressing he</p><p> climbed into bed and counted sheep until</p><p> he fell into a troubled, restless slumber.</p><p> During the following hour, his subcon-</p><p>scious mind ran the entire gamut of sen- </p><p>sations. Wild dreams and nightmares made</p><p>him toss and roll. His lips became fever- </p><p>ish. From them escaped weird sounds that </p><p>in themselves even went to further terror- </p><p>ize him. They appeared to him to come </p><p>from the curling lips of the synthetic men. </p><p>The body of Joe Agar seemed to hover over </p><p> him like a dismal ghost. The wide, Satanic</p><p> orbs of the living Jack stared at him, burn-</p><p> ing like twin fires and searing his soul.</p><p> Then something happened that brought</p><p>Douglass wide awake. What was it? Was </p><p>his imagination mnning wild or had his </p><p>ears detected the faint, stealthy footsteps of </p><p>a bare-footed prowler? Sitting rigid in bed, </p><p>he waited for the sounds to reach his ears </p><p>again. The room was pitch dark. In </p><p>front of his eyes danced gray, ominous </p><p>shapes, the fancies of his strained vision. </p><p>Suddenly he heard what he thought sounded </p><p>like a dull thump, as though a body had </p><p>collided with a wall or the floor. Then the </p><p>silence became ominous. </p><p> Trembling from head to foot and chilled</p><p>to the marrow with a cold, clammy feeling, </p><p>he softly got out of bed and glided to the </p><p>door. A skylight over the hall bathed it </p><p>in a pale, phosphorescent glow from a high </p><p>moon. At a glance he saw that Dr. Pon- </p><p>tius’ door was open. His room was beside </p><p>Allanna’s and the scientist had closed his </p><p>door on entering. Douglass had seen that, </p><p>but why was it open now? Was Dr. Pontius </p><p>prowling around the house? He wondered </p><p>if the scientist had made the unnatural </p><p>sounds. </p><p>AS he watched the open door, Douglass </p><p>thought he saw a green ghastly face </p><p>appear in it for a moment. His blood ran </p><p>cold and his knees banged together. Not </p><p>a sound reached his ears, altho he listened </p><p>with his hands cupped behind them. </p><p> “Clang! Clang! Clang!” The great an-</p><p>tique clock in the living room chimed sud- </p><p>denly. Douglass almost screamed. Then a </p><p>grotesque face appeared in the scientist’s </p><p>doorway. The reporter recoiled like a </p><p>snake. Almost at once he heard the pad of </p><p>bare feet in the hall and by sheer force of </p><p>will was he able to look out again. </p><p> The hulking form of Jack Agar was re-</p><p>treating slowly down the hall! From his </p><p>wrists and ankles dangled the tom straps</p><p>that had held him to the table in the labor- </p><p>atory ! </p><p> “My God!” Douglass groaned through</p><p>dry, parched lips. As though hearing, Jack </p><p>Agar paused abruptly and turned his fiery </p><p>THE SYNTHETIC MEN </p><p>713 </p><p>eyes back from whence he had come. They </p><p>seemed like the orbs of a tiger flaming in </p><p>the night. Then he turned suddenly and en- </p><p>tered another room, two doors beyond the </p><p>one occupied by the scientist. More silence </p><p>followed, beating down upon the reporter </p><p>like the blows of a triphammer. </p><p> What had Jack Agar done in the scien-</p><p>tist’s room? It seemed to Douglass that his </p><p>hunch had materialized in the dead of a </p><p>horrible night. But had the synthetic man </p><p>actually_ killed his creator? The reporter </p><p>could wait no longer to find out. With a </p><p>bound he leaped into the hall and ran si- </p><p>lently to the opposite room. Without hesi- </p><p>tating he entered, fumbled for a light- </p><p>switch near the frame, and found it. The </p><p>switch snapped. </p><p> As part of his duty as a reporter, Doug-</p><p>lass, had seen men hanged. But now as he </p><p>crouched against the wall, he was terrified </p><p>and appalled at what his eyes beheld. Dr. </p><p>Pontius lay in a corner beside his bed, his </p><p>head crushed like an eggshell! </p><p> The reporter suddenly heard another dull</p><p>thump and a hiss of air from a dying man’s </p><p>lungs. Swiftly his mind searched for a pos- </p><p>sible meaning to this. Then it dawned up- </p><p>on him that the butler must have fall victim </p><p>to the terror that was slinking like a mad </p><p>gorilla through the house. He again heard </p><p>the indistinct pad of feet. His blood </p><p>throbbed at his throat and temples, sending </p><p>cold, clammy chills over him. Where </p><p>would the beast of the test tubes go next? </p><p>To his or Allanna’s room? </p><p> Douglass crouched just inside the death-</p><p>room door. A great shadow, ghastly and </p><p>spectral, fell across the sill. He felt an urge </p><p>to scream and smothered it. The murder- </p><p>beast slunk past, his long arms dangling </p><p>strangely at his bides, his lips curled into </p><p>the same ominous leer, his nude body glis- </p><p>tening under the light that filtered into the </p><p>hall. </p><p> The reporter was so utterly appalled that</p><p>his wits seemed dull. It was fully a minute </p><p>before he overcame his horror and stole a </p><p>glance into the hall. The synthetic man </p><p>crouched before the closed door of Allanna!</p><p>He looked toward the reporter as if by in- </p><p>stinct. Douglass dodged back out of sight </p><p>and waited, expecting to see the beast track- </p><p>ing him down. After a few seconds he look- </p><p>ed out again. </p><p> Jack Agar had vanished. Douglass’ heart</p><p>almost stopped. Before he could control </p><p>himself, he had leaped out into the hall. In- </p><p>stantly there came a blood-curdling scream </p><p>from Allanna’s bedroom. With terror strik- </p><p>ing at his mind, the reporter ran for her </p><p>door. It was open wide and her room was </p><p>filled with beastly muttering and stifled </p><p>cries. Then he heard plaintive pleadings </p><p>coming from the darkness. Pleadings from </p><p>horrified feminine lips. </p><p> Young Mr. Morton Douglass could stand</p><p>no more. Mumbling dire things he bounded </p><p>into the room, pausing to switch on the </p><p>lights and take stock of the situation. </p><p> The synthetic man was bending over Al-</p><p>lanna as she lay in fear on her bed, her </p><p>arms outstretched to ward off his deadly, </p><p>murderous fingers. Douglass saw at a glance </p><p>that he had her by the throat now and in a </p><p>twinkling would beat her head to a pulp. </p><p>The beast paid not the slightest attention to </p><p>the sudden flood of illumination, but seem- </p><p>ed bent only on murder. </p><p> Douglass had a glimpse of pleading eyes</p><p>peering at him through the beast’s arms. </p><p>For the first time in her life, Allanna was </p><p>in mortal fear. The expression on her fea- </p><p>tures caused the reporter to go stark mad. </p><p>With the roar of a beast he flung himself </p><p>forward, felt his nerveless fingers touch the </p><p>clammy flesh of Jack Agar, and gain a hold. </p><p>The Secret Destroyed </p><p>IT seemed to him then that nobody could </p><p>be closer to death, but in his insane fury it </p><p>mattered not whether he came out victor- </p><p>ious or had his head smashed in, so long as </p><p>he gave Allanna a chance to escape. Gain- </p><p>ing momentary control over his reeling, in- </p><p>furiated senses, he yelled loudly to the girl. </p><p> “Run Allanna!” he shouted, using pre-</p><p>cious breath that he knew would be needed </p><p>to protect himself from Jack Agar. “Call </p><p>the police!” </p><p> Allanna neded no urging. Like a wood</p><p>nymph she sprang from her bed and ran, </p><p>terrified, into the hall. Douglass heard her </p><p>714 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>calling desperately but futilely to her uncle. </p><p>Her feet sounded on the hall floor and then </p><p>the reporter heard her scream again. He </p><p>did not doubt but that she had discovered </p><p>her uncle’s gruesome form, stilled in death. </p><p> Jack Agar’s lips became discolored with</p><p>a green, ghastly foam giving him the ap- </p><p>pearance of a rabid animal, as he turned </p><p>slowly to face his antagonist. From his </p><p>throat came the startling snarl of a jungle </p><p>brute making a kill. But his actions were </p><p>sluggish because of his dull, undeveloped </p><p>wits. His great arms writhed through the </p><p>air like serpents and the reporter ducked </p><p>under them. </p><p> Douglass stepped nimbly aside and de-</p><p>livered a clean, right-handed blow on his </p><p>adversary’s unwholesome chin. The syn- </p><p>thetic man’s eyes went strangely dull and </p><p>listless, losing much of their savage, mur- </p><p>derous lust. He faltered a trifle and am- </p><p>bled backward. The newspaper man fol- </p><p>lowed like a trained pugilist and led again </p><p>with a vicious left. </p><p> The delicate flesh of Jack Agar’s chin</p><p>split in a horrible gash. A green liquid </p><p>sprayed over the reporter, smelling like the </p><p>damp, sour weeds of the sea. His eyes </p><p>blazing furiously he lashed out with a potent </p><p>savageness. Across his vision was a curtain </p><p>of red and he cast caution aside to deliver </p><p>another terrific right. Then Jack Agar’s </p><p>waving arm caught him in the grip of a </p><p>boa. He sobered in the instant and was </p><p>amazed at the supernatural strength of the </p><p>creature. Jack Agar seemed to have the </p><p>power of steel vises in each arm and they </p><p>closed around the small of his back with </p><p>menace. </p><p> The newspaperman felt an agonizing pain</p><p>through his middle. His blood seemed to </p><p>turn to ice and his heart appeared to have </p><p>suddenly stopped. Something told him he </p><p>was going to explode. Then he looked into </p><p>those terrible, fiery orbs. He tried to </p><p>scream, but his voice was dead. Great balls </p><p>of fire danced before him and he knew he </p><p>was going into unconsciousness, for a fath- </p><p>omless black abyss yawned under them like </p><p>open space. He felt himself falling, falling </p><p>with a terrific wind racing past his ears.</p><p> Then as it seemed he was at last going to</p><p>strike terra firma at the bottom of the pit, </p><p>he heard a terrific explosion. Through his </p><p>reeling head ran the thought that he had </p><p>actually exploded and his astral body was </p><p>floating over his mortal remains. Something </p><p>hit his ghost and knocked it strangely aside. </p><p>Then he thought that he was gloating over </p><p>something. </p><p> And that something looked very much</p><p>like the still form of Jack Agar with a round </p><p>hole in the center of his brow from which </p><p>poured a smelly green liquid. Other forms </p><p>moved about like weaving ghosts; then he </p><p>felt a cold, icy something on his forehead. </p><p>Cradually objects began to assume definite </p><p>shape and finally out of a jumbled nothing </p><p>he recognized Allanna. From her deep- </p><p>blue eyes ran glistening tears. </p><p> “Oh, Mr. Douglass!” he heard her sob</p><p>tearfully. “He did not kill you! Oh ...!” </p><p>He saw her shudder violently and then a </p><p>blue-uniformed man lifted her erect. </p><p> “Take it easy, young lady,” advised the</p><p>officer. “It won’t do to go into hysterics. </p><p>He’s alright!” </p><p> Eager hands lifted the reporter to his</p><p>feet. His head reeled and he lurched side- </p><p>ways. Hands caught him. Water was forc- </p><p>ed down his parched lips. Rapidly he </p><p>emerged from the cloud behind which hov- </p><p>ered death and oblivion. </p><p> “W-what happened?” he managed to ask</p><p>as he stood, tottering. A bluecoat glanced </p><p>to a heap on the floor and nodded. </p><p> “He had you in a bad way, young fellow!”</p><p>the officer said with a grin. “In another </p><p>second he’d have bashed your head like an </p><p>eggshell! Murphy’s slug got him right be- </p><p>tween the eyes.” </p><p> Allanna shivered and hid her face against</p><p>the police captain who supported her. She </p><p>sobbed convulsively. Douglass had a sud- </p><p>den thought. </p><p> “Did he kill the butler, too?” he blurted,</p><p>feeling the strength returning to his tremb- </p><p>ling legs. He searched the officers’ eyes. </p><p>The bluecoats nodded as one.</p><p> “And the old man in the other room,”</p><p>said one of them smoothly. “Bashed </p><p>in	”</p><p> “I know all about that,” the reporter cut</p><p>in quickly to save Allanna from hearing </p><p>THE SYNTHETIC MEN </p><p>715 </p><p>further. “The beast will never kill another </p><p>man, I hope!” </p><p> “Aye!” interjected the captain. “He’s</p><p>as dead as a door-nail!” </p><p> “I had a hunch something like this would</p><p>happen,” said Douglass shaking his head </p><p>sadly. “Dr. Pontius violated all the un- </p><p>written laws of nature by creating synthetic </p><p>human life. Man should not try to duplicate </p><p>the work of the Master Creator. I am sorry </p><p>for Dr. Pontius, but glad that he will carry </p><p>his secrets to the grave.” </p><p>• Douglass instinctively glanced toward his </p><p>room across the hall where his coat con- </p><p>taining his papers reclined on a chair- </p><p>back. He wondered if the papers had been </p><p>touched. Without hesitation he went to </p><p>the room, removed the notes from his inner </p><p>pocket and strode to the open fireplace </p><p>near the foot of the bed. His hands trem- </p><p>bled and he muttered softly to himself. </p><p>“He told me he had no written formula,” </p><p>he mumbled, glancing at a paragraph in his </p><p>notes that revealed the secret of synthetic </p><p>life. “So here goes the works. The secret </p><p>will remain a secret as far as I’m con- </p><p>cerned ! ” </p><p> A match scraped along the fireplace</p><p>stones. It was held to the sheaf of fools- </p><p>cap. A flame illuminated the drawn fea- </p><p>tures of the reporter. He held the burning </p><p>documents until the flame reached his shak- </p><p>ing fingers; then dropped the twisted mass </p><p>into the grate with a feeling that he was </p><p>doing mankind a great favor. </p><p> Within a year the house of horror had</p><p>been transformed into one of sunniness. </p><p>The pickled bodies of Jack and Joe Agar </p><p>had been sent to Tyburn and with them had </p><p>gone everything scientific Dr. Pontius had </p><p>possessed. Allanna had fallen into the </p><p>wealth her uncle had left, but her husband, </p><p>the young Mr. Morton Douglass, continues </p><p>to be the right hand man of Amesbury of </p><p>the Globe. </p><p>THE END. </p><p> FOR THE JANUARY ISSUE  </p><p> We offer  </p><p> “The Satellite of Doom”  </p><p> by *  </p><p> D. D. SHARP  </p><p> Mr. Sharp is well known as the author of the “Eternal Man” and the "Eternal Man Re¬  </p><p> vives” and now he gives us this new and very unusual story. It has been proved by experts  </p><p> on space travel that it is possible for a satellite to be built for the earth. Such a ship sent  </p><p> up to 500 miles and Riven a speed of about five miles per second would continue to travel  </p><p> around the earth indefinitely without further power. Such an idea has thousands of possibil¬  </p><p> ities and Mr. Sharp uses a few of the best to construct a story of mystery, intrigue and  </p><p> thrilling adventure.  </p><p> “The Gland Men of the Island” by Malcolm Afford  </p><p> The author who was recently a professor of medicine at the University of Adelaide, Austra¬  </p><p> lia, is a scientist of the first rank, but you will agree he is as good a writer of fast moving  </p><p> fiction as he is a scientist. We know that it is possible by treating our glands to produce  </p><p> men or are tall or short, fat or thin, intelligent or moronic. If such a power came into the  </p><p> hands of any man he could use it to upset our entire earth. A world wide catastrophe might  </p><p> follow if he should use this knowledge to evil uses. You must not miss this story.  </p><p> “Death From the Seas” by Joseph Kennelly  </p><p> What takes place far below the surface of the ocean is still quite a mystery to us because  </p><p> of the terrific pressure at even moderate depths. We have never been able to penetrate more  </p><p> than a few hundred feet, but it is probably true that strange creatures exist in the submar¬  </p><p> ine depths. What they would be like we have no means of telling, but if we were to pene¬  </p><p> trate the ocean’s depths as our characters do in this story, we might find some of the most  </p><p> amazing things that the imagination of man has conceived.  </p><p> “The Outpost on the Moon” by Joslyn Maxwell  </p><p> The second installment of this masterly interplanetary story will reveal the secret of many of  </p><p> the puzzling events of the first installment. We will find the meaning of the mysterious Out¬  </p><p> post established on the desolate Moon, unknown to the people of earth. Is it a menace from  </p><p> the limits of the solar system that the Outpost is trying to contend with? Even the Outpost  </p><p> does not know the answer; but flying with our characters between Moon and Earth we will  </p><p> get vivid glimpses into some astonishing events.  </p><p> AND OTHER STORIES IN THIS BIG NEW YEAR ISSUE  </p><p> ON SALE DECEMBER FIRST  </p><p> The Struggle</p><p> for Venus Dy S</p><p>lllxatrated by Marckioni </p><p> It rapidly grew in intensity. It had the appearance of a half moon</p><p> toward which I was rushing with frightful velocity.</p><p> 716</p><p>THE day on which my story opens— </p><p>June 6, 2012—was marked in advance </p><p>aa the date of a transit of Venus across the </p><p>disk of the sun. It will have a foremost </p><p>place in the minds of future generations </p><p>of school children as the date on which the </p><p>first expedition of colonists from Earth </p><p>landed on the neighboring planet. </p><p> Although a broken leg prevented me</p><p>from being a member of that band of </p><p>brave men, my later </p><p>destiny was closely </p><p>linked with their </p><p>amazing adventures on </p><p>Venus, and it is their </p><p>story, in so far as I </p><p>was connected with it, </p><p>that I shall set down </p><p>here to the best of my </p><p>ability. </p><p> A n introductory</p><p>word about myself a </p><p>necessary. The first </p><p>space trips — those </p><p>venturesome leaps to </p><p>the moon—were made </p><p>when I was a school </p><p>boy. They fired the </p><p>imagination of the </p><p>world, and I was </p><p>only one of the mil- </p><p>lions of boys who re- </p><p>solved to devote their </p><p>lives to the explora- </p><p>tion of space. Partly </p><p>because I was more </p><p>persistent than some, </p><p>and partly because I </p><p>was more fortunate, I </p><p>was able to follow the </p><p>line of my ambition. </p><p>What will always </p><p>stand out as the biggest day in my life was </p><p>that on which, my theoretical training com- </p><p>pleted, I hopped off on my first space trip, </p><p>in which 1 circled the moon. Prior to </p><p>that time Robert E. Jones and Matthew Ed- </p><p>dy had already made their epochal trip to </p><p>Venus, and I looked upon my first space </p><p>voyage as merely further training that </p><p>would equip me for similar exploits. </p><p> When it was decided to send a large ex-</p><p> pedition to remain at least two years on</p><p> Venus and investigate the deposits of rad-</p><p> ium-bearing pitchblende found by Jones</p><p> and Eddy in their brief stay, I was accept-</p><p> ed as a member of the party, and took part</p><p> in the preparations. My high expectations</p><p> were rudely dashed when, a month before</p><p> the start, my run of good fortune was end-</p><p> ed by the accident in which my leg was</p><p> broken. That, of course, disposed of my</p><p>7'HE planet Venus occu- </p><p>pies a peculiar and en- </p><p>viable position in our solar </p><p>system. According to the </p><p>best evidence that we have </p><p>it is a young world, younger </p><p>than the earth, with a con- </p><p>sequently longer period of </p><p>life before it. By its dis- </p><p>tance from the sun, it is </p><p>well fitted to maintain a high </p><p>order of life, and for all we </p><p>know, that life may now ex- </p><p>ist beneath its ever-present </p><p>cloud layers. And if life </p><p>does not exist on it, Venus </p><p>lies in the skies a planetary </p><p>prize awaiting the conquer- </p><p>or. According to Professor </p><p>V. V. Stratonoff, an emin- </p><p>ent Russian astronomer, the </p><p>earth must some day lose </p><p>its ability to support human </p><p>life, and then we must be </p><p>prepared if we wish to main- </p><p>tain our race to emigrate to </p><p>a more habitable sphere. </p><p>Yet our conquest of Venus </p><p>is not likely to go uncon- </p><p>tested, for it is probable as </p><p>our author shows that a bit- </p><p>ter battle is certain over </p><p>this fair young world. </p><p>r </p><p>hope of accompanying </p><p>the expedition. Dr. </p><p>Franklin Sanders, </p><p>chairman of the Com- </p><p>mission for Venus, of- </p><p>fered me the post of </p><p>wireless o p e r a to r , </p><p>which 1 gladly accept- </p><p>ed. My duties were </p><p>to aid in the installa- </p><p>tion of the station </p><p>which would be used </p><p>to communicate with</p><p>the men on Venus, </p><p>and, after communi- </p><p>cations were establish- </p><p>ed, to keep one of the </p><p>three eight-hour </p><p>“watches” at the re- </p><p>ceiving set. At the </p><p>same time 1 was to aid </p><p>in preparations for a </p><p>second * expedition to </p><p>be sent out two years </p><p>later when Venus </p><p>would again be in in- </p><p>ferior conjunction </p><p>with Earth. </p><p> On June 6, 2012,</p><p>then, 1 left an assist- </p><p>ant in the wireless </p><p> room and went to the</p><p>roof of the building in Washington, I). C., </p><p>furnished the Commission by the North </p><p>American Continental Government. It is </p><p>unnecessary for me to describe the transit </p><p>of Venus across the sun’s disk, for all of </p><p>my readers must have witnessed the pheno- </p><p>men either in 2012 or 2004. 1 do wish, </p><p>however, to record a conversation with Dr. </p><p>Sanders, because it will show our expectant </p><p>attitude On that day when the expedition, </p><p>717 </p><p>.718 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>out 26 days, was scheduled to arrive on </p><p>Venus. I was watching the sun, with the </p><p>planet outlined against it, through a pair of </p><p>binoculars when Dr. Sanders approached </p><p>me. </p><p> “If all has gone well,” he said, “we</p><p>should be in communication with them in a </p><p>few days, now.” </p><p> “I’m sure all has gone as planned, sir,”</p><p>I replied. “Nothing could go wrong with </p><p>Commander Jones in charge.” </p><p> “He is a wonderful leader,” Dr. Sanders</p><p>agreed. “I share your confidence in him. </p><p>Nevertheless interplanetary travel is still </p><p>fraught with many perils, as you know bet- </p><p>ter than I. It is a long and dangerous voy- </p><p>age, but I trust it has </p><p>been accomplished suc- </p><p>cessfully.” </p><p> “Their adventures will</p><p>only have begun when </p><p>they land,” I said. “They </p><p>will still have to cope </p><p>with all the dangers of a </p><p>world such as ours must </p><p>have been a million </p><p>years ago.” </p><p> “And you would give</p><p>your right eye to be with </p><p>them,” Dr. Sanders </p><p>smiled. “Don’t worry, </p><p>Starrett, you’ll join </p><p>them at the first oppor- </p><p>tunity.” </p><p> SMILED, rather</p><p>wryly, I am afraid, </p><p>for I knew that the “next opportunity” </p><p>would not come for almost twro years. </p><p>From that day Venus and Earth would </p><p>steadily separate until, some ten months </p><p>later, they would be on opposite sides of the </p><p>sun and separated by more than 160,000,- </p><p>000	miles, instead of a mere 25,000,000</p><p>miles as at present. No trip between the </p><p>two planets could be considered until Ven- </p><p>us again approached inferior conjunction. </p><p>Dr. Sanders read my thoughts.</p><p> “Venus won’t be civilized in two years,</p><p>my boy,” he said, “nor in two decades. </p><p>I’m sure you will have your part in the work </p><p>of civilizing it, and your share of adventure. </p><p>It is no secret, of course, that the present </p><p>plan is to estalish a permanent colony on </p><p>the planet. There must be untold resources </p><p>to be developed. I can visualize the day </p><p>when Venus will have a thriving population </p><p>of men and women.” </p><p> An almost religious light shone in his</p><p>eyes as he continued. </p><p> “Beautiful cities will be planned and</p><p>erected free from the blemishes that on </p><p>Earth we have inherited from past ages of </p><p>trial and error. Commerce will ply the </p><p>seas of Venus and there will be a steady </p><p>exchange of goods between the planets. </p><p>Venus may come to be regarded as the ‘pro- </p><p>mised land’ for the inhabitants of Earth. </p><p>In some future age when the earth receives </p><p>less heat from the dying </p><p>sun, mankind may desert </p><p>its old home and move </p><p>to the new world nearer </p><p>the source of life.” </p><p> He clapped me on the</p><p>shoulder. </p><p> “These are glorious</p><p>prospects that we have </p><p>before us in the dawn of </p><p>the 21st Century. Ad- </p><p>venture such as no man </p><p>ever dreamed of a few </p><p>centuries ago! My boy, </p><p>the great adventure is </p><p>just beginning. I pre- </p><p>dict that you will have a </p><p>big part in furthering it. </p><p>So don’t let your spirits </p><p>be cast down now.” </p><p> I do not remember what reply I made,</p><p>except that I stammered my thanks for his </p><p>kind words. His enthusiasm and vision </p><p>were contagious, although there was nothing </p><p>new to me in what he said. Later on, how- </p><p>ever, when I was back in the room which </p><p>housed the interplanetary wireless set, my </p><p>disappointment rose afresh. After all I </p><p>had wished to be a pioneer, and it would </p><p>not be the same going out with a second</p><p>party two years later to find the ground </p><p>broken, homes erected and a little commun- </p><p>ity ready to receive us. Nothing could be </p><p>done about it, however. I had missed my </p><p>big chance through such a trivial thing as a </p><p>fall and a broken leg. </p><p>WESLEY ARNOLD </p><p>THE STRUGGLE FOR VENUS </p><p>719 </p><p> The bone had practically healed by this</p><p>time, but it was too late. The expedition </p><p>had departed twenty-six days earlier, and, </p><p>as we learned later, landed on Venus on </p><p>that very day and near the time when the </p><p>planet was seen from Earth in transit across </p><p>the sun’s face. I little guessed that day </p><p>how fortunate it was for all concerned that </p><p>I was not with them. </p><p>CHAPTER II. </p><p>Mystery on Venus. </p><p>IT was three days later before any word </p><p>was received from Venus, the delay be- </p><p>ing explained by the necessity for the tech- </p><p>nicians of the expedition to assemble the </p><p>wireless and getting it in working order. </p><p>1 still have copies of the messages received </p><p>in the Washington headquarters, so that I </p><p>am able to give their exact texts. They tell </p><p>a dramatic story of mystery and suspense </p><p>in a strange and unfriendly world. </p><p> Contact was established on June 9. I was</p><p>on duty at the time and was reporting per- </p><p>iodically to Dr. Sanders that no results had </p><p>been obtained. The wavelength to be used </p><p>was so low that there was no interference </p><p>from Earth stations. I was tuning the set </p><p>near the agreed point when I caught a faint </p><p>signal. I perfected the adjustment and </p><p>then wailed. If it were indeed Venus call- </p><p>ing, the signal would be repeated in exactly </p><p>five minutes. Precisely at the end of that </p><p>period, which I spent watching the second </p><p>hand creep around the dial of my watch, </p><p>I caught the signal again, much louder. It </p><p>was the Venus station repeating the station </p><p>call for Earth. </p><p> I tapped out the answer to show that</p><p>communication had been established, and </p><p>then sent for Dr. Sanders. It would be </p><p>more than two minutes before the radio sig- </p><p>nal, traveling with the speed of light, would </p><p>reach Venus, and an equal time before the </p><p>reply could be heard. </p><p> Dr. Sanders entered the room, followed</p><p>by others who had heard the good news. </p><p>There were excited whispers, which I stilled </p><p>with a motion of ray hand. Although the </p><p>message was taken down automatically by</p><p>the receiving instruments, I was unwilling </p><p>to risk the possibility of mechanical troub- </p><p>le and accordingly wrote the message down. </p><p> “Earth, attention! Earth, attention!</p><p>Arrived three days ago. All O. K. We </p><p>landed near mouth of Holmes River and </p><p>have begun construction of permanent home </p><p>on favorable site. Living in the ships </p><p>pending completion of thatched roof huts. </p><p>Party of hunters on first day surprised herd </p><p>of sexons* and killed enough to supply us </p><p>with meat for a week. Have caught sever- </p><p>al forms of river life in nets and Dr. Alex- </p><p>ander is analyzing them. Potato trees are </p><p>plentiful and the root, with sexon meat and </p><p>bread, completes our diet until Dr. Alex- </p><p>ander tells us what else we can eat. </p><p> “Have divided party in two groups and</p><p>alternate daily, one group exploring </p><p>neighborhood and collecting specimens of </p><p>vegetable and animal life while others cut </p><p>and haul lumber. The wood of the potato </p><p>tree is strong and light, and the rough </p><p>sawed lumber has the quality of glowing </p><p>faintly for several hours after sunset. Liz- </p><p>ards of many types and all sizes are abun- </p><p>dant, but apparently harmless. We hope </p><p>tc begin work on radium field in few weeks </p><p>when camp is completed. Men all gather- </p><p>ed to wait your reply. Send greetings to </p><p>friends on Earth. Robert E. Jones.” </p><p> Dr. Sanders quickly scribbled &lt;the answer,</p><p>which I began sending within a few minutes </p><p>after the completion of this message. In </p><p>the meantime the news had been flashed to </p><p>all parts of the world. Congratulatory </p><p>messages from notables began arriving and </p><p>were transmitted to the distant party. It </p><p>was more than two hours later when we </p><p>said good-bye for the day. </p><p> It is remarkable that from the first there</p><p>was no difficulty in communicating with the </p><p>party on Venus. It had been realized, of </p><p>course, that communication could not be </p><p>maintained during that part of the synodic </p><p>revolutions of the two planets when they </p><p>were at nearly opposite sides of the sun, </p><p>and the most hoped for was that we could </p><p>keep in touch with the distant party during </p><p>the five or six months preceding and fol- </p><p>lowing inferior conjunction. Our exper- </p><p>*An ostrich-like bird having six rudimentary</p><p>legs, whence the name. </p><p>720 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>ience proved beyond doubt that this was </p><p>possible, although, because of circum- </p><p>stances which I shall soon relate, we ac- </p><p>tually maintained touch with Commander </p><p>Jones and his party for only thirty days. </p><p>The breaking of communications at the end </p><p>of that time had nothing to do with radio </p><p>conditions. If there had been anyone to </p><p>operate the station on Venus the signals </p><p>would have been received at the Washington </p><p>station. </p><p>AT the first, however, Commander Jones </p><p>could send a message from Venus in </p><p>confidence that it would be received about </p><p>two minutes later on Earth. A program </p><p>was worked out by which we made contact </p><p>with the party at noon (Washington time) </p><p>every day. That was merely for conven- </p><p>ience and regularity, as there was always </p><p>some one on duty in the receiving room in </p><p>the commission building to receive an emer- </p><p>gency message if there were any occasion </p><p>for one. </p><p> During the first week Commander</p><p>Jones daily message told a story of regular </p><p>progress in establishing a home under the </p><p>tropical and primitive conditions of the new </p><p>world. The messages might almost have </p><p>come from a party in some still uncivilized </p><p>section near the equator except for refer- </p><p>ences to strange plants and animals simi- </p><p>lar to those which may have existed on </p><p>Earth before the dawn of human life. </p><p> The first hint of what was to come was</p><p>contained in a message received on June 17. </p><p>It read: </p><p> “Something has happened that we are</p><p>unable to understand. Dick Smith and </p><p>James Fall disappeared yesterday afternoon </p><p>when they were cutting down trees a short </p><p>distance from the camp, and no trace of </p><p>them has been found as yet. We have </p><p>dropped everything else to look for them. </p><p>No one can explain what may have happen- </p><p>ed to them. We have seen vensaurians </p><p>large enough to carry a man, or even two, </p><p>without much difficulty, but none was seen </p><p>near the time the men disappeared, and no </p><p>tracks were found in the neighborhood </p><p>where they were working. The large </p><p>species that we have seen appear to be her-</p><p>bivorous and have shown no signs of attack- </p><p>ing us. What adds to the mystery is the </p><p>fact that both men were armed, and would </p><p>certainly have used their pistols if attacked. </p><p>No shots were heard by others working </p><p>nearby. We hope that they have merely </p><p>strayed away and become lost, but we do </p><p>not know what to fear. I have ordered a </p><p>guard on the camp at all hours. We will </p><p>continue our efforts to find Smith and Fall.” </p><p> This message was a private one to Dr.</p><p>Sanders, and he did not make it public, </p><p>since to have done so would have served no </p><p>useful purpose, but would have aroused fu- </p><p>tile fears among relatives and friends not </p><p>only of the two men but of all those in the </p><p>party. </p><p> Subsequent messages from Commander</p><p>Jones informed those of us connected with </p><p>the commission that no trace of the missing </p><p>men had been found. The others, after a </p><p>futile search, returned to the other work </p><p>which it was necessary for them to do. </p><p>The camp was completed and operations </p><p>were begun on the radium mine. </p><p> On July 5th we received the following</p><p>message from Commander Jones: </p><p> “I am forced to the conclusion that there</p><p>is some intelligent and malevolent force at </p><p>work against us. What its nature may be </p><p>it is impossible to say, but on no other hy- </p><p>pothesis can I explain the invasion of our </p><p>camp last night. </p><p> “There was no outcry during the night,</p><p>but when we awoke this morning we found </p><p>that three men who had been on guard and </p><p>three other men who slept in a hut near </p><p>the edge of camp had disappeared. We </p><p>found no sign of bloodshed nor of a strug- </p><p>gle of any sort, which makes the occurrence </p><p>absolutely incomprehensible. </p><p> “During the morning I decided to go up</p><p>a short distance in one of the space ships </p><p>to survey the land, and possibly to lead the </p><p>missing men back to camp if they were free. </p><p>It was then we made the discovery that the </p><p>ships had been entered and our tanks of </p><p>fuel mixture carried away. This, appar- </p><p>ently, had been done at the same time the </p><p>men were spirited away, for I am unable to </p><p>believe they took the fuel and left the camp</p><p>of their own accord. </p><p>THE STRUGGLE FOR VENUS </p><p>721 </p><p> “At any rate we are now stranded here,</p><p>and apparently at the mercy of unseen foes. </p><p>The morale of the forty-eight men remain- </p><p>ing in the camp is unimpaired by this latest </p><p>development. We are all determined to </p><p>solve the mystery and find out what hap- </p><p>pened to our comrades. </p><p> “The loss of our fuel mixture is a ser-</p><p>ious blow, since it means that we are forced </p><p>to remain where we are and will be unable </p><p>to do any extensive exploring unless we re- </p><p>cover the tanks. The camp will be put on </p><p>a war basis until we determine the nature </p><p>of the danger which threatens us.” </p><p> This message was the last that ivas re-</p><p>ceived from the expedition. </p><p> Later that afternoon I tried to make con-</p><p>nection with the station 011 Venus to trans- </p><p>mit a message from Dr. Sanders. I was </p><p>unable to obtain a reply. Nor was there </p><p>any word from the expedition the follow- </p><p>ing day at the usual time. </p><p>CHAPTER III. </p><p>A Desperate Plan. </p><p>SEVERAL days later Dr. Sanders sent </p><p>for me to come to his office. I could </p><p>tell from his nervous manner as he bade me </p><p>sit down that he had something of import- </p><p>ance to say. He began abruptly: </p><p> “We have held several meetings of the</p><p>Commission,” he said, “to discuss the sit- </p><p>uation regarding the expedition now on </p><p>Venus. While we can only guess at what </p><p>may have happened to the party, the sudden </p><p>breaking of communications following the </p><p>mysterious disappearance of eight of the </p><p>men and the raid on the camp, indicates </p><p>that some disaster has overtaken them. </p><p> “What makes the matter more serious is</p><p>the loss of their fuel mixture, without </p><p>which they are unable to operate the space </p><p>ships. That means that they cannot move </p><p>from the spot where they landed, on the </p><p>northern coast of Elysia, and if they are be- </p><p>set by foes in overwhelming force they are </p><p>unable to escape to some other part of the </p><p>planet. Of course the fact that the fuel </p><p>mixture was singled out for theft indicates</p><p>that their foes are intelligent beings of some </p><p>sort. This is in absolute contradiction to </p><p>the apparently well-established fact that </p><p> nothing corresponding to human life exists</p><p>on Venus, but we are forced to accept the </p><p>fact as it stands. </p><p> “We have decidcd, in short, that aid must</p><p>be sent to the party and especially that we </p><p>must get a supply of fuel mixture to them. </p><p> “I don’t think it is possible,” I protested,</p><p>when he paused. “Venus is rapidly sep- </p><p>arating from the Earth at present. A space </p><p>ship which started out now would have to </p><p>follow the planet through its orbit and </p><p>could only gain on it slowly, possibly one </p><p>or two hundred thousand miles a day.* At </p><p>that rate, even if the ship could carry </p><p>enough liquid air and fuel mixture for the </p><p>long journey, it would not overtake the </p><p>planet for almost a year.” </p><p> “By all the accepted standards and theor-</p><p>ies that is correct,” Dr. Sanders replied. </p><p>“Such an attempt would of course be fore- </p><p>doomed to failure. Necessity, however, is </p><p>the mother of invention, and a plan has </p><p>been worked out for the Commission under </p><p>which we believe a space ship setting out </p><p>now can reach Venus within two months. </p><p>If you will consider making the trip, I will </p><p>explain the idea to you. It is unnecessary </p><p>for me to say that it will be hazardous in </p><p>the extreme, or to point out that the lives </p><p>of the 56 men who landed on Venus a month </p><p>ago may be at stake. What do you say?” </p><p> “I am willing,” I replied.</p><p> Dr. Sanders drew out a sheet of paper on</p><p>which was drawn a system of circles and </p><p>dotted lines, and which I immediately re- </p><p>cognized as indicating the orbits of Earth </p><p>and Venus around the sun. The sketch is </p><p>reproduced here (Page 723) so that the </p><p>reader can follow Dr. Sanders’ explanation. </p><p> “The plan, as I have told you, is an ex-</p><p>tremely daring one,” Dr. Sanders contin- </p><p>ued. “It, is nothing less than to launch a </p><p>ship into space at the proper direction and </p><p>at such a speed that it will circle the sun </p><p>and return in time to meet the planet Ven- </p><p>us, in its orbit. </p><p> “The plan is shown on this diagram.</p><p>The letters ‘E’ and ‘V’ show the respective </p><p>positions of Earth and Venus in their or- </p><p>•The speed of Venus in it« orbit is about 22 </p><p>miles per second; that of the earth 18.5 miles </p><p>per second. If -an attempt were made to </p><p>reach Venus directly, it would be like chasing </p><p>after a fast-receding train. </p><p>722 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>bits at the time of the recent transit. The </p><p>small circles on the orbits ‘E’ and ‘V’ show </p><p>the positions in which the two planets will </p><p>be on July 21, when all should be in read- </p><p>iness for the start of the trip.” </p><p> Looking at the diagram 1 began to get a</p><p>faint understanding of the plan, which was </p><p>indeed a daring one. </p><p> “Our calculations show that in one of the</p><p>small and speedy ships you would have to </p><p>travel under power for about 36,000,000 </p><p>miles along the course indicated,” Dr. San- </p><p>ders said. “Since the course lies approxi- </p><p>mately in the direction of the sun your </p><p>speed would increase rapidly after you </p><p>passed the point where the sun’s attraction </p><p>equalled the earth’s. After 36,000,000 </p><p>miles your speed would be such that you </p><p>could shut off your power and leave the </p><p>ship to sweep around the sun just as the </p><p>comet does, and in the path indicated. At </p><p>the end of 45 days the ship would have </p><p>whipped comet-like around the sun and re- </p><p>turned to the orbit of Venus, and the planet </p><p>would have moved forward to the same </p><p>point V2. Thus your trip would require </p><p>less than twice the time taken by Command- </p><p>er Jones and his party, although you would </p><p>cover almost 200,000,000 miles in reaching </p><p>the planet.” </p><p>iirpHE course lies very close to the sun,” </p><p>1 I said, after studying the diagram for </p><p>a moment. </p><p> “Yes, you would pass within 20,000,000</p><p>miles of the sun,” Dr. Sanders replied, “and </p><p>you would feel some discomfort from the </p><p>heat. Special arrangements will have to be </p><p>made to protect the ship. The reason the </p><p>course is laid so close to the sun is that you </p><p>will gain speed that way, in addition to </p><p>shortening your course. Your ship, when </p><p>you turn off the power, will be a free body, </p><p>exactly similar to a comet, and you know, of </p><p>course, that the closer such bodies pass to </p><p>the sun the greater is their speed.” </p><p> I took up the diagram and studied it while</p><p>I	turned the proposal over in my mind.</p><p>While I had no desire to sacrifice myself </p><p>to no purpose, I was perfectly willing to</p><p>undertake a long chance in the hope of aid- </p><p>ing the men who were trapped on the dis- </p><p>tant planet and at the mercy of unknown </p><p>enemies. On its1 face the plan seemed </p><p>hopeless, but was it? 1 knew that astrono- </p><p>mers were able to calculate with the utmost </p><p>precision the course of comets which ap- </p><p>peared suddenly in the solar system, swept </p><p>around the sun and disappeared in far dis- </p><p>tances. Why, then, should they not be able </p><p>to prescribe the conditions under which a </p><p>body would follow a desired orbit around </p><p>the sun? I knew, too, that the world’s best </p><p>astronomers and mathematicians were at the </p><p>call of the Commission for Venus. If they </p><p>authorized the attempt— </p><p> “I’ll do it,” I said. “You say the start</p><p>can’t be made until the 21st?” </p><p> “It will take that long to make the neces-</p><p>sary alterations in the ship to be used,” </p><p>Dr. Sanders replied. </p><p> As he stood up and took my hand with a</p><p>quick nervous motion I realized that Dr. </p><p>Sanders thought my death warrant had just </p><p>been signed. </p><p> “There is to be another meeting of the</p><p>Commission this afternoon,” he told me. </p><p>“You will be present, of course, and the </p><p>plans for the trip will be discussed.” </p><p> .CHAPTER IV.</p><p> The Trip Begins.</p><p>AHEAD of me millions of stars glittered </p><p>with magnificent brilliance against the </p><p>black background of limitless space. Ex- </p><p>actly 30 degrees to the right hung the sun, </p><p>a big ball of fire outlined sharply against </p><p>blackness. Through the double glass port </p><p>in the stern of the space ship I could see the </p><p>Earth, brightly lighted by the sun, filling </p><p>most of the sky behind me. </p><p> It was July 21, and my big adventure</p><p>was already an hour old. After two weeks </p><p>of steady work the small space ship had </p><p>been remodeled to fit the special require- </p><p>ments of the voyage around the sun. In ad- </p><p>dition to the heating arrangement it had </p><p>been equipped with a refrigerating system </p><p>which would carry the intense heat from </p><p>the sun-side to the off-side of the ship when </p><p>I	neared the sun. Special expansion plates</p><p>had been inserted in the outer steel envelope </p><p>of the ship to permit both extreme contrac- </p><p>tion from the cold of interstellar space and </p><p>extreme expansion from the sun’s heat when </p><p>THE STRUGGLE FOR VENUS </p><p>723 </p><p>it became intense. The work had been </p><p>completed on schedule, and I had stepped </p><p>into the ship at the appointed hour after a </p><p>final handclasp with Dr. Sanders. </p><p> My schedule permitted of no delay. Im-</p><p>mediately after leaving the earth’s atmos- </p><p>phere I had turned on the rocket power </p><p>full force, so that I was now many thous- </p><p>and miles out on my long journey. </p><p> For my own use I carried twenty tanks</p><p>of liquid air and five tanks of fuel mix- </p><p>ture, enough to keep the ship going at full </p><p>speed for forty </p><p>days and to cov- </p><p>er approximate- </p><p>1 y 70,000,000 </p><p>miles as well as </p><p>supply air inside </p><p>the sealed ship </p><p>for sixty days. </p><p>Packed away in </p><p>the ship were ten </p><p>extra tanks of </p><p>fuel mixture for </p><p>use in the big </p><p>ships stranded </p><p>on Venus for </p><p>lack of it. I had </p><p>already turned </p><p>on the heating </p><p>system and it </p><p>was warm and </p><p>comfortable i n </p><p>the inner shell of </p><p>the vacuum </p><p>ship. </p><p> With the ship</p><p>set on its course </p><p>and running </p><p>smoothly I was </p><p>able to leave the controls for the time being </p><p>and watch the earth, from which 1 was re- </p><p>ceding at more than 20 miles a second. </p><p>The earth, itself i oiling along its orbit at </p><p>the rate of more than 18 miles a second, </p><p>had already moved a considerable distance </p><p>to one side of a straight line behind the </p><p>ship. In the days that followed it would </p><p>steadily dwindle in apparent size until it </p><p>became lost in the myriad of bright specks </p><p>that surrounded me on all sides and that</p><p>represented worlds and suns at incompre- </p><p>hensible distances. </p><p> Almost squarely abeam on the right</p><p>side, and at right angles to my course, was </p><p>an exceptionally bright luminary which I </p><p>knew to be the planet Venus. If I could </p><p>only turn and fly directly to it my journey </p><p>would be a comparatively simple one, but </p><p>I knew that I should require years to catch </p><p>the planet if I set out to pursue it through </p><p>its orbit. Long before that time my sup- </p><p>ply of liquid air would be exhausted. In- </p><p>stead of following what appeared to be the </p><p>natural course I </p><p>must trust my- </p><p>self to mathema- </p><p>t i c a 1 science, </p><p>which declared </p><p>that the sun, if </p><p>permitted to ex- </p><p>ercise its influ- </p><p>snce, would whirl </p><p>my ship around </p><p>it in such a way </p><p>a9 to intercept </p><p>the planet at an </p><p>advanced point </p><p>in its orbit. </p><p> As far as the</p><p>theory went, I </p><p>was satisfied </p><p>that 'I would </p><p>reach Venus in </p><p>safety. I had </p><p>only to follow </p><p>the course laid </p><p>out for me and </p><p>there was little </p><p>danger of my </p><p>ship missing </p><p>Venus complete- </p><p>ly and hurtling far out into space to drift </p><p>there long after I had suffocated for lack of </p><p>air. The chief dangers that confronted me </p><p>were three in number, and I was well aware </p><p>of them. </p><p> The first was that I might miss my way</p><p>in the maze of the heavens. Of this I was </p><p>not much afraid, since 1 wa9 able to check </p><p>my course both by the constellations and by </p><p>the sun. Even if 1 became hopelessly lost </p><p>1 might be able to reach Mercury and re- </p><p>plenish my supply of liquid air.</p><p>Showing the novel means used by our explorer to </p><p>travel from Earth (E) to Venus (V). At the favor- </p><p>able time for passage the Earth should be at E and </p><p>Venus at V (in a direct line with the sun). But the </p><p>journey was not begun until July 21 when the planets </p><p>were in the positions El and VI. It would not have </p><p>been passible to catch Venus by chasing alter her </p><p>directly, so our explorer set his course as indicated </p><p>by the heavy line and allowed the sun’s attraction </p><p>to pull him around it at a great speed and thence </p><p>land him at Venus on September 5. </p><p>724 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p> The second and probably the greatest</p><p>peril would be faced when.my ship swept </p><p>freely in its orbit close to the sun. If the </p><p>cooling system failed to work properly the </p><p>plates of the outer shell might be melted. </p><p>This would not only disable the ship but </p><p>would permit the rays of the sun to beat </p><p>on the inner shell and raise the temperature </p><p>to a point where human life could not ex- </p><p>ist. Here, too, however, if my equipment </p><p>worked properly all would be well. </p><p> The third danger was that which every</p><p>space flier encounters—the possibility of </p><p>his ship being disabled by collision with a </p><p>large meteoric particle. With watchfulness </p><p>and care this could be avoided, despite the </p><p>fact that I would have to spend some eight </p><p>hourse of every day asleep. There was, of </p><p>course, an almost steady succession of taps </p><p>audible iriside the ship as small particles </p><p>ricocheted off the stream lines of the outer </p><p>shell, but these offered practically no peril. </p><p>THINKING over these matters as the </p><p>long journey began I felt, with the con- </p><p>fidence of youth, that the success of my </p><p>venture now depended solely upon me, and </p><p>that I should prove equal to the task. </p><p> The warning bell rang, and I moved for-</p><p>ward to the controls. An indicator, oper- </p><p>ated by a magnetic needle which reposed in </p><p>a hemispherical shell of lead on the nose of </p><p>the ship, showed that the meteor was ap- </p><p>proaching from above and to the left, and </p><p>I quickly picked it out in that direction. </p><p>It had the appearance of a star which rap- </p><p>idly grew in intensity. After a minute the </p><p>side of it turned to the sun had assumed the </p><p>appearance of a half moon toward which I </p><p>was rushing with frightful velocity. The </p><p>bell continued to ring at intervals of a sec- </p><p>ond, growing steadily louder. I realized </p><p>that the meteor was an unusually large one </p><p>and stood waiting with my hand on the con- </p><p>trol, although it seemed certain, judging </p><p>from the direction of the particle, that I </p><p>would clear it by a comfortable margin. </p><p>Alertness of vision and quickness of re- </p><p>sponse in such meetings may spell the dif- </p><p>ference between safety and sudden exter- </p><p>mination. In this case, however, the met- </p><p>eor was in a plane considerably above that </p><p>in which I was traveling. Three minutes</p><p>after the first warning I saw it flash under- </p><p>neath as a long streak of light. I could </p><p>follow its course behind the ship for some </p><p>five minutes before it became too dim to </p><p>distinguish. </p><p> That danger past, I busied myself about</p><p>the ship, seeing that all was functioning </p><p>properly, and accustoming myself to its mo- </p><p>tion. The manifestations of gravity, as or- </p><p>dinarily felt on the earth, were rapidly dis- </p><p>appearing as my distance from the earth </p><p>became greater. There was no downward </p><p>pull, and I was able to remain standing on </p><p>the floor only because of magnetized shoe </p><p>soles. Instead of a downward pull there </p><p>was a steady force exerted in the ship tow- </p><p>ard the stern exactly resembling gravity and </p><p>due to the fact that the ship’s speed was </p><p>then increasing at a steady rate under the </p><p>propelling power of the rocket motor. Ev- </p><p>erything in the ship’s interior was fixed in </p><p>place, otherwise all would have collected </p><p>in a pile in the stern. I was able to keep </p><p>my place by resting my hand on a rail </p><p>which ran around the interior. A strap at- </p><p>tached to a belt around my waist could be </p><p>hooked onto the rail whenever I wished. </p><p> There was. of course, no night or day on</p><p>the space ship, since the sun would hang </p><p>for many earth days in the same apparent </p><p>position. It was necessary for me to sleep, </p><p>however, and I soon found myself tired aft- </p><p>er the exertion and excitement of the start. </p><p>I accordingly decided to take a nap, de- </p><p>pending on the warning bell to notify me </p><p>of the approach of any large meteoric body. </p><p>I ate a capsule of food concentrate, drank </p><p>a glass of water, and then lay down for my </p><p>first sleep on the trip. </p><p>CHAPTER V. </p><p>Past the Sun to Venus. </p><p>ON the fifteenth day of my journey—for </p><p>I had of course kept a careful record </p><p>of the passage of time by earth standards— </p><p>I turned off the rocket motor, leaving my </p><p>ship free from then on to describe the </p><p>course imposed by the sun. It will be un- </p><p>derstood, naturally, that I had power Avail- </p><p>able at any moment for an emergency such </p><p>as the necessity of avoiding a meteor. </p><p> The earth had long since ceased to pre-</p><p>THE STRUGGLE FOR VENUS </p><p>725 </p><p>sent more than the smallest disk to the </p><p>naked eye, and was distinguishable chief- </p><p>ly as the brightest of the millions of stars </p><p>and planets which I could see. It was lo- </p><p>cated, to use a convenient nautical descrip- </p><p>tion off the starboard quarter of my ship, </p><p>while the sun appeared off the starboard </p><p>bow. At that time Venus was to be seen </p><p>slightly abaft of the starboard beam, for </p><p>I was now inside its orbit and actually trav- </p><p>eling away from the planet, as I would be </p><p>for many days thereafter until my ship </p><p>swung around the sun and headed down </p><p>the home stretch of the long trip. Venus </p><p>then appeared slightly less bright than </p><p>Earth. ' </p><p> Observations taken four days earlier,</p><p>when I crossed the orbit of Venus, had </p><p>showed that the ship was shooting through </p><p>space at the scheduled rate. On the fif- </p><p>teenth day approximately one-sixth of the </p><p>trip measured in distance, and one-third </p><p>measured in time, had been completed. </p><p>Since getting clear of Earth I had grad- </p><p>ually altered my course nearer the sun. At </p><p>the time I turned off the power the ship </p><p>was rushing headlong “down hill” toward </p><p>a point in the heavens about 25 degrees </p><p>from the sun. </p><p> It was with a curious feeling that I threw</p><p>the switch which stopped the action of the </p><p>rockets. I was 36,000,000 miles from Earth, </p><p>and considerably further from Venus. With </p><p>the power off I had no more sense of mo- </p><p>tion than persons on earth realize their </p><p>motion through space on the Earth’s jour- </p><p>ney around the sun. Nevertheless I knew </p><p>that my ship would continue to rush on </p><p>its predetermined orbit, gathering speed </p><p>steadily until it whirled like a comet around </p><p>the far side of the sun and headed back to </p><p>Venus. My average speed during the re- </p><p>mainder of the trip would be double what </p><p>it had been while the rockets were in oper- </p><p>ation. </p><p> With the motor turned off I could no</p><p>longer detect anything resembling gravi- </p><p>tation inside the ship. I can explain this </p><p>condition best by asking my reader to im- </p><p>agine a closed room or box which is fall- </p><p>ing from a great height in a vacuum, and </p><p>to imagine that he is sitting at a table in</p><p>the room. The room will be falling per- </p><p>fectly freely under the influence of gravity, </p><p>and its occupants, human and otherwise, </p><p>will be moving under exactly the same </p><p>force. Then if the man holds a book at </p><p>arm’s length and releases it, its position </p><p>within the room will not change, since both </p><p>the book and the room are falling at the </p><p>same rate. In other words the book will </p><p>remain suspended freely in the air of the </p><p>room. The table and chair likewise may </p><p>be raised and will float in the air. The </p><p>man may then sit in the chair or on the </p><p>table, or float about at pleasure through </p><p>the room by pushing himself away from </p><p>the ceiling, floor or walls He can walk </p><p>with equal ease on any of the six walls of </p><p>the room. This illustration is exactly ana- </p><p>logous to the condition of my ship as it </p><p>fell through interminable space on its </p><p>strange journey. </p><p> The succeeding days passed monotonous-</p><p>ly, except for occasional brief periods when </p><p>the alarm announced that a meteoric par- </p><p>ticle of considerable size was in the vicin- </p><p>ity. But despite the monotony I felt a grow- </p><p>ing tension in my mind. I stood frequently </p><p>at the controls watching the sun, whose size </p><p>now appeared double that as seen from the </p><p>Earth. The dial on my instrument board </p><p>began to show that the outer starboard </p><p>plates were becoming heated, and on the </p><p>23rd day out I switched on the refrigerat- </p><p>ing system which aided in carrying the heat </p><p>from that side to the port side, from which </p><p>it would radiate into space. </p><p>THE sun grew larger perceptibly dur- </p><p>ing the next 48 hours, until I was final- </p><p>ly able to distinguish individual tongues of </p><p>flame licking out hundreds of thousands of </p><p>miles from its surface. It finally appeared </p><p>squarely at right angles to the direction of </p><p>the ship, and I knew I had reached the </p><p>most critical part of my journey, when the </p><p>ship would swing around the arc of its </p><p>course nearest the sun. That my cooling </p><p>system was working perfectly was demon- </p><p>strated by the fact that the outer plates on </p><p>the sun side, while very warm, were well </p><p>below any dangerous temperature. </p><p> For die next five days, from the 25th</p><p>(726 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>through the 30th of the trip my ship, my </p><p>ship would remain at about the same dis- </p><p>tance from the sun, speeding through the </p><p>long curve around it at more than 90 miles </p><p>a second, or a million miles every three </p><p>hours. In the five days it would cover 40,- </p><p>000,000 miles. </p><p> Although this was the most critical part</p><p>of the journey, and I wished to remain on </p><p>guard as much of the time as possible, it </p><p>was not to be expected that I could stay </p><p>awake constantly for five days and keep </p><p>my faculties in a proper condition to meet </p><p>the emergencies that might arise. It was </p><p>better to take a minimum of rest, depend- </p><p>ing on automatic signals to awaken me if </p><p>any occasion arose. Accordingly after 20 </p><p>hours of the critical period had passed with- </p><p>out incident and when all appeared to be </p><p>going well, I lay down for a nap. I was </p><p>dangerously exhausted, and slept soundly </p><p>for six hours. </p><p> When I awoke the first thing I noticed,</p><p>upon looking out of the ship’s ports was </p><p>that the sun was no longer squarely abeam </p><p>and at right angles to my course. Instead </p><p>it had dropped back fully fifteen degrees. </p><p>I was seriously alarmed by this observation, </p><p>the significance of which will be obvious to </p><p>the reader. It meant nothing less than that </p><p>my ship, instead of following its plotted </p><p>course, was heading away from the sun. </p><p> As quickly as possible I took obser-</p><p>vations of the apparent position of the fixed </p><p>stars. This verified the fact that the ship’s </p><p>direction had swung away from the sun, </p><p>and revealed, moreover, that the angle was </p><p>slowly increasing. Calculations made from </p><p>the figures I obtained showed that if the </p><p>tendency continued for 36 hours the ship </p><p>would be headed directly outward from the </p><p>sun. </p><p> The situation appeared fraught with the</p><p>greatest peril, since my ship was traveling </p><p>so fast under the influence of the sun’s at- </p><p>traction that it was practically out of con- </p><p>trol by means of the rocket motor. More- </p><p>over its action appeared totally contrary to </p><p>all known laws about the movements of as- </p><p>tronomical bodies. The only explanation</p><p>I could think of was that the ship actually </p><p>jvas traveling much faster than I had cal- </p><p>culated—so much faster that the sun was </p><p>unable to hold it, with the result that it </p><p>was flying off from the sun in entirely the </p><p>wrong direction. In that case I knew that </p><p>the rocket motor would be able to exert </p><p>only a fraction of the power necessary to </p><p>right it. </p><p> The only reassuring observation that I</p><p>made was one which showed that my dis- </p><p>tance from the sun had grown slightly less, </p><p>rather than greater. The apparent size of </p><p>the sun was larger than it had been when </p><p>I went to sleep and the tongues of flame </p><p>licking cut from its surface were more dis- </p><p>tinct. This was in accordance with my </p><p>mapped course which should have brought </p><p>me at that time lo about the nearest point </p><p>of the course to the sun. </p><p> A moment’s calm reflection gave me the</p><p>answer to the strange problem, and showed </p><p>that my only real danger had been that </p><p>of becoming panicky and doing something </p><p>which I would have been unable to undo </p><p>later. The ship, in fact, was following ex- </p><p>actly the course laid down for it, despite </p><p>the fact that its nose was now pointing </p><p>further and further away from the sun. </p><p>What had happened was that when the </p><p>ship began its curve around the sun there </p><p>was no force to change the direction in </p><p>which the ship pointed. In the Earth’s at- </p><p>mosphere, of course, the air pressure on </p><p>the stream lines would have held the nose </p><p>of the ship straight. The vacuum of space </p><p>offers no such resistance, and with the rock- </p><p>ets turned off there was nothing to prevent </p><p>the ship from traveling sidewise or even </p><p>tail first. In fact, I saw that if left alone </p><p>the ship actually would be going tail first </p><p>when it reached the end of the arc around </p><p>the sun and swept on toward Venus. Nor </p><p>would that have mattered except for one </p><p>thing—the cooling system was arranged to </p><p>apply only to the right side of the ship </p><p>and it would be fatal to expose the plates </p><p>on the unprotected left side to the intense </p><p>rays of the sun. </p><p> I accordingly turned on the rocket pow-</p><p>er slightly, and by inclining the exhaust to </p><p>the starboard side, pushed the tail to the </p><p>left. When the ship had assumed its cor- </p><p>rect position relative to the sun, I straight-</p><p>THE STRUGGLE FOR VENUS </p><p>727 </p><p>ened the exhaust to stabilize it on the course </p><p>and then again cut off the power. </p><p>BEFORE I again lay down for a nap </p><p>I had the satisfaction of seeing an ex- </p><p>ceedingly bright planet appear from be- </p><p>hind the sun. It was Venus, which the day </p><p>before had been lost to view as I swept </p><p>around the far side of the sun from it. At </p><p>last I was on the home stretch, and headed </p><p>for my goal. </p><p> What, I wondered, had been the fortune</p><p>of the party of colonists in the meantime? </p><p>Had they again established wireless com- </p><p>munication with Earth after a silence forced </p><p>by some circumstances of which I could </p><p>know nothing? Had the lost men returned, </p><p>the tanks of fuel mixture been recovered, </p><p>and would I find the camp firmly estab- </p><p>lished and all going well? </p><p> Or had the mysterious raids on the camp</p><p>been continued? Would I perchance find </p><p>that the entire party had been wiped out </p><p>and that I was the only man alive on the </p><p>planet? In the latter case the chances would </p><p>be heavily against my survival, although I </p><p>would be forewarned of danger and on guard </p><p>from the first. </p><p> These restless speculations engrossed my</p><p>mind more and more during the days that </p><p>followed, as the planet Venus steadily grew </p><p>larger to the eye. I could tell that my ship, </p><p>sweeping through apace at a tremendous </p><p>rate, lessening however as it receded from </p><p>the sun, would almost exactly strike the </p><p>planet. That was well because, although I </p><p>could easily fly under power to the planet </p><p>from my position inside its orbit and slight- </p><p>ly ahead of it, I wished to save as much </p><p>fuel mixture as possible. It might prove </p><p>necessary to attempt to return to Earth in </p><p>one of the larger ships at the next inferior </p><p>conjunction and in that event the extra sup- </p><p>ply of fuel mixture which I carried would </p><p>be none too much. </p><p> In the final stage of my journey the ship</p><p>was traveling about at right angles to the </p><p>motion of Venus, and the two bodies were </p><p>converging with a tremendous mutual vel- </p><p>ocity. From an apparent size equal to that </p><p>of the moon seen from Earth, the disk of</p><p>Venus perceptibly enlarged. It became ob- </p><p>vious at length that, il left to follow the </p><p>orbit into which it had settled, my ship </p><p>would crash into the planet—so exact had </p><p>been the calculations of the astronomers of </p><p>the Commission. </p><p> When still about one million miles off</p><p>I turned on the power and altered my </p><p>course toward a point somewhat in front </p><p>of the planet. I then began reducing the </p><p>speed of the ship, using the rocket power </p><p>as a brake. Twelve hours later my journey </p><p>was practically finished as I hovered over </p><p>the northern hemisphere about a hundred </p><p>miles from the surface of the planet, but </p><p>well within its atmospheric shell. </p><p> CHAPTER VI.</p><p> The Raiders.</p><p>FROM a great height the continent of </p><p>Elysia looked like a green carpet spot- </p><p>ted with patches of white and brown. Be- </p><p>low me I recognized the contours of a large </p><p>peninsula which my map showed to be </p><p>about 200 miles east of the mouth of the </p><p>Holmes River. Before setting out for that </p><p>point I dropped lower to view the surface </p><p>of the planet at close range. </p><p> The green carpet was a forest of trees</p><p>which I estimated to be all of 200 feet high, </p><p>and it stretched inland as far as the eye </p><p>could reach. Their tops were waving in a </p><p>breeze hardly perceptible otherwise, and </p><p>above them there was no sign of bird life </p><p>or life of any sort. When I swooped down </p><p>close to the water, however, I saw a group </p><p>of large reptilian animals slither into a </p><p>marshy backwater from the bank, where </p><p>they had been sunning themselves. I mount- </p><p>ed to an elevation of about 1,000 feet and </p><p>headed westward toward the destination of </p><p>my long journey. After 45 days spent alone </p><p>in the small space ship I had the strong- </p><p>est desire to set my feet on solid ground </p><p>again and to find someone of my own kind </p><p>to talk to. </p><p> After half an hour, about the time I had</p><p>allowed myself to cover the 200 miles, </p><p>.1 saw that I was approaching a wide in- </p><p>dentation in the coast line, which I judged </p><p>to be the mouth of the Holmes River. Two </p><p>miles upstream I should find Commander </p><p>Jones’ camp.</p><p>728 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p> As I came nearer, however, I saw with</p><p>surprise what appeared to be evidence of </p><p>man’s work on a bluff on the far side of </p><p>the wide bay. The top of the bluff had </p><p>been cleared and levelled off, and on it </p><p>had been erected a dome-like mound of </p><p>earth resembling a large Eskimo igloo. </p><p>There was a circular opening in the top, </p><p>and other openings, apparently entrances, </p><p>around the circular base. The fresh dirt </p><p>gave evidence that the structure, whatever </p><p>it was, had been finished comparatively </p><p>recently. The idea which leaped to my </p><p>mind as I tried to explain this unexpected </p><p>discovery was that Commander Jones had </p><p>deserted his first camp for some reason and </p><p>had moved to this point, two miles down, </p><p>at the mouth of the river, and had erected </p><p>this strange habitation. Why, then, had no </p><p>one come out to welcome me? </p><p> The most logical answer was that, be-</p><p>lieving it impossible for anyone to make </p><p>the trip from Earth at the time, they took </p><p>me for an enemy. I hovered low and per- </p><p>mitted my ship to drift over the mound so </p><p>that if any of the party were concealed </p><p>there they could recognize the ship as an </p><p>Earthly one. When I came directly over </p><p>the opening I could see that the mound was </p><p>hollow. I could make out nothing in the </p><p>dimly lighted interior, and there was still </p><p>no sign of life. As I searched the strange </p><p>mound with my eyes, however, I saw a pen- </p><p>cil ray of intense light suddenly directed </p><p>from somewhere within it at my ship. </p><p> Almost immediately' I saw a wisp of</p><p>smoke from the floor of the ship near the </p><p>stern. The ray was cutting through both </p><p>inner and outer plates with the ease of an </p><p>acetylene torch flame eating through a thin </p><p>sheet of lead. </p><p> I sprang to the throttle and advanced it.</p><p>With a tremendous roar the ship leaped </p><p>forward so that I was almost thrown to </p><p>the floor. In barely a second I was out of </p><p>sight of the mound over the trees which </p><p>surrounded the cleared bluff on the land </p><p>side. There I again stopped the ship, let- </p><p>ting it drift while I examined the damage. </p><p>The ray had cut a semicircular arc through </p><p>the inner and outer plates of the ship, and </p><p>had punctured the overhead plates as well.</p><p>It had come perilously close to the reserve </p><p>tanks of fuel mixture, which would have </p><p>exploded and annihilated the ship if they </p><p>had been exposed to it. As it was the ship </p><p>had been rendered useless for interplanet- </p><p>ary travel, although it could still be used </p><p>in the atmosphere of Venus. </p><p> I had travelled some ten miles from the</p><p>bluff when the ship again came to rest. </p><p>After I had finished my inspection of the </p><p>ship I looked about me and was surprised </p><p>to notice a wide river about a mile ahead. </p><p>I recalled then that I had not seen the riv- </p><p>er before. An examination of the map con- </p><p>vinced me that in fact the bluff where the </p><p>strange mound Was situated was actually </p><p>on the arm of a small bay, and that the </p><p>Holmes River lay in front of me. I ac- </p><p>cordingly proceeded slowly to the river </p><p>and turned downstream over it, since I knew </p><p>I was more than two miles inland. A few </p><p>minutes later I sighted a collection of huts </p><p>on the right bank, and a short distance </p><p>away were the two large space ships used </p><p>by the Jones expedition. It was unques- </p><p>tionably the camp established by the party. </p><p>It was overgrown with creepers, however, </p><p>and gave every sign of being completely </p><p>deserted. I settled down over it and saw </p><p>that my judgment was correct. There was </p><p>no sign of life in the camp. Carefully I </p><p>brought my ship to rest near the two large </p><p>space ships, and stepped out to the ground. </p><p>I was convinced that I had accidentally </p><p>stumbled on the home of the creatures </p><p>whose mysterious attacks had disrupted the </p><p>expedition. Furthermore I had had a ter- </p><p>rible demonstration of the power they were </p><p>able to wield. I resolved that, forwarned </p><p>as I was, I should not share the fate of </p><p>Commander Jones and his aides, whatever </p><p>it might have been. Undoubtedly the creat- </p><p>ures would look for me at the site of the </p><p>camp. As I had not seen them I could </p><p>form no idea of how formidable they would </p><p>be. I decided to inspect the camp hurriedly </p><p>and then conceal my ship nearby and re- </p><p>turn to watch developments. </p><p> In the limited time which I allowed my-</p><p>self I hoped to discover some record which </p><p>would 'indicate the fate of the colonists, </p><p>THE STRUGGLE FOR VENUS </p><p>729 </p><p>and also, if the wireless set were in order, </p><p>to send a message to Earth telling of my </p><p>arrival. I turned first to the semi-circular </p><p>row of huts and searched them rapidly. The </p><p>huts and their contents had suffered con- </p><p>siderable damage from rain since being de- </p><p>serted. They still contained most of the </p><p>personal effects of the colonists, indicating </p><p>that the desertion of the camp had been ac- </p><p>complished in great haste. In the fourth </p><p>hut which I entered I found evidence that </p><p>it had been occupied by Commander Jones. </p><p>There was a box containing some of the </p><p>instruments taken from the space ships. On </p><p>a shelf I found what I most wanted—the </p><p>log of the trip. I opened it quickly and </p><p>found, to my intense disappointment, that </p><p>the last entry had been made on the day </p><p>when the final message from the party was </p><p>received by me in Washington. There was </p><p>nothing to tell how or why the camp had </p><p>been deserted, which confirmed my suspi- </p><p>cion that the colonists had been overcome </p><p>by a sudden attack directed from the mound </p><p>on the coast. </p><p> I tucked the slightly mouldy book under</p><p>my arm, to study it later at. leisure, and </p><p>completed a hasty examination of the camp. </p><p>I was unable to understand the complete </p><p>lack of evidence of an extensive struggle. </p><p>The fact that there were no human remains </p><p>anywhere in the camp permitted me to be- </p><p>lieve with some cause that the colonists </p><p>were still alive. But whether they were </p><p>prisoners or had been driven to some other </p><p>part of the continent remained to be seen. </p><p> My search was next directed to the two</p><p>large space ships. The thin waterproof </p><p>cover of one of them had been torn and </p><p>the ship’s plates were rusting. I entered </p><p>the other one and found from a cursory </p><p>examination that it appeared to be in first </p><p>class condition. The apparatus for com- </p><p>pressing and liquefying air was in seem- </p><p>ingly good repair, but the tanks of fuel </p><p>mixture, without which liquid air was use- </p><p>less for motive purposes, were missing. </p><p> The wireless apparatus had been set up</p><p>in this ship, and a rapid examination con- </p><p>vinced me that it had not been damaged. </p><p>As I was looking over it more carefully I </p><p>heard a chattering sound which seemed to</p><p>come from the direction of the huts. I </p><p>slipped over to one of the ports on that side. </p><p>What I saw took away my breath and made </p><p>my heart beats ccase suddenly. </p><p> A large balloon-like object, shaped like</p><p>a dirigible, had settled quietly to the </p><p>ground on the other side of my space ship, </p><p>and from its interior were alighting several </p><p>creatures whom I felt sure were from the </p><p>mound colony. In general appearance they </p><p>bore a remarkable resemblance to human be- </p><p>ings, although they were unlike any men I </p><p>had ever seen. They were slightly smaller </p><p>than the average man, and had large heads, </p><p>big round eyes which protrudede, and point- </p><p>ed noses and chins. They moved rapidly and </p><p>alertly. They wore tunics which fell freely </p><p>from their shoulders to their knees. </p><p> As I watched breathlessly, between twen-</p><p>ty and twenty-five of these beings, presum- </p><p>ably natives of Venus who had escaped dis- </p><p>covery on the first exploration of the plan- </p><p>et, alighted from the object which I could </p><p>only suppose to be some sort of flying </p><p>machine. Two. of them immediately walked </p><p>to my space ship and after examining it </p><p>from the outside entered through the open </p><p>passage. The others scattered to search the </p><p>camp. </p><p> I realized that despite my resolutions, I</p><p>had allowed myself to be outwitted by the </p><p>enemy in the first encounter. The creatures </p><p>had surprised me in overwhelming numbers, </p><p>and in addition, as I knew, were probably </p><p>better armed than I was. Knowing that they </p><p>would soon search the large ships for me, </p><p>I decided that the best thing to do under </p><p>the circumstances was to attempt to hide </p><p>in the underbrush until they had left the </p><p>camp. The space ship was on the edge of </p><p>the camp and I was able to keep it between </p><p>me and the creatures until I reached the </p><p>protection of the trees and undergrowth. I </p><p>worked my way silently further into the </p><p>forest and then climbed into the lower </p><p>branches of a tree and mounted to where I </p><p>was able to obtain a fairly unobstructed </p><p>view of the camp. </p><p>A Meeting </p><p>THE Venusians, as I judged them to be, </p><p>did not seem particularly perturbed </p><p>730 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>over my escape. As I watched them through </p><p>the branches of the trees they concluded a </p><p>search of the camp and collected around </p><p>the balloon, or whatever it was, in which </p><p>they had arrived. There was a conference </p><p>and then several of them went to my ship </p><p>and entered it. They emerged within a few </p><p>minutes each carrying two of the tanks of </p><p>fuel mixture. They made several more trips </p><p>until all the tanks had been removed to </p><p>their ship. I could see that they were pre- </p><p>paring to leave, undoubtedly thinking that </p><p>I had been rendered helpless by the loss of </p><p>the fuel. I watched with the utmost interest </p><p>as they entered their conveyance. A clever- </p><p>ly constructed door closed downward, ap- </p><p>parently sealing the ship airtight. Then </p><p>without a sound and with no means of pro- </p><p>pulsion which I could observe, the object </p><p>rose in the air and headed purposefully in </p><p>the direction of the mound. </p><p> I descended the tree and made my way</p><p>back toward the camp. At the fringe of the </p><p>underbrush as I was about to step into the </p><p>cleared space I heard a rustling sound </p><p>nearby to the right. I dropped to the </p><p>ground, although the noise had come from </p><p>so near I was almost sure I had been ob- </p><p>served. My fears turned to amazed joy when </p><p>I looked up and saw a man step from be- </p><p>hind a tree a few yards away. It was Cap- </p><p>tain Matthew Eddy! </p><p> “Starrett!” he cried. “But how on earth</p><p>_» </p><p> Captain Eddy’s joy and surprise at this</p><p>unexpected meeting equalled mine. He was </p><p>at first unable to believe my story of the </p><p>trip around the sun, but my presence and </p><p>that of the small ship forced him to accept </p><p>it. He then told me briefly the history of </p><p>the expedition in the following words: </p><p> “You already know of the disappearance</p><p>of Smith and Fall, and later of six other </p><p>members of the party, and of the theft of </p><p>our fuel mixture. We were totally at a loss </p><p>to explain these mysteries, especially as we </p><p>had every reason to believe that there were </p><p>on Venus no other intelligent beings than </p><p>ourselves. </p><p> “On the night following the first inva-</p><p>sion of the camp I was awakened by a cry </p><p>.from the adjoining hut. As I started up I </p><p>saw two man-like creatures framed in th« </p><p>doorway. They immediately pounced upon </p><p>me and before I was really awake they had </p><p>overpowered and bound me. I was left </p><p>alone in the hut for about five minutes, and </p><p>in that time I managed to slip the knot in </p><p>the wiry cord which held my arms and free </p><p>myself. I realized from the sounds I heard </p><p>that the camp had been invaded in force </p><p>and that all the men probably had been </p><p>made prisoners as I had. Knowing that the </p><p>fate of the entire party might depend upon </p><p>me I crept cautiously to the door and </p><p>looked out. There were about a hundred </p><p>of the strange men in sight, many of them </p><p>gathered around what resembled a dirigible </p><p>which rested in the camp. Others were car- </p><p>rying the bound forms of my comrades and </p><p>placing them in the object—which I have </p><p>reason to believe is nothing less than a space </p><p>ship. </p><p> “It was obvious tl^at if I showed myself</p><p>I would immediately be overpowered and </p><p>captured. The lives of my comrades ap- </p><p>peared to be in no immediate danger and I </p><p>decided that my best chance of rescuing </p><p>them lay in maintaining my own freedom </p><p>and watching developments. Accordingly I </p><p>made a hole in the rear of the hut, and, </p><p>unobserved, slipped out of the camp. I was </p><p>the only one who escaped the raid. The </p><p>others were all placed, securely bound, in </p><p>the raiders’ ship. Ten minutes later I saw </p><p>the ship rise silently until it was outlined </p><p>against the stars high overhead. It then </p><p>headed swiftly in a northeasterly direction.” </p><p> Captain Eddy told me briefly how he had</p><p>set out immediately in the direction taken </p><p>by the raiding party, and after a week’s </p><p>search had found the mound colony. He </p><p>had stayed in the neighborhood of the </p><p>mound ever since, except for an occasional </p><p>trip through the ten miles of jungle back </p><p>to the camp for supplies. He had observed </p><p>the actions of the mound men from trees </p><p>on the fringe of the cleared bluff, but had </p><p>seen no trace of the prisoners. His obser- </p><p>vations had convinced him, for one thing, </p><p>that the dirigible used by the mound men </p><p>was really a space ship of some strange </p><p>kind. </p><p> “I have come to the conclusion,” he said,</p><p>FHE STRUGGLE FOR VENUS </p><p>731 </p><p>**that the mound creatures are not natives </p><p>of this planet any more than we are. They </p><p>are totally unlike any other form of life </p><p>to be found on Venus, and it is almost in- </p><p>conceivable that they have developed here </p><p>so tremendously in advance of everything </p><p>else on the planet. It would be no more </p><p>incongruous to imagine modern men living </p><p>in the same world with the prehistoric ani- </p><p>mals which roamed over Earth when it </p><p>was comparatively young. </p><p> “Moreover the fact that there is only a</p><p>single colony and that the party has a space </p><p>ship is almost conclusive evidence that they </p><p>are visitors from another planet. It is my </p><p>opinion that the party came here from Mars, </p><p>where, we have reason to believe, there is </p><p>life similar to that on Earth.” </p><p> The force of what my companion said</p><p>was apparent, and I was inclined to share </p><p>his view. If it were the truth, we were un- </p><p>doubtedly faced by the strangest situation </p><p>any man had encountered. Nevertheless, </p><p>that view of the situation held more hope </p><p>than any other I could imagine. If the </p><p>mound creatures were indeed Martians then </p><p>their number was limited. If Captain Eddy </p><p>and I could outwit them—find some means </p><p>of freeing our comrades—the struggle for </p><p>control of the planet should not be too </p><p>unequal, although I was sure the mound </p><p>creatures—whether Martians or natives of </p><p>Venus—would prove worthy opponents. </p><p>My companion told me that there were </p><p>about 150 of them living in an excavation </p><p>in the bluff, to which the openings in the </p><p>mound were entrances. About half of them </p><p>went daily in the space ship to some point </p><p>west of the Holmes River, he said. As he </p><p>had no way of crossing the river he had </p><p>been unable to discover the objects of these </p><p>trips. </p><p> Captain Eddy told me that h? had made</p><p>an attempt to operate the wireless set but </p><p>that his knowledge of radio was not suffi- </p><p>cient to enable him to succeed. Together we </p><p>slipped into the space ship and I began </p><p>working on the set. </p><p> I found that the batteries had lost some</p><p>of their strength, but nevertheless 1 made </p><p>the necessary adjustments, and began flash-</p><p>ing the earth call at five minute intervals. </p><p>Several hours later, when I was about to </p><p>give up in despair, I caught an answer. I </p><p>then transmitted a brief but thorough ac- </p><p>count of the supposed fate of the party of </p><p>colonists, with the assurance that Captain </p><p>Eddy and I would do all possible to rescue </p><p>them if they proved to be prisoners of the </p><p>mound men. </p><p>CHAPTER VII. </p><p>Trapped. </p><p>AT Captain Eddy’s suggestion we spent </p><p>the night in a tree near the camp, </p><p>sleeping on a platform of boards taken </p><p>from one of the huts. At dawn we ate </p><p>breakkfast in the camp and then set out </p><p>for the coast, working our way through the </p><p>light underbrush. Although the going was </p><p>not difficult it was necessarily slow, and the </p><p>sun indicated it was noon when we finally </p><p>approached the bluff on which the mound </p><p>was located. We were aided by the fact </p><p>that the force of gravity on Venus is almost </p><p>a fifth less than on Earth, so that while we </p><p>retained our strength on Venus we lost </p><p>about one fifth of our weight. Consequent- </p><p>ly we were able to walk much more lightly </p><p>and to leap over obstacles which, on Earth, </p><p>we would have had to climb painfully. </p><p>Moreover the weight of other objects was </p><p>similarly reduced, so that 120 pounds could </p><p>be lifted with the same effort that would be </p><p>required to raise 100 pounds on Earth. </p><p> We lunched on the sap of a milk tree in</p><p>which my companion had set a spigot. The </p><p>fluid tasted considerably like milk and Cap- </p><p>tain Eddy told me that Dr. Alexander, the </p><p>chemist of the expedition, had found it par- </p><p>ticularly nourishing. The trees were plen- </p><p>tiful along the coast, growing to a height </p><p>of about 20 feet under the shelter of the </p><p>tall trees. </p><p> We then approached cautiously nearer</p><p>the bluff and climbed into a tree which my </p><p>companion had found well suited for ob- </p><p>servation. The space ship was not in sight, </p><p>having gone as usual somewhere to the </p><p>westward. Nor were any of the mound men </p><p>visible at the time. Five minutes later, how- </p><p>ever, we saw ten of the creatures emerge </p><p>from one of the openings at the base of </p><p>the mound. They descended the bluff and </p><p>732 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>disappeared in the forest to the left. </p><p> I suggested, imprudently enough, that</p><p>Captain Eddy remain where he was while </p><p>I made an attempt to cross the bluff and </p><p>enter the mound, in the hope of reaching </p><p>the prisoners and freeing them. Captain </p><p>Eddy emphatically vetoed the plan, telling </p><p>me that the top of the bluff was constantly </p><p>watched. He then outlined his own plan of </p><p>action, which required that we remain </p><p>where we were until after dark, when one </p><p>of us could try to penetrate the home of the </p><p>mound creatures. Captain Eddy had often </p><p>wished, during the two months he had </p><p>watched the mound, that he were free to </p><p>make a similar attempt. The odds against </p><p>success were so great, however, and his re- </p><p>sponsibility as the only free colonist was </p><p>so great that he had not risked it. Now that </p><p>there were two of us he agreed with me </p><p>that the effort must be made. At my in- </p><p>sistence he agreed that I make the attempt, </p><p>while he remained in the forest. </p><p> As we were discussing this plan in whis-</p><p>pers I realized suddenly that the tree in </p><p>which we were concealed was swinging </p><p>slowly out of it9 vertical position. Startled, </p><p>I looked down and saw, far below me, at </p><p>the base of the tree, a pencil ray of light </p><p>eating through the trunk. The swing toward </p><p>the ground continued with increasing mo- </p><p>mentum and in a second the tall tree was </p><p>crashing through the branches of its neigh- </p><p>bors, while Captain Eddy and I were </p><p>scratched and buffetted and finally torn </p><p>loose from the branches to which we were </p><p>clinging. The resistance of the other trees </p><p>slowed our fall somewhat, but I was thrown </p><p>clear of the tree when it finally crashed </p><p>through, and struck the ground with suf- </p><p>ficient force to stun me momentarily. </p><p> Before I could move two of the strange</p><p>men from the mound pounced on me like </p><p>cats and pinioned my arras. I struggled as </p><p>well as my returning strength permitted and </p><p>for a half-second flung them free. The next </p><p>instant they were back, and several others </p><p>dashed in to aid them. After a fierce but </p><p>brief struggle one of them slipped a noose </p><p>over me and drew it tight about my arms. </p><p>I was rendered helpless and, though I con- </p><p>tinued to kick and writhe as long as pos-</p><p>sible, they quickly completed the work of </p><p>trussing me securely. When I finally re- </p><p>laxed, realizing the futility of further strug- </p><p>gling, I was laid on the ground. A minute </p><p>later the bound form of Captain Eddy was </p><p>placed beside me. I saw that he was un- </p><p>conscious, and that his forehead was bleed- </p><p>ing, but I could not tell how badly he was </p><p>hurt. </p><p> Our captors, who were the same ten we</p><p>had seen leave the mound, chattered briefly </p><p>among themselves, and then Captain Eddy </p><p>and I were picked up and carried up the </p><p>bluff and into the mound. After carrying </p><p>us through a short passage from the en- </p><p>trance our captors descended a long flight </p><p>of steps cut in the dirt. The lower level </p><p>was lighted with a soft pleasant glow the </p><p>source of which I could not determine. A </p><p>large central arena was revealed, with cells </p><p>around the walls and with six passageways </p><p>running off at intervals of sixty degrees. </p><p>We were transported down one of these </p><p>passages for about fifty feet—half of its </p><p>length—and the party halted in front of a </p><p>door. One of the mound men turned several </p><p>levers, and then swung the door open, re- </p><p>vealing a vestibule about ten feet wide and </p><p>fifteen feet long, with a closed door at the </p><p>far end. </p><p>WE were laid on the ground in the cen- </p><p>ter of the vestibule and the mound </p><p>men departed, closing the door through </p><p>which they had carried us. Some thirty </p><p>seconds elapsed and then there was a sharp </p><p>click. Immediately the inner door opened </p><p>and Commander Jones and several others </p><p>of the missing colonists appeared. They </p><p>did not seem particularly surprised to see </p><p>the form of Captain Eddy, but their amaze- </p><p>ment when I was recognized can be better </p><p>imagined than described. Our mutual ex- </p><p>clamations were interrupted after a moment </p><p>by a low musical note from the inner room. </p><p>Apparently it was a warning. </p><p> “Quick!” Commander Jones ordered in</p><p>a sharp voice, “Drag them in!” </p><p> Friendly hands grabbed me and dragged</p><p>me, still bound, through the open door. </p><p>Others carried the still unconscious Cap- </p><p>tain Eddy into the large room which was </p><p>THE STRUGGLE FOR VENUS </p><p>733 </p><p>revealed, and the door then snapped shut. </p><p> Commander Jones turned his attention to</p><p>Captain Eddy, while others quickly un- </p><p>bound me. My companion had suffered a </p><p>bad cut on the back of his head. He revived </p><p>as his head was being bathed with water </p><p>taken from a small channel which led </p><p>through the underground chamber, and it </p><p>was found that his wound, while painful, </p><p>was not serious. </p><p> Commander Jones then listened with the</p><p>utmost interest to a recital of my trip from </p><p>Earth.- </p><p> “We heard something of your arrival</p><p>from our jailors,” he said, surprisingly, </p><p>“but it seemed so incredible that we decid- </p><p>ed there was some mistake. As for poor </p><p>Eddy, we have had regular reports of his </p><p>activities. While he thought he was unob- </p><p>served he has been under constant surveil- </p><p>lance and could have been captured at any </p><p>time during the two months we have been </p><p>held here.” </p><p> “Do you mean that you can communi-</p><p>cate with your jailors?” I asked, “And for </p><p>that matter, who and what are they?” </p><p> “I can tell you everything that we know</p><p>about them very quickly,” Commander </p><p>Jones said. </p><p> “Soon after we were made prisoners I</p><p>was taken into an office in another part of </p><p>this ant hill. There was a recognizable </p><p>map of the heavens on a table. One of our </p><p>captors who acted as spokesman indicated </p><p>Earth on the map and pointed to me. I </p><p>nodded my head, foolishly thinking that he </p><p>would understand that affirmative sign. </p><p>When he failed to do so I touched my chest </p><p>with my finger and then placed the finger </p><p>on the dot indicating Earth. This he under- </p><p>stood, and in a like manner he told me that </p><p>he and his companions came from Mars. </p><p> “He then touched himself and indicated</p><p>his companions. Placing his finger on Mars </p><p>he traced a path to Venus. Then he nodded </p><p>his head vigorously. I wras forced to laugh, </p><p>as you would laugh at a monkey, by the </p><p>celerity with which he had adopted my sign</p><p>of affirmation once he understood it. I re- </p><p>alized, however, that he was no monkey, but </p><p>a being of quick intelligence. But his </p><p>message was not completed. He next indi- </p><p>cated Earth on the map and traced a path </p><p>to Venus, and then made a sign of break- </p><p>ing something in his hands. The meaning </p><p>was plain enough. He was telling me that </p><p>Venus should belong to the men of Mars </p><p>and not to the men of Earth. My reply was </p><p>to show my defiance in the same manner </p><p>he had adopted. </p><p>. “Since that day I have had many con- </p><p>ferences with the same individual and we </p><p>have developed a means of communicating </p><p>ideas with a minimum of effort. I have </p><p>picked up some of their vocal sounds and </p><p>he has learned a remarkable amount of </p><p>something approximating English. Al- </p><p>though there is a certain amount of friend- </p><p>liness between us because of this ability to </p><p>understand one another, his enmity as a </p><p>Martian against all Earth men, and his de- </p><p>termination to keep Venus for his own race </p><p>is unaffected. </p><p> “The present expedition of Martians</p><p>numbers about 200 and they have been on </p><p>Venus for more than two years. During </p><p>that time they have not been able to com- </p><p>municate with Mars. I was surprised that </p><p>they had not developed wireless until I </p><p>learned that they have the ability of trans- </p><p>mitting thought very efficiently. This, of </p><p>course, made wireless unnecessary pn their </p><p>home planet, but it cannot be used for </p><p>more than a few thousand miles. </p><p> “As a result of this the party must return</p><p>to Mars to report the success of their trip </p><p>and their discoveries here. They are plan- </p><p>ning to leave within a few weeks, when the </p><p>position of Mars will be favorable. Then </p><p>at the next favorable conjunction they plan </p><p>to return with other ships and several thou- </p><p>sand of their fellows. They expect that </p><p>ten years from now the entire population </p><p>of Mars will have been transferred to Venus, </p><p>since Mars is rapidly becoming incapable </p><p>of supporting life. The population of that </p><p>planet now is only about a million, as </p><p>nearly as I can make out. </p><p> “One thing they have given me to under-</p><p>stand very definitely. Before they leave </p><p>Venus they plan to kill all of our party,</p><p>not out of any feeling of enmity, but sole- </p><p>ly to eliminate the possibility that we will </p><p>return to Earth for reinforcements and will </p><p>734 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>contest with them the possession of Venus. </p><p>The idea has never occurred to them that </p><p>the men on Earth already know of the suc- </p><p>cess of our trip and the nature of condi- </p><p>tions on Venus.” </p><p>t*T3UT can’t we do anything?” I pro- </p><p> 13 tested.</p><p> “We have not been inactive,” Commander</p><p>Jones replied, “and we have high hopes of </p><p>escaping and outwitting them. I must ex- </p><p>plain to you first the nature of our prison. </p><p> “The walls are charged with an electric</p><p>current at high tension and it is only neces- </p><p>sary to press on them to receive a very </p><p>severe shock. Since the connections are be- </p><p>hind the walls we are unable to get at them, </p><p>and it would do no good if we could, be- </p><p>cause they would know it immediately if the </p><p>current were interrupted. They have a spe- </p><p>cial connection by which they can permit </p><p>us to go into the vestibule to get food they </p><p>have left there, but if we linger the current </p><p>is switched on. Our water we get from </p><p>the stream running through the end of the </p><p>room. It drops to a lower level near the </p><p>wall, you see, and serves there to dispose of </p><p>waste. It is the system of plumbing which </p><p>they have provided for the entire colony.” </p><p> He led me over to the wall beyond the</p><p>small stream and raised a box which rested </p><p>there. Under it was a hole about three feet </p><p>across leading down into the ground. </p><p> “Soon after we were imprisoned here we</p><p>began working on a tunnel under the walls, </p><p>disposing of the dirt in small quantities by </p><p>letting the stream carry it out to the ocean. </p><p>It is now completed to within a foot of the </p><p>surface near the base of the bluff on the </p><p>land side, and we are only waiting the pro- </p><p>pitious moment to put out escape to the </p><p>test.” </p><p> Commander Jones next led me to the dou-</p><p>ble row of bunks in the center of the room. </p><p>Under the foot of one of the bunks he </p><p>pointed out two containers which I recog- </p><p>nized as cans of fuel mixture. </p><p> “I found out where these were kept,” he</p><p>explained, “when my Martian captor ques- </p><p>tioned me about them. These two are all I </p><p>have been able to slip in here unobserved </p><p>on my various trips into the other parts of </p><p>the ant hill. They will serve our purpose </p><p>I think.” </p><p> While others of our fellow prisoners</p><p>gathered around us Commander Jones ex- </p><p>plained to me the plan that had been work- </p><p>ed out. The tunnel could be forced through </p><p>at the base of the bluff at any time by a few </p><p>minutes’ work. Our leader thought it best </p><p>to wait for a few days, until the exact plans </p><p>of the Martians were revealed, and make the </p><p>break for liberty at the last moment con- </p><p>sistent with safety. Two of the men would </p><p>slip out under cover of darkness, carrying </p><p>the two tanks of fuel mixture with them, </p><p>and make their way to the abandoned camp </p><p>where the two large space ships and my </p><p>small one were deserted. </p><p> A highly explosive bomb could be made</p><p>by injecting a small amount of the fuel </p><p>mixture into one of the heavy tanks of </p><p>liquid air. Using the rest of the fuel mix- </p><p>ture to operate one of the ships, the pair </p><p>would return over the mound and drop the </p><p>bomb on it. The attack on the mound would </p><p>be timed exactly, and before it was made </p><p>the remaining prisoners would slip out </p><p>through the tunnel and escape to a safe dis- </p><p>tance from the bluff. </p><p> There was a large group of the colonists</p><p>who chafed at the proposed delay in action. </p><p>It was their argument that the Martians </p><p>might at any time decide to carry out their </p><p>announced plan of doing away with all of </p><p>us. It was argued that their capture of </p><p>Captain Eddy and me, putting all of the </p><p>Earth men on Venus in their power, indi- </p><p>cated that the crisis was near. At any </p><p>moment they might introduce into the un- </p><p>derground chamber a poisonous gas which </p><p>would give us no chance of resistance, or </p><p>of using the tunnel. </p><p> This faction proved the more weighty,</p><p>and when Commander Jones acceded to the </p><p>wishes of the majority it was decided that </p><p>the attempt should be made that night. </p><p>Commander Jones refused to leave what he </p><p>considered the position of greatest danger, </p><p>nor did Captain Eddy’s condition permit </p><p>him to indulge in anything so strenuous as</p><p>a ten-mile trip through the forest. Com- </p><p>mander Jones accordingly appointed Arthur </p><p>Rhodes, one of the most resourceful mem- </p><p>THE STRUGGLE FOR VENUS </p><p>735 </p><p>bers of the party, as one of the pair to make </p><p>the attempt to bomb the mound. I was </p><p>picked as his companion because of my </p><p>familiarity with the operation of both the </p><p>small and the large space ships. </p><p> About an hour before dawn the follow-</p><p>ing morning Rhodes slipped headfirst into </p><p>the hole in the floor and wriggled out of </p><p>sight. 1 followed, although the dark hole </p><p>was anything but inviting. I made my way </p><p>through the tunnel more slowly than my </p><p>companion, pushing the two containers of </p><p>fuel mixture before me. When I finally </p><p>touched his foot with my outstretched hand </p><p>he whispered to me to lie quietly for a mo- </p><p>men. He had already removed some of the </p><p>dirt at the end of the passage. After a </p><p>moment, when no sound reached us, he re- </p><p>sumed work, passing back handfuls of dirt </p><p>to me, which 1 distributed on the floor. </p><p>After a few moments I felt him slip forward </p><p>and then felt a breath of cool air. I silent- </p><p>ly wriggled forward and slid out of the </p><p>end of the tunnel. We placed a piece of </p><p>brush over the opening and then slipped in- </p><p>to the forest carrying our burden, apparent- </p><p>ly unobserved. </p><p> We proceeded slowly until sunrise, after</p><p>which we were able to make better time. </p><p>Considerably before noon we came to the </p><p>river bank and soon located the camp. We </p><p>had decided to use one of the large ships, </p><p>since they were equipped with chambers in </p><p>the floor through which the bomb could be </p><p>dropped. We accordingly set to work at </p><p>once dismantling the aerial posts from the </p><p>ship which was in the better condition of </p><p>the two. That completed we entered the </p><p>ship and continued our preparations, ar- </p><p>ranging the powerful bomb and fixing a </p><p>fuse to it. </p><p> All was in readiness long before night,</p><p>but we were forced to wait until the prear- </p><p>ranged hour to give our companions an op- </p><p>portunity to escape from their prison. </p><p>CHAPTER VIII. </p><p>The Battle in Space. </p><p>AN hour after sunset we closed the door </p><p>of the big ship. I loosed the rocket </p><p>power and the ship rose swiftly to a height</p><p>of several hundred feet, where I steadied it. </p><p>As it would take no more than a few minutes </p><p>to arrive over the mound colony, Arthur </p><p>Rhodes was already stationed at the center </p><p>of the ship, where the improvised bomb </p><p>lay in the chamber in readiness to be drop- </p><p>ped. His voice came to me over the tele- </p><p>phone. </p><p> “O.K. Let’ergo!”</p><p> I turned in the direction of the mound and</p><p>picked up a speed of about 200 miles an </p><p>hour. 1 did not wish to go too fast as it </p><p>would be necessary to slow down over the </p><p>bluff on the sea coast so that my companion </p><p>could drop the bomb accurately. He would </p><p>have enough difficulty in any event in aim- </p><p>ing the missile through the glass port in the </p><p>floor. Even so, we were in sight of the </p><p>mound in four minutes. </p><p> As I reduced the speed of the ship I saw</p><p>a dark object rise swiftly over the mound. </p><p>There was no sound, but in the dusk I </p><p>could make out the outlines of the Martian </p><p>space dirigible, which was shooting upward </p><p>with increasing speed. </p><p> It seemed obvious that the Martians had</p><p>discovered the escape of their prisoners, </p><p>and had acted so quickly as to entirely up- </p><p>set our plan. How many of the party were </p><p>in the big ship I could only guess, but it </p><p>seemed best to carry out the plan of de- </p><p>stroying the mound, where I presumed the </p><p>majority of them remained. I accordingly </p><p>held the ship on its course. When almost </p><p>directly over the bluff I saw a figure run </p><p>out on it with a blazing torch. By the in- </p><p>distinct light I realized that it was one of </p><p>our own party. Lest Rhodes should fail </p><p>to recognize him and drop the bomb, I </p><p>swerved seaward quickly to prevent the ship </p><p>from passing over the bluff. </p><p> As I did so I suddenly understood the</p><p>significance of the signal some member of </p><p>our party had risked his life to give. For </p><p>some reason, at which I could only guess, </p><p>the Martians had entirely deserted the </p><p>mound. All of them, then, must be in the </p><p>space ship. Could it be that they were de- </p><p>parting for the long homeward journey? </p><p>Had they discovered the escape of all their </p><p>prisoners and started to search for us at $ie </p><p>deserted camp, only to change their plans</p><p>736 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>when our ship came in sight as they took </p><p>off? </p><p>• These conjectures (lashed through my </p><p>mind instantaneously. I automatically </p><p>turned the ship upward and advanced it to </p><p>high speed in pursuit of the Martian ship. </p><p>As I did so, the voice of Rhodes came to </p><p>me from the center of the ship. He had </p><p>not seen the Martian ship, and was unable </p><p>to understand what had occurred. Receiv- </p><p>ing only disjointed exclamations in answer, </p><p>since all my attention was devoted to the </p><p>pursuit, he came forward to where I stood </p><p>in the bow of the ship. By that time I had </p><p>collected my ideas and was able to tell him </p><p>in a few words, what apparently had oc- </p><p>curred. The Martian ship had disappeared </p><p>from our sight, but from its course while </p><p>it was visible I judged that it was still </p><p>mounting upward from the surface of the </p><p>planet. </p><p> Rhodes agreed with me that we should</p><p>attempt to overtake the Martian ship and </p><p>disable it, if possible, rather than permit </p><p>its occupants to reach Mars and return with </p><p>reinforcements. We had seen that the Mar- </p><p>tians were intelligent and resourceful, able </p><p>to use weapons which gave them a decided </p><p>advantage over us, and absolutely ruthless </p><p>in their determination to hold Venus for </p><p>their race and to wipe out all competitors. </p><p>They had openly declared themselves our </p><p>enemies, and we were forced to regard them </p><p>as such. </p><p> Although the sun had set an hour earlier</p><p>on the surface, our swift flight upward </p><p>brought into view first a reddish glow in </p><p>the west, and then the rim of the sun itself </p><p>appeared. Strain our eyes as we might we </p><p>were unable to see the Martian ship. </p><p> I pushed the space ship to the limit, in-</p><p>creasing its speed steadily as the atmosphere </p><p>became less dense. We shot swiftly through </p><p>the upper layers of atmosphere and soon </p><p>emerged into the blackness of interplanetary </p><p>space. </p><p> ‘There it is!” Rhodes cried.</p><p> I looked in the direction he indicated and</p><p>saw a thin crescent of light overhead and to</p><p>the left. It was undoubtedly the Martian </p><p>space ship, shining moon-like by the light </p><p>of the sun. Against the completely black </p><p>background of limitless space it was im- </p><p>possible not to see it. Could we overtaka </p><p>it? </p><p>I COULD hardly doubt that we had been </p><p>observed by the Martians as soon as we </p><p>emerged from the atmosphere of Venus, but </p><p>I decide upon a ruse. If I could place our </p><p>ship directly between the Martian and the </p><p>Sun we would be invisible to them, while </p><p>their ship could be seen in its largest and </p><p>brightest form. I accordingly cut to the left </p><p>and in five minutes accomplished my pur- </p><p>pose. Although we had lost valuable dis- </p><p>tance in the race to overtake the Martians, </p><p>we now had a distinct advantage in being </p><p>visible lo them, if at all, only as a small </p><p>speck on the disk of the sun, while their </p><p>ship shone like a large moon before us. The </p><p>question now was one of speed. </p><p> We had about a day’s supply of fuel</p><p>mixture. However, since our ship was not </p><p>designed for space combat our only way </p><p>of disabling the enemy ship was to drop the </p><p>improvised bomb on it. I realized, of </p><p>course, that this could not be done except </p><p>under some gravitational force. If attempt- </p><p>ed outside of a fairly strong gravitational </p><p>field the bomb would not “drop” but would </p><p>continue to travel with our ship until it ex- </p><p>ploded and destroyed us. The only chance </p><p>of success, a slim one at best, was to make </p><p>the attack while still within the gravita- </p><p>tional field of Venus. I accordingly pushed </p><p>the ship to the utmost, and had the satisfac- </p><p>tion of seeing the Martian ship grow larger </p><p>in appearance, showing that we were over- </p><p>taking it. </p><p> While the description of these events has</p><p>taken considerable time, the reader must </p><p>understand that their actual occurrence cov- </p><p>ered only a brief span. We were already, </p><p>however, some 10,000 miles from the sur- </p><p>face of Venus and it was apparent that we </p><p>would be 15,000 miles up before we could </p><p>overtake the fleeing ship. I made a rapid </p><p>calculation in my head. The attraction of </p><p>gravity at the surface of Venus is about 26 </p><p>feet a second. At 15,000 miles the acceler- </p><p>ation would be less than two feet a second. </p><p>However that would suffice if my plan^ </p><p>worked out otherwise.</p><p>THE STRUGGLE FOR VENUS </p><p>737 </p><p> Rhodes fell in with the idea completely</p><p>when I sketched it in a few words. </p><p> “I’ll put a ten-second fuse in the bomb</p><p>and let you know the moment I release it,” </p><p>he said. </p><p> Left alone in the control chamber in the</p><p>bow as my companion hurried back amid- </p><p>ship, I watched the Martian ship grow </p><p>steadily brighter. I wondered if the enemy </p><p>ship, like ours, was entirely unfitted for </p><p>fighting. If they were able to direct that </p><p>powerful ray of light from the ship we were </p><p>doomed', for once the double shell of our </p><p>ship was punctured we could not survive in </p><p>the vacuum of space. That was a chance we </p><p>were forced to take. </p><p> It was only a few minutes before our ship</p><p>was quite close to the Martian. The super- </p><p>ior speed at my command enabled me to </p><p>manoeuvre the enemy into position between </p><p>our ship and the planet below. I then let </p><p>the space ship sink gradually until it was </p><p>speeding along a course directly parallel to </p><p>that of the Martian, exactly above it relative </p><p>to Venus, and separated by no more than </p><p>fifteen or twenty feet. </p><p> “All set?” came the steady voice of</p><p>Arthur Rhodes. </p><p> “All set,” I replied.</p><p> In my mind’s eye I could see him light the</p><p>fuse, close the inner door of the chamber and </p><p>open the outer one. </p><p> “It’s off!” came his shout over the tele-</p><p>phone. </p><p> I held the ship steady for two nerve-</p><p>wracking seconds to give the bomb time to </p><p>clear it, and then again turned the rockets </p><p>on full force and directed the ship sharply </p><p>upward. </p><p> With the nose of the ship pointed away</p><p>from the Martian ship, I was unable to see </p><p>what happened next, but when I turned some </p><p>ten seconds later at a distance of more than </p><p>a hundred miles from the point where the </p><p>other ship should be, it could not be dis-</p><p>tinguished. Instead, I could make out sev- </p><p>eral large luminous particles, and I knew </p><p>that innumerable smaller particles of what </p><p>had been the Martian ship had been (lung </p><p>off in every direction. </p><p> Arthur Rhodes, who joined me in the con-</p><p>trol room, had actually witnessed the break- </p><p>up of the Martian ship. No noise of the ex- </p><p>plosion had reached us, of course, since </p><p>sound is not carried through a vacuum. </p><p> The large pieces of the ill-fated ship had</p><p>been flung down toward Venus in different </p><p>directions. Soon after our ship reentered </p><p>the atmosphere of the planet we saw one of </p><p>these particles flash through the atmosphere </p><p>as a flaming meteor or “shooting star.” </p><p> It is necessary only to add that Rhodes</p><p>and I joined the other colonists and that the </p><p>interrupted work begun on the radium field </p><p>was resumed. A few days later we discov- </p><p>ered what had taken the Martians daily to </p><p>the westward of the Holmes River. Several </p><p>miles west, on another seacoast bluff, they </p><p>had built another colony such as the one </p><p>which Commander Jones called an “ant </p><p>hill.” Doubtless this had been intended as </p><p>a home for others who were to be led back </p><p>to Venus by the exploring party. How- </p><p>ever, the Martians apparently deserted the </p><p>plan of colonizing Venus when the party </p><p>of explorers failed to return, and none of </p><p>them have since appeared on Venus. The </p><p>Earth colony there has of course grown to </p><p>important proportions and the inspired </p><p>dreams of Dr. Sanders, head of the Com- </p><p>mission for Venus, bids fair to be not only </p><p>fulfilled, but surpassed. </p><p> THE END.</p><p>For Wonder Stories </p><p>“Next Month” </p><p>tarn to Page 715 </p><p>As the *Death Lily* Began to Appear on Earth—in </p><p>Remote Places the Air-Plant Men Prepared ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ </p><p>The Air- </p><p> By Roger</p><p> Wulfres</p><p>Illustrated </p><p>A FAMILIAR shadow was cast upon the </p><p>frosted glass of the door-panel.

The row, </p><p>so compact was it, did not exceed two feet </p><p>from end to end. </p><p> It was moving. The eye at the left-hand</p><p>end of the row closed and sank away. The </p><p>row moved along from right to left, a tenth </p><p>eye became apparent at its right-hand end. </p><p>•Another eye blinked and drifted away. </p><p>Again the row moved along, again and </p><p>again. </p><p> I felt I was being inspected by a concen-</p><p>trated nightmarish crowd of people. It was </p><p>a moment before the </p><p>shock of the thing wore </p><p>off. But soon I was able </p><p>to reason sufficiently to </p><p>understand that the eyes </p><p>were placed at regular </p><p>intervals around what ap- </p><p>peared to be the neck of </p><p>a balloon-shaped affair. </p><p>And that this balloon-like </p><p>creature was slowly re- </p><p>volving horizontally, so </p><p>that each of its many eyes </p><p>was being presented in </p><p>slow succession. </p><p> For awhile I Suffered</p><p>the inquisition of the bale- </p><p>ful creature’s penetrating </p><p>stare.

My </p><p>voice sounded hollow and I wondered vague- </p><p>ly if I could be talking in a dream. </p><p> “She is,” replied Destanne brusquely. “II</p><p>you’ll grab your hat, I think we might make </p><p>a dash for a taxi right now and, with luck, </p><p>be in time when we reach the airdrome to </p><p>catch the 9.30.” </p><p>CHAPTER II. </p><p>The Trail of the Death Lily </p><p>TOGETHER we shot down to the ground </p><p>floor of the Fanton Building in an ex- </p><p>press elevator and darted </p><p>across the pavement into </p><p>a waiting taxicab. </p><p> Once inside the cab,</p><p>Doctor Destanne gave the </p><p>chauffeur terse instruc- </p><p>tions to take us to the </p><p>Seaboard Central. Then </p><p>he closed the window and </p><p>removed his goggles. </p><p> “Be surprised how</p><p>quickly those things can </p><p>get you,” he commented, </p><p>pointing upwards. </p><p>“We’re going empty </p><p>handed,” I reminded him. </p><p> “No. I ordered quite</p><p>a lot of stuff in Miami on </p><p>my way north. A radio </p><p>from the flying field will have it meet us </p><p>when we pass there. Lot of things, includ- </p><p>ing a collar and chain-mesh for you, and </p><p>goggles. And one of these—” </p><p> From just above his belt he seized the</p><p>scarcely concealed hilt of a machete; jerked </p><p>the weapon out and stroked its razor-keen </p><p>edge as lovingly as a Roman gladiator might </p><p>have toyed with a short sword. I was glad </p><p>when he slammed the frightful blade back </p><p>into its scabbard, for the chauffeur had</p><p>been watching us suspiciously. </p><p> We reached the flying field without inter-</p><p>ference and more than half an hour before </p><p>the time set for the great amphibian air- </p><p>liner’s departure. Here I found the Doctor’s </p><p>ROGER WULFRES </p><p>742 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>arrival had been expected and arrangements </p><p>had already been made for our passage. A </p><p>sheaf of telegrams settled my affairs and I </p><p>was ready to join Destanne in one corner </p><p>of the luxurious smoking compartment of </p><p>the waiting ship. </p><p> “Sibyl,” he said, apparently reading my</p><p>thoughts “is in the gravest danger, in deadly </p><p>peril, in fact; but not in altogether immi- </p><p>nent danger. That is, I suspect we shall be </p><p>in ample time if nothing unforeseen occurs. </p><p> “You will appreciate the situation better</p><p>if I begin somewhere near the beginning and </p><p>give you an outline of what I know of the </p><p>air-plant men. </p><p> “Brisson, a New Orleans police detective,</p><p>who is also a brilliant Southern botanist, </p><p>sent me in a joking way a specimen of a </p><p>tiny and .quite rare plant—er, not unlike a </p><p>hyacinth. He wrote me that his confreres </p><p>had given this plant the name of ‘Death </p><p>Lily’ for a rather curious reason. </p><p> “Brisson, it seems, had been at work as-</p><p>sembling the data on all the recent mur- </p><p>ders in the South, especially Florida and </p><p>Louisiana. They had a string of eight </p><p>apparently unreasonable, disconnected, un- </p><p>interesting homicides—unsolved affairs of </p><p>violence. They were alike, seemingly, in </p><p>only one respect. Fiendish brutality. Crush- </p><p>ed skulls, broken necks, gouged out eyes. </p><p>In one case, the victim had been practically </p><p>torn asunder. </p><p> “All of them were country people, ob-</p><p>scure tenant-farmers or farm laborers of the </p><p>very poorest class and utterly without </p><p>money or enemies. The cases were so far </p><p>apart, however, and the time interval be- </p><p>tween so short, that not even a fiend killer </p><p>seemed to fill the bill. </p><p> “Brisson’s love of botany often led him</p><p>far afield. In his investigation he found </p><p>a bed of the tiny hyacinth, a specimen of </p><p>which he sent me, growing somewhere in </p><p>the vicinity of each murder. ‘Death Lily’ </p><p>they named it.” </p><p>DESTANNE paused and gazed thought- </p><p>fully at the airdrome beacon, a rest-</p><p>less finger of light which stroked the night </p><p>sky that lay beyond the smoking-room’s </p><p>heavy curved-glass windows. </p><p> “Death Lily” he said again. “Brisson’s</p><p>associates had named it well. A modest, </p><p>pale-blue bloom with a peculiarly pleasant, </p><p>sweetish aroma—harmless, fragile, non- </p><p>poisonous, shrinking as a violet yet more </p><p>deadly in its significance than the vilest </p><p>leper. </p><p> “We traced it, Sibyl and I, to what seem-</p><p>ed its source—this ‘Death Lily’—for it was </p><p>a newcomer to the South. The beds Brisson </p><p>found were undoubtedly far-flung colonies </p><p>of a plant apparently having its origin on </p><p>a group of uncultivated, tropical islands ly- </p><p>ing in the Caribbean south-east of Cuba. </p><p>‘Shadow Island’, the map called the largest </p><p>one. The lines we plotted on our charts </p><p>converged at that point. </p><p> “At this time we haw no thought but for</p><p>the fun we were having assembling data on </p><p>an unknown plant recently finding root in </p><p>North American soil—a seemingly harmless </p><p>and rather likeable plant at that. </p><p> “To test our figures, we decided on a trip</p><p>to ‘Shadow Island’. That was when we left </p><p>New York, as you remember.” </p><p> I nodded. “And at ‘Shadow Island’ you</p><p>found what?” I asked, rather tired of the </p><p>details. </p><p> “At ‘Shadow Island’,” Destanne bit out</p><p>grimly, “we found Hell.” </p><p> The great airliner was already shaking</p><p>with the pulsations of its powerful engines. </p><p>A last passenger arrived followed by a </p><p>white-coated steward. The roaring of the </p><p>engines rapidly grew in intensity; soon we </p><p>would be taking off and anything resembling </p><p>conversation would be drowned out by the </p><p>ear-aching thunder. </p><p> “But Sibyl?” I shouted.</p><p> Destanne shot me a brow-lifted smile.</p><p>“Don’t worry too much about Sibyl,” he </p><p>said, in a shout that was scarcely audible. </p><p>“If we use our heads we can beat those </p><p>devils. Guess I’ll go turn in. This roaring </p><p>doesn’t bother you so much after a time—</p><p>restful.” </p><p> The smoking-room jolted slightly as if</p><p>shaken by a mild earthquake. We were </p><p>under way. </p><p>THE AIR-PLANT MEN </p><p>743 </p><p>CHAPTER III. </p><p>The Menace of the Air-Plant Men </p><p>Nightmare hours slid by. i was m. </p><p>Sleeping became gasps of dreaming </p><p>horror. The cachet of tissue-wrapped clove- </p><p>perfumed gauze which the steward brought </p><p>me, did little to relieve my illness although </p><p>it was highly recommended as a preventive </p><p>of airsickness. </p><p> And my mental state was even more un-</p><p>happy than my physical condition. What, </p><p>exactly, was the peril which threatened </p><p>Sibyl? What was the connection between </p><p>the air-plant men and the ‘Death Lily? </p><p>How did the air-plant men intend to launch </p><p>their attack against humanity ? Would they </p><p>begin by wrecking the airliner upon which </p><p>we were travelling? These, and a thousand </p><p>other questions went racing through my </p><p>mind during those semi-delirious hours. </p><p> But at last I 3lept. When 1 woke, Des-</p><p>tanne was bending over me. The motors </p><p>of the airliner no longer roared. The port- </p><p>giass of my cabin was a disk of brilliant </p><p>turquoise. The room flooded with sunlight. </p><p> “Come along, Roger. Shake it up,” the</p><p>Doctor was saying. “This is Batamano and </p><p>the launch is waiting to take us ashore.” </p><p>Batamano, I learned as I dressed, was a </p><p>fishing village on the Isla of Batamano. This </p><p>was the Caribbean, upon its deep blue water </p><p>the great airliner rested, and the splashes </p><p>of dazzling whiteness which dotted it were </p><p>the sails of myriad sponge-fishing craft. We </p><p>were within fifteen miles of “Shadow Is- </p><p>land.” </p><p> “You slept like the proverbial log,” Des-</p><p>tanne told me. “Here, climb into this. </p><p>We’re getting pretty close now.” </p><p> From a chair beside me, he lifted a suit</p><p>of steel chainmesh to which a massive steel </p><p>collar, similar to the one he was wearing, </p><p>was attached. “You missed Miami and all </p><p>the rest,” he said. “Just as well though.” </p><p>Almost unnoticed by our fellow passen- </p><p>gers, we clambered down the swinging gang- </p><p>way to the waiting launch. The body of</p><p>the amphibian airliner stood tall above us </p><p>as Destanne introduced me to the three </p><p>bronzed men who helped us into the wab- </p><p>bling launch. </p><p> “Pedro is the mechanic,” b&lt;» explained.</p><p>“Henrique they call ‘El Practico’, the pilot, </p><p>and Francisco—well, he’s just excess bag- </p><p>gage. He owns the launch.” </p><p> Sturdy, sun-tanned fishermen, they were</p><p>fearless enough and square. They knew of </p><p>the peril which lurked around “Shadow Is- </p><p>land” but were indifferent to it. They laugh- </p><p>ed heartily at the chainmesh, collar and gog- </p><p>gles we wore. And as they stowed the </p><p>heavy trunk Destanne had brought, said they </p><p>wished for nothing better than their </p><p>machetes. </p><p> “That reminds me,” put in the Doctor</p><p>hurriedly. “Stick one under your own belt, </p><p>Roger, right now. The moment you find </p><p>yourself within striking distance of one of </p><p>the tentacles don’t hesitate, just whack.” </p><p> I took the barbarous weapon reluctantly.</p><p>Such things, I thought, were good for cutting </p><p>sugar-cane, but not quite the weapon for a </p><p>civilized man. I was glad I had slipped a </p><p>.45 automatic into my shoulder holster when </p><p>I left New York. </p><p> We w’ere by now leaving the indigo bay of</p><p>the Plava of Batamano and entering the </p><p>greener waters of the open sea. Eagerly we </p><p>scanned the blazing sky for a sign of a </p><p>hovering scout of the air-plant men. There </p><p>were none. </p><p> “You will find the goggles a great help,”</p><p>the Doctor told me. “The lenses are slightly </p><p>tinted and act as color-screens to a certain </p><p>extent. I’ve found the air-plant men are ex- </p><p>perts at hiding in a clear sky by chameleon- </p><p>like color changes. The balloon-like part, </p><p>too, is often quite transparent and scarcely </p><p>more tenuous than a cloud of smoke.” </p><p>«'VT7’ HAT,” I asked, “are the air-plant </p><p> ▼ t men?”</p><p> “Now you’ve asked me something,” an-</p><p>swered the Doctor gravely. “My opinions </p><p>are formed from observations made during </p><p>a hurried and very harassing encounter—</p><p>Yes, very. This is what I suspect. </p><p> “Their amazing intelligence, their physi-</p><p>cal and mental make-up, everything about </p><p>them, suggests that instead of being the </p><p>devilish octopus-like creature which we are </p><p>744 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>by circumstances forced to think them, they </p><p>are much more highly developed than we </p><p>are. Therein lies their deadly menace. </p><p> “Going back a little, you will remember</p><p>that our earth has been ruled from time to </p><p>time by varying types of creatures. Each of </p><p>these was replaced by newer, more efficient </p><p>ones until, climbing the evolutionary scale, </p><p>we find man dominating the scene. </p><p> “Good. Now we know the part evolution</p><p>played in these changes and the extent they </p><p>were hurried along by the sudden mutations </p><p>of radically new types. Also, that each of </p><p>the creatures to dominate the scene—even </p><p>man himself—put in a first appearance as </p><p>an almost defenseless creature. </p><p> “For ages man survived as a weak and un-</p><p>important inhabitant before he stepped up </p><p>to anything like a dominant place. So weak </p><p>was he that, if the creatures then dominat- </p><p>ing had even guessed that he was to be their </p><p>successor, they could have wiped him out </p><p>in a day. </p><p> “Judging, then, by what had gone before,</p><p>the fact is pertinent that the creature which' </p><p>is to replace man must be already somewhere </p><p>on this earth of ours. By now, man’s suc- </p><p>cessor must be gaining a foothold. By now, </p><p>some mutation or some amazingly new </p><p>branch of-—of man himself, possibly, must </p><p>be somewhere hiding and growing, furtive </p><p>and hunted most likely, but gaining strength </p><p>for the overthrow of the very parent from </p><p>which he sprang.” </p><p> Destanne lapsed into speculative silence.</p><p> “And you infer that these air-plant men</p><p>are our superiors?” I asked, with some heat. </p><p> “Possibly, possibly,” Destanne murmured,</p><p>quite unmoved. “Don’t rush to conclusions, </p><p>Roger. I believe I’m correct when I say </p><p>that their superiority—intellectual superior- </p><p>ity—is almost beyond our grasp. Of course, </p><p>I’m puzzled. But that balloon-shaped body </p><p>of theirs suggests a head—an awe-inspiring, </p><p>skull-less brain. Their multiple eye sug- </p><p>gests something, too. You’ve noticed that </p><p>it isn’t a mechanical contrivance like the </p><p>multiple eye of a fly. Each pair of eyes is</p><p>an individual, characteristic, independent </p><p>affair.” </p><p>THROUGH my goggles, I had been </p><p>watching the blue Jiorizon of a placid </p><p>sea. High above us, a single saber-winged </p><p>bird soared. From beside me, came the idle </p><p>slap of wavelets against the bow of the </p><p>launch and the put-puttering of the asth- </p><p>matic motor. A blazing tropic sun hung in </p><p>the western sky, but the heat continued to </p><p>be intense. Blistering heat. A tranquil </p><p>sea. And a light breeze at our backs, oven- </p><p>hot. </p><p> “Hot enough to hatch devils,” I comment-</p><p>ed. </p><p> “Man,” Destanne reminded me, with ex-</p><p>asperating calm, “had his origin in warm </p><p>climates.” </p><p> “Nonsense,” I exclaimed. “You’ve let</p><p>this heat and the idea of these things run </p><p>away with your imagination. They’re new. </p><p>They’re unpleasant to deal with, like an </p><p>octopus or a shark; but they’re far from </p><p>being what you think them to be.” </p><p> Directly ahead of us, land showed as a</p><p>short, black line thickening the horizon. A </p><p>shadowy line that would have been scarcely </p><p>visible had it not been for a growth of palm </p><p>trees whiskering one end of it. </p><p> “If I’m not mistaken—our destination,” I</p><p>announced. </p><p> Destanne nodded agreement. “Shadow</p><p>Island,” he said, a touch of awe in his </p><p>voice. </p><p> “Right,” I said, fingering the .45 auto-</p><p>matic under my armpit, and cursing the </p><p>heat and the chainmesh. “It is, eh? Well, </p><p>if Sibyl’s there, held by man or superman, </p><p>I intend to find her and bring her back— </p><p>or raise Hell trying.” </p><p> Destanne shot me a quick glance; smiled</p><p>slightly at my enthusiasm—a trifle sadly, </p><p>I thought. His manner galled me unreason- </p><p>ably. I pointed at the wretched little cayo </p><p>we were now rapidly approaching. </p><p> “Sibyl’s there,” I said. “For some rea-</p><p>son I don’t doubt that. That she’s being </p><p>kept there by force in the manner you sug-</p><p>gest, is another thing. You’ve been pre- </p><p>cious quiet as to how and why these so- </p><p>called air-plant men, are doing it.” </p><p> = “I really don’t know,” Destanne said</p><p>meekly. “At the time we were seized and I </p><p>managed to hew my way out with a machete, </p><p>THE AIR-PLANT MEN </p><p>745 </p><p>it seemed to me that the air-plant men han- </p><p>dled Sibyl with the greatest care. Carlos, </p><p>the boatman we had hired to come with us, </p><p>they smashed to a pulp in something less </p><p>than ten seconds. ' </p><p> We were close in now and headed for a</p><p>beach where a sunparched sand bank of </p><p>dazzling whiteness drifted down almost to </p><p>the waters' edge. A barren shore, spotty </p><p>with scraggly bunch-grass. and away to our </p><p>left a stretch of saltmarsh. mangrove-cov- </p><p>ered. </p><p> “Not a sign of life,” I commented, stand-</p><p>ing up in the bow of the launch and tempted </p><p>to tear off the metal collar which, under the </p><p>sun’s scorching rays, fairly seared my neck. </p><p>“I wouldn't be surprise^ if Sibyl—” </p><p> I broke off abruptly.</p><p> Above the crest of the hogback of sand</p><p>directly before us, something rose slowly. </p><p>Like a semi-transparent blue bubble it lifted </p><p>against the skyline until it was just clear </p><p>of the sandy range. It was roughly pear- </p><p>shaped, some twenty feet tall by fifteen </p><p>wide. </p><p> For a moment it remained, silent and mo-</p><p>tionless; then it sank behind the ridge. And </p><p>I stood gaping and speechless and filled </p><p>with the suspicion that I had been stared </p><p>at and inspected by some lethargic giant </p><p>who had merely lifted his head and peered </p><p>at me over the ridge. </p><p> CHAPTER IV.</p><p> A Horrible Plan</p><p>&lt;&lt; A LOOK-OUT, probably,” said Doctor </p><p> xa. Destanne.</p><p> I turned to find Francisco was examining</p><p>his machete, grim-lipped. Henrique was at </p><p>the helm, whispering to himself in Spanish </p><p>but keeping the launch on its course. We </p><p>were headed straight for the beach which </p><p>was now less than a hundred yards away. </p><p> “Will they attack us when we land, do</p><p>you think?” I asked, suddenly feeling very </p><p>weak and helpless.</p><p> “That remains to be seen,” replied Des-</p><p>tanne. “I doubt it, for we are to windward </p><p>of them. We came up on them from that </p><p>direction because I’ve found that their </p><p>flight isn’t well controlled. They seem to </p><p>rise by inflating themselves with some very </p><p>light gas, internally produced and probably </p><p>heated. Their direction appeared to me to </p><p>be largely a matter of selecting the right </p><p>air currents—like a balloonist. Although, </p><p>sometimes I suspect they are able to rocket </p><p>themselves for short distances by the ejec- </p><p>tion of air from tiny openings placed on </p><p>their under surfaces.” </p><p> Henrique shut off the motor. The launch</p><p>drifted silently forward, until it nosed softly </p><p>onto the sand at the water’s edge. Only the </p><p>pouring of the waves and the long-drawn </p><p>hiss of sand-laden water disturbed the utter </p><p>silence. </p><p> Doctor Destanne was the first to spring</p><p>ashore. I followed quickly after him, and </p><p>Francisco and Pedro brought up the rear. </p><p> I was intent upon watching the place at</p><p>which the air-plant men had peered at us. </p><p>For this reason I scarcely noticed that the </p><p>two fishermen were carrying ashore the </p><p>trunk Destanne had brought along. </p><p> We were climbing the ridge by that time</p><p>and I was too busy struggling up the steep </p><p>sandy wall to comment on the matter. </p><p> This embankment was less than twenty</p><p>feet high but steep—unnaturally steep, I </p><p>thought. Every step of our climb was a </p><p>sweating agony. Many a time'the crumb* </p><p>ling and uncertain surface gave way beneath </p><p>us and we slid to the bottom. </p><p> But eventually we gazed over the crest</p><p>and over the amazing expanse which formed </p><p>the interior of the island. Roughly circular </p><p>it was, at least a mile in diameter, and deep, </p><p>like the crater of an extinct volcano. </p><p> The similarity ceased at that though, for</p><p>as I was quick to realize, the whole struc- </p><p>ture was artificial. The entire area had been </p><p>scooped out to a depth of some thirty feet. </p><p>The ground was approximately fifty feet </p><p>below us. </p><p> And it was cultivated ground, watered</p><p>seemingly from a meagre stream which </p><p>emerged by way of the mangrove swamp. </p><p>Without pathway or trial, a single field </p><p>close-covered with a pale blue flower, it was </p><p>one sweep of blue—a pastel, dainty hue. </p><p> “The ‘Death Lily’,” murmured Destanne.</p><p>“The feeding ground.” </p><p>746 </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p> I blinked and then saw what before I had</p><p>thought was simply the result of atmospheric </p><p>heat waves. The air above the field was </p><p>shimmering as if heated air were flowing </p><p>into the cooler space above the moist </p><p>ground. </p><p> I saw now that the shimmering had a de-</p><p>finite pattern. It was like a roof over the </p><p>field; a roof formed by a myriad glass </p><p>domes built row after row. Domes—glass </p><p>globes, solidly massed. Huge bubbles— </p><p>air-plant men. Millions of them—their ten- </p><p>tacles spread out upon the ground amongst </p><p>the flowers. </p><p> “Feeding,” said Destanne slowly. “I’m</p><p>not quite sure it’s that, either. Notice the </p><p>absence of perfume? The air should be </p><p>positively reeking with it. I suppose they </p><p>absorb that perfume—and maybe some in- </p><p>finitely subtle and essential gases with it” </p><p> I was staring, drymouthed, paying little</p><p>heed as Destanne iambled on: “The neces- </p><p>sities of their existence—air and water and </p><p>the perfume of the ‘Death Lily’. The latter </p><p>they seem to need only occasionally, I sus- </p><p>pect they take it in large, periodic doses.” </p><p>MY glance had been wandering far and </p><p>near for a sign of Sibyl. I had hoped </p><p>to find her—if Destanne had told me the </p><p>facts—wandering along the beach. My </p><p>plans, scant as they had been, were to circle </p><p>the island and perhaps find Sibyl waiting for </p><p>us. </p><p> Now it seemed to me Sibyl must indeed</p><p>be lost. What were we against this multi- </p><p>tude of super-powerful, super-intelligent </p><p>creatures? </p><p> Destanne was silent, and I was wrapped</p><p>in thoughts of the most melancholy nature </p><p>as we stared out across that vast blue field. </p><p>Perspiration trickled under our goggles. It </p><p>streamed beneath our metal collars. </p><p> Then, as if my worst fears had suddenly</p><p>materialized, I saw Sibyl! Clear and plain </p><p>I saw her. She was some three hundred </p><p>yards to our left, supine as if resting. With </p><p>the glasses that Destanne handed me I saw </p><p>how death-like was the marble pullor of her</p><p>cheek. </p><p> Stifling a shout, I seized Destanne by the</p><p>arm. He saw her and his face became tenses </p><p>with the realization of her danger. </p><p> “If we go along this side,” he said, point-</p><p>ing at the beach, “we might—” </p><p> Without waiting for words, I slid down</p><p>to the beach. Ran, with the Doctor stumb- </p><p>ling after me; ran, until I believed I was </p><p>opposite the spot where Sibyl lay. Then I </p><p>climbed like a crazy ant up the embank- </p><p>ment until I again reached its crest. </p><p> A scrap of white paper like a pale pen-</p><p>nant faced me. It had been wedged into </p><p>the end of a short, split stock which was </p><p>planted on the embankment. Sibyl’s hand- </p><p>writing— </p><p> “If you come:*’—the words spun dizzily</p><p>before my eyes as I crouched and read on. </p><p>“At first I was dreadfully frightened. They </p><p>seemed such unnatural, ghastly creatures, </p><p>these air-plant men. </p><p> “But I learned to understand them. Their</p><p>multiplex personality puzzled me. The idea </p><p>of a compound creature using a community </p><p>brain was appalling. It was hard to under- </p><p>stand how a group could live on indefinitely </p><p>by subjugating the personalities of its mem- </p><p>bers. </p><p> “Doctor Destanne called them the ‘Air-</p><p>plant Men’. He was nearly correct—except </p><p>that each one is a composite of many mem- </p><p>bers. In our struggle to escape, the Doctor </p><p>shot at the group which attacked us. His </p><p>shot killed one of its members. The group' </p><p>immediately sloughed off the dead mem- </p><p>ber and prepared to absorb a younger one </p><p>as a replacement. </p><p> “In some way not clear to me, they have</p><p>selected me to be the replacement. I am </p><p>to be absorbed and adopted as a member of </p><p>the group which attacked Doctor Destanne. </p><p>I understand my body will be unnecessary. </p><p> “My mind, entirely different in its views</p><p>from the usual run of air-plant folk, is con- </p><p>sidered a very valuable asset—a stimulant </p><p>to the group. The absorption of it will take</p><p>time—possibly—” </p><p> As if the paper had suddenly become a</p><p>/enomous reptile, I cast it from me; pounded </p><p>it into the sand with my clenched fist. </p><p>THE AIR-PLANT MEN </p><p>747 </p><p>The Rescue! </p><p>AGAIN I stared at SibyL, down there </p><p>among the “Death Lilies”. Her face </p><p>was pale and upturned, eyes closed as if in </p><p>sleep. Her khaki shirt was open at the </p><p>throat; khaki breeches and leggings, sand- </p><p>dusted. She might have been a corpse— </p><p>yet I knew life still lingered in that sweet </p><p>face, that a heart still pulsed in that sand- </p><p>sprinkled form. </p><p> The thought sent me berserk. Heedless</p><p>©f the myriad eyes I knew must be staring </p><p>at me, I sprang to ray feet. Gun tight- </p><p>clasped in ray fist, I rushed down the em- </p><p>bankment. Seven leaping strides, and I </p><p>struck bottom. </p><p> Sibyl was at my feet and above me loomed</p><p>great globular forms. I could see them </p><p>more clearly now. Like captive balloons </p><p>tipped by the sunlight they swayed, held </p><p>down by a forest of taut tentacles. Tenta- </p><p>cles that moved and reached out for me. </p><p> A single, sinuous arm slithered serpent-</p><p>like across the white throat of Sibyl. An- </p><p>other, like a snake of soft glass, was brush- </p><p>ing my face. </p><p> In a flash I had the machete out. Hack-</p><p>hack, the razor-edged blade bit through the </p><p>yielding stuff. Hack-hack, and with each </p><p>blow, severed ends twisted and contracted </p><p>like chopped eels. </p><p> A moment of madness, an instant of strug-</p><p>gling, and I had Sibyl slung over my shoul- </p><p>der, her ankles crooked under my gun arm. </p><p>Her head was hanging down across my back. </p><p>How slight she was! How limp! But alive </p><p>yet. I knew that by her very limpness— </p><p>by a magnetic warmth. </p><p> An arm, a powerful constricting arm,</p><p>closed around my throat; began lifting with </p><p>power tremendous. Thwack, the blade of </p><p>my machete rang with the very swiftness of </p><p>the blow. Thwack, the handle tingled in </p><p>my fingers. Ten feet of severed tentacle </p><p>writhed about me, then hung still and flac- </p><p>cid. </p><p> I faced the steep slope of the fifty-foot</p><p>embankment. Behind me, the air was thick </p><p>with a lashing, writhing movement; heavy </p><p>v/ilh a sense of soundless commotion. </p><p>Up and up 1 climbed, the blood mist of </p><p>desperation thick before my eyes. Up and </p><p>up. </p><p> The inner side of the embankment was</p><p>smooth, moist and firm, due to some extent, </p><p>perhaps, to the proximity of the damp, cul- </p><p>tivated land. It offered a reasonable foot- </p><p>hold. Fighting for breath I reached the </p><p>crest. Destanne was waiting there, machete </p><p>in hand. </p><p> “Down,” he yelled, pointing toward the</p><p>launch. “I’ll cover the rear.” </p><p> One step I took, then toboganned to the</p><p>beach in a welter of dry sand; straightened </p><p>up and began staggering off in the direction </p><p>of the launch. </p><p> I could see Henrique in the launch. He</p><p>was waving his arms wildly. His suntanned </p><p>figure was black against the sky. His </p><p>screamed words came to me in garbled </p><p>Spanish that was meaningless. </p><p> Then a faint shadow, indistinct as the</p><p>shadow of a passing cloud, swept over me. </p><p>I could hear Destanne shout. A shot rang </p><p>out. But I staggered on, heels deep-sunk in </p><p>the sand. </p><p> The shadow passed. It was before me</p><p>now stretched over the whiteness of the </p><p>beach. Lashing tentacles, hissing like whip- </p><p>lashes, cut the air over my head. Swiftly </p><p>the thing bore down on the launch. </p><p> Henrique had ceased waving his arms.</p><p>He stood now quite still, one foot resting on </p><p>the boat’s gunwale. Chest out. Machete </p><p>flashing. </p><p> But the enraged air-plant man was too</p><p>quick for him. A flick of a tentacle and a </p><p>jerk. One moment Henrique hung high in </p><p>the air, his arms gallows-twitching, legs </p><p>dancing on air, head twisted, neck broken; </p><p>the next, he was falling like a dropped </p><p>weight, feet-foremost, into the blue water </p><p>beneath him. </p><p>FROM somewhere not far behind me,</p><p>came shouts of encouragement from </p><p>Destanne. They seemed to me to be strange- </p><p>ly out of place. The creature that had mur- </p><p>dered Henrique was still floating high over </p><p>the launch. Soon a horde of them would </p><p>spring upon us fiom behind the embank- </p><p>ment. Henrique’s fate had been merely a </p><p>74$ </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>demonstration of what was in store for each </p><p>of us. </p><p> Nevertheless, I plunged on toward the</p><p>launch. A man struggling for a hopeless </p><p>cause, my feet sank deeper with every stride. </p><p>My strength was lessening with each gasp- </p><p>ing breath. </p><p> A little to my left, I saw Pedro and Fran-</p><p>cisco were also making for the launch. Until </p><p>now they had been crouching in a hole they </p><p>had dug at the base of the embankment. </p><p>They came running now and pointing up- </p><p>ward at the evening sky. </p><p> Were the air-plant men even now assemb-</p><p>ling their hordes above us? I gave one </p><p>swift, despairing glance upward. Only a </p><p>sky of cloudless blue was there. For some </p><p>reason I did not understand, the air-plant </p><p>man which had attacked Henrique was rap- </p><p>idly swinging off inland. </p><p>* * * * </p><p> In a huddle of striving humanity we met</p><p>at the launch. “The breeze,” Destanne was </p><p>saying. “Thank Heavens it’s holding. Had </p><p>to go. See?” He pointed at the air-plant </p><p>man drifting swiftly inland. “Couldn’t hold </p><p>his position with this light breeze blowing.” </p><p> Francisco got the motor ready as I placed</p><p>Sibyl tenderly in the vessel’s stern and took </p><p>my place beside her. The girl seemed to be </p><p>sleeping. Destanne was grasping a slender </p><p>wire to which what appeared to be a battery </p><p>box and a switch was attached. The wire </p><p>stretched from the still motionless craft to </p><p>a point far up the beach. </p><p> Then, like a wall of transparent ice, the</p><p>air-plant men rose above the embankment. </p><p>A faint breeze still blew in from the ocean. </p><p>The air was clear and flooded with long rays </p><p>of a lowering sun. So clear was it, I thought </p><p>of it as translucent water and the hordes of </p><p>air-plant men that were rising beyond the </p><p>ridge, as gigantic jelly-fish that floated; </p><p>whilst we, infinitesimal creatures, were </p><p>doomed to crawl over a strange ocean’s floor. </p><p> Destanne was squatting on a seat; the</p><p>switch-box in his lap. One arm he raised</p><p>in a signal to Francisco who waited, hand on </p><p>the starter. </p><p> With a hissed word of command, the lit-</p><p>tle biologist snapped his arm down; shot </p><p>the switch over. </p><p> The mighty roar which followed shook</p><p>the launch, rocked the island, and blotted </p><p>out the sunlight. </p><p> “Madre de Dios”, I heard Francisco</p><p>groan, as the chug-a-chug-chug of the </p><p>launch's motor bit into the ear-throbbing </p><p>silence that followed that blast. The buried </p><p>trunk had been dynamite packed, I under- </p><p>stood that now. </p><p> Sand-clouded darkness was all about us</p><p>as we left “Shadow Island". The sea around </p><p>us was pelted for miles with the rain of fall- </p><p>ing debris. </p><p> “The embankment,” Destanne said, after</p><p>awhile, “it’s broken.” Then, abruptly: </p><p>“Well, well, if Sibyl isn’t wide awake once </p><p>more. Don’t be alarmed Sibyl, I think </p><p>we’ve beaten them.” </p><p> The girl rolled her head from side to side.</p><p>“A little water, nothing more,” said Destan- </p><p>ne. “Come along, Roger, snap out of it. </p><p>There’s a canteen beside you.” </p><p> Clumsily I lifted the canteen to Sibyl’s</p><p>lips and she swallowed a little of the luke- </p><p>warm fluid; rested her head on my shoul- </p><p>der again and closed her eyes. </p><p> Swiftly the launch was nosing into the</p><p>breeze and we sped away from “Shadow </p><p>Island”. The place we left behind us was </p><p>a smoking wreck. Above it, high above it, </p><p>rose tier upon tier the floating hordes of the </p><p>air-plant men. Slowly they were drifting </p><p>away from us, driven by the westerly </p><p>breeze, they sped eastward. Tier upon tier </p><p>they rose, a golden argosy of strange and </p><p>scintillating beauty which towered far into </p><p>the cloudless sky. Their uppermost mem- </p><p>bers were caught in the crimson streaks- of </p><p>sunlight which marked them against the sky </p><p>as golden bubbles. Where would they go </p><p>next? I wondered, as I glanced at Destanne. </p><p> “Their feeding ground flooded, destroy-</p><p>ed,” he said, noting my glance. “Mighty </p><p>good thing for us the direction of the wind</p><p>makes it impossible for them to overtake us </p><p>for some time.” He pased, then: “My ori- </p><p>ginal plan wras to dynamite their feeding </p><p>ground whilst they were heavy under the </p><p>influence of the perfume which plays such </p><p>an important part in their lives.” </p><p> “The stuff must leave them groggy,” I</p><p>commented. </p><p>THE AIR-PLANT MEN </p><p>749 </p><p> “Precisely. An essential food to them,</p><p>just the same. Brisson has arranged for </p><p>the destruction of the smaller beds they were </p><p>establishing throughout the Southern </p><p>States.” </p><p> “Which will leave them quite defeated?”</p><p>I asked-. </p><p> "I hardly think so. They are marvellous</p><p>balloonists,—tireless, effortless motion. They </p><p>will establish new grounds. Central Amer- </p><p>ica, perhaps, or even Africa. Wherever the </p><p>‘Death Lily’ will flourish. Defeated now </p><p>but a menace to posterity." </p><p> We lapsed into silence. The last of the</p><p>air-plant men were vanishing into the shad- </p><p>ows far astern. Slap-slap, the waves bounc- </p><p>ed the bow of the launch, and flew past us </p><p>in threads of white spume. </p><p> Sibyl sighed and stirred restfully. I moved</p><p>a trifle. Something was tangled around my </p><p>feet. </p><p> Destanne followed my movements; he</p><p>bent over and picked up one end of a ten- </p><p>foot length of what looked like cable. Limp </p><p>and dry, it hung from his hand, slick-sur- </p><p>faced. </p><p> ‘“Obviously a vegetable tendril,” he</p><p>chuckled, with a knowing smile, as he twist- </p><p>ed the thing into a seamanlike coil. “If </p><p>you don't mind, I’ll keep this—er, piece of </p><p>liana vine.” </p><p>THE END. </p><p>What Is Your Knowledge of </p><p>SCIENCE? </p><p>Test Yourself By This Questionnaire </p><p>1.

It had the musty look peculiar </p><p>to parliamentary chambers, and by the fix- </p><p>tures I knew that I had seen it before in </p><p>pictures. I had even visited its modern </p><p>counterpart. Rows of chairs were placed </p><p>facing a dais, row on row, one above the </p><p>other, as in a theatre. To one side sat a </p><p>man with a gavel, dressed in the long frock </p><p>coat, the stiff-bosomed shirt, the open col- </p><p>lar and the soft black silk necktie of an- </p><p>other generation. And in the center of the </p><p>room stood another man, dressed like the </p><p>chairman; a tall, heavy-set, severe-looking </p><p>individual, with a brow like the dome of </p><p>Saint Peter’s, and the jaw of a mastiff. The </p><p>man was speaking in a rich, sonorous, voice, </p><p>slowly, distinctly. The audience paid him </p><p>the tribute of hushed attention. </p><p> “In this respect, sir,” he was saying, with</p><p>a note of satire in his mellow, resonant, </p><p>voice, “I have a great advantage over the </p><p>honorable gentleman. There is nothing </p><p>here, sir”—and he placed his hand over his </p><p>heart—■“which gives me the slightest un- </p><p>easiness; neither fear, nor anger, nor that </p><p>which is sometimes more troublesome than </p><p>either, the consciousness of having been in </p><p>the wrong—” </p><p> And so it went on, this stately, courteous</p><p>debate of a bygone day. There was some- </p><p>thing familiar about the speaker’s face and </p><p>words. I recognized the old senate cham- </p><p>ber, pictures of which I had studied; and </p><p>then it all came to me in a flash. </p><p> “My God!” I exclaimed. “It’s Webster</p><p>beginning his reply to Hayne!” I knew the </p><p>opening words, which I had studied years </p><p>before, in which the great orator laid spec- </p><p>ial emphasis upon Hayne’s use of the word </p><p>“here”—with its accompanying gesture of </p><p>indicating the heart. </p><p> I was standing listening to the beginning</p><p>of the greatest extemporaneous speech ever </p><p>made in the United States. And then sud- </p><p>denly I remember something else. “Web- </p><p>ber spoke steadily for twenty-four hours!” </p><p>I said to myself. “I mu3t get out of here </p><p>before Brown regains consciousness and </p><p>kills me with contempt!” </p><p> Slowly ray historical knowledge came</p><p>back to me. The reply to Hayne was de- </p><p>livered at the end of January, 1830. I had </p><p>overshot my mark by exactly one century! </p><p>“Not so bad for an amateur, in a space of </p><p>seven million years,” I said aloud, as I </p><p>turned the control and the senate chamber </p><p>and the majestic speaker faded from view. </p><p> To come to my own century, my own</p><p>year, was the work of a fraction of a mo- </p><p>ment. As the familiar cavern formed itself </p><p>around the crystal globe, as the lights stop- </p><p>ped glowing, and the vibration ceased, I </p><p>breathed a prayer of gratitude to the des- </p><p>tiny which had brought me safely back to </p><p>my own world and my own time. </p><p> I held a vial of smelling salts under</p><p>Brown’s nose. He moved his head feebly </p><p>in an effort to avoid the pungent odor, and </p><p>opened his eyes. “All out,” I quoted, </p><p>taking unfair advantage of a wounded man, </p><p>“this is as far as we go.” </p><p> I dragged him fiom the machine and out</p><p>into the cavern. He looked around, noted </p><p>the familiar surroundings, and thanked me </p><p>with a look. “Well,” I said, “can I operate </p><p>that machine, or not? Where would you </p><p>be without me? Do you realize you’ve </p><p>been unconscious since we left—that is, for </p><p>seven million years?” </p><p> In spite of his pain, Brown smiled faint-</p><p>ly. “You’re all right,” he whispered. And </p><p>that was the greatest compliment I ever re- </p><p>ceived from the master of time. </p><p> Many a time I was tempted to tell him</p><p>I had seen and heard Daniel Webster, a man </p><p>whom he had never seen and never heard. </p><p>But that would have made me subject again </p><p>to his satirical remarks on my abilities. </p><p>And after all, how do I know he has never </p><p>seen and heard Webster? With a man like </p><p>Brown one can never be sure of anything— </p><p>unless it be the certainty of adventure such </p><p>as the world has never known. </p><p>THE END </p><p>WONDER STORIES </p><p>751 </p><p>The Silent Scourge </p><p> (Continued from Page 697)</p><p>Innately involved with the manufacture of </p><p>the XY gas by the government that as far </p><p>as possible it has been minimized.

Science Questions and Answers: </p><p> How do scientists know that space is frigid! Is it</p><p>because the higher one goes the colder it becomes, </p><p>and therefore when one gets well away from the earth </p><p>it is intensely oold? I would appreciate the answer </p><p>to this puxsling affair. </p><p> Ronald Small,</p><p> 601 West 173 St.,</p><p> New York City.</p><p> (To answer this question, we must first get clear</p><p>what is meant by temperature. Let u« suppose that </p><p>we place a thermometer on a body whose temperature </p><p>we wish to measure. The thermometer shows 50 </p><p>degrees centigrade. What we have really measured is </p><p>the temperature of the thermometer, because we have </p><p>waited until the temperature of the thermometer is </p><p>steady, and therefore the thermometer has reached </p><p>the same temperature as the body we arc observing. </p><p> We can only measure the temperature of material</p><p>bodies, such m gases, liquids and solids. We can no </p><p>more measure the temperature of space than we can </p><p>measure the temperature of time. </p><p> It follows, then, that empty space with no material</p><p>such as gases, liquids or solids in it has no tempera- </p><p>ture, and if we were to take a thermometer out into </p><p>space we would measure the temperature of the ther-</p><p>mometer itself. </p><p> What happens to a body in empty space is this:</p><p>it has in the beginning its own intrinsic heat. It </p><p>receives heat from every body in space that is radiat- </p><p>ing, and it radiates heat itsdf. Now the temperature </p><p>that a small Mr will have in empty space will de- </p><p>pend on how much heat it receives and absorbs and </p><p>how much it radiates away. The reason why a human </p><p>being would perish in open space is that the side of </p><p>him that is toward the sun would be warmed, but </p><p>before the heat could penetrate through his body to </p><p>tho sunless side, he would have radiated enough heat </p><p>away to make him frigidly cold. Even a body like </p><p>Mercury, which can be considered in empty space, </p><p>has its sunny 3ide unbearably hot, and its sunless </p><p>side intensely cold. </p><p> So we cannot speak of the temperature of space, we</p><p>can only speak of the temperature of bodies that are </p><p>in empty space, and we can speak of how hot tMy" </p><p>are by considering how much heat tr. receive and </p><p>how much they lose—Editor.) </p><p>The Wonder Tube of Iiadio </p><p>Editor, Science Questions and Answers: </p><p> There is one particular thing of interest to me, a</p><p>paragraph entitled, ‘‘Magic Radio Tube Works Won- </p><p>ders' ; and in it you state the various wonderful </p><p>things that this Radio Tube has done, and that “El- </p><p>evators can be leveled with quick accuracy." </p><p> Now I am very interested m elevators, or lifts »a</p><p>we call them, and I am writing to ask you how this </p><p>system of levelling by means of this radio tube works. </p><p>Any information, however small, would be greatly </p><p>appreciated by me, and I sincerely hope you will bo </p><p>able to furnish me with many particulars. </p><p> I may also say that your magazine has afforded</p><p>me many hours of enjoyable reading, and may I </p><p>wish you and your publications every sucoess. </p><p> Frank Wm.

The principle is simple; its application, of course, </p><p>is a task to be worked out very carefully by engineers. </p><p>In many of the apartment buildings in this city </p><p>there are no elevator attendants; the passenger steps </p><p>in, presses a button designating the desired floor. The </p><p>door closes automatically; the elevator moves up or </p><p>down to the desired floor, stops and levels itself, and </p><p>the door opens again. If the button is pressed from </p><p>another floor, the elevator closes itself and descends </p><p>or ascends to the desired level. A similalr device </p><p>has been installed among the bookstacks of the </p><p>Library of Congress, at Washington, for the use of </p><p>the librarians traveling between different levels. </p><p> This type of photoelectric cell is the alkaline hydride</p><p>tube type. The old selenium cell is very efficient, but </p><p>takes a somewhat longer time to react to a change </p><p>in light. The photoelectric phenomenon is the basis </p><p>also of television, now being demonstrated in England </p><p>by Mr. Baird, and here by several experimenters.— </p><p>Editor.) </p><p>The Weight of the Brain </p><p>Editor, Science Questions </p><p>and Answers: </p><p> What is the weight of</p><p>the human brain?

I understand that as long as an </p><p>airship is lighter than air. it remains up or keeps </p><p>ascending. How can it be made &gt;■&gt; come down? I </p><p>mean this: Is it the motion of th» propellers that </p><p>pushes it down or what is it?

Box 237.</p><p> Springfield, Ma&amp;s</p><p> (A power-driven Zeppelin or blimp, the lame as an</p><p>airplane, has at its tail a rudder that can move in a </p><p>vertical plane, in other words up or down from the </p><p>horizontal. If the Zeppelin is moving straight ahead </p><p>and wishes to descend, the rudder (or “elevator" as it </p><p>is called) is depressed. In other words it inclines </p><p>downward. The air that rushes at it therefore tends </p><p>to give an upward impetus to the elevator and there* </p><p>fore to the tail. </p><p> Since the tail is raised, the nose points downward</p><p>and the craft can descend. The reverse is used if the </p><p>craft wishes to rise. A Zeppelin or blimp has its</p><p>structure so adjuBted that when it is fully loaded it </p><p>just floats in the air. In other words, under such </p><p>conditions a single man could hold up a giant Zeppelin. </p><p>Therefore the Zeppelin neither rises nor, descends by </p><p>virtue of ita buoyancy, the buoyancy merely gives it </p><p>the power to remain in the air without movinr. </p><p>—Editor) </p><p>Measuring the Distances of Stars </p><p>Editor, Science Questions ami Answers: </p><p>There are a few questions I would like to ask your </p><p> 1.	Is the sun's energy conveyed to the earth by</p><p>light rays which, on striking the earth's atmosphere </p><p>are converted into heat waves? </p><p> 2.	Are all the stars restricted to slight movement</p><p>with regard to the earth? If not, how can the tri- </p><p>angulation method of finding the distance of a star </p><p>be used ? For certainly the .star would have changed </p><p>itB position considerably in six months? </p><p> George Currie,</p><p> Sudbury, Ont., Canada.</p><p> (1. The energy of the sun is radiated in the form</p><p>of electromagnctic waves of all lengths, depending on </p><p>their frequencies; only a small portion of these are </p><p>seen by us directly as light. Other waves, differing </p><p>from visible light only in wavelength, are not percept- </p><p>ible to our eyes; they have the property tr.ther of </p><p>generating heat in objects which they strike. There </p><p>is no absolute difference in the nature of light wave* </p><p>and heat waves; the effects which they produce de- </p><p>pend rather upon the physical and chemical natures </p><p>and the sizes of the objects which they strike. Each </p><p>set of waves has a tendency to set up activity i whe- </p><p>ther heat or—as in our eyes—chemical action) in sub- </p><p>stances the particles of which are of a size which </p><p>bears a certain ratio to their particular wavelength. </p><p>It is quite probable that some of the sun’s radiation </p><p>is converted into long or heat waves in the atmos- </p><p>phere; but, at the bottom of the atmosphere, we are </p><p>able to measure only what radiation gets through to </p><p>us. When t*cientists are able to ascend through the </p><p>atmosphere into space, they will be able to tell us </p><p>more about this. </p><p> 2.	All the stars are in motion, and in the case of</p><p>the nearer stars, this movement is measurable by their </p><p>displacement against their background. Sirius, the </p><p>brightest star and our very near neighbor, has moved </p><p>in the past two thousand years apparently about the </p><p>width of the moon—a distance actually numbered in</p><p>billions of miles. This “proper motion" has been com- </p><p>puted by astronomers for all stars which are near </p><p>enough to have an observable parallax; and is taken </p><p>into account. Astronomers make great numbers of </p><p>corrections for this and that source of error in meas- </p><p>urement, and repeated observations over a period of </p><p>several years, before they venture to estimate the par- </p><p>allax of a star. </p><p> The triangulation method is illustrated in the ac-</p><p>companying diagram. It follows the same principles </p><p>as the work of a land surveyor, except that much more </p><p>delicacy of measurement must be observed. The par- </p><p>allax of our nearest neighbor ALPHA CENTAURI cor- </p><p>responds to a yearly movement, back and forth, of </p><p>less than half an inch at a distance of a mile; and </p><p>the telescopic observations muBt bo corrected for ap- </p><p>parent motions which cover many times this distance. </p><p>—Editor.) </p><p> I A Him department we shall publish every month</p><p> youf opinions.

The sheer</p><p> beauty of it stimulates the senses, casts to the four</p><p> winds of this tiny speck rolling in the atmosphere,</p><p> the importance of the t.hings about which a man</p><p> worries. Wherefore is beauty but in dreams ' Where-</p><p> fore is reality but in thought?</p><p> Going through the- pages of this daring publication,</p><p> I came upon the story by Francis Flagg, entitled</p><p> "The Lizard Men of Buh-Lo”, and after reading that</p><p> masterpiece of imagination I lay the book down to</p><p> begin writing here and say that every man who ex-</p><p> pects to amount to a whoop in this world of great</p><p> demands should read science fiction because it trains</p><p> his mind to think in terms broader than he has been</p><p> accustomed to.</p><p> I ought to know. T recal when 1 got my first</p><p> copy of a science fiction magazine and began read-</p><p> ing it. I threw it aside in disgust. A few months</p><p> later 1 was writing a story for Mr. Gernsback. It</p><p> was published. I said that I would never go beyond</p><p> the probable again, but the more 1 read such stories</p><p>•	as “Marooned in Andromeda" and the many others</p><p> published during the past few months in WojfuER</p><p> Storibs I wish I could write them—-the more I</p><p> realize that while we read to be entertained we might</p><p> also read to think, and to dream and to create. Per-</p><p> sonally, I have built, up a religious belief—or rather</p><p> I have approached a sort of probability—by reading</p><p> science fiction and delving into the mysteries of</p><p> science through as many of its branches as time will</p><p> permit.</p><p> Edsel Newton,</p><p> Billings, Mo.</p><p> (It’s quite stimulating to read a frank confession—</p><p> such as Mr. Newton gives us. If science fiction</p><p> didn’t do the things that he says they do, we would</p><p> have to qvrit publishing. But our magazines have</p><p> grown because we give our readers something to</p><p> take them beyond themselves—so that, as Mr. Newton</p><p> says, they can grasp greater immensities and have</p><p> thoughts they would not have had otherwise.</p><p> Mr. Newton also makes a startling statement, but</p><p> something that, verifies what the Editor said during</p><p> a recent oontrovery. That, by understanding the</p><p> physical universe one can really find a meaning in</p><p> it and from that meaning he can find a religion.

We don’t want our </p><p>readers to wander away from their magazine. We </p><p>feel that our readers do appreciate what we arc giving </p><p>them. When difficulties arise, as in the case of Mr. </p><p>Cody, wo think that they were the result of too hasty </p><p>conclusions, undue suspicions, etc., and when they are </p><p>cleared up, we will all be good friends again. </p><p> It's easy enough to adopt a high-and-mighty atti-</p><p>tude and say, “Well if you don’t like it go back where </p><p>you came from.” Just as our 110 percent patriots </p><p>want our government to do with it« radicals. But </p><p>that's a foolish attitude. If there’s anything wrong </p><p>with a government, a man's body or a maguzine, the </p><p>sensible thing to do is to find out what it is and cure </p><p>it. If it’s a misunderstanding only, as it was in Mr. </p><p>Cody’s case, everyone can be enlightened and made </p><p>happy. But we thank Mrs. Christiansen for her nice </p><p>sentiments.

That would come in very handy to those of </p><p>us who frequently go over some old numbers for </p><p>reference.

Price $3.00.</p><p> It is rare that a man in such a distinguished po-</p><p>sition as the lato Karl of Birkenhead occupied will </p><p>risk his time and reputation on prophecies of the </p><p>future. Men of eminence are Quite satisfied with </p><p>themselves, generally, if they can guess accurately </p><p>the events of the coming year or two, without at- </p><p>tempting to predict the occurrences of the next cen- </p><p>tury. </p><p> The present book has a great deal of interest in</p><p>that it represents an opinion of the world of 100 </p><p>years henoe, of neither a writer nor a scientist but </p><p>one of the most eminent of the English Conservatives, </p><p>and a leader of the English Bar. The author admit- </p><p>ted in his book that a better scientific background </p><p>would have aided him immensely in his task: but it </p><p>is evident that he has wisely made up for his own </p><p>shortcomings by consulting authorities in the fields </p><p>he wrote about. </p><p> To readers of science fiction the book should have</p><p>n peculiar interest, for it will enable them to check </p><p>the predictions of science fiction authors with that </p><p>of one of the sanest., most conservative men of tha </p><p>day. Science fiction does not Buffer thereby—in fact </p><p>the late Earl may be suspected of having dipped</p><p>liberally into men like Wells, Verne and Edward </p><p>Bellamy, and pei-haps others known more intimately </p><p>to readers of WONDER SIQHIL’S. </p><p> Conscious all the time of the critical appraising</p><p>eyes of his contemporaries on his work, the Karl </p><p>wa/&gt; content to stick doso to the predictions that </p><p>are quite conservative. . In many of them, it strike# </p><p>the reviewer, he does not make use of a sense of </p><p>time values, aud the changes that should occur over </p><p>the next fifty years, he places as oocurring in not </p><p>less than a century. Some of his conclusions ara </p><p>worth quotation. </p><p> Speaking of war in 2030. he sees great masses of</p><p>mechanically operated engines, such as tanks, con- </p><p>trolled by wireless. “Hence," he goes on to 6ay, "tho </p><p>contending armies of tanks may be able to go into </p><p>battle entirely unmanned; and the issue of the day </p><p>will be decided by two men, each of them directing </p><p>his country's entire armament." </p><p> A completely synthetic diet is a probability of the</p><p>next century. ‘‘Synthetic foods will be cheaper, moro </p><p>palatable, moro various, perhaps more hygienic than </p><p>their predecessors. Bv the year 2030, synthetic </p><p>bread, sugar and vegetables may bo cheaper than </p><p>water today." </p><p> Like Henry Ford, the Earl sees that at last relief</p><p>from burdensome toil is in sight for the laboring man. </p><p>“It will not bo often that his one day a week will bo </p><p>made laborious by specially hard work; superintend </p><p>ing the operations of giant machines of two hundred </p><p>years hence will be supremely easy and supremely </p><p>dull." </p><p> He foresees loo. a world in which science and sci-</p><p>entific thought will dominate the minds of the masses </p><p>of the people, "as thoroughly au Koman Catholic </p><p>thought dominated the Middle Ages." We will bo abl§ </p><p>to use scientific judgment in casting our votes on </p><p>great national problems, and advertisers will use ft </p><p>real established science of psychology to compel us </p><p>to buy their goods pictured in their hypnotic adver- </p><p>tisements. </p><p> We will be less emotional than we are now, in fact</p><p>“judged by our (present) standards, the man and </p><p>woman of 2030 will seem harsh aud unemotional." </p><p> On the question of interplanetary travel the Earl</p><p>is quite discreet. He is sure that by 2030 attempts </p><p>to reach the other planets will have been made, and </p><p>that several expeditions will perish before one suc- </p><p>ceeds. Yet the perils are such that he personally </p><p>did not wish to risk himself on a trip. </p><p> We sec through the eyes of the author, a world</p><p>in which many of our problems, economic, social and </p><p>industrial will have been solved by the scientist. Man </p><p>freed from toil will devote himself in his leisure to </p><p>intellectual pursuits. By cooperative effort war may </p><p>be averted, but if it comes it will probably bo less </p><p>awful than the last. It will probably come to a quiok </p><p>and devastating end, but the conquerors will be wise </p><p>enough not to cripple too much the man aud indus- </p><p>trial power of the defeated. </p><p> w5^:iB^,,riari^ar^afr*lri^ar‘,</p><p>RADIO ENCYCLOPEDIA </p><p>'A *Oo///	of Facts</p><p>IST)TSPENSABLE RADIO REF- </p><p>ERENCE BOOK — Contain* over </p><p>1.930 definitions — 549 photographs, </p><p>drawings, diagrams.

It is rather a tribute to it, there- </p><p>fore, that the publishers saw fit to revive it in a day </p><p>when many of the ba«*s of the story have been de </p><p>etroyed by the march of science. However it is a good </p><p>yarn, well told, many of its sections gripping one with </p><p>a feeling of inutterabta d--spair. and even transmitting </p><p>lo the reader part of th« madness of the solitary hero, </p><p> An expedition sets out for the North Pole to win a</p><p>prize of $175,000,000 10 the first man to set foot on</p><p>the pole. Naturally this is before the day of the air- </p><p>plane, and the expedition fights the elements with </p><p>schooner, dog and sled. Our hero leaving behind his </p><p>fiancee who has admonished him to “Win for me" </p><p>leaves his companions in the dead of night, near the </p><p>pole, and make the final dash alone. He returns to </p><p>find » dead world, people, sitting or reclining at their </p><p>usual occupations struck dead by some mysterious force. </p><p>Newspaper clippings and other records reveal that a </p><p>purple cloud of cyanogen gas had gradually spread </p><p>over the earth to gather all living things into its death- </p><p>ly fold. The chapters by the wav that recount the </p><p>scenes found by tlip heTO as he makes his way from </p><p>the Pcle back to London, are the beet of the book. </p><p> Alone in the world, with corpses on every band,</p><p>madness gradually seizes him. He works for seven- </p><p>teen years to build a palace of gold and a great laki’ </p><p>of wine, and then abandons his work to rush off to </p><p>China, for he has a feeling that a living being still </p><p>exists there.
