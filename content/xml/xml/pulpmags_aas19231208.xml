                    <ab>or do you do this?</ab>
                    <ab>YOU know how loose caps will slip through your fingers just when minutes are most precious. You can't lose the Williams cap. Its always on -- hinged on. And the tube hangs
                        on.</ab>
                    <ab>Time-saver though the hinged cap is -- it is a detail for speed compared with the lather. Williams Shaving Cream bulks instantly into rich, busy lather -- not suds. This lather
                        so softens and lubricates your skin that the razor seems to "glide" the hairs off. And besides being a faster beard-softener, it has a decidedly beneficial effect on the
                        skin.</ab>
                    <ab>Williams' is white and absolutely pure. It contains no coloring matter whatsoever. Truly, you will find it the perfect cream in the perfect container.</ab>
                    <ab>For men who prefer the stick, Williams Doublecap (absolutely new) and Williams' Holder Top Stick (the original holder stick) the genuine Williams in the most convenient stick
                        forms. There are Re-loads for both.</ab>

                        <ab>"I AM going to tell you some startling facts about myself in the hope that others may profit by my experience.</ab>
                        <ab>Just eighteen months ago I was facing an economic and financial crisis. I was sick, broke and hopelessly discouraged. The future held nothing for me.</ab>
                        <ab>Today, just a year and a half later, I am one of the most successful men in this community. I am the owner of a prosperous, growing business. My income is more than $400 a
                            month.</ab>
                        <ab>You will be surprised when I tell you how easy it has been lor me to turn from failure to success.</ab>
                        <ab rend="bold">The Curse of a Small Income</ab>
                        <ab>Remember that eighteen months ago I had almost nothing. Every dollar I earned was used immediately for food, clothes and rent. Not a dollar saved--in constant fear that I
                            would lose my job--that was my predicament.</ab>
                        <ab>I wanted to live as well as my neighbors. I wanted an automobile. I wanted to give my children an education. I wanted to give my wife the things that every woman is
                            entitled to. But I couldn't. I barely made both ends meet.</ab>
                        <ab>Then came a serious illness. I lost my job. Even my small income was gone. I was desperate.</ab>
                        <ab rend="bold">My Big Opportunity Comes</ab>
                        <ab>When things seemed blackest my big opportunity camc. Within a week I had made a net profit of S67.66. Within thirty days I had $170. The next month I made S280--and from
                            then on my income has jumped steadily. I have made SI33 in a single week, and one day I made S69.50 clear profit for myself.</ab>
                        <ab>This is how the wonderful change came about. One day my son brought home a magazine, and in it there was an advertise- ment that said that any man, without experience or
                            training, could make from 5100 to $300 a month in his spare time.</ab>
                        <ab>I could hardly believe it. I knew that I had never made that much by working ten hours a day. I felt sure that such earnings were impossible. And yet I read where others
                            had made as much as $1200 a month in this same work. The advertiser offered to send a book without cost. I had everything to gain and nothing to lose, so I mailed the
                            coupon.</ab>
                        <ab rend="bold">Amazing Book Showed Me the Way to Success</ab>
                        <ab>That marked the turning point for me. The little book told me exactly what to do--where to go, what to say, and how to make money. If I hadn't sent for it when I did I
                            don't know what might have happened. All I have today --my prosperity, my business--are due to the things I learned by reading that book.</ab>

                        <ab>My work has been easy and pleasant. I am the representative for The Comer Manufacturing Company in this territory. All I do is take orders for their coats. They gave me a
                            wonderful proposition. They furnished me with such complete help that I succeeded immediately.</ab>
                        <ab rend="bold">Chance for Average Man to Make $5,000 a Year</ab>
                        <ab>The Comer Manufacturing Company is the largest concern of its kind in the world. They manufacture a splendid line of raincoats for men, women and children. These coats are
                            not sold in stores. They are sold by local representatives like myself.</ab>
                        <ab>Because of the marvelous styles, excellent material and superb workmanship; because of the wonderfully low prices for such high grade merchandise, it is very easy to take
                            orders for these coats. The representative does not collect or deliver. And most pleasing, he gets his money the day he takes an order.</ab>
                        <ab>I am not. a salesman in any sense of the Word. I'm just an average man. My territory is not good, yet there has never been a single day that I haven't made money--
                            generally from S20 to $40. My business is growing bigger each day. I get repeat orders. My customers send their friends to me. I expect my profits to be at least $5,000
                            this year.</ab>

                        <ab>THERE'S been a need for this idea a long, long time. For your average pipe-smoker is the greatest experimenter in the world. He's forever trying a "new one"--confident that
                            some day he'll stumble on the real affinity for his pipe.</ab>
                        <ab>But there's no reason why the quest for a perfect tobacco should be an endless Pilgrim's Progress -- full of sorry mis-steps and disillusions. There are myriads of
                            different brands of smoking tobaccos on the market. But of them all, there are 12 distinctive blends which stand in a class by themselves.</ab>
                        <ab>If a man could only segregate these twelve decisive blends from the hundreds of duplicate blends -- and turn his taste to testing these twelve blends exclusively--he'd set
                            tie his tobacco problems in a hurry.</ab>
                        <ab>So that's what suggested the Big idea to The American Tobacco Company.</ab>
                        <ab>We said,"Why not pick out twelve of the world's finest and most distinctive tobacco mixtures--pack a liberal quantity of each in an attractive Humidor Box--and offer it to
                            pipe-smokers, direct by mail, at a price no pipe lover can afford to resist!"</ab>

                    <div type="column">
                        <cb n="02"/>
                        <ab>Thus a man could get the "whole works" in tobacco blends in one assortment--with the certainty that among them, he'd find his long-sought tobacco-affinity.</ab>
                        <ab>A $3.05 test for $1.50</ab>
                        <ab>It might take you years to "happen on" all twelve of these flawless blends, and it would cost you $3.05 to buy a full-size standard package of each. But through the Humidor
                            Sampler, you can get a liberal get-acquainted quantity of all twelve of these blends for $l.50--with theattractive Humidor case included.</ab>

                    </ab>
                    <ab>TO the hall of Svend the Bloody, a Norse jarl or noble, a galley from Gaul brings Edvard, son of Haakon, Svend's gentle brother, who wooed a maid of the Southland and died
                        there. His coming is not relished by Svend, who has had control of his brother's lands, but Svend fears the wrath of Olaf Trygvesson, the king, too much to do him open harm.
                        Edvard, seeming small and dark to the huge Norsemen, is called "the black jarl," but he speedily proves his skill and courage in an encounter with Magnus, Svend's right hand
                        man. Edvard incurs the enmity of Magnus because Brynhild, a shield maiden Magnus loves, prefers Edvard. The black jarl himself enrages Brynhild because he does not love
                        her.</ab>
                    <ab>Svend leads his followers to a fair at Trondhjem, by command of King Olaf, who hopes to bring about peace between Svend and other followers of the old gods, and the Christian
                        jarls. The pagan jarl contrives to leave Edvard at his camp, where the king will not see him. Magnus commissions two warriors to slay Edvard. The black jarl fights
                        manfully.</ab>

                    <ab>WHAT HAS OCCURRED IN PARTS I, II and III.</ab>
                    <ab>EX-ROUNDSMAN McCARTY, insestigating the death by poison of a man who falls in the street, discovers that the victim is Alfred Hughes, valet to Henry Orbit, one of the wealthy
                        residents of a block with gates at either end, adjoining the park, known as New Queen's Mall. Inspector Druet, of the police, also investigates.</ab>
                    <ab>Neither Orbit nor his neighbors, including the Sloanes, Goddards, Parsons, Bellamys, and Burminsters, shed light on the poisoning. McCarty and his friend, Denny Riordan, learn
                        from little Fu Moy, nephew of Ching Lee, Orbit's Chinese butler, that Lee and Hughes were enemies, and that there had been a slight fire in Orbit's bedroom. It develops that
                        the dead man's character was such he had a number of enemies. Several days after, the murder young Horace Goddard disappears under circumstances indicating kidnaping. While
                        McCarty is investigating an ex-crook, Roberts, butler at the Parsons' house, who confesses to having harbored an escaped criminal in an empty house in the Mall, he is
                        interrupted by the wildly excited Ching Lee, who brings word that Lucette, maid in charge of the Bellamy baby, is dead in Orbit's house.</ab>
