            <seg type="columnLine">he coldly waited. For, no matter what the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">is what he registers. And the last word</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">gathering into groups here and there--tur-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">rags; but the white or brown flowing gar-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ments predominated. There were Arab</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">playing at cards, chess, and dominoes, and</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">my camera. A caravan came down the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">wore the head-dress,with heavy, twisted</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the marabout urged it upon me; there</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">dressed a sentence of inquiry or interest to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">public was at last established on a firm</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">calm and self-possessed--did not show</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">quite sure from the first moment that he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the marshal, who wished him all possible</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">success in his new mission, and, if Grevy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was pleased to be the President of the Re-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">not to be. and to take up his private life</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">again. There were many speculations as</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">o'clock, sometimes at one-thirty, and very</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rarely alone. We always dined out or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had people dining with us, so that family</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">When the ambassador took his holiday,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Adams replaced him, and had the rank</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">talk business. As long as a secretary or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a huissier was in the room, they spoke</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">him not only in Paris, but when we first</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lived in London at the Embassy. He died</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">suddenly in Switzerland, and W. missed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him very much. He was very intelligent,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a keen observer, had been all over the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">world, and his knowledge and appreciation</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of foreign countries and ways was often</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> All the autumn of '79 was very agi-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tated. We were obliged to curtail our stay</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at Bourneville, our country home. Even</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">though the Chambers were not sitting,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">every description of political intrigue was</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">came all day long. W. had one or two</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">surprised to see how in this quiet agricul-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">over them. They seemed to think the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">would bring untold prosperity not only to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the country, but to each individual, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">many very modest, unpretending citizens</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the small towns saw themselves "con-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">However, 011 the whole, the people in our</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">beautiful days of September in the coun-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">try. The trees were just beginning to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">lightful, the roads so soft and springy.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The horses seemed to like the brisk canter</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as much as we did. We disturbed all the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">rabbits scuttled away--we saw their white</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tails disappearing into holes, and when we</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the wood lire looked very cheerful and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> However, everything must end, and W.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had to go back to the fight, which promised</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to be lively. In Paris we found people</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wearing furs and preparing for a cold win-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ter. The house of the Quai d'Orsay was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">comfortable, well-warmed, "caloriferes"</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and big fires in all the rooms, and whenever</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">there was any sun it poured into the rooms</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">unlikely that the coming year would see us</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">still at the Quai d'Orsay, it was not worth</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">always had two or three people to keep</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">me company. Prince Hohenlohe came</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">often, settled himself in an armchair with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his cup of tea, and talked easily and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">charmingly about everything. He was</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">sult of W. having declined the London</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">of bravery there leaped a tiny flame. " So</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">help me," said John Rodney, " I'll prove</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">up!" And he put back his cross in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pocket of his shirt.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Unsteadily, uncertainly, he stood in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">waiting on the crest of the ridge, his de-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cision mocked by his knowledge that every</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">street in the camp held for him the temp-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tation of old haunts of his visits there.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">But back of him lay that boy who was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dead because he had not reached him in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">time. The morbid horror of repassing the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shack daunted him. While he hesitated,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a lithe figure swung down the dark road</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">toward him. When the stranger came</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">near he spoke. "M'sieu 1* capitaine?"</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he asked of Rodney. He struck a match</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to light a cigarette, and by its sputtering</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">flame Rodney recognized him as the voy-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ager who had danced in the Haileybury</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">saloon. When Rodney failed to answer,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he held the light close enough to see his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">face. Instantly, with the camaraderie of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the river men for the captain who had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">crossed the barrier of race to make him-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">self one of them, he drew from his wide</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sash a flask of brandy. "M'sieu is ill?"</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he inquired with solicitude.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"No," said Rodney. His eyes de-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">voured the flask. He kept wetting his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">parched lips with his tongue. His hands</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">trembled as he put them behind his back.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">"No," he repeated. And he strode back</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">along the ridge to the shack where the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">"You never had enough for your own</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">to catch him in speech that they might</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">threw aside his mask of sleep. His eyes</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blazed terribly as he flung off his hat and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">drew himself up to his great height. His</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">determination and white with the fury of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">garnered rage. In the aisle he towered</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over the seats as slowly, surely, he made</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">as they saw the flaring fires of Rodney's</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the springing step of the panther lie had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">he said, and the sharp note of authority</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in his voice brought to the raging man</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the insistent memory of obedience to its</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> After that no one spoke of Rodney or</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">She roused herself to raise money for resto-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">at Mount Vernon she continued to guide its</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">steamboat during the four years of the war.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">She went to Washington and to the Capitol,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">she ventured to do it. She had to climb</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">those steps six or seven times during the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">next ten days. When the senator who was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to introduce the bill told her that he could</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">do no more; that 110 member of his commit-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tee would consent to ask him to introduce</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the bill without further consideration, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">added: " But you can do it ." She did do it.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He needed three members of the committee</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">each one assented immediately to her re-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">quest. On another day she went, ill with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fever, to give the necessary information to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">enable her friend, the senator, to reply to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the opposition, since every one seemed to be</seg>
