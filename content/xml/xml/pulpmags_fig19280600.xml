There was a grin</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his face; no mistaking it--it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grin of pleasure. He glanced at his op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponent for an instant, looking him over ;</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right arm moved forward--flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, rather.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The party of the second part, Kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">McCabe, ducked the right he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to arrive--and ran his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">smack into the left glove of Buster</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin. The sharp spat of the blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be heard all over the huge build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. A crimson flow started from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nostrils of McCabe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Martin was dancing easily away--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grin more pronounced.

We</seg><seg type="columnLine">could lick him every night for a week!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Back in the ring, McCabe put his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head down and bored in. He was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous body-puncher. Low-hung,</seg><seg type="columnLine">squat, hard-headed, cauliflower-eared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet-domed, hairy-chested, he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">more like a heavyweight coal miner</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a lightweight boxer. He was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in close, his arms working from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hips like tireless pistons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Martin danced away; now and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lightning-like left flicked out and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">smacked against the almost unprotected</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of McCabe. Each time it landed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">damaged that face. It had one eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed and purple. It had McCabe's nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">battered flat. It had McCabe's lips raw</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bleeding. But McCabe bored in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Still grinning, Martin walked into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hulking Kid. He measured him care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully and let go a left and right to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. They went home with a velocity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a mule's kick. McCabe settled back</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his heels and shook his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly to clear away the effect of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">punches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Up in the gallery, in the dark shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the roof, a shrill voice screamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down: "Oh, what a sock!

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">evaded the slower-moving Kid with</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridiculous ease. He hit him at will. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clinches he tied him up in knots.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Usually Buster had one arm free while</seg><seg type="columnLine">McCabe was completely helpless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whenever this happened, Martin would</seg><seg type="columnLine">tap him playfully on the back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head or pound him in the ribs--merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show him what could be done if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buster decided to do it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The radio announcer was telling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">listeners in:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "He's a nice boy, this Buster Martin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Up there in his trunks and gloves he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks more like a Sunday school kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a fighter who has knocked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">every good boy who has faced him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">McCabe hasn't so much as mussed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair up yet and this is almost the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the second round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Martin's skin is white and he's beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tifully formed.

He never sold a leather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pusher out in his life--merely for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jack he could collect from the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Shoot That Left!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">camp--and as a consequence his bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll was not so fat as it might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The newswriters had a habit of kid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ding old Moan Cassidy whenever he</seg><seg type="columnLine">breezed into town with a new ''pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect" under one wing. Moan was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways about to break forth with a cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pion of the universe. Up to now Moan</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never watched the announcer raise</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mitt of one of his boys as "the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion of his class and of the world"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Moan's fiercest and greatest ambi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was to manage a champion some</seg><seg type="columnLine">day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moan was getting old, up around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixty mark; still no champion. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had happened upon Buster Martin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a street fight. Buster was em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ployed in giving another newsboy a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tasty beating--a very tasty beating from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the standpoint of ringcraft. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">using that famous left hand with telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect--and exactly one minute and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty seconds, by Moan's watch, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moan's approach he flattened his bigger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stronger opponent with a right cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the jaw. It was then that Moan had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who's trainin' you. lad?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moan. ,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Trainin' who for what?" demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the newsboy of the laughing blue eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Trainin' you to handle your mitts</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that?" repeated Cassidy. "Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">are you fightin' when you ain't sellin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nobody's trainin' me," responded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buster proudly. "When I hit 'em they</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay hit--at least, they always have."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moan departed from the corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking deeply. Next day he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">around again and the next day and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">many days after.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally he startled the kid by offering</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get him a fight--a preliminary at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the clubs. Buster looked his amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. But it took him just as long to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accept as it did to say 'Yes/ And Bus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter Martin had been launched on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">route to fame and fortune.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That first fight of Buster's had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a joke. Buster had walked into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring, looked at the bird in the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner, grinned at Cassidy, moulded his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloves over his knuckles, and when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell rang--it was a four-round affair--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he leaped across the ring, speared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other boy with a straight left which</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed his chin up in the air and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slammed home a right hook. Moan</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out front and collected sixty</seg><seg type="columnLine">bucks while Buster was tying his shoe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laces in the dressing room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neat boy, Buster; clean and fast; no</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad habits. A little too friendly and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite ready to finish his man until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hurt. Cassidy didn't like that very</seg><seg type="columnLine">well. He tried to break Buster of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">habit of carrying a man along--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buster, filled with the joy of life and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with compassion stamped all over him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">never did like putting his man away</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless he had to or unless the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow stung him badly and aroused that</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming fury that was pent up within</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cassidy brought the boy along in</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid strides. There was very little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moan could teach him about the fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">game--that is the fighting itself. Bus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter seemed to have everything a fighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed--instinct. He hit, blocked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducked and thought like a veteran of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred ring battles. Cassidy merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">taught him the tricks that dirty fighters</seg><seg type="columnLine">employed in the ring to cripple an op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponent and then showed him how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">protect himself from such tactics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the most part, Buster fought on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the West Coast during those early days.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was not until the press of the coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try boomed him as the coming cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pion that Cassidy brought him to New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York and the really big time. By that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, however, Martin had decisions</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Shocky Grady, Young Hogan, Kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">(Twin) Green and Billy Edwards--</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the good boys in his class. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bowling them over, one after an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, with no trouble at all and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a startling ease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was no wonder that Sailor Madden</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked over the sport pages with a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">10</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">interest and followed the ring doings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Buster Martin with a keen eye.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sailor Madden was the lightweight</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion of the world--and didn't care</seg><seg type="columnLine">much about such contenders as Buster</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin. Life was too soft and money</seg><seg type="columnLine">too easy. Hard fights were things to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be shunned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Madden was challenged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time, he told Cassidy to get a repu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation for his man--to have him beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">some one good. Cassidy sputtered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned Edwards and Hogan and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grady, but Spike O'Toole, Madden's</seg><seg type="columnLine">manager, sneered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get a man," he advised. "Go push</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the 'Bull/ Push over Kid Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cabe. After that we'll talk business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Cassidy got the match with Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cabe and Martin had knocked out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy Madden's manager had termed "a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CASSIDY was happy, happy for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boy and for himself. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">happier when the New York State Box-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Commission ordered Madden to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fend his title against Buster Martin</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the next three months or to for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feit the lightweight belt. Cassidy</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that he was about to become the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manager of a champion at last, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">he honestly believed that Buster could</seg><seg type="columnLine">take Madden. The newspapers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">whooping things up and Martin's name</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the chief item on the sport pages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buster Martin was happy. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a kid, twenty, full of fire and life. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">still liked to chase after fire engines and</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to the movies. Up to this point</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin had never known a single girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cassidy had shielded him from such</seg><seg type="columnLine">temptations with practised hand. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways he used to tell Buster, "Lay off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dames, Buster; they're bad medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cine for a fighter. Like counting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house before you have your man put</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Plenty of time for them things</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you're the champ. Forget the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frails until then and you'll make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grade. Right now anything can happen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lay off--get me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Buster would grin and sink a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glove-padded fist into Cassidy's side as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a playful gesture, and for a minute the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gym would be a madhouse of flying fists</seg><seg type="columnLine">and grunts and slapping blows--until</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cassidy's wind was gone and then he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">heave a medicine ball at the grinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buster and stamp away down the stairs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inwardly grinning but outwardly shak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his bald head. Cassidy had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to go some himself when he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">young--but this Buster Boy--well, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a regular flash--a rapier--a super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cassidy's happiness was marred a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trifle by a visit from Spike O'Toole.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cassidy knew Spike of old. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Spike was a bad actor, a tough</seg><seg type="columnLine">customer and a plain crook. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had other activities on the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the management of Sailor Mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den. It had worried him plenty--to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to buck such a combination as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Toole-Madden outfit could put in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew several stories; he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Sailor Madden was the champion</seg><seg type="columnLine">because Spike O'Toole had fixed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight that brought him the champion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. He knew that an innocent kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been sold out by his manager to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a Roman holiday for Spike</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Toole and Sailor Madden. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fight had taken place in another</seg><seg type="columnLine">state, where it was safe from the inves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tigations of a regular commission--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that while Sailor Madden was a hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitting. ugly customer in the ring he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't won the title on the up-and-up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was quite probable that he was ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to defend it in the same way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> O'Toole sauntered into the lobby of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moan Cassidy's hotel, and offered him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big black cigar. After a minute he</seg><seg type="columnLine">led him to one of the easy chairs in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lobby and lowered his voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen, Moan," he began. "There</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't no use of two old friends quarrel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over this coming scrap. No need</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it. Let's fix things so that no mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter what happens or who loses, we win."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cassidy said nothing. Inside he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Shoot That Left!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">U</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">boiling, but prudence demanded that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">listen to the proposition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see," went on O'Toole with</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was meant to be a friendly smile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"this thing is too good for one show.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let's have the boys meet, put on an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teresting scrap--looks good to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suckers--and have it a draw, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">rematch them.

After</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he'll blow it to your boy, but be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore that they can fight one or two good</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhibitions for the dough--get me?--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we're sittin' pretty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Inwardly he was gloating.

Buster</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin would not be a contender after</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night. He watched Cassidy's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Cassidy was red faced. lie was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet looking down at O'Toole.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spike leaped up in alarm; Cassidy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands were clenched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Listen, you snake," hissed Cassidy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You take that talk to some of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked friends; don't bring it here to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.

Well, listen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my crooked friend; Buster Martin will</seg><seg type="columnLine">knock him from under that title exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">two months from today--understand?</seg><seg type="columnLine">--two months from today he'll be cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pion--and by a knockout!

In one corner of the room sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sailor himself, and close to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her ear an inch from Madden's mouth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat a blonde girl with lips a more vio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent red than Nature had intended any</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips to be. From her attitude one knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was very much interested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sailor Madden. From the Sailor's at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titude it w'as very evident that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of the fact and regarded it as</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to be puffed up about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spike O'Toole was making one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">six at the poker table which held down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle of the floor.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant diamond glittered on the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger of his left hand and another</seg><seg type="columnLine">nestled in the exact center of a red</seg><seg type="columnLine">necktie.

He whipped his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand from the floor and it landed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the unknowing Frankie's ear with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crack of a pistol shot. Frankie, cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">off in his spech, fell forward on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, down like a pole-axed ox, down</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the cigar and cigaret stubs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay quiet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spike O'Toole leaped to his feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Shoot That Left!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wild alarm but he was too late to pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent the blow.

He con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued to glare his indignation at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sailor.

That's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh, ain't it?

He shook his head. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a light of dismay in his eyes. Buster</seg><seg type="columnLine">was down too fine. He looked drawn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">white, stretched-out. He was laboring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his training and Buster had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">labored over his training before. Buster</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the sort of lad who could work at</seg><seg type="columnLine">an easy gait for hours at a time--</seg><seg type="columnLine">three minutes after three minutes--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">never blow hard nor show signs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatigue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These days Buster Martin was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">working like that. Buster was making</seg><seg type="columnLine">training a labor. His chest heaved, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles were becoming hard, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not retaining that flexible round-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. His punch seemed to have lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">its old sharpshooting snap and certainty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His cheeks had lost much of their color.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes were dull and lacked the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirited fire of a few months past.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, too, Buster was becoming si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent, almost morose. He had little to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say. He was not the Buster who</seg><seg type="columnLine">bubbled over with animal spirits and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went about the gym taking sly pokes</seg><seg type="columnLine">at any one with a turned back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was training perfunctorily--as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty--and, above all. when he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at old Moan Cassidy he had'a guilty</seg><seg type="columnLine">look; his eyes would drop and study the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. Moan watched him throwing</seg><seg type="columnLine">punches at the heavy sandbag. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">an effort for the boy to throw his arms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moan called him aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Buster came over to him a look of</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-defiance in his eyes. His gloved</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands were hanging at his sides. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathing heavily. Moan went straight to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point. He was not one to beat about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bush over anything. He placed his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hands on Martin's shoulders and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him full in the eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Buster Boy," he said in a low voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"are you goin' to throw old Moan down</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this stage of the game?

Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you get that line?" he asked. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he spoke he shifted his eyes from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moan's face to the floor and stood with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head bowed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen, boy," begged Cassidy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We've been through too many things</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, you and I, to split up now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howsomever I'm going to take a chance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm going to tell them newspaper boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I won't stand for you goin' into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring with Sailor Madden."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You what?" exploded Martin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just that," assured Cassidy.

It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the last straw--the cutting away of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last prop that held Buster to a ves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tige of sanity. He could only hope that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buster would survive the Madden fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">without serious injury and that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">rebuild from the wreck; build up a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buster with more vision and more gray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, on the night before the fight, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">timid knock came on his door.

Pop Cassidy</seg><seg type="columnLine">28</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was not in a mood to talk with any one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He struggled to his feet a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later and endeavored to hide his embar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rassment and to appear natural.

He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard her description so many times</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Buster that it was impossible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to mistake her. His hand was trem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling. His brain was hardly clear. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was face to face with the girl who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">so heartlessly ruined his "boy" and who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tumbled the dreams of a lifetime</seg><seg type="columnLine">down about his shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm Molly O'Connor," announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl in a dead voice.

Madden</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarled. There was blood trickling</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the corner of his mouth. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed, and again Martin gave ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting punches from underneath, up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Sailor's covered head.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sailor straightened up and Martin</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove a right cross to the temple that</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook Madden to his toes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Sailor was screaming at him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthing vile language.

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">jolting short right took him under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. His mouthed jarred open and</seg><seg type="columnLine">another terrific left to the same spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused him to gasp. The world went</seg><seg type="columnLine">black suddenly. A right hook landed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jaw. He felt himself slipping--go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down. He felt the soft surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canvas, was dimly aware that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieking maniacs out in the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">were people--men and women. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that he had been knocked down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the referee was counting. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that over in the far corner, Mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den was standing with his arms thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the ropes and a nasty smirk on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his battered face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pie turned his buzzing head and, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes rested on the form of Pop Cas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidy, miles away, chewing on his cap--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Shoot That Left!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tears in his eyes.

He was saying "eight,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the voice sounded a mile off. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to go on. He'd thrown Pop down</seg><seg type="columnLine">--treated him like a dog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Below him a frantic radio announcer</seg><seg type="columnLine">was telling the world :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Martin is' down in his comer, right</seg><seg type="columnLine">over our heads!

He tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge Madden, but Madden was back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing away, sneering at him. Madden</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed two short lefts to the body and</seg><seg type="columnLine">an overhand right to the top of Buster's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. The blows felt like the landing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of a pile driver. And they were only</seg><seg type="columnLine">taps--measuring punches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tried to box, but his arms were</seg><seg type="columnLine">too heavy. He heard a shrill voice--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's voice. It sounded over the din of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty thousand fight mad fans:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kill him, Sailor. Kill the big bum !"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin knew that voice. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Molly's. All of the rage of five min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes ago surged through him. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself strong again. His head cleared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt that he was out-boxing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sailor--automatically. (Pop Cassidy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">training).</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He flicked out his left and saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood spatter from the Sailor's flat nose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stepped back, feinted with his left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crossed a heavy right to the Sailor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw. It went home like a lightning bolt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It shook the Sailor from heels to head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He heard Spike's rough voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep away from that right, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">dummy!" Spike was bellowing. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">guy can hit as long as he is alive!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin was grinning--a wolf grin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hit?" He'd show 'em he could hit!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He waded in close and ripped his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to the Sailor's heart. Again the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sailor wilted a trifle and gave ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And Martin, the terrible rage burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">him up, followed after him--shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">short rights and lefts to the jaw and</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of the snarling man before him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could sec nothing but the head of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sailor and the bloody gleam on two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his gold teeth. Buster reveled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sight; he was counting--making</seg><seg type="columnLine">him feel the weight of his fists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lashed forward and drove an up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">percut to the jaw. At the same mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, Madden side-stepped and, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crouch, drove a body punch at Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin. It went home with terrible force</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and it was low. Martin groaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud in his agony and started to double</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. As he sank to the floor, the Sailor</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot two rights to the jaw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he wrent down Martin knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was done. He'd felt that pain</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. It was the muscle and heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralysing blow--the dirty punch, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">punch the referee couldn't see. A thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">36</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sand voices shrieked "Foul!" But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">referee shook his head and began the</seg><seg type="columnLine">count. And Martin sank lower 011 the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the corner, Pop Cassidy stood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tears streaming down his face, his lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttering strange curses. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">towel in his hand. He was thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had to save his Buster from fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther punishment. He had to save him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from terrible injury. He blamed him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. Should have called the fight oft'.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In his grief he forgot that the rules will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not permit a fighter's manager to end</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fight by throwing in the sponge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The referee must end the fight--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In Madden's corner a white-faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, a stricken light in her eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the gray face of the man she</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved. The referee's arm was going up</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the ninth time. The house was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bedlam, and Martin was still inert upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor of the ring--near to his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hoarse, fog-horn sound broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the din.

He pushed him off the stool</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the center of the ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The radio announcer was talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">again to his unseen audience:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cassidy has been saying things to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his man during the rest.

The fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">is back in his eyes and he's glaring at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sailor as if he intended to eat him</seg><seg type="columnLine">lip. This Buster Martin is one sweet</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy for anyone's money. He's shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">more sheer guts here tonight than we've</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen in the Arena in a blue moon. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaping oft his stool. He's jumping</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the ring. It's his old trick, folks!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's trapped the Sailor coming out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his corner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the gong Martin had leaped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Sailor rose slowly to his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He trapped him in the Sailor's own cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, close to the ropes. He was bobbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ducking in front of Madden, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands were flashing in and out, tie-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up the Sailor without touching him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a grim look on Buster's face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was thinking of what Pop had said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That Molly girl is over there in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sailor's corner having a circus." Yeah?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spat! Without him knowing it, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right flashed out and jarred the Sailor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head back. He sank his left up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glove wrist in Madden's middle and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepping back, crashed another right to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jaw. The Sailor closed and held.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the clinches Madden heeled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the chin with the back of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">glove and the laces cut a deep gash in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buster's upper lip. He could hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrill voice of Molly. She was scream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the top of her voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kill the big boob, Sailor. Sock him</seg><seg type="columnLine">one for me--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sound gave new strength to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his weary arms. He lashed out with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight right, and the Sailor slipped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one knee. The referee waved Martin</seg><seg type="columnLine">away and the house was filled with so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many gibbering lunatics. He stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, panting and eager. He felt his</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs trembling and his arms were</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerless. The Sailor was up and com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he lunged in, Martin jabbed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sore nose with three rapid lefts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and laughed aloud as he saw the blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurt anew. The Sailor was again</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthing expletives. He was slamming</seg><seg type="columnLine">away at Martin's body, each blow hurt-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and each blow taking some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little stamina left in the battered body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Buster Martin. He knew that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at the end of his rope. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought drove him mad. In another</seg><seg type="columnLine">round he would not have enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength left to drive home a finishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">punch, even if Madden gave him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stepped in desperately and swung.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madden crashed through his guard with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pounding left to the jaw. Again the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world rocked and swayed, and a shrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh came to him--Molly's laugh. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">bobbed his head and threw a right hook</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Sailor's body. He heard Madden</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunt. He lashed out with an over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand left and knew that it had found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sailor's jaw. Then the Sailor</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached him with another of those pile-</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving rights to the heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In condition and hard as nails, Buster</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have laughed off such a punch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tonight they landed with a crushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">force. His knees sagged and his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped to his sides. Quick as a flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madden leaped in, sensing the moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His left and right thudded against Bus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter's jaw--even while Buster was</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumbling from the body blow. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">world spun and the blinding lights were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickening. Like a ship at sea, rocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the storm, he could hear Cassidy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice pleading with him:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get up, Buster! Get up! Get up, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll throw in the sponge."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Martin stirred his pain racked body</seg><seg type="columnLine">at "Four." It was a quiver of punch</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk muscles and nerves to the ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">siders. To Buster it was a titan effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stand erect. His legs refused to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. His brain was dead.. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobbing. His lungs were like furnaces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning him cruelly with each indrawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath. He knew that he was licked--</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time in his life. Out!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beaten! The referee was saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">",Seven!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was on his side in Madden's cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner. Dimly he saw'the snarling face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Spike O'Toole grinning at him. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he saw Molly O'Connor, and he?</seg><seg type="columnLine">38</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were glowing and her fists doubled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get up, you mama's boy!" She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming full in his face--not ten feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant. "Get up, you bum sport. Get</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and take your medicine from a bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter man. Stop dogging it, you quitter!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oh you yellow dog!''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was on his feet without looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">around. He didn't even know where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sailor was standing. He couldn't see.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lights were still reeling. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strength of ten giants. His heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">was aflame. "Bum sport, eh?--yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog?" He groped about with his two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. A thudding blow landed behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ear and he whirled. Punches had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost the power to hurt him. A crashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">left landed on his jaw and he shook it</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, waded in. He had found Madden.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His gloves were touching him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His head was clearing a little. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear, hear the shouts and growls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cries from the house; hear the bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lam of noise as Madden broke ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his attack and retreated across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring. Madden had a puzzled look on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face. He couldn't understand how</seg><seg type="columnLine">this boy could keep getting up. Spike</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Toole was chewing his cigar and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallowing the raw leaf. Cassidy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieking, his face purple:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shoot 'at left. Buster! Shoot 'at left I</seg><seg type="columnLine">The left, Boy--the left!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XV</seg><seg type="columnLine">Molly Wins a Decision</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAINTLY Buster heard Pop's voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What? The left? Oh yes--the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the old trick Pop had taught him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beginning. Prop 'em up with a left</seg><seg type="columnLine">jab and drop 'em with the right. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fighting like an automaton. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was fighting with fury, driving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sailor across the ring, beating at his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and body with a never-ending storm of</seg><seg type="columnLine">short rights and lefts. In the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring he stopped short and gave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sailor time to open up. Then he stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in and measured him._ His left flicked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">out, a short snappy left jab, just as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">always flicked out. And before it landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its target the right was on its way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">following it up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The left tilted the Sailor's head up so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his jaw was exposed for the frac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of a second, and then the crashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">right drove home--the good old right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand that knew when hay was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">made. The hard bone of the Sailor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw under his glove sent a wave of</seg><seg type="columnLine">exultation over Martin. He closed in--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he stumbled over something on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. He was still fighting, slashing out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his hands, but the Sailor wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. And the knock-down timekeeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">was counting, "Two.'' The referee was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushing Buster to his corner so he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">go on with the count.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As it was, Madden got a longer count</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he was entitled to due to Martin's</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbed brain. But he didn't stir, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunned Spike O'Toole pulled him</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodily to his corner when the fight was</seg><seg type="columnLine">over--when the referee had counted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">final, "Ten--and out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A raging mob descended upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring to carry Martin to the dressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. On the way in he passed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely. The police had to carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the rest of the way and place him</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the rub-down table, so Pop Cassidy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Moan" Cassidy in all truth on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion, could go to work on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside the frenzied mob pounded on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door and demanded entrance to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idol's dressing room, but Pop ignored</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clamor. He was ministering with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tender hands of a woman to the battered</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of "his Boy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was not until the next morning that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buster was really able to listen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything. It was not until he awoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a pain-racked sleep in which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued the fight of the night before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he knew that he was "Buster Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin, Lightweight Champion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">World"; a Champion the newspapers</seg><seg type="columnLine">heralded as "the greatest of them all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a boy that hasn't sense enough to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he's knocked out--and goes on</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Shoot That Left!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting with his heart." He read the</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers, all of them, as any boy would</seg><seg type="columnLine">do the morning after he happened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">become the lightweight champion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I heard you yell, 'use 'at left, Bus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter.' and I did it just like you showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a million times," he told Cassidy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And then I found myself wonderin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">why I couldn't hit him any more.

"He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on the floor, and I was the Manager</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a World's Champion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pop, I'm awful glad for your sake,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the happy kid. "I'm more glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">than I am for myself.

He patted Buster on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. "Listen, Boy, there's another</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend of yours out here that would like</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shake your hand and wish you luck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't be too hard. And everything that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she did yesterday and last night I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">about in advance and told her to do it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">to help you lick Madden."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who is it?" demanded Buster sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piciously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind who it is," answered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Cassidy.

He moped around, brooding. He hated Jeffries with a consuming bitter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.

Sharkey came out of it with three broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribs, but he came out with the "grudge" missing.

He was beautiful as an athlete</seg><seg type="columnLine">is beautiful, clear-eyed, graceful. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other looked smaller. His face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">weazened, his neck thin. The wiry</seg><seg type="columnLine">bristles of his almost colorless hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck out at all angles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were the actors in one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most dramatic battles the history of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring has ever recorded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The handsome man was Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Britt; the drawn and scrubby one Bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tling Nelson. Nelson moved forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">always forward. He had no defense to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">speak of. Britt hit him at will. Nelson</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued to move forward. No matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">how hard or how often Britt punched</seg><seg type="columnLine">he bored in just the same. Jimmy kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">backing away, smashing him cruel</seg><seg type="columnLine">blows, and always he kept advancing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once inside Britt's arms. Nelson</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to work. Punch, punch, punch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">right and left, to stomach and kidney,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and short, hard uppercuts to the jaw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the clinches Nelson did all the fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, while Britt strove to protect him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. Jimmy wanted to box at long</seg><seg type="columnLine">range. The Battler would have none of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. He started to fight his way inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment the referee forced them</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Britt landed six blows to Nelson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. They were hard blows, for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">41</seg><seg type="columnLine">42</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pride of the Pacific Coast had a left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand like a foil and a right with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hint of dynamite in it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At times Nelson's expressionless face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a crimson jelly under the thud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Britt's sodden gloves; there were times</seg><seg type="columnLine">when even his Greek body seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be stung through and through by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">merciless flogging. But he never</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped going forward. The roughest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">toughest lightweight champion that ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived was working at his trade. He took</seg><seg type="columnLine">no account of the rounds. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no need of accounting, for it was a fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a finish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Through all of it Britt paid no heed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his seconds. Wildly they urged him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to caution in the earlier rounds, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy sought to stop his opponent by</seg><seg type="columnLine">main strength. He boxed, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the cautious, defensive boxing he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shown in other fights. He was wag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his own war. Win or lose, the credit</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the sixth Nelson punched Britt</seg><seg type="columnLine">groggy. The gong saved him. Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute and he would have been done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rest did wonders for him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">recuperated amazingly. Nelson needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no recuperation. He had neither tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor wilted under the constant punching.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was as strong and almost as fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">as when he started.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In the succeeding rounds Britt could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do nothing with Nelson. He hit him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand blows. In the matter of points</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was far ahead, but points meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. Jimmy was not hurting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Battler, not slowing him down in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">least, and that meant he was losing--</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly and gamely, but losing just the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the fight went. The crowd was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all for him. It cheered every move he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made. Even the newspaper men in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">press row were praying for him. for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy Britt was the idol of the Coast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Nelson was almost an unknown.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was soon to be known throughout</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world, however.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the fourteenth Britt went groggy</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. He forgot to box. He forgot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">everything but the necessity of slaying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tight-lipped man who was continu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally crowding up against him, of clos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the terrible blue eyes that flamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his. He fought like a madman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He fought himself out in a hopeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">rally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the fifteenth Britt resumed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxing. He tried to stall, to rest, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inhuman fighting machine before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him would not let him rest. Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">would throw all his weight back of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">punch. It would land squarely on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dane's chin, but the head, coming for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward in advance of the body, met the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow rigidly. It never snapped back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing Britt could do seemed capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of snapping it back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, through the next three rounds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His friends gave up hope. His father,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing in that crowded arena, like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mourner at a funeral, had long since re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed himself to the inevitable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the eighteenth came the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">climax of that bitter fight. Nelson, fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing the one plan he knew, waded</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the showering blows--the blows</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had weakened and softened with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passing of the rounds. The body!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The body! That was the target. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was always the place to hit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A couple of lefts to the stomach</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought Britt's head forwaru. As it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in Nelson showered clubby rights</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lefts to the jaw. Another left to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body, a right to the jaw--the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">again--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy sank to the floor, and rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. His tongue protruded. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped the ropes, and tried to rise, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no more strength left in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms and legs. Nelson, a smile on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">battered face, looked down at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not hear the gloating roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the fifteen thousand in the Colma</seg><seg type="columnLine">arena. They hailed him--Battling Nel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. Cushions from the hard seats</seg><seg type="columnLine">rained through the air. The ring filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with jubilant men, who swept him up</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their shoulders. Nelson hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to notice it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had a strange sort of concentra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Durable Dane</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Though not much more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy in years--he was twenty-five--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been fighting his way toward this</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment for ten of them. Ten years is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long time, when they are filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard knocks. Nelson had always faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard knocks in the same manner that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had faced the flying fists of Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Britt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was the biggest moment of his life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bigger even than that happy day he fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished the Old Master, Joe Gans. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Battler had a high contempt for Britt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boxer rather than the fighter. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him the keenest personal joy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">win.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR fighting was Nelson's trade, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was never another just like</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The greatest lightweight the ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever saw was this little man, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">straw-colored hair, and the strangest</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue eyes in all the world. He was slim</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not very rugged in appearance, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the biceps of a dry goods clerk who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken up physical culture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet Battling Nelson was the rough-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est, toughest old wolf of them all. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't pretty to watch. For all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">slimness he was awkward as a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dane puppy. He wasn't clever or par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticularly fast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tore in, whaling away with both</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. Smashes to the head and body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here, there, everywhere. Nelson had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no defense. He pushed in against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">punches. Hooked and swung so fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">and often that only a small proportion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his blows were necessary to wear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other fellow down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His left arm had been injured, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">he couldn't bend the elbow for block-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. So he would keep turning his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, to stop the blows with his neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ears. It turned those ears into</seg><seg type="columnLine">grotesque deformities, but while he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ring he didn't mind that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Battler was rough. He always</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into action with a two- or three-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day growth of whiskers on his jowls--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trick that Jack Dempsey emulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">years later. In the clinches he would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> scrape those bristly whiskers against</seg><seg type="columnLine">his opponent's neck and chest, time after</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, in every clinch. After a bit, blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">would seep through the scratched skin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His dry, wiry hair would get in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other fellow's eyes. And all the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be hammering away with both</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rough. Tough. Never stopping.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No one could hiyt him, no matter how</seg><seg type="columnLine">they cut and slashed his face and body</seg><seg type="columnLine">into shreds. And his eyes!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy Britt said of them--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy should know, having fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nelson four times--"They were un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">canny, expressionless. They looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">through you instead of at you. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so expressionless that they might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been the eyes of a dead man. An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other thing: They never blinked. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">you stab a left into a fellow's nose or</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross a right to his chin he can't help</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinking. Nelson never did. No mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter how fast the punches were coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes were wide open and staring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It began to get you after a while. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to believe that the guy wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">human. Say, for days after a fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Nelson I couldn't see anything but</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It's a lot to say of any man that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the best that ever came along at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular game. There was not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightweight champion in the whole pack</seg><seg type="columnLine">who didn't know more about boxing</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Battling Nelson. There probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't one who could not make a fool</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him in six rounds, outpoint him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten, have none the worse of it in fifteen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, if you tossed any of them into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring with the Durable Dane in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight to a finish, one man would be car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried out and one would walk--and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walker would be Battling Nelson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Kid Lavigne was just as game as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nelson, a harder hitter and faster on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet. He was a rugged soul, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe Walcott fairly murdered him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">early rounds of their historic fight at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maspeth. Lavigne's left ear was hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing by a shred. He was scarcely recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nizable, but he fought a stern, uphill</seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">battle and beat the Barbadoes Demon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That indicated plenty of ability to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">punishment, but the Saginaw Kid didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight nearly as much as Nelson, nor did</seg><seg type="columnLine">he last as long.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frank Erne would have given him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good fight, but the Battler would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn him down. Joe Gans was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">far from his best when he traveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">those forty-two hot rounds in the Ne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vada desert, yet he was on the floor at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the finish--knocked out &gt;f a man ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, even though the referee did give</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the decision on a foul.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wolgast was of the same type as Nel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son and JLavigne, but he crumbled fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">once the break came. Great ringman</seg><seg type="columnLine">though Benny Leonard was, it isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely that he could have licked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Battler where harder hitters failed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly he was not cut out for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">finish fights that were once popular.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for Goodrich, Kansas and Man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dell, we can dismiss them as we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others. They were not built to</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel the "derby route."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nelson was as honest as the day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was never the faintest hint of</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicion against him in the years he</seg><seg type="columnLine">waged wars in rings from New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">to 'Frisco. Before the first fight with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gans at Goldfield a gambler offered him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large sum to quit. If he would ''lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">down" he would be independent for life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nelson rose up in the wildest wrath</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kicked that gambler down the steps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had no education in the accepted</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of the term, but possessed sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">native intelligence. He owned a mining</seg><seg type="columnLine">company, ran a town, and wrote a book</seg><seg type="columnLine">in addition to winning the lightweight</seg><seg type="columnLine">championship of the world, a record</seg><seg type="columnLine">that many a more pretentious man</seg><seg type="columnLine">might envy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, Battling Nelson was a diamond</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the rough--the roughest on record.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This two-fisted slugger was, and is</seg><seg type="columnLine">--you get in the habit of past tensing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fighter when he has been out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">racket very long--a generous fellow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the San Francisco earthquake</seg><seg type="columnLine">came along he sent a check for $1,000</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to the relief fund, which was a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than some professional philan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thropists did.

Though his quarter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a million would not be so highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rated now, it represented a greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">achievement to get it together than it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was for Gene Tunney to earn his mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion in these days of high finance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It isn't my job to paint Bat Nelson</seg><seg type="columnLine">as an angel, He was anything but that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He didn't drink or smoke, but no man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who has gone on the road as a kid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought his way along as a meat-cutter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiter, prize-fighter and what-not can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little Lord Fauntleroy. But he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">game and honest, and never whimpered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If he was an egoist he was also a doer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he was the greatest fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightweight champion we ever had.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seems to me that there can be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispute on this point. He fought ihe</seg><seg type="columnLine">longest championship fights in modern</seg><seg type="columnLine">history. He beat the greatest men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his time--Gans, McGovern, Britt, Cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bett, Herrera, Canole, Hanlon. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">took more punishment than any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion who ever lived, and yet his</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbelievable ruggedness carried him</seg><seg type="columnLine">through twenty years of competition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was one of the most picturesque</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all champions; a man who never</seg><seg type="columnLine">backed up, who never believed any chap</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his weight could whip him. Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">London called him "the abysmal brute."</seg><seg type="columnLine">By this he meant that Battling Nelson</seg><seg type="columnLine">was soaked with that basic thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the very center of life--movement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No matter what comes, the abysmal</seg><seg type="columnLine">brute will move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one who saw Nelson in his last</seg><seg type="columnLine">great effort against Wolgast can doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that London was right.

That his fam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily took him to Illinois when he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a year old and eventually settled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hegewisch certainly had much to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hegewisch was a fighting town.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meat packing and ice-cutting were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">principal industries, and that sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">work makes for strong muscles.

He was paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">ninety cents a week, which looked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small fortune to him. His employer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Daline, recognizing the kid's en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ergy and trustworthiness, increased his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wage until he was getting one dollar a</seg><seg type="columnLine">day by the time he quit to enter the em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploy of the G.

Bat never</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked for any the best of it, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard work in the outdoors helped mould</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into a much stronger youngster</seg><seg type="columnLine">than his slim build indicated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was in September, 1896 that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wallace's circus made a one-day stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Hammond, which is just around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner from Hegewisch, in a manner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking. Practically every boy in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hegewisch walked to Hammond to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that show. Because of the hot weather</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meat-cutters--of which brigade</seg><seg type="columnLine">young Nelson was one--were working</seg><seg type="columnLine">only three days a week. So Bat hied</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself over with the gang, marched in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street parade with a banner, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward carried water for the ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phants. For this each youngster was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rewarded with passes to the show.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wallace's circus was no dazzling af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair, or wouldn't have been to metro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">politan eyes. The costumes were shabby</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the elephants wore a moth-eaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">look, but to Battling Nelson's eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze it was a carnival of grandeur. Yet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an even bigger attraction than the circus</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself was a supposedly world renowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">pugilist, who was traveling with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">show.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one knew who this fellow was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the circus billed him as "Wallace's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unknown." He was a tough-looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">chap, compactly built and as hard as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kid Broad. I guess he was the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">real prize-fighter Nelson had ever seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At any rate, the boy was thrilled to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones at the thought of watching him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">action. Though only fourteen years</seg><seg type="columnLine">old, Bat was the cock o' the walk in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">home town, and already thoughts of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring career were flickering and buzzing</seg><seg type="columnLine">around in his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In these days they talk a lot about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gene Tunney's supreme confidence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The present heavyweight champion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world is sure of himself, but he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">never as complete an egoist as Battling</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nelson, even when that young man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the immature age of fourteen:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quite casually he offered to fight the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great unknown for the dollar given any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who lasted three rounds. Imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">the supreme gall of the youngster. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as Nelson knew, this fellow might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been a world's champion, amusing</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself by a tour incognitio. His ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience was limited and he didn't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that world's champions are the last peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple in the world to do such a thing. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignorance made the exploit doubly</seg><seg type="columnLine">daring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wearing a frayed red sweater and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubber-soled shoes, little Bat walked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the sawdust arena to face the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"killer." The tent was packed, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the accompaniment of roaring lions, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">band that struggled through "Down</seg><seg type="columnLine">Went McGinty," and the yelps of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd, the greatest lightweight of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">all made his fighting start.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, the Unknown was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid of this youngster. He rushed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimacing fiercely, intent on getting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">job over and done with. Nelson met</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rush squarely, his left hand held</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in the approved manner. Back</seg><seg type="columnLine">went the Unknown's head, his nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Durable Dane</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">47</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">streaming blood. Nelson was on top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him instantly, with a cracking right</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the heart that had the profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional gasping and floundering. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">game, though, and came back, but Bat</seg><seg type="columnLine">again jabbed with his left, and coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered with a right to the stomach. Down</seg><seg type="columnLine">went the Unknown, completely out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Man Wallace paid over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised dollar, but there wras little</seg><seg type="columnLine">profit in that. WThile Bat was making</seg><seg type="columnLine">his first step toward the championship</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world one of the circus hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">stole his coat, which contained his</seg><seg type="columnLine">week's salary of $5.40 and a Water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bury watch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE circus owner wanted Bat to</seg><seg type="columnLine">play the role of the "Great Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known" for the balance of the tour. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">even offered fifty dollars a week and</seg><seg type="columnLine">expenses--an unparalleled offer for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourteen-year-old in the fading days of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nineteenth century---but old Nels</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nelson wouldn't listen to it. His boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too young for such foolishness. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">must stay at home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, that was all right with Bat. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was having a good time in Hegewisch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the call of the road had not yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken hold of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His victor^' over Wallace's prize-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighter started a great interest in box-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing around his neighborhood. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">White House Club, an athletic organi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zation, was started, with Nelson as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prize boxer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The population of the town was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally divided between Danes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swedes. There never has been much</seg><seg type="columnLine">love lost between these peoples, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter rallied around a rough young</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow named Ole Olson to counteract</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ballyhoo the Danes were making</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Nelson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So a match was made for a purse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">three dollars, and one Sunday afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire male population of Hegewisch</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned out to see the fight. Olson had</seg><seg type="columnLine">height, weight and reach on his rival,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which about balanced the reputation</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nelson had made by knocking out the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown. Pay envelopes were rifled</seg><seg type="columnLine">for betting money, and the excitement</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so great that men were taking pot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots at each other all over town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Olson knew no more about the sci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence of boxing than Nelson did. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore in, and Bat met him flat-footed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For two rounds Ole swarmed all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kid. They battered away at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other like a couple of wild men. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the third Nelson beat the Swede</seg><seg type="columnLine">down with a flurry of short arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">punches to the body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That precipitated* a riot. The spec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tators, nervously excited about the fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and keyed to a higher pitch by the short</seg><seg type="columnLine">and desperate struggle, began a battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">royal among themselves. Nelson went</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the forefront of that, and led the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danes to victor}- over the Swedes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rough and tough. Tireless. A boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">who really loved to fight!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was too much fight talk around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Nelson household. Those hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">working and conscientious folk had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for the ring. They saw' no glory</seg><seg type="columnLine">or money or advancement of any sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it for their son. They thought he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would get hurt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bat kept on talking, though. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">two victories had brought him only four</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars, but money wasn't everything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By this time he was working as a black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">smith's helper in one of the Hegewisch</seg><seg type="columnLine">shops, and the stir of adventure was</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipping up his blood. You can't ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain that sort of thing to your mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">--not so she'll understand, anyway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day a fly-- g iron fragment from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a broken machine struck Bat in the face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">laying it open. He was taken more</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead than alive to the Mercy Hospital,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he lay unconscious for forty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight hours. He came out a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks later, through with that sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. Fie wanted to fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wrhen Mrs. Nelson protested he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Aw, ma!

Most of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">romance had gone out of the road for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him by that time. There was no fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to do in that part of the country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except the street corner kind that al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways crops up when hot-blooded youth</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Bat went to work as a helper in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a butcher shop at fifteen dollars a</seg><seg type="columnLine">month. That was his occupation until</seg><seg type="columnLine">Christmas, when, his demand for five</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars a month more being refused, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed up the job and went to work as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowboy on a nearby ranch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The war with Spain came down like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thunderclap on the country. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one was in a fervor of patriotic excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. A volunteer company was formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Huron. They weren't finicky about</seg><seg type="columnLine">a person's age, so Bat Nelson slipped in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and became a soldier overnight. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors traveled down to Sioux Falls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, for some reason or other, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain was rejected, and his men, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had agreed to follow him to the finish,</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned home with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That visit to Sioux Falls gave Nel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son an idea. There was a boxing club</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, and Bat had by no means decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give up the game. He finished up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the winter months as a waiter in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vanderbilt Hotel in Miller, but when</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring began to tint the world with</seg><seg type="columnLine">green he went to Sioux Falls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that time a shifty, raw-boned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">long-armed fellow named Freddy Green</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the particular pet and idol of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fans. He was called "the champion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Dakotas." Nelson had never heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him until he wandered into the Falls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It wouldn't have made any difference if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had. The idea never entered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaggy head that he need be afraid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any one. His blue eyes would not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavered had he been tossed in with Kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lavigne, then lightweight champion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The manager of the club was glad to</seg><seg type="columnLine">match Bat with Freddy Green, since</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">there were not so many fighters around</seg><seg type="columnLine">who wanted to risk themselves with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, kid," he said, "I'll take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance with you.

In that short span of time</seg><seg type="columnLine">a boxer, cowboy, soldier, casual worker</seg><seg type="columnLine">--Yes, Nelson took life by the throat in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tenderest years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, against the champion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dakotas, he was to make his debut in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">real ring, in real fighting togs--quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that he had taken the first step</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the goal that beckoned him on</seg><seg type="columnLine">since he stood watching Wallace's Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known writhe and squirm in the saw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust of the "big top."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Lure of the Game</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GREEN was a boxer.

It was all new stuff to Nelson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Unknown and Olson had rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him as eagerly as he went at them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was a different sort of game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bat kept chasing, and Freddy kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprinting and outboxing him. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth round the blood spurted from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nelson's nose under the continuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumping.

His victory</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Green was a tonic that lifted him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the heights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Williams knew no more about boxing</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Nelson did. He came out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner, both hands swinging. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Battler met him with a grin of pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy. That sort of stuff was right down</seg><seg type="columnLine">his alley. He doted on it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Williams was strong as a bull</seg><seg type="columnLine">and much the more experienced man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Up to the sixth round he had a bit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">better of it. He was weakening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though. The pace was faster than he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was used to. On the other hand, Nel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son had no tire in him and kept coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster and faster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the seventh Bat landed a sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">right to the stomach, then stepped back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see if the Soldier would follow him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead, the puffing warrior retreated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, ha," said Nelson to himself,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> r.--Jone--«</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're a quitter, are you?" He came</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing back once, with a whirl of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooks, crosses and uppercuts to face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. Williams wilted under it, tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to run, and was saved by the bell as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Green had been the night before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The respite was only temporary. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighth round was not a minute old be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the referee counted him out, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Battling Nelson had scored his fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight knockout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ABOUT that time the kid began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a bit homesick. He was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixteen, after all, and he wanted to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">his folks and chum around with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys. So he rode the freights back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hegewisch. where he was given the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time honored welcome of the prodigal</seg><seg type="columnLine">son.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even the earth-worn Nels Nelson</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have realized that his son was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngster with the sort of determina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that brooked no stopping. Bat</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to be a fighter. Neither his</seg><seg type="columnLine">father's anger nor his mother's tears</seg><seg type="columnLine">could stop him. If they thought he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was following a dreary track to the rain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow's end. the boy had a different idea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So verbal opposition was dropped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nelson made a fistic reappearance be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the home folks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He boxed a six-round draw with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eddie Herman in Hegewisch. and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw decision was nothing in the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a break for him. Eddie, a smart</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxer, made a fool of Bat for the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">three rounds. After that the Dane bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered him from pillar to post, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the finish Herman was a gory sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had the bout been scheduled for ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounds Nelson would undoubtedly have</seg><seg type="columnLine">scored another knockout.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So far he had given no thought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big cities. Confident as he was of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own ability, he knew that outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own bailiwick and up in Dakota,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was not a drawing card. But now</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned those blue eyes of his on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hegewisch is one of the many small</seg><seg type="columnLine">towns that snuggle around the south-</seg><seg type="columnLine">50</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">era outposts of that city. It isn't so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much of a trip into the Loop, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment Nelson had no desire for</seg><seg type="columnLine">long and tiresome trips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eddie Penny had been cleaning up</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the second-rate lightweights in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago. He didn't feel any call to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid of the tow-headed kid from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hegewisch, and when a match was of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered he willingly agreed. They met on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the South Side and Bat's victory was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite as decisive as the first one over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wallace's Unknown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nelson walked right into Penny, bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered him with both hands and finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">him off in less than a round. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">following month he stopped Bull Win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters in even a shorter time, and topped</seg><seg type="columnLine">off his Chicago debut by knocking out</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fellow named John Smith in the sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond &gt;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These three victories netted him ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">actly fifteen dollars, the method of pay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a fighter at that time being to pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hat. Since all of Bat's victims</seg><seg type="columnLine">were favorites of the crowd, the folks</seg><seg type="columnLine">assembled were not in a mood to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">him much reward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nelson wasn't discouraged. Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">could discourage him. Though the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards of the moment were meagre, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, he knew that ringmen did earn</seg><seg type="columnLine">large sums of money. If other men</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done that, he could, too, the boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasoned. He felt that destiny had</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed him out.	^</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But for more than a year no fights</seg><seg type="columnLine">came his way. He stayed home and</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked, trained at the old White House</seg><seg type="columnLine">Club, and took one gorgeous hunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip in the Northwest. The outdoor life</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hard physical work and consistent</seg><seg type="columnLine">training were building him up. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only eighteen and had plenty of time</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE year of 1900 marked the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Nelson's sporadic ring efforts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He began to fight regularly. He started</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the first step of the ladder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He agreed to fight a negro named</seg><seg type="columnLine">Feathers Vernon at Dalton, Illinois.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Six rounds for ten dollars. It wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">much of a fight, for Feathers ran and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducked and clinched throughout. Bat</seg><seg type="columnLine">was given the decision. Just as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">president of the club was about to hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the ten dollars a fight started. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">money was knocked out of his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nelson managed to retrieve a dollar and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half, but the bill was so badly tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was not able to pass it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though his financial reward for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bout was only fifty cents, it was not en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely a wasted day. In the free-for-all</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nelson went to work and whipped half</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen men for the sheer pleasure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, glory of glories, the manager</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Star Theater in Chicago offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">him fifteen dollars for a windup match</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Charley Dougherty! It was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gift of the gods. Nelson accepted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with avidity, and knocked Dougherty</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in a round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They brought him back for a bout</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Joe Hedmark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fight with Hedmark was the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit of tragedy to come into Nelson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">career. Afterward he said that Joe was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a combination of Terry McGovern and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dal Hawkins. An exaggeration, cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly, but he must have seemed some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing like that to the inexperienced</seg><seg type="columnLine">country boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At any rate Hedmark was strong,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast, and a good puncher. He was tal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler, stronger, and had been in the game</seg><seg type="columnLine">much longer. Nelson fought harder</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he had done in any of his other</seg><seg type="columnLine">battles, but was doomed to defeat from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the start.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As usual, Bat came out swinging, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hedmark let go a right uppercut with</seg><seg type="columnLine">every ounce of his strength behind it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Down went Battling Nelson for the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time in his life. It was a greater indig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nity than the blood Freddy Green had</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn from his nose. He came up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clawing like a wildcat, mad clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nelson kept going forward all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, but he couldn't reach his target,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Joe pelted away with both hands at</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Durable Dane</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">51</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his face and ribs. They finished the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last round fighting like madmen in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the ring, but there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissenting voice when the referee raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hedmark's hand. He had won with</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty to spare, and even Battling Nel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son admitted it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the matter of knockdowns it prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably set a record. Hedmark dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Dane seventeen times in six rounds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in turn was floored on five occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions. Twenty-two visits to the canvas</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a six-round bout ought to be a rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ord, if it isn't one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nelson was paid fifteen dollars--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">about eightv-eight cents a knockdown.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You can hardly buy that sort of thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">today at any price.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just a week later Bat went on with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harry Griffin in the same ring and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped his opponent thirteen times</seg><seg type="columnLine">without being able to put him away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When you consider there were thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five knockdowns in twelve rounds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting it's easy to understand w'hy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nelson was becoming popular with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago crowds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His remaining fights in 1900 were</seg><seg type="columnLine">successful enough from an artistic but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a financial standpoint. Young Bay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the best lightweights in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Middle West; Clarence Class, Ed Bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley, Danny McMahon, Black Griffo and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack Martin caused him no particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. Pete Boyle, when on the verge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of being stopped, was awarded the fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a foul by Referee George Siler.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day he lost to Boyle, Nelson, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only time in his life, fought two</seg><seg type="columnLine">battles in one day. As soon as he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been disqualified, he changed into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">street clothes, hopped a trolley car, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the Hibernian Club, where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought four rounds with McMahon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For these fights Nelson was paid ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars. That wasn't cake and coffee</seg><seg type="columnLine">money even in those days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Battler was beginning to find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing. He wasn't cut out for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">six-round game. He needed distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which his superb vitality would give</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a chance to come from behind. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">clever men could outbox him over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">short route. Even the frailer ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not tire much in six rounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fifteen rounds. Twenty. Finish</seg><seg type="columnLine">fights. That was the dream lurking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tousled head even then, but in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">section of the country six rounds w'as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the standard. Had it been the standard</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere Battling Nelson would never</seg><seg type="columnLine">have risen to fame. He would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been just another strong, rough medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocrity. They couldn't possibly know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in a finish fight he was the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightweight of them all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Fight at Rheinlander</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOBODY knew that, of course.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The promoters knew it least of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, apparently, for up to this time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">largest sum he had been paid for a fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thirty-five dollars. Then, quite un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectedly, Nelson went up into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-figure class.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fought a tough young Irishman</seg><seg type="columnLine">named Mickey Riley in Milwaukee for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a guarantee of thirty-five dollars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mickey was pretty smart and kept out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of reach for the six rounds. The ref-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eree gave him the decision, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a most unpopular one. Following the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm of hoots and boos came a rain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver and small bills. The Battler</seg><seg type="columnLine">netted $98.31, which was approximately</seg><seg type="columnLine">the value of the United States treasury,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lurking in his simple heart was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire to be a Beau Brummel. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fight he togged himself out in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven-dollar suit, a derby and a new pair</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shoes, and trod the boulevards to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give the natives a treat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You must understand that even so</seg><seg type="columnLine">rugged a soul as Battling Nelson could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not possibly have lived on his ring earn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings at that time, even with such occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional windfalls. He was working for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Hawley Down Draft Furnace Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany on the North Side of Chicago,</seg><seg type="columnLine">52</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging a sledge for eight hours a day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was all the training he got. Gym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nasiums and road work and balanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">diets were beyond his range. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon of fight night he would get</seg><seg type="columnLine">off early for a bath and haircut, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to go any distance. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled to Milwaukee he took the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">day off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His brother Johnny and Charley</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peterson used to come up from Hege-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisch to second him, so there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">money wasted on handlers. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't be, for Bat made it a rule to</seg><seg type="columnLine">send half his purses to his mother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the victories there was little</seg><seg type="columnLine">margin for celebration, either, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a meal at Flynn Brothers' restaurant</seg><seg type="columnLine">on State Street. The Flynns were big-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearted Irishmen, and they liked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tow-headed kid from Hegewisch. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had money he could pay. If he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">they "wrote it on the ice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Early in May, 1901, Nelson went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Omro, a little Wisconsin town, to fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harry Fails. It was only a six-round</seg><seg type="columnLine">no-decision affair, but it was so-bitterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">contested that the fans demanded an</seg><seg type="columnLine">encore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was satisfactory to all parties</seg><seg type="columnLine">save the sheriff of the county. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff, himself, was not particularly op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to a little setto, but he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">given orders to stop it. If he didn't, off</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come his official head. He also</seg><seg type="columnLine">informed the fighters that if they went</seg><seg type="columnLine">through with the bout he would per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonally see that they served a little time</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the penitentiary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That scared both the boys. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were eager to fight, but didn't want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get in trouble over it. The fellows pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moting the affair decided that they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">all go over to Rheinlander, just across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the county line, and then the sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not interfere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the horsedrawn vehicles in Omro</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hired, and they started out. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the excitement no provision was made</seg><seg type="columnLine">to transport the fighters. All the rigs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were full. Nobody offered them a seat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of the bigger-hearted bumpkins</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">said they could ride on the laps of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers if they had a mind to. Both</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harry and Bat decided to walk. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it would be good training.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly it began to snow, hard. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">came down so thick and fast that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hardly see fifty feet ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. An icy wind was whipping down</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the North, and there was four or</seg><seg type="columnLine">five miles to go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bat had never seen snow in May be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore. He had no overcoat, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven-dollar suit was no great protec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion against the elements. By the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boys reached the barn where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to fight they were so stiff with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold that they could hardly move. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">barn itself was a pretty chilly place, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot for a man in nothing but trunks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shoes to stand around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every one of the spectators had a bet</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, and the gangling fellow who</seg><seg type="columnLine">owned the place was appointed referee.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crowd howled through the ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounds. Bat and Harry were stirred</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the excitement, but more by their</seg><seg type="columnLine">rivalry and the need to keep warm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They fought like a couple of bob-cats.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the finish they were both strong and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The referee raised both their right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, exclaiming, "Even up, boys--</seg><seg type="columnLine">hang fiddle if she wasn't!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No purse had been arranged for.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fighters in those days weren't very</seg><seg type="columnLine">good business men, you know. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wisconsin fans were sports, and real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized that they had been treated to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great scrap. They began to toss money</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the ring, and the erstwhile enemies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning from blows to finance, began</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambling over the floor to pick it up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were a lot of cracks, and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the coins rolled into them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The money had been too hard-earned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to let it escape so easily. They bor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowed a hammer and pinch-bar, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pried up the boards, so that not a penny</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be missed. When it was all piled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and divided they each had $150. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the biggest purse so far, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Nelson was not to better for nearl/</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Durable Dane</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">53</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">two years. That's how slow progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">was for the greatest lightweight of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BAT did practically no fighting again</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the fall of that year, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he started campaigning in Milwaukee</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, first with the Italian, Joe Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cente, then with that cagy veteran, Ed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">die Santry.

As a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact Santry was on the floor when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last bell sounded, and the referee had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to help him to his feet before lifting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right glove in the sign of victory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Astounded, Bat rushed over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped the official by the arm.

"I won. didn't I?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, Nelson," the referee said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Santry told me that everything was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed up; that he was to get the decision</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever happened."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was the Durable Dane's first</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting with anything shady in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring.

There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were six years of sporadic fighting be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him. He was twenty years old,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and getting a little battered. He had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">money to speak of, the fifty dollars he</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried in his pocket representing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sum total of his wealth. He had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">trade. He seemed to be getting no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where.

He went under the moniker of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beppo an' he had the chief attributes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a heavyweight--the weight an' the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dumbness. But, mister, it was a differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent kind of dumbness. A big, deep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dense kind. He was dumb enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think he was a world-beater--an' too</seg><seg type="columnLine">dumb to see why he wasn't. Say, mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, put me up against any ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">brand of that product, an' you can give</seg><seg type="columnLine">odds 011 me. But this guy's kind, it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">me beat from the opening gong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was this way. Me, I'm Harry</seg><seg type="columnLine">Higgins, manager. You all heard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Sure. Some wise folks call me</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lighthead Harry" but I never see no</seg><seg type="columnLine">connection.

Now I wasn't at the point where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could rake in any of that easy graft</seg><seg type="columnLine">by chargin' admission for the show my</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys put on in trainin'. So I pays no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more attention to the gent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had lunch with Jakie McCoy that</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. I remember, because he wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to throw a fight to his boy up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Half Moon A. C. that week. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't. He wasn't offerin' enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anyway, when I gets back from</seg><seg type="columnLine">chow, the tow-head was still doin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty.

"No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanks.

"Want to step</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few rounds?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," says he an' settles back against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall again to watch those sons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maul swap punches.

One of them hard-cut, juttin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads like a gunboat cleavin' the waves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nice pair of shoulders, sort of stooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">like they'd followed a plough. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tapers right down to the hips, even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">them baggy clothes he was wearin'.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An', though he was leanin' against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, he seems to stand light an' poised</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy on his dogs. Well, he had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear-marks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was all set to open up an' get some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dope from him when I hears a</seg><seg type="columnLine">yell from across the gym an' looks up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shocker Coffee, one of the cornin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavies I had, had jus' kissed the can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vas.

The Shocker had fought a tough</seg><seg type="columnLine">go with the Savannah Tar Baby couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nights ago an' he was still some shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. He waves to Iron Jaw McCabe--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was sparrin' with him--he's had</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough an' climbs through the ropes for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the showers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I throws a word the Shocker's way</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he passes an' turns back to find this</seg><seg type="columnLine">tow-head gent laughin'.

Big an' square.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Them kind of babies ought to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">peddlin' shoelaces," he cracks, laughin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">some more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jus' then Iron Jaw comes up. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">overhears the remark an' looks this baby</seg><seg type="columnLine">up an' down.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turns to me, smiling. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy to see he ain't mad, or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">sore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Punch drunk, eh. Sends a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em nuts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ordinarily, Iron Jaw's jus' like any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other fighting man. He don't pick</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraps. When he fights, he wants to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid for it. But that one caught him</seg><seg type="columnLine">low. It was less than a month since he</seg><seg type="columnLine">buys some oil stock. An' it turns out</seg><seg type="columnLine">that what was behind that stock was</seg><seg type="columnLine">good for drinking maybe, but not much</seg><seg type="columnLine">for lubricating. Right then some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys had begun to remark as how Iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jaw had been stoppin' a pile of punches</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his head. Iron Jaw has heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of them cracks. So this one don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">help none at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was like walkin' into a bull's bou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doir in red underwear. It's Iron Jaw's</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to get hot now. An' he does. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalks back to the ring, proud an' snar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lin' low through that hole where some</seg><seg type="columnLine">56</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth were missin'. Pie climbs through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ropes, sheds his robe, an' turns to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tow head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You want to step this way, mister,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he bawls out, "an' I'll drink a few of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them punches of vours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The kid grins at me an' says: "Worse</seg><seg type="columnLine">than I thought."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Iron Jaw gets that one, too, right on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the button. He comes back for more</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the only wise-crack I ever heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">him pull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Most hicks are green," he sings out</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this guy. "You're different. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">look yella to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, that's enough to start a pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">good war any place. The tow-head</seg><seg type="columnLine">grins some more at me, an' then begins</seg><seg type="columnLine">strippin' off his coat. "Ain't had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">work-out today an' I might jus' as well,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he explains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the boys digs him up a pair</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trunks an' it ain't long before he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ring with Iron Jaw. Now get</seg><seg type="columnLine">me right. Iron Jaw may be old. An'</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's seen better days. But there's more</seg><seg type="columnLine">sore hands come from tryin' to crack</seg><seg type="columnLine">his jaw than from the rock pile at Sing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sing. Also, despite the fact that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sops up punishment like a thirsty</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponge, he carries a right-hand punch</seg><seg type="columnLine">that reminds the boys of Cain handlin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abel the works, when it lands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WELL, they're in there. This tow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head bozo ain't worried none,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' he don't seem mad. Somebody</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracks the gong one, an' they're at it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Iron Jaw comes wadin' in like a truck</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse with fallen arches, that round-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house right cocked for the fall of Rome.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The tow-head--an' I didn't make no</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistake about his build; it's pretty--</seg><seg type="columnLine">starts prancin' around, shootin' light</seg><seg type="columnLine">lefts at iron Jaw's head. Might jus'</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well waste time tick'in' a battleship</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a port hole. Iron Jaw unleashes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right swing a couple of times. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kid steps away from it like it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad news. Jus' once he fools Iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jaw an' rolls under it, cornin' up to poke</seg><seg type="columnLine">one in the bread basket that'd help 110</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">man's indigestion. That was the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Iron Jaw goes into the second mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der'n ever. An' the tow-head ain't sore</seg><seg type="columnLine">atall. Jus' prances around grinnin' an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">pokin' a neat left into Iron Jaw's eye.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm gettin' a good line on the kid. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sees he's flashy, with plenty of speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' good footwork. He back-pedals</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a champ an' he counters plenty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But they're all light. What that bozo</seg><seg type="columnLine">needs is a punch. Every once in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he steps in an' shoots one hard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he's firin' from long distance an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">when his glove lands, it's at the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his reach. No sting in them kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They clinch an' I sees the tow-head's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth movin'. I don't know jus' what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he says, but it was mean. For Iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jaw backs off mad. Like the time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ump gave him a raw decision up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yonkers an* they called out the dicks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . He plows in, primed for man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaughter, an' nails the kid in a corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Right then's where I learn this kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">can take it. Iron Jaw hits him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything in the book, takin' turns at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head an' his tummy. But instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pullin' his chin into his shoulder an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">coverin' up hard, the tow-head tries to</seg><seg type="columnLine">box. He picks some of them off in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air an' blocks a few more. But Iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jaw's landin' hard an' plenty an' there</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't no room to back pedal. Easy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the kid hasn't done much fightin'.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was thinkin' of stoppin' the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaughter before the kid goes down</seg><seg type="columnLine">when 1 notices it's Iron Jaw who's</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathin' hard an' wobblin'. He's hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kid so many times he's groggy</seg><seg type="columnLine">from throwin' punches. He breaks</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground to the middle of the ring an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tow-head comes out. Does he tear</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an' put the K. O. on the founderin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Iron Jaw ? Does he rush him around</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' hand him the works before he gets</seg><seg type="columnLine">set again?" Oh, no. This baby's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxer an' out to show the world he is.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The big dumb-bell stands there sparrin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a occasional light left to the head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I glims that sick grin on his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">again--an' he makes me mad. Conceit's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Battlin' Beppo</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">5 7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">written all over him. This mangy, cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">respondence-school shadow boxer!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was standin' near the light switch</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' right then I gives Iron Jaw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high sign. He was so groggy I had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash it four times before he catches it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He finally does an' nods. Right away</seg><seg type="columnLine">he begins backin' up again. I see him</seg><seg type="columnLine">cock the old right like a coffin nail an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">I presses the button.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the lights goes on again, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys was throwing water into the tow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head's mug an' stickin' the smellin' salts</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his bugle. Iron Jaw had con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected perfect with that right swing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark. The kid's eyes finally rolls</seg><seg type="columnLine">back an' opens, light blue an' inno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Somebody turned off the lights," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">croaks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, no," I comes right back.

But it got</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, that every time I sees that tow head</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the lights, an' the crowd yellin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Battlin' Beppo</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">61</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I prepares for the worst. That boy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad news from the first gong--for me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Right about when I was gettin' total-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly discouraged, Jimmy Doheny comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from Chi to eliminate the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">other real challenger for the heavy title</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the field. I handled Jimmy when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought in the welter division, an' he</seg><seg type="columnLine">always comes over to Clancy's to see me</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he's in town. Well, he drops in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' 1 ask him to cock an eye on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Battlin' Beppo. The kid's workin' out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Shocker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doheny watches him for about five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, an' don't say nothin'. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turns around to me, serious.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Harry," he tells me, "If I'm ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">champ, I'll make no bones about it. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodge that baby. He's got the goods</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the heels up. Where you been</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidin' him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I ain't," I avers. Then I tells him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sad tale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Lighthead," he breaks in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"there's only so many dumb ones he</seg><seg type="columnLine">can pull. He looks like a sure money</seg><seg type="columnLine">nag to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mister, that puts some hope back in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my system. I keep on workin' with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kid an' prayin'. Then a piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck drops like a bombshell into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp. Big Les Brown, Pacific Coast</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy, is in town an' lookin' for action</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he takes on the latest South</seg><seg type="columnLine">American hope. None of the boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">wants to step it with him because this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown mauler's got a rep for damagin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gent. I runs right down to his man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ager an' dickers till I get a bout for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Battlin' Beppo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After what Jimmy Doheny tells me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know I'm right. The kid's got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">goods, if he can only bring 'em out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For two weeks I works on gettin' Beppo</seg><seg type="columnLine">fightin' mad. I cook up a couple of rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories about what this Les Brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinks of the kid. But it don't do no</seg><seg type="columnLine">good. He jus' smiles that slow grin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE night of the fight comes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1 got the kid all primed up on</seg><seg type="columnLine">what this fight means. Maybe a shot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">among the real heavies. Maybe a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance at the title. Anything to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">him fight. Jus' before we start for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring, I have a note sent in supposed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be from Les Brown. That note ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">very sweet. Beppo reads it, an' looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">up sort of puzzled. I called him about</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything in the book in a few lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that note.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe," he chuckles, "this fella's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tryin' to scare me." But he wasn't even</seg><seg type="columnLine">sore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was lookin' for the worst, after that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the kid opens my eyes for four of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fastest, toughest rounds I ever hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see. Big Les Brown was out to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">it over with as quick as possible. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was big an' fast an' crafty. He shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a couple of swings in the first min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute with "finish" written all over 'em.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Did they bother Beppo? Not one bit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's fightin'.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mister, I almost lost my tonsils them</seg><seg type="columnLine">first four rounds. The kid had every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing an' he was usin' it. Even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspaper men were hurrahin' an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribblin' oft copy fast. He was step-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pin' it like a champ. The kid carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">the battle right through the first. I fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ured he was all shot, but it was Brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was gaspin' after it was over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second canto was Battlin' Beppo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy. He chopped Brown back an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth, an' laced his body till it was pink.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If he'd only got fightin' mad in there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could have finished it right then an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. But all the time, while he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fightin' good, he seems to lack that little</seg><seg type="columnLine">spark. You know--the thing that sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruby Fitz in with that double shift, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing Jim Jeffries used to pull outa the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bag to drop his man, the thing Dempsey</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to uncork in the famous fourth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The third was great. Beppo had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy from the Coast lookin' like a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandbag an' breakin' ground till he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dizzy. The kid shot in a barrage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jabs and hooks that would 'a run a</seg><seg type="columnLine">champ ragged. Then, Les Brown takes</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grip an' slides under a hook, a short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard jolt to Beppo's midriff. He for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets all about the hook from then on*</seg><seg type="columnLine">62</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Even at that, he's crossin' Brown with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty rights an' stickin' that snaky left</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his eye. Brown's viewin' the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one side an' his torso looks like</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's been painted red.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before the fourth, I tells the kid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncork the hooks again. He looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">around at me, shakin' his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Naw, Higgins, you're all wrong.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They're no good. Jus' because that pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looka Dempsey had some luck with 'em.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That pork-an'-beaner--" An' the gong</seg><seg type="columnLine">rings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I didn't get over that crack until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kid wades in an' rattles two rights over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown's heart. The house is screamin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a knockout as they tie up in a clinch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They clinch again--an' again. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">howlin' to the Kid to stand free</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' hit. They lock again an' the Kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't seem in any great hurry to</seg><seg type="columnLine">break.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, the story comes out after it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. It was this way. so Beppo tells</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, In them clinches, Brown hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a sweet sob story. His little wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">is down at the ringside. He don't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to see him knocked out. Jus' hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">oft till this round is over. Then he'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have her sent out. Do T need to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you that big hick fell for it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The way he began pullin' his punches</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a crime. He don't rush Brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard now an' he has him twice on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ropes an' let's him away. I'm tearin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hair an' wonderin' what's wrong.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ten seconds to go. 1 see Brown's glove</seg><seg type="columnLine">come up an' wave to some one down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ringside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His wife, the Kid figured. He stole</seg><seg type="columnLine">jus' a glance. Brown was set. He took</seg><seg type="columnLine">jus' one shot, with that dynamite left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Curtains! Battlin' Beppo never saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mister Brown's wife, an' Les was grin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nin' in the center of the ring with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand up when the kid wakes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah, he fooled me,'' the Kid ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mits after the battle, with that slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">grin. "But Tunney won't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No." I groans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he assents. ''That ham I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixed it with tonight ain't any good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He pulled a nifty. Now them guys at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top ain't much better--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     The Frame-up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY say a rollin' stone gathers no</seg><seg type="columnLine">moss. But I always figured that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gent that wrote that nifty must 'a' lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a country where grass didn't grow on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hillside. Anyway, along about that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, the pickings were gettin' pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin in the big burg. All the boys in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">stable had strutted their stuff in every</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight club around an' they couldn't draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more laughs from the fans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Iron Jaw was gettin' so he jus' stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' swung. The Shocker was hittin</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabarets hard an' I figures maybe a</seg><seg type="columnLine">change of scene will help him. As for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Battlin' Beppo, the fight boys had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">number. They didn't want to see him</seg><seg type="columnLine">any more, if they had to pay. So I let</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other has-beens out an' hit the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">with these three.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First stop was Fhillv an' we was</seg><seg type="columnLine">swingin' west from there. The Kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps ten with Pete Dono an' gets a draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">after havin' the fight tied up in the fifth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From then on, he elects to slug with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby hippo outweighin' him forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds. It didn't do him no good. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buffalo he meets the local favorite an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">tries to jab his way to victory against a</seg><seg type="columnLine">guv who specialized in imitatin' a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow. On the train out of Buffalo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he explains this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, Higgins," he broke out in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoker. ''I can't help wantin' to jab.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I got a good one. Pretty an' fast, ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">she? Jus'like a champion. Yeah, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it comes to the jab, it's me an' Tunney.M</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah," I submits, lightin' a cigar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He'd be good, if he was a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster," the Kid admits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a backwoods town called Carlton</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sticks of Illinois. I tries a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. I figures if I could get the Kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind mad, he'd be too crazy to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">Battlin' Beppo</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">63</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">any bonehead plays. For the last six</seg><seg type="columnLine">months, I been tryin' to get him seein'</seg><seg type="columnLine">red, an' it ain't worked. He's too good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natured. But at Carlton, I digs up some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the local applejack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I knew the Kid would raise a howl</seg><seg type="columnLine">about drinkin', so I feed jus' enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him before the bout, callin' it "iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonic." It hits him plenty, an' he's even</seg><seg type="columnLine">rollin' a bad eye at me when we starts</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It works fine. He lays the other boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with a one-two an' looks around for</seg><seg type="columnLine">more worlds to conquer. His glazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes light on the ref an' he uncorks a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hook with ''morgue" tagged all over it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ref forgets to duck an' we leaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">that burg with our coat-tails stiff in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From then on it's a losin' game. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">work everything I can think of or ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of on the Kid. Nothin' takes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's good-natured an' he's dumb. An'</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's enough. In Chi, I tell him to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a runnin' fight of it with Slug Herberts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a South Side pug. The Kid backpedals</seg><seg type="columnLine">for eight innings, shootin' a straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">right an' hookin' heavy with his left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's got the guy dizzy an' fought out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the seventh. A couple of stiff kidney</seg><seg type="columnLine">punches sets the stage for the fade-out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the eighth an' Battlin' Beppo still</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaks ground. I give up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In Detroit, I don't sign him on with</seg><seg type="columnLine">anybody. He sits on the sidelines an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">tells me how the war should have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">run when it's over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now if Iron Jaw had let that baby</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry the fight in the seventh he'd a'</seg><seg type="columnLine">had something left for the last," he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fides in me, innocent-like. "The champs</seg><seg type="columnLine">all do that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," I says. "Iron Jaw's won</seg><seg type="columnLine">more scraps than you lost." I adds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes. But you'll have to admit</seg><seg type="columnLine">that bozo's never go'n' to make a cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pion," he comes back, blue eyes serious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lotta guys I know ain't," I guess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right," he nods. "Now this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slug Herberts I took on in Chi. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">fella was lousy. You could hit him witli</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything.

We blew intot</seg><seg type="columnLine">St. Louis an' met a load of hard-luck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rain an' a bad house. Iron Jaw slips</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the ropes an' breaks a leg. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shocker meets up with a couple of molls</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew in New York an' goes out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one party he never comes back from.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There I was, Harry Higgins, the slick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est fight manager in the game, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">no-good, hit-an'-miss pug on my hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, I signs Battlin' Beppo on for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen-round slug-fest with some black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">smith down in a burg people forgot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We blew in an' the fight blew up. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">local peanut promotors got cold feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Me an' the Battler climbed onto a train</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' got run off two stations up the line</seg><seg type="columnLine">because we had no more tare.

When I comes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">check back, it seems like all my hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck began when I signed on the Kid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An' he hasn't helped any. Well, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogs it down the main street of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">joint an' pull§ in at the local hotel. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggage gets us in, but the dinin' room</seg><seg type="columnLine">is separate an' run on a cash basis.

Yes, it's true they banned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight in several states. No, they couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the Battler work out. Not for sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral days, anyway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gets rid of them gents an' dashes</seg><seg type="columnLine">off to Avire Porky Howard who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">walkin' the streets in Chi when we went</seg><seg type="columnLine">through. He's a old-time ham-an'-egg</seg><seg type="columnLine">pug on his heels. But he can make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Battler step an' keep up the appearances</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a real trainin' camp. Porky arrives</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the afternoon train an', over a meal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I give him the lowdown.

Couple of days later an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other drops in an' I spot him as Jacobs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the expert dopester of the bunch. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">goes home an' tells how he thinks he</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognizes the Battler as a gent he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a bout at the Weepah goldfields last</seg><seg type="columnLine">year. He then presents us with a rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ord that sounds like wholesale murder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything seems to be breakin' right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't tell Spud I ain't put the Kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise.

But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't dare let the Kid in on the game.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An' I figure it's safe anyway.

I'll send him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in with orders to back-pedal an' box like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fool. That guy, nor no other, can buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fates, an' previous records prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">they got his name on the wrong side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the book.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Kid's talkin' all the time now</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the big fights.

One</seg><seg type="columnLine">day he springs this one:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Porky tells me the champ ain't had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fight this year. An' lie's puttin' on</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight. Believe me, Harry, you'll never</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch me doin' that." Or, "You notice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harry, I ain't on my toes so much now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">None of the big boys does that in train-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in'." Somehow, that makes me mad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WELL, things runs along so good I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't believe I'm alive. Spud lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a referee from among the Tiger's</seg><seg type="columnLine">handlers. That's good insurance against</seg><seg type="columnLine">a break. The mayor's tickled silly when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spud offers to let him be official an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nouncer. The local Board of Commerce</seg><seg type="columnLine">puts up the ring an' rigs a good lightin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant over it. Everythin's smooth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That is. it is until the day I slip over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Tiger's camp for an hour. Spud</seg><seg type="columnLine">wants to fix the details. Porky promises</seg><seg type="columnLine">to herd off the newsmen! they're pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick around there now. While I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">talkin' with Spud. I happen to look over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Tiger. He ain't been takin' his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Battlin' Beppo</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">trainin' seriously, anyway, an' he looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">shabby, an' slow an' sort of careless. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">notices he misses a punch occasional an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">his boys are handlin' him light. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">say nothin' to Spud but, when I get</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, I watch the Kid closer'n ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mister, I'll admit the Kid always</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked good in the gym. But this out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">door stuff seems to have done some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to him. He admits he came from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a burg like this, anyway. Maybe it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">that home feelin'. Anyway, he's plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean an' vicious, steppin' around with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fast-movin' Porky. That little boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">can hit some himself an' I almost keels</seg><seg type="columnLine">over when I see the Kid drop his guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' let Porky tear in wild.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> J think this over. The Battler always</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked good. But he looks better now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An' when he moves sometimes, he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds you of the way a scared fish darts</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the water. Fast an' easy. Also--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">see a snarl breakin' out every once an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">awhile. That ain't good. If he gets</seg><seg type="columnLine">fightin' mad--where'll I be? He. might</seg><seg type="columnLine">do anything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 always thought that, anyway. May-</seg><seg type="columnLine">be that's why I held on to him so long.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The way those clean-cut, straight limbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">snap about puts a chill in my heart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also, the Kid's gettin' bigger. He seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have spread some an' put on weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the barrel. Not fat, either. No. that</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of beef that' ripples like coils of</seg><seg type="columnLine">burnished copper--mean an' wicked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I don't sleep well on it, either. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next day, relief sails into port. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">news crowd, standin' back of a rope I</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigged up about twenty yards from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring, is jabberin' an' lookin'. Then one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 'em catches my eye an' I spots him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Charley Forbes, the old heavy who</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to knock 'em galley-west at Shar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">key's Club. I go down an' give him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad hand, stung with a bright idea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He's coverin' it for some sport sheet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Detroit. I asks him how he'd like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a real story about how the Battler</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt to him. He don't get me at first.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I explains: I mean for him to climb in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' mix it with the Kid. Now Charley</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't never quite got that fever for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">feel of a punch outa his system. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 'em never do; that's why they keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">coinin' back till they lock 'em up in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">padded cell. An! he's one of them guys</seg><seg type="columnLine">that always keeps in training. Also, he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">written "detour" on more up-an'-comers</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any other leather-pusher in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He falls for the idea. It don't take</seg><seg type="columnLine">no time to slip him into a pair of trunks</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' introduce him to the Kid. We run</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the rest of the news gang an' they</seg><seg type="columnLine">go at it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three rounds an' fast. Charley's step-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pin' to knock him, if he can. The Kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks good, awful good. Then Charley</seg><seg type="columnLine">paws him in the eye--shoots a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rabbit punches in the clinches--cracks</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with a backhand shot. He even</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarls at the Kid. The Battler steps fast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he don't get mad; jus' keeps a-grin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nin' an' inovin'. Three times he has an</seg><seg type="columnLine">openin'. Charley leaves 'em a-purpose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But something seems to tie the Kid up</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' he can't drop him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Charley tells me the lowdown while</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's gettin' back into his clothes. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">good, but he lacks the knockout wallop.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't seem to have the fire. No, he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">never trouble a real champ.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That makes me feel good. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charley leaves, I ponder it some.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strange. Maybe it's the excitement or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tenseness of a real bout that ties him</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, makes him do the wrong thing, holds</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from flashin' over when the time's</seg><seg type="columnLine">right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, I been workin' on that problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a year now, an' I know it's useless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I aim to give the kid the gate after this</seg><seg type="columnLine">bout, anyway.

Then he goes around</seg><seg type="columnLine">bobbin' to the crowd. The mayor does</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stuff.

It sounded like a crownin' wal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lop an' the crowd went mad. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tiger was playin' his game. Twice more</seg><seg type="columnLine">he connects in the midriff, but light, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 'em pulled. The Kid chops his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mister, the Battler was beautiful that</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, like a big, oiled piston.

It's true that Heeney didn't display any</seg><seg type="columnLine">knockout punch. It's also true that he isn't blooming with that elusive box-office</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It" called "color."

One</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Frederico Calles, present holder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the title, a Filipino. The other was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Young Dave Burdett, the challenger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose skin was like that of a baby, hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">combed back like that of a drugstore</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowboy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hit with one arm free!

He'd mixed it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot of chaps in his time, until that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatal evening when, an amateur after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, he was inveigled into a battle with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a professional mauler.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just a kid, then, a kid who was known</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his first name to every man who saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scrap.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he didn't let Gillis drop. He kept him</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his feet, fooled the crowd through-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, and battered and mauled him for</seg><seg type="columnLine">five additional rounds. His hands had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been too heavy to lift. He couldn't fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. The pro didn't hurt him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too numb.

Even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man he had been asked to fight thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">so. He taunted Giilis with fear, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gillis took him out in the woods, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a few friends looking on, and gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a trouncing he would never forget.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watch this baby, Gillis!

But Burdett was a cagy</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrapper. He sank his fist into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach of the Filipino, and the Filipino</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back on his heels, hands dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his stomach. Burdett flew at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was knocked flat on his back by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple which came so fast even Gillis</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost missed 'em.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burdett bounced up without a count,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blood dripped from his lips to dye</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chin.

He rocked his head from side to</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, lowered his own head, and fairlv</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted Burdett to his toes with savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">uppercuts to the short-ribs. Burdett</seg><seg type="columnLine">went through the ropes, doubled up like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a jack-knife, hanging by his knees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Calles came back and Burdett was</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, inside the ring again, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gillis could count.</seg><seg type="columnLine">74</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Make 'em fight!

Benson crawled through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ropes, strode to Gillis, felt of his taped</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands.

He'd al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready taken the best Gillis could send.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He snarled, bored in. He rocked Gillis</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his heels with a one-two that Gillis</seg><seg type="columnLine">could neither duck nor block. Gillis</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to clinch. Benson smashed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose, filled the evening with dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars, pounded Gillis to his knees with</seg><seg type="columnLine">murderous rights and lefts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gillis staggered into a clinch.

He made little attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover now, nor did Benson. Both were</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood-spattered, fighting furies as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell signaled the end of the first rouncL</seg><seg type="columnLine">They circled warily for a few sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onds to begin the second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get him, Gillis!

Thought he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid. Maybe he was, but he'd con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quer his fear if it was the last thing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth he did.

Benson stepped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">back, measuring his man.

He made a break for the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Maxon caught his arm and swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">him back, laughing harshly. Spike Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan looked up into the redhead's terror-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken face and what he saw there</seg><seg type="columnLine">areused his sympathy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aw, say, boss, I don't think--" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course you don't think. Dugan,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon interrupted him angrily. "You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a sap. Come on, bo. Do your</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff." Maxon spun the Kid around,</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed a hand in the small of his back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and propelled him out on the floor. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">next thing the redhead knew something</seg><seg type="columnLine">thudded lightly on his mouth and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips went numb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Kid was worse than frightened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was downright scared. His fear was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so obvious that Rivers had little taste</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his work and danced around lightly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jabbing away with his left until the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">thatch bobbed like a cork, but pulling</seg><seg type="columnLine">his punches steadily until Maxon let out</seg><seg type="columnLine">a roar:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get in there, Rivers!" he yelled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is a fight, not a fox-trot. Quit</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing and sock. Make him take it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So Rivers opened up. He slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">both hands to the Kid's lean stomach in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lightning succession of trip-hammer</seg><seg type="columnLine">punches and, as the redhead, mouth open</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gasping, doubled over with both</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands across his midriff, Rivers hooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vicious right, swinging his whole body</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind it. There was a sodden thud as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leathern knuckles smote the Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known Kid fairly on the jaw and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down in a heap, dizzy, puzzled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to figure out in his punch-addled</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain just what had happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an instant he sprawled there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then something stirred under his fiery</seg><seg type="columnLine">mop. A blind, unreasoning wave of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hot anger swept over him. He leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet, forgetting fear, forgetting</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain, intent only on annihilating that</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark, scowling figure of torment before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What followed was highly unortho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dox and, therefore, doubly amazing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rivers, smiling coolly, stepped in to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Kid, but his smile vanished in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath. He found himself entangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a brick-topped cyclone, fighting as</seg><seg type="columnLine">no self-respecting boxer would fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Kid's head was hunched, turtle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like. between upraised shoulders. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous hands on the ends of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">long arms were flying like thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">sledges. And they were not swinging.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were shooting straight ahead like</seg><seg type="columnLine">twin pistons in lunging, irresistible</seg><seg type="columnLine">drives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The redhead was upon his quarry be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore Rivers could sidestep or duck. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Battler threw up a guarding left, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was brushed aside like a straw and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge fist, catching him high on the fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, threw him off balance. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavered another crashed through and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he staggered back, feeling as if his chest</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall were crumpled. Then he was en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped in a rain of blows and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, badly hurt, his eyes slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">glazed, his breath coming in labored</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dragged himself to his knees to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the redhead looming over him, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his queer, turtle-like posture, his blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes aflame, his mop of red hair bris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tling. He heard Maxon's shouts:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get up there, Rivers! Box with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Stand him off and cut him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces. Flatten him for that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still kneeling, Rivers shook his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">to banish the mists. He inhaled deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a moment his eyes were clear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was on his feet, dancing away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the redhead, who broke'into pursuit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT this time there was a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">story. Rivers beat the Kid to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">punch and the old fear welled up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">redhead's breast. He retreated, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaping, bobbing form appeared every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Unknown Kid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">97</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">where and leaden, merciless punches</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught him at every turn. Twice he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell, blinded, helpless, and when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged himself to his feet for the sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond time he was begging abjectly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't, don't," he moaned, covering</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face. Rivers stared, then dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands and, with a muttered "Yella!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalked across the floor, pulling off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloves. In an instant Spike was at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unknown Kid's side, leading him to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">water pail, dousing his battered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleeding face and murmuring crude con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dolences in his ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And watching the gasping, blubbering</seg><seg type="columnLine">redhead through eyes that were mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">slits. Jim Maxon was hatching a colos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sal take. The thing had been born in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked brain as the Kid launched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">furious offensive. For a flash the scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been blotted out and Maxon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">back at another ringside, under a broil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sun, with 30,000 screaming, shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing fans in a delirious uproar as a red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed. freckle-faced giant battered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed down a heavyweight champion</seg><seg type="columnLine">to enthrone himself as the most beloved</seg><seg type="columnLine">idol in ring history.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well did Maxon remember the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">procession that always wended its way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ringside when Red Bob fought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was Mrs. Bob, wearing her trim</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue jersey, and so small she could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped under her big husband's arm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Always Mrs. Bob walked to the ring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand in hand with Red Bob. And on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Red Bob's shoulder rode a tiny carbon</seg><seg type="columnLine">copy of the fighter. Little Bob was</seg><seg type="columnLine">four years old when his father became</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion and for two years he had rid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den to the ringside for every fight. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny mite had been born with a birth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark--a clean-cut boxing glove of red</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the palm of his little hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Little Bob and his mark became a by-</seg><seg type="columnLine">word among fight fans and his father</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mother were completely wrapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day after the big fight the blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell. Little Bob disappeared. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was talk of kidnaping, but no trace was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever found. Red Bob hung up his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> P.--June--9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gloves. He never wore them again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Somewhere out West the broken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearted champion and his wife bought</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ranch and retired to it. Their friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw them no more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was the story that flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Maxon's mind as the Kid ripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and battered Rivers for one inspired in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant. It was in just that fashion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Red Bob had waded through the tough-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est field of heavyweights in the world's</seg><seg type="columnLine">history. Xo one had ever fought that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way before or since.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now this tramp, for just a flash,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had duplicated the old master's famous</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouching, lunging, furious attack. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready the scheme was taking shape in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon's fertile brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In half a dozen strides Maxon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the floor and at the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kid, lying sprawled out. his breath com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in jerks, while Spike rubbed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaving stomach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rip off that right glove, Dugan,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon commanded, and, as Spike</seg><seg type="columnLine">obeyed, Maxon bent over, caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge, naturally-doubled list, pried open</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ringers and examined the palm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No callouses there," he grunted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Typical tramp. I'll bet he never</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked a day in his life. 'Doc' ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be able to fix that up in short order."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, to Spike:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fix him up and put him to bed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the bunks, Dugan. Then come</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the house; I want to talk to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scheme which Maxon unfolded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little trainer made him gasp, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">protests only angered his chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind the 'buts'," Maxon</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">summoned the redhead into the farm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, uncurled the clenched fingers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ham-like right hand, grunted satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faction and waved him out without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's all set," he confided to Spike</seg><seg type="columnLine">later. "Rivers is boxing Babe Barry at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Arena a week from tonight.

The crafty manager had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused to tell who the Unknown Kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. He had refused to discuss him</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all.

They whisked a towel over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders, a sweater over that, a bath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">robe over all and before any one real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized what was happening the Kid, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his trunks, was in a car with Spike</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was hurried away from the club.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day saw the beginning of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke-up that was a monument to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cunning of Maxon. With boxing</seg><seg type="columnLine">writers talking of the reincarnation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Red Bob and fight circles agog,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon became suddenly inaccessible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scribes he usually sought out him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. For two days they speculated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They re-hashed the story of Red Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Little Bob, they told of the kidnap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping and the champion's retirement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Maxon allowed himself to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">cornered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What, that bum?

Go out and talk to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourselves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They did. They descended upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">training camp and found Spike as un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">communicative as Maxon.

The discovery of Little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob, given up for dead, unwittingly fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing in his father's footsteps, attained</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant fame as the greatest of all sport</seg><seg type="columnLine">romances. Photographers invaded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp. Old pictures of Red Bob were</seg><seg type="columnLine">raked from dusty files and, if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to show sufficient resemblance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthusiastically wielded air brushes sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied the deficiency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Overnight the Unknown Kid stumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinkingly into the limelight. Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon grinned knowingly but said</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Read the papers. They seem to -</seg><seg type="columnLine">know more about him than I do," was</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stock retort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If you don't think your hard-boiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight fan is foolishly sentimental, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sider the eases of Georges Carpentier</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Luis Firpo. Consider what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplished on a capital that was nine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenths "color" and one-tenth ability. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on this generous gullibility that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon played and things came his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Offers flooded him, but he scanned</seg><seg type="columnLine">all proposed opponents warily. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">one with a real punch was turned down</seg><seg type="columnLine">without hesitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the chance he had been seek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing came and the Unknown Kid--still</seg><seg type="columnLine">billed as such--climbed into the ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Lefty Moore in his second fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moore, the logical contender for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavyweight championship, was a phe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomenally cievcr boxer, but a woefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">weak hitter and not too robust in ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorbing punishment. His skill had put</seg><seg type="columnLine">him above the ruck and kept him there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Maxon reasoned that the Kid's first</seg><seg type="columnLine">flurry of rage would brush aside Moore's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">powder-puff punches and crush him</seg><seg type="columnLine">down before the boxer had a chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get started. If Moore weathered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first storm and slipped over a smart cuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two, the Kid would fold up. Maxon</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew all this and he staked the success</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his whole scheme on the fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pie won in the first round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the Unknown Kid was rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ring, his fatal weakness still</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden, while a frantic crowd swarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aisles, shouting and cheering for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Little Bob and fighting to grasp his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">or pat him on the back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so the stage was set for Maxon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">big coup. Instantly lie accepted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first offer of a tilt with Marty Johnson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the title-holder. He knew it was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the little comedy. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clumsy, timid Unknown Kid had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest chance of lasting more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a round or two. He knew the redhead</seg><seg type="columnLine">would quit--if not actually knocked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the first time Johnson connected with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of those pole-axing rights, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had nothing to fear for himself, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter how miserably the Kid might</seg><seg type="columnLine">perform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never once had Maxon mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Unknown Kid except to deride him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If people chose to think that he, Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon, was lying, that was their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard luck. And his bets--those juicy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure-thing bets on Johnson--would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep under cover. He'd see to that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the red barn preparations for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big fight went forward busily. Like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trojan Spike worked with his protege,</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepping him for the slaughter, and al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways hoping that he might show that</seg><seg type="columnLine">vital spark of gameness that would en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able him to go down in a fighting finish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His hopes were fruitless and when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">piloted the Unknown Kid through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge Coliseum to the ring he knew he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bringing out a rank quitter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He grinned as he and Maxon fussed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over their man while the throng cheered</seg><seg type="columnLine">deafeningly, but his heart was sick. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, resting lightly on the redhead's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, detected a telltale quivering</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a new roar of cheers heralded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">100</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of Johnson. He felt a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinct flinch and noticed that the Kid's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips were trembling as the champion</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopped lightly through the ropes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped coolly to his stool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spike steered his sacrificial offering</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the formalities. Then he and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maxon slipped from the ring. He caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flashing glimpse of the Unknown Kid's</seg><seg type="columnLine">white face as he went and he could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangled Maxon, who crouched beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. wearing his professional mask of</seg><seg type="columnLine">indifference.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN the bell! The "fight" was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on and it was a pitiful spectacle to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spike, who knew what was happening</seg><seg type="columnLine">up there in the white light that bathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring. Mechanically the Kid went</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the motions Spike had taught</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. This time there was no stinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack to lash the redhead into fury.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnson, sparring carefully, was feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his man out. A look of bewilder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment spread over his face. He ccased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">frown. He boxed carefully a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer, then he smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Deliberately and with perfect timing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the champion feinted with his left, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooked his right at this ridiculous, shuf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fling figure. The Kid staggered back on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heels, then backed off. Like a sure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">footed tiger Johnson flew after him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unleased a terrific, leaping right smash.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In his flying onslaught he misjudged</seg><seg type="columnLine">his distance and the punch glanced harm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly off the top of the thick red</seg><seg type="columnLine">poll.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a howl went up that rocked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof. The Unknown Kid was down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had slipped to the floor almost be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the glancing blow landed and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying there, still and quiet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was all so pitifully obvious that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd was up on the seats, booing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming, ''Quitter!" The referee bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">over as he swung his arm in the count</seg><seg type="columnLine">and barked sharply at the recumbent</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure. Under his verbal prodding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kid dragged himself reluctantly erect</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the count of eight. A vicious upper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut ripped through his half-hearted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">guard and again he slumped to the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as the bell ended the round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hauled to his corner, the redhead</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleaded for mercy. "I'm done," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wailed. " 'At guy'll kill me if I go out</seg><seg type="columnLine">there again. Lemme go. please. He'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill me, I tell ya. He'll kill me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, it was no part of Jim Maxon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme to have the Kid quit in his cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner. Things like that cause held-up</seg><seg type="columnLine">purses, gossip, investigations and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpleasant things. So Maxon talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Dutch" to the Kid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen to me, you big stiff!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grated into the redhead's ear, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time raising the Kid's water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle significantly into view. "Do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">see this bottle? Well, I'm going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave your yellow skull in with it if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't go out there when the bell rings</seg><seg type="columnLine">and take your medicine. Stick out your</seg><seg type="columnLine">chin and stop one. rhe sooner the better.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But you can't dog it in your corner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snap into it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Unknown Kid did as he was bid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den. Slowly, uncertainly, he advanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his corner for the second round to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be met by the dark-browed champion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaping across the ring to end the farce.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Contemptuously the title-holder jabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rapier left in half a dozen lightning</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabs to the mouth and blood spurted</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Kid's lips to trickle down his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chin. He was looking for his chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop and as a looping punch thudded</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his heart he folded his knees clum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sily and went down on his face, quit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting cold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was just at this point when, ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cording to Maxon's scenario, the farce</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have ended, that two new actors</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped in. Unnoticed in the din, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge old man, stoop-shouldered but</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerfully built, had upreared his bulk</seg><seg type="columnLine">from an isle seat and started for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A broad-brimmed black hat was</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammed down on his head and his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand clutched an umbrella by the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the knuckles showed white through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  His left hand was closed over the tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Unknown Kid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">101</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hand of a sweet-faced little old lady who</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked beside him, so tiny she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have stepped under his out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched arm without ducking her</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonneted head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The couple reached the ringside just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Unknown Kid took his final</seg><seg type="columnLine">"flop,1'' just as the referee started his</seg><seg type="columnLine">toll. For an instant the big man's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept over the ring, then he reached up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and out with the handle of his umbrella</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tapped smartly and steadily on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In one buzzing ear of the redhead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flattened down against the mat, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">that imperative rapping, strumming hol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowly on the raised planking like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounded drum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "--three--four--five--" droned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">referee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly the Kid rolled over and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-closed eye fell upon the leonine</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and shoulders of the tapper, rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the edge of the ring. The big</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's blue eyes were pinpoints of glint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing steel. His face wore an angry flush.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he spoke in a booming, big voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">that carried clearly to the redhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Boy," he thundered, leveling his um-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brella at the Kid, "get up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 '--seven--eigh t--n i ne--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Unknown Kid came up from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. Why he did it he didn't know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he scrambled to his feet in the nick</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time and swung apprehensively</seg><seg type="columnLine">around to meet the next assault. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in a leaping, bobbing, slashing at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack and the redhead began to wilt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">From somewhere behind him he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard that booming voice again:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fight, boy, fight!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A nasty left hook, barely falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">short, scraped agonizingly across his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. From deep down in the breast a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot tide surged up, engulfing him in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">insane fury. With a perceptible jerk</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head dropped down, turtle-fashion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bis shoulders hunched up into a protec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive cradle, his body swayed forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and launched out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For just a breath that eternally</seg><seg type="columnLine">booming voice goaded him on, then it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was drowned in a vast roar, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd sensed the drama taking place</seg><seg type="columnLine">there at the ring. The supposed Little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bob was fighting agaii. and old Red Bob,</seg><seg type="columnLine">miraculously appearing out of thin air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was tongue-lashing him into a brick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">topped hurricane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And like a hurricane the Unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kid went after the champion, driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">those crushing, piston punches. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first caught Johnson on the right shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der and spun him like a top. The second</seg><seg type="columnLine">thudded solidly, checking the title-holder</seg><seg type="columnLine">in midspin and sending him headlong</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the ring to slide to a stop with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head hanging over the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time it was Johnson who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved by the end of the round. Gasping</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his wide-opened mouth, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion caught at the ropes, hauied</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to a swaying, upright position,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then staggered to his corner as the bell</seg><seg type="columnLine">pealed a life-saving clang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind him the referee and a yelling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">joyous Spike grabbed the raging red-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head by the arms and dragged him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">kicking and struggling to his corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now Maxon, his face livid, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaping into the ring, elbowed Spike</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside and, pulling a bottle of smelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">salts from his hip pocket, swung it</seg><seg type="columnLine">briskly upward, ostensibly to give the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kid an inhalation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a flash, Spike acted.

A terrible right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight from the shoulder, crashed full</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Johnson's face and he was cata-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulted stiffly against the ropes. The taut</seg><seg type="columnLine">strands tossed him back in a rebound</seg><seg type="columnLine">to meet a pile-driving left squarely on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point of the chin and, like a limp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloth figure, he collapsed in a heap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no need for a count. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAXON went up the stairs two at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time. He had confirmed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad news.

It was not in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature of the man to take his loss si-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lently. He was out to square accounts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bursting into the crowded dressing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, he pushed and shoved his way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chair where the Unknown Kid sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinning happily.

After a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay-off of several months he goes into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strenuous competition, in which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">carries along after his heart has warned</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to stop.

Perhaps it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not so very long after your luncheon</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you went into the game, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart had not gotten a sufficient amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rest after going through the rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">arduous task of helping in the process</seg><seg type="columnLine">of digestion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At any rate, if you would apply the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart exercise creed that I have out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lined above you would avoid any such</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpleasantness.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were manned by ambitious directors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">chafing at the limitations of time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time Peter had passed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretentious rows of residences that</seg><seg type="columnLine">line Santa Ricoro Boulevard a mile be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond Film City's limits. Their scramble</seg><seg type="columnLine">of architecture had merged into frankly</seg><seg type="columnLine">utilitarian buildings -- the hangar-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">factories of canned drama. As a future</seg><seg type="columnLine">worker in this environment the cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pion looked about with interest. A sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">on one of the buildings informed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was the business office of Immor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal Players, Inc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moving-picture cow-puncher ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rayed in the conspicuous habiliments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his calling lounged on the steps, rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brown-paper cigarette with the fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his left hand. He looked up--recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized Anson from the pictures he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen in the papers--and nodded, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">abashed, as some fight fans are by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proixmity of greatness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Hello, Peter." he grunted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello.

"Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yes, he's the president of the company,</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't he? What sort of a chap is he?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You don't know him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. I have never had the pleasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of meeting Mr. Gribble."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cow-puncher blew a smoke ling</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air, and watched it shred out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sunshine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gee, but you're lucky!" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JOHNNY H ALLAH AN, director-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in-chief of Immortal Players, Inc.,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoved the advertising section of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Film City Gazette across his desk into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the damp, pudgy hands of President</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leslie Gribble. The latter adjusted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses to the bridge of his fleshy nose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and read the item his editor pointed out:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wanted: An Englishman, six foot tall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">over one hundred and eighty pounds.

The ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ecutives ignored them, and rushed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door where Peter stood. Their greet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was rather stickily effusive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hallahan explained why the men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting, and intimated that he waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the champion's approval before pick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one of them out. Gribble's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were roving about the waiting-room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and settled on a big, red-faced chap</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rather prominent teeth . . . Gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner Brown, he knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You!" he said sharply.

Why, yes, he was the brother</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that chap who had been abusing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl at the boarding-house. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no use holding that against</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The fellow probably needed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">job.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh. I guess he'll do," said Peter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He looks to be in top-notch physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape. Do you want to work with me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Curran ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Englishman gave him an evil</seg><seg type="columnLine">110</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">glance, then dropped his eyes. "Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir," he said sullenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TWO hours later a number of big</seg><seg type="columnLine">touring cars hummed swiftly out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foothill road. They contained the ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors who were to participate in the pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, for Johnny Hallahan did not intend</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the time should be wasted. Anson</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it peculiar that they were going</seg><seg type="columnLine">on location for so long a time, but, ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitting his ignorance of the devious</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways of directors, said nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their headquarters were half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabins deep in the Santa Catalina hills.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The motors took them as far as pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible ; then they continued 011 horseback.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was far enough from human habita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and pernicious newspapers to satisfy</seg><seg type="columnLine">even Leslie Gribble. There were to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">no messengers between Film City and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the location on which they were work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in order to prevent the slightest in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation from getting to Anson's ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Johnny went to work. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">mapped out a stunt picture that kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">them on their toes--hair-raising runs</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the brush and over boulders;</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggles on the very lip of the canyon;</seg><seg type="columnLine">rescues from the icy waters of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peter Anson thoroughly enjoyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">every moment of it. He had expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to spend a lot of time in the studio,</seg><seg type="columnLine">working under the glare of the Cooper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hewitt lights. Life in the open--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhilaration of strength-building effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and the spice of danger, added a</seg><seg type="columnLine">piquant zest to existence. Time flew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and almost before he knew it the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks were over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The exhausting work had tired out</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of the stunt actors, but it had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">injured Anson in the least. That both-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered Johnny Hallahan. He decided to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage an affair that would send the</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion into the ring in no condition</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a steep path down the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the nearby canyon. Below it a swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain stream hurdled over its rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed, swirling in deep pools, and racing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">over pebbly narrows. Only the soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmur of it came up, mingled with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thresh of willows and the elfin music of</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects. The day before they returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Film City Johnny took the company</seg><seg type="columnLine">out there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Were going to try a run down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the canyon," he said. "Peter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, will be in the lead, fanning old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thunderbolt between the ears with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">butt of his gun. You want an oblique</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle," he added to the camera-man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and shoot low. I don't want much</seg><seg type="columnLine">above his head. When you get to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">point"--indicating a rock marked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">chalk midway down the steep declivity--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Pedro'll rope old Thunderbolt, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring him to a stop. Foi heaven's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sake, get a little life into it! We don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want any make-overs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peter Anson climbed into the saddle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heart beating not a fraction faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">in spite of the narrow and frightfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">steep trail that faced him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ready! Action! Go!" snapped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">director. Anson touched Thunderbolt</seg><seg type="columnLine">W'ith his spurs, and the stunt-pony</seg><seg type="columnLine">started lickety-split down the trail, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the posse pounding behind, yelling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">firing. . Pedro, the little Mexican va~</seg><seg type="columnLine">quero, was in the lead, circling his lariat</seg><seg type="columnLine">above Iiis head. When Peter came</seg><seg type="columnLine">abreast of the marked stone the coil of</seg><seg type="columnLine">braided hair snaked out and dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">around his shoulders. It seemed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion as though a mighty hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached out of nowhere, lifted him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saddle and dashed him to the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sprawling 011 his back in the whirlwind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dust ne saw the other actors sweep</seg><seg type="columnLine">by; then pull up, and ride back as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny yelled "Cut!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peter Anson was bruised from neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">to heels, and his left wrist was begin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning to swell ominously. In his brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience in filmland he had learned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">"take a fall" as trick riders do, but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been so unexpected that he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground all bunched up. Thun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derbolt--not he--was to have been las-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soed. He rose dizzily, spitting out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthful of sand and blood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Framed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">111</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The doctor with the outfit examined</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and found a sprained wrist, in ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition to a score of bruises. Johnny</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hallahan was raving mad--or pretended</seg><seg type="columnLine">most admirably that he was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The dumb greaser!" he shouted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">''I'd like to feed him to the squirrels.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A dozen times I told him that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thunderbolt he was to rope, and every</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he opened that silly mouth of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said, 'Si, senor.' Then he lays you</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. Fortunately, we're just about fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished here, anyway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is fortunate that I haven't any</seg><seg type="columnLine">fights scheduled in the near future,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Peter grimly. "If I had I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be an ex-champion sure as shooting--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I can't afford to lose the title yet a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The director averted his eyes. "Yes,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it is lucky," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHILE Peter Anson was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Santa Catalina hills on location,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gribble carried out every detail of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan. An arena that seated some ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand people was built on the "lot"</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Immortal Players, Inc., and on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day of the fight it was packed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweating, enthusiastic fight fans. Anson</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the favorite, of course, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flood of cash that appeared to back</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunner Brown sliced the odds from two</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one to even money. That, in itself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused hectic interest. Something was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gribble prowled around, uneasy as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet cat. His fat face had lost its</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonted color, and there were moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">when his hands trembled with nervous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. He felt morally certain of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outcome, but it was his spineless nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">to worry over every chance he took. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other hand, Hallahan was as cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">and debonair as if only a trifle hinged</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the result.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're sure everything is all right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny?" Gribble asked for the twen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tieth time. "If anything goes wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll be wiped out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The director puffed calmly at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigarette. "So will I--but nothing can</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">go wrong. Gunner Brown is a fighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">who can give Anson the battle of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, even if Peter was in pcrfect shape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just now our champion is in better con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition for the hospital than the ring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You've seen Brown training. Besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has a grudge against Anson. Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Gunner's brother had a scrap</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning we left for the hills, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Englishman had all the worst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it--broke his arm, I believe, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peter knocked him down. So the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunner wants to clean Peter for</seg><seg type="columnLine">purely personal reasons. Nothing can</seg><seg type="columnLine">go wrong."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anson drove up to the arena in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gribble's limousine. His wrist was</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily bandaged and taped, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">badiy bruised left arm was wrapped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloth. He had suggested that the box-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing scene be held up for a day or two.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ilallahan countered with the plea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">financial necessity. The company was</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboring under difficulties, and it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain them to keep the enormous mob</seg><seg type="columnLine">of extra people any longer than was</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely necessary. He pointed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the boxing scene would be no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a mild workout, anyway. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peter, always good natured, agreed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he paused outside the arena.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The immensity of it, the enthusiasm of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mob puzzled him, and then, in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant, he understood that he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">framed. Inside the stadium an op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponent was waiting for him ... a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good one, 110 doubt . . . Gunner</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peter Anson's lips tightened. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had promised not to fight that fellow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It would take the biggest sort of moral</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage to stand by his word in the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that crowd--but if Gunner Brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his opponent he would not fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marigold held his promise. Only she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could release him from it, and she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">three thousand miles away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny Hallahan came to the doo:* of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the limousine, but he did not look di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectly at the champion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who is this fellow I am to fight?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Peter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">112</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You picked him out yourself.

I can see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this isn't a moving-picture but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage setting for a real fight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, feeling absolutely confident of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outcome, and knowing that it was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few minutes until Peter would find</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the truth, anyway, the director told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him everything that had happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''You're going to box Gunner</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown," he finished, "Gribble has your</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed contract, and if you welsh now</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll never fight again.

"I promised not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight Gunner Brown--and I'm not</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to/"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such a contingency had never oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curred to Johnny Hallahan. He threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened. He pointed out that Anson would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be. irrevocably ruined if he refused.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peter realized the truth of the assertion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his promise to Marigold was a bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rier that he refused to hurdle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that intensely interesting mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment the moving-picture cow-puncher</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom Anson had first seen on the steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Johnny Hallahan's office, rushed up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweating profusely and out of breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've been chasm' you around like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">locoed cay use," he panted. "Here's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">telegram marked urgent, important,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush an' all the rest of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Peter tore it open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you get the opportunity to fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunner Brown do it.

"I may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be dumber than a long-horned bull, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	know some things. I listened around,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and heard about this frame-up--an' two</seg><seg type="columnLine">or three other things--so I took the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">liberty o' sending a telegram to Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Havens. You can trim this Gunner-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pcrson. Go in and do it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peter Anson went into the ring, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips thinned into a hard line. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been tricked into .fighting for his title</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he was in better condition for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor than a crucial battle. If he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the canvas for ten seconds it</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant the end of his happy dreams. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't going to lose if brawn and cour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age could beat this mighty champion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">England.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the bell rang for the first round</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peter advanced to the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring. He had mapped out his plan of</seg><seg type="columnLine">combat. Battered as he was, it was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible for him to sustain a long battle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He must end it quickly if at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His opponent circled around him, left</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist pumping in and out. Anson hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself forward, and ripped into Brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a madman. The Englishman cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered up, and retreated. The mob</seg><seg type="columnLine">howled, for Peter was the favorite, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the super-cautious tactics of the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vader delighted them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though able to hit only with his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, Anson made that fist count. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">herded the Gunner into a corner, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">belted away like a madman. The title</seg><seg type="columnLine">was forgotten. He was fighting for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">future--for Marigold's happiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Gunner huddled up his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders, wrapped his arms about his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">and jaw, and sought to weather the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm. As a championship fight it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a farce--not the farce that Gribble and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hallahan had expected--but exactly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverse. The crowd howled its execra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions on the vaunted fighting machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">from England.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The end came twenty seconds from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the round. Brown sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to slip out of the corner and essay a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little footwork. Peter nailed him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a savage hook to the jaw that threw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gunner back on his heels. The Briton's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eves glazed; one arm jerked up in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">futile gesture of defense, then Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught him with a savage blow that sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">him quivering to the floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Framed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">113</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no need for the referee's</seg><seg type="columnLine">count. Had each second been a min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute long Gunner Brown would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been unable to drag himself to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TEN minutes later the moving-pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture cowboy accompanied Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anson into the latter's dressing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't understand it," mused the</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion, caressing his sprained wrist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Gunner should have been able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">trim me under these conditions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cowboy chuckled. "He might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have--but, you see, it wasn't Gunner</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown you fought."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen. I got this story right. Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member the guy you licked at your,</seg><seg type="columnLine">boardin' house the mornin' you re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported to Hallahan? That was Gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner Brown himself, who had followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">you there to keep a line on you. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">busted his wrist when he fell, an' so</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as he was concerned the scrap was</seg><seg type="columnLine">off. But Brother Nat saw a chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean up without hurtin' the Gunner's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting reputation. He took the Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lish champ's place himself. Easy enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't it? Nobody knew 'em, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight was staged too quick for any</seg><seg type="columnLine">European sportsmen to get over. Nat</seg><seg type="columnLine">collected the money--gave the story</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearin' his brother to the newspapers--•</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' hiked for a train East. You're all</seg><seg type="columnLine">set now, Peter-boy. I wired from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringside for Miss Havens to come out</seg><seg type="columnLine">here right away. After you're married</seg><seg type="columnLine">she can tell you that she is sorry for</seg><seg type="columnLine">tryin' to keep her stepb-other from</seg><seg type="columnLine">gettin' trimmed. For that matter, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can take him on when your wrist is</seg><seg type="columnLine">better--an' eat up Ted Richards' quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of a million. Everything's fine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peter admitted that everything was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE OLD MAN IN CLEVELAND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KID BROAD had a rich and exciting career. The Kid wasn't handsome and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't clever, but he could put up a rattling good fight any time. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">matched with a hard hitter one night--oh, an awfully hard hitter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"He belts me one on the jaw in the second round, see?" said the Kid. "Down I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">went, scratching canvas. I rolled over, an' said to meself, 'Get up, Kid, the old</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man in Cleveland '11 read about this in the paper to-morrow.' An' I got up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "In the third he lands another one, and while I'm listenin' to the referee, I said,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'Don't forget the old man in Cleveland.
