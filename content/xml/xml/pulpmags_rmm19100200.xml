col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lector of fares</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Conductor Ayers, under the sobriquet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of " Poppy," later became one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most widely known and popular conduc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors in the history of railroading He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was witty and good-natured, and pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed in a remarkable degree the faculty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of getting 011 pleasantly with every one</seg><seg type="columnLine">with whom he came in contact</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also, he possessed a waist - line that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be inveigled through the narrow'</seg><seg type="columnLine">car-doors only by the exercise of a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal of finesse Poppy was permitted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride behind Engineer Jacob Hamel, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">German, and the first engineer employed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the road Hamel had always looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the genial Poppy with dark suspi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the latter suggested that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be some way for him to commu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nicate with the engine so he could let</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hamel know when to stop to let off a</seg><seg type="columnLine">passenger, or for any other reason, sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picion became at once a certainty that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conductor was seeking to usurp the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rogatives of the engineer Hamel de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided to teach the presumptuous one his</seg><seg type="columnLine">place</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day Poppy had an idea Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curing a stout cord, he ran it from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rear of the train to the framework of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabless engine He tied a stick of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood on the end of the cord, and told</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hamel that when he jerked the stick up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and down, that he--Hamel--was to stop</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hamel growled out something inar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticulate, and as soon as Poppy's back</seg><seg type="columnLine">was turned he cut the stick of wood from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cord and tied the latter to the frame</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the engine Next day the same per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formance was repeated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the third day, Poppy rigged up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick of wood at Piermont, the terminus</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the road, and told Hamel that if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut the cord again, or ignored his efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">to signal him, he would thrash him when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he got to Goshen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the train reached Goshen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal-stick was gone and the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord was trailing in the dirt Poppy</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked forward to the engine and, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out uttering a word, took off coat, vest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hat, loosened his ample collar, rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his sleeves, took a reef in his belt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yanked Hamel off the engine, and sailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was as pretty a set-to as the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">ardent -sport could wish to see Hamel</seg><seg type="columnLine">had all the dogged tenacity of his phleg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic race, while Poppy, in spite of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulk, was agile as a cat Neither knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything about boxing neither had any</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of yielding</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One represented Prerogative the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">championed Progress For several min-</seg><seg

tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umphed, as she always does</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That memorable victory on that balmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">May morning settled for all time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question of who should run trains Also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it introduced an exceedingly important</seg><seg type="columnLine">device Once the idea was hit upon, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't take long to replace the stick of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood with a gong, and then the bell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cord was fully launched upon its useful</seg><seg type="columnLine">career</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Sending Umbrellas by

type="columnLine">every possible occasion One day, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1849, when everybody was talking about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the telegraph, one of his passengers,</seg><seg

en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gine, ran down the main line, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">backed up against the end of the burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">car</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The skin of his hands and the hair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head were gone when he finished that</seg><seg type="columnLine">coupling

type="columnLine">first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that, his breath came easier, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">siding four was the last to open

twenty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, what had been done before</seg><seg type="columnLine">was boy's play to what must now be done</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was necessary to run far back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">zone of the first of the fire, where the em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber-spewing debris of sidings one and

got</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, and saw that half the sills were al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready sagging to the ties</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then a draw-head pulled loose, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came bucking out with two cars Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">cars would not let him back to six He</seg><seg

other three engines</seg><seg type="columnLine">Having run them out onto the main line</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the switch to siding four, he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and set the other switches so that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main line ran direct to five</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he got aboard, and ran down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">track for a quarter of a mile or more</seg><seg type="columnLine">There he stopped, and built such fires un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der those boilers as would make steam</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster than any safety-valve could let it</seg><seg type="columnLine">off</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This done, he crawled up into the cab</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the head engine, reversed it, opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throttle to the last notch, and then, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the

type="columnLine">and settled comfortably to the business</seg><seg type="columnLine">of running down the curving grades</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hutton and Acre, hunched up together</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Acre's seat-box, were still debating</seg><seg type="columnLine">with unflagging zeal They had not ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rived at a conclusion when the engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the bottom of the pass and</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck into the rather sharp left curve,</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the base of the mountain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On Acre's side of the engine the verti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal rock-wall continued close to the cab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">window On Bayard's side the first fun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel of the valley lay wide and smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">with range-grass There they met the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second section of freight, without note or</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice, coming to them at a spanking</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace on the single track</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is of no present consequence how</seg><seg type="columnLine">they got there, perhaps, except that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bayard was running correctly on his or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der and the other crew had misread the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting - point And so the meeting-</seg><seg type="columnLine">point having been suddenly transposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">without notice, while Hutton and Acre</seg><seg type="columnLine">were busy with their own opinions on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the obstructed side of the engine-view, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Bayard who first caught the rocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam of the coming headlight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">voiced a brief warning</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " J ump ! This side ! " he shouted, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was all, except one short bark from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whistle, which the other engine in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly echoed, in kind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For the rest of it he thrust the throttle</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut upon the thread of steam which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been using, toward the level, swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brake-valve to its fullest duty, as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand fell from the throttle and, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet still astride of the quadrant, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them resting upon the strong steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">footrest which projected from the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quadrant, he pulled the lever back</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply, released the latch and, attempt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to get to his feet, lunged half out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window, intending to swing his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and leap clear</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of leaping, however, he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily back, after one longing, straining</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance at Hutton and Acre fleeing safely</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the quarter moon, across the range</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass, and then he attacked the reverse</seg><seg type="columnLine">lever fiercely, in the effort to reset it</seg><seg type="columnLine">elsewhere in the quadrant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was the last fleeting view Hutton</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Acre had of him, struggling in wri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing outline, against the dim cab-lights,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until after all was over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stood watching, with shortened</seg><seg

spurt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed from the grinding brake-shoes upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wheels all along the cars crowding</seg><seg type="columnLine">up darkly from the rear</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sunny Acre's arms were unconsciously</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffened in grotesque arcs like those of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">frog's front legs in poise for leaping, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his outspread fingers were set wide and</seg><seg type="columnLine">separately as extended

deceptively</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to halt just before striking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, with a brakeman's last resort</seg><seg type="columnLine">when all else had failed, he let go a pier-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cing, quavering yell that was swallowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in the crash of the impact, leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">once, straight up from the ground, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started racing back toward the grinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smoking jumble in the half darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">011 the tracks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All of it was very briefly done The</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposing

down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dull rumble of the suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stayed trains quickly subsided in both</seg><seg

the wheels and axles form a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">path for the electricity, and only a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of it passes through the relay,</seg><seg

soon as it strikes a block where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the track current has been short-circuited</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the presence of a train or by other</seg><seg
