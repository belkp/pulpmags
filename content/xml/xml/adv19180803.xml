A. LAMB </p><p>Author of “Tal Taulai Khan" “Dorgan’s Dcvil-Dcvil," etc. </p><p>IT WAS the year of the lion at the very </p><p>end of the sixteenth century when Khlit </p><p>guided his horse into Astrakan. No </p><p>sentries challenged him in the streets of </p><p>Astrakan, for the Cossacks were masters here </p><p>and no Cossack would dishonor himself by </p><p>taking precautions against danger. There </p><p>were many Mohammedans in the streets </p><p>of Astrakan, but it was evening and the </p><p>followers of Allah were repeating the last </p><p>of their prayers, facing, as was the law, </p><p>toward the city of Mecca. </p><p> Sitting his steppe pony carelessly, Khlit</p><p>allowed the beast to take its own course. </p><p>The night, in Midsummer, was warm and </p><p>his heavy svitza was thrown back on his high </p><p>shoulders. A woolen cap covered one side </p><p>of his gray head, and his new pair of costly </p><p>red Morocco boots were smudged with tar </p><p>to show his contempt for appearances. </p><p>Under his shaggy mustache a pipe glowed </p><p>and by his side hung the strangely shaped </p><p>saber which had earned the Cossack the </p><p>name of “Khlit of the Curved Saber.” </p><p> Khlit rode alone, as he had done since</p><p>he left the Siech, where Cossack leaders had </p><p>said that he was too old to march with'the </p><p>army of the Ukraine. He paid no attention </p><p>to the sprawling, drunken figures of Cos- </p><p>sacks that his horse stepped over in the </p><p>street. Clouds of flies from fish houses, </p><p>odorous along the river front, buzzed around </p><p>him. Donkeys driven by naked Tatar </p><p>urchins passed him in the shadows. Oc- </p><p>casionally the glow from the open front of </p><p>an Ispahan rug* dealer’s shop showed him </p><p>cloaked Tatars who swaggered and swore </p><p>at him. </p><p> Being weary Khlit paid no heed to these. •</p><p>A dusty armorer’s shop under an archway </p><p>promised a resting-place for the night, and </p><p>here he dismounted. Pushing aside the rug </p><p>that served as a door he cursed as he </p><p>stumbled over the proprietor of the shop, a</p><p>Syrian who was bowing a yellow face over </p><p>a purple shawl in prayer. </p><p> “Lailat el kodr,” the Syrian muttered, cast-</p><p>ing a swift side glance at the tall Cossack. </p><p>Copyright, 19 IS, by The Rideway Comfiany in the United States and Great Britain. All rights reserved. </p><p>3 </p><p>4 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Khlit did not know the words; but that</p><p>night thousands of lips were repeating </p><p>them—lailat el kadr, night of power. This </p><p>was the night which was potent for the </p><p>followers of the true faith, when the dhinns </p><p>smiled upon Mohammed, and Marduk was </p><p>hung by his heels in Babylon. It is so </p><p>written in the book of Abulghazi, called by </p><p>some Abulfarajii, historian of dynasties. </p><p> It was on such a night of power, say the</p><p>annals of Abulghazi, that Hulagu Khan, </p><p>nephew of Ghengis Khan and leader of the </p><p>Golden Horde overcame the citadel of </p><p>Alamut, the place of strange wickedness, </p><p>by the river Shahrud, in the province of </p><p>Rudbar. It was on that night the power </p><p>of Hagen ben Sabbah was broken. </p><p> But the power of Hagen ben Sabbah was</p><p>evil. Evil, says Abulghazi, is slow to die. </p><p>The wickedness of Alamut lived, and around </p><p>it clung the shadow of the power that had </p><p>belonged to Hagen ben Sabbah—a power </p><p>not of god or man—who was called by some </p><p>sheik, by others the Old Man of the Moun- </p><p>tain, and by himself the prophet of God. </p><p> It was also written in the book of Abul-</p><p>ghazi that there was a prophecy that the </p><p>waters of the Shahrud would be red with </p><p>blood, and that the evil would be hunted </p><p>through the hidden places of Alamut. A </p><p>strange prophecy. And never had Khlit, </p><p>the Cossack of the Curved Saber, shared in </p><p>such a hunt. It was not of his own seek- </p><p>ing—the hunt that disclosed the secret of </p><p>Alamut. It was chance that made him </p><p>a hunter, the chance that brought him to </p><p>the shop of the Syrian armorer, seeking </p><p>rest. </p><p> So it happened that Khlit saw the</p><p>prophecy of Abulghazi, who was wise with </p><p>an ancient wisdom, come to pass—saw the </p><p>river stair flash with sword blades, and the </p><p>banquet-place, and the treasure of Alamut </p><p>under the paradise of the Shadna. </p><p> “Lailat el kadr," chanted the Syrian,</p><p>his eye on the curved blade of Khlit, </p><p>“Allah is mighty and there is no god but he.” </p><p> “Spawn of Islam,” grunted Khlit who</p><p>disliked prayer, “lift your bones and find</p><p>for me a place to spend the night. And </p><p>food.” </p><p> The Cossack spoke in Tatar, with which</p><p>language he was on familiar terms. The </p><p>response was not slow in coming, although </p><p>from an unexpected quarter. A cloaked </p><p>figure rose from the shadows behind the </p><p>one lamp which lighted the shop and con- </p><p>fronted him. The cloak fell to the floor </p><p>and disclosed a sturdy form clad in a fur- </p><p>tipped tunic under which gleamed a coat </p><p>of mail, heavy pantaloons, and a peaked </p><p>helmet. A pair of slant, bloodshot eyes </p><p>stared at Khlit from a round face. </p><p> Khlit recognized the newcomer as a</p><p>Tatar warrior of rank, and noted that while </p><p>the other was short, his shoulders were wide </p><p>and arms long as his knees. Simultaneously </p><p>Khlit’s curved saber flashed into view, with </p><p>the Tatar’s scimiter. </p><p> As quickly, the Syrian merchant darted</p><p>into a corner. Cossack and Tatar, enemies </p><p>by instinct and choice, measured each other </p><p>cautiously. Neither moved, waiting for </p><p>the other to act. Khlit’s pipe fell to the </p><p>floor and he did not stoop to pick it up. </p><p> “Toctamish!”</p><p> It was a woman’s voice, shrill and angry</p><p>that broke the silence. Khlit did not shift </p><p>his gaze. The Tatar scowled sullenly, and </p><p>growled something beneath his breath. </p><p> “Toctamish! Fool watch dog! Is there</p><p>no end to your quarreling? Do your </p><p>fingers itch for a sword until you forget my </p><p>orders?” </p><p> The curtains were pushed aside from a</p><p>recess in the shop, and out of the corner </p><p>of his eye Khlit saw a slender woman dart </p><p>forward and seize the Tatar by his squat </p><p>shoulders. Toctamish tried in vain to throw </p><p>off the grip that pinned his arms to his side. </p><p> “One without understanding,” the Tatar</p><p>growled, “here is a dog of a Cossack who </p><p>would rather slay than eat. This is the </p><p>Khlit I told of, the one with the curved </p><p>sword. Are you a child at play?” </p><p> “Nay, you are the child, Toctamish,”</p><p>shrilled the woman, “for you would fight</p><p>when the Cossack would eat. He means </p><p>no harm. Allah keep you further from the </p><p>wine cask! Put up your sword. Have you </p><p>forgotten you are man and I am mistress?” </p><p> To Khlit’s amusement Toctamish, who</p><p>whether by virtue of wine or his natural </p><p>foolhardiness was eager to match swords, </p><p>dropped his weapon to his side. Where- </p><p>upon Khlit lowered his sword and con- </p><p>fronted the woman. </p><p> Beside the square form of Toctamish,</p><p>she looked scarcely bigger than a reed of </p><p>the river. A pale-blue reed, with a flower- </p><p>face of delicate olive. Above the blue </p><p>garment which covered her from foot to </p><p>throat, her black hair hung around a face </p><p>which arrested Kill it’s attention. Too </p><p>Alamut </p><p>5 </p><p>narrow to be a Tatar, yet too dark for a </p><p>Georgian, her head was poised gracefully on </p><p>slender shoulders. Her mouth was small, </p><p>and her cheeks tinted from olive to pink. </p><p>The eyes were wide and dark. Under </p><p>Khlit’s gaze she scowled. Abruptly she </p><p>stepped to his side and watched him with </p><p>frank curiosity. </p><p> “Do you leave courtesy outside when</p><p>you enter a dwelling, Cossack?” she de- </p><p>manded. “You come unbidden, with dirty </p><p>boots, and you flourish your curved sword </p><p>in front of Toctamish who would have killed </p><p>you because he is crafty as a Kurdish far- </p><p>sang, and feared you. I do not fear you. </p><p>You have a soiled coat and you carry a foul </p><p>stick in your mouth.” </p><p> Khlit grunted in distaste. He had small</p><p>liking for women. This one was neither </p><p>Tatar nor Circassian nor Georgian, yet she </p><p>spoke fair Tatar. </p><p> “Devil take me,” he said, “I had not come</p><p>had I known you were here, oh, loud voiced </p><p>one. I came for food and a place to </p><p>sleep.” </p><p> “You deserve neither,” she retorted,</p><p>following her own thoughts. “Is it true </p><p>that you are Khlit, who fought with the </p><p>Tatars of Tal Taulai Khan? Toctamish </p><p>is the man of Kiragai Khan who follows </p><p>the banners of Tal Taulai Khan and he has </p><p>seen you before. It seems he does not like </p><p>you. Yet you have gray hair.” </p><p> The Cossack was not anxious to stay,</p><p>yet he did not like to go, with Toctamish </p><p>at his back. While he hesitated, the girl </p><p>watched him, her lips curved in mockery. </p><p> “Is this the Wolf you told me of?” said</p><p>she to Toctamish. “I do not think he is </p><p>the one the Tatar fold fear. See, he blinks </p><p>like an owl in the light. An old, gray owl.” </p><p>Toctamish made no reply, eying Khlit </p><p>sullenly. Khlit was fast recovering from </p><p>his surprise at the daring of this woman, </p><p>of a race he had not seen before, and very </p><p>beautiful, who seemed without fear. The </p><p>daughter of a chieftain, he meditated; </p><p>surely she was one brought up among many </p><p>slaves.</p><p> “Aye, daughter,” he responded moodily.</p><p>“Gray, and therefore forbidden to ride with </p><p>the free Cossacks, my brothers of the Siech. </p><p>Wherefore am I alone, and my sword at the </p><p>service of one who asks it. I am no longer </p><p>a Cossack of Cossacks but one alone.” </p><p> “I have heard tales of you.” The black-</p><p>eyed woman stared at him boldly, head on </p><p>one side. “Did you truly enter here in </p><p>peace, seeking only food?” </p><p> “Aye,” said Khlit.</p><p> “Wait, then,” said she, “and the nameless</p><p>one whose house this is will prepare it for </p><p>you. Meanwhile, sheath the sword you </p><p>are playing with. I shall not hurt you.” </p><p> Motioning Toctamish to her side, the</p><p>woman of the blue cloak withdrew into a </p><p>corner of the curtained armorer’s shop. </p><p>The Cossack, who had keen eyes, noted that </p><p>the Syrian was bending his black-capped </p><p>head over a bowl of stew which he was </p><p>stirring in another corner. No others, he </p><p>decided, were in the shop. </p><p> Toctamish seemed to like his companion’s</p><p>words little. He muttered angrily, at which </p><p>the girl retorted sharply. Khlit could not </p><p>catch their words, but he guessed that an </p><p>argument was taking place, at which the </p><p>Tatar was faring ill. The argument seemed </p><p>to be about himself. Also, he heard the </p><p>name Berea repeated. </p><p> Although Khlit was not of a curious</p><p>nature, the identity of the girl puzzled him. </p><p>With the beauty of a high-priced slave, </p><p>and the manner of a king’s daughter, she </p><p>went unveiled in a land where women </p><p>covered their faces from men. Moreover </p><p>she was young, being scarce eighteen, and </p><p>of delicate stature. </p><p> Khlit bethought him, and it crossed his</p><p>memory that he had heard of dark-haired </p><p>and fair-skinned women of unsurpassed </p><p>beauty whose land was at the far end of </p><p>the Sea of Khozar, the inland, salt sea. </p><p>They were Persians, of the province of </p><p>Rudbar. Yet, fair as they were in the </p><p>sight of men, none were bought as slaves. </p><p>Berea, if that were her name, might well </p><p>be one of these. If that was the case, what</p><p>was she doing in Astrakan, alone save for </p><p>one Tatar, who while he was a man of rank </p><p>and courage, was not her equal? </p><p>II </p><p>THE Cossack’s meditation was </p><p>interrupted by the girl, who mo- </p><p>tioned to the Syrian to set his stew </p><p>before Khlit. </p><p> “Eat,” she cried impatiently, pointing</p><p>to the steaming bowl. “You are hungry, </p><p>Father of Battles, and I would speak with </p><p>you. A man speaks ill on an empty belly, </p><p>although a woman needs not food nor wine </p><p>to sharpen her wits. Eh, look at me and </p><p>6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>say, Father of Battles, is it not true I am </p><p>beautiful, that men would die for me? It </p><p>is given to few to look at me so closely.” </p><p> She stepped near the Cossack, so the</p><p>edge of her silk garment touched his shaggy </p><p>face where he crouched over the bowl. </p><p>Khlit sniffed, and with the odor of lamb stew </p><p>he smelled, although he knew not its nature, </p><p>the scent of rose leaves and aloes. He </p><p>dipped his hand into the bowl and ate. </p><p> “Speak, Khlit, Cossack boor,” shrilled</p><p>the woman, shaking his shoulder impa- </p><p>tiently, “and say whether it is in your mind </p><p>I am beautiful. Other men are not slow </p><p>to say that Berea of Rudbar and Kuhistan </p><p>is shapely, and tinted as the rose.” </p><p> Khlit’s hand paused midway to his</p><p>mouth. </p><p> “Toctamish has a handsome harlot,” he</p><p>said and swallowed. </p><p> The girl stepped back hastily.</p><p> “Clown!” she whispered softly. “Name-</p><p>less one of a dog’s breeding. You shall </p><p>remember that word. It was in my mind </p><p>to bid you come with me, and be companion </p><p>to Toctamish-” </p><p> “Am I a man for a Tatar’s wench?”</p><p>Khlit was making rapid inroads into the </p><p>stew. </p><p> “Nay, a boor of the steppe. Remember,</p><p>your speech is not to be forgotten. I am a </p><p>chief’s daughter, with many horsemen.” </p><p> Berea was watching the Cossack half-</p><p>angrily, half-anxiously. Toctamish moved </p><p>his bulk to the bowl, regarding the dis- </p><p>appearing contents with regret. </p><p> “How can one man be courteous, Berea</p><p>of Rudbar,” he asked gruffly, “when the </p><p>tribe is without breeding? It were better </p><p>to cut the throat of this caphar, dog without </p><p>faith, before he ate of our bread and salt.” </p><p> “Nay, eat also of the food, Toctamish,”</p><p>said Berea, “and let me think.” </p><p> The Tatar’s brown face wrinkled in</p><p>distaste. </p><p> “Am I to share bread with a caphar?”</p><p>he snarled. “Truly, I promised to obey </p><p>you, but not thus. Bid the Cossack be gone </p><p>and I will eat. Otherwise he will be </p><p>brother in arms, and his danger shall be my </p><p>danger.” </p><p> Berea stamped her slippered foot im-</p><p>patiently. </p><p> “Has Allah given me a donkey to follow</p><p>me? Eat your share of the stew, Toc- </p><p>tamish, and cease your braying. Is it not </p><p>written in the Koran that the most dis- </p><p>agreeable of voices is the voice of asses.” </p><p>Toctamish remained sullenly silent. He </p><p>was very hungry. Likewise, Khlit was an </p><p>enemy of his blood. </p><p> “Eat, Flat-Face,” chuckled Khlit, who</p><p>was beginning to enjoy himself, “the stew </p><p>is rarely made. But the bottom of the </p><p>bowl is not far off.” </p><p> The odor of the food tormented the</p><p>Tatar. And Berea, for reason of her own, </p><p>allowed him no chance to back away from </p><p>the bowl. Finally, in desperation, he </p><p>squatted opposite Khlit and dipped his </p><p>hand into the stew. </p><p> “Remember the law, Flat-Face,” guf-</p><p>fawed Khlit, as the other ate greedily. </p><p>“We have shared bread and .salt together— </p><p>I would give a hundred ducats for a mouth- </p><p>ful of wine.” </p><p> “It is not I who will forget, caphar.,”</p><p>retorted Toctamish with dignity. Tugging </p><p>at his girdle, he held out a small gourd. </p><p>“Here is arak; drink heartily.” </p><p> “Aye,” said Khlit.</p><p> He had tasted the heady mares’ milk</p><p>of the Tatars before and he sucked his </p><p>mustache appreciatively after the draft. </p><p>Pulling pipe and tobacco from a pouch he </p><p>proceeded to smoke. </p><p> “Observe,” said Toctamish to Berea,</p><p>to show that he was not softened by what </p><p>has passed, “that the caphar dog is one who </p><p>must have two weeds to live. He sucks</p><p>the top of one and drinks the juice of the </p><p>other.” </p><p> “Still your tongue,” said Berea sharply,</p><p>“and let me think.” </p><p> She had seated herself cross-legged by</p><p>the bowl, and her bird-like glance strayed </p><p>from Khlit to Toctamish. The Cossack, </p><p>engrossed in his pipe, ignored her. </p><p> “Why did you name me a harlot?” she</p><p>asked abruptly, a flush deepening the olive </p><p>of her cheeks. </p><p> “Eh, I know not, Sparrow. Devil take</p><p>it, a blind man would see you are not kin </p><p>to Toctamish. He is not of your people. </p><p>And there is no old woman at hand to keep </p><p>you out of mischief. You have said you </p><p>were a chief’s daughter. If that is not a lie. </p><p>then the chief is dead.” </p><p> The girl’s eyes widened, and Toctamish</p><p>gaped. </p><p> “Have you a magician’s sight, caphar?”</p><p>she cried. “It is true that the sheik, my </p><p>father is dead. But I did not tell you.” </p><p>“Yet you are alone, Berea, across the </p><p>Alamut </p><p>7 </p><p>Sea of Khozar, without attendants. A wise </p><p>sheik will keep his girl at home, except </p><p>when she is sent to be married. Is it not </p><p>true that another sent you out of Rudbar?” </p><p>Berea’s dark eyes closed and she rested </p><p>her chin quietly on her folded hands. One </p><p>hand she thrust into the folds of her cloak </p><p>at the throat and drew it out clasped around </p><p>a small object which hung by a chain from </p><p>her slender neck. Opening her fingers she </p><p>disclosed a sapphire of splendid size and </p><p>brilliancy, set in carved gold. The jewel </p><p>was of value, and appeared to be from the </p><p>work-shops of skilled jewelers of Tabriz. </p><p>Khlit eyed it indifferently and waited. </p><p> “It is true that another sent me from</p><p>Rudbar, Khlit,” said Berea softly, “and it </p><p>was to be married. The one who sent me </p><p>sent also some slaves and an attendant. </p><p>He swore that a certain chief, a khan of </p><p>the Kallmarks had asked me for his wife, </p><p>and I went, not desiring to stay in Rudbar </p><p>after my father died.” </p><p> “The Kallmarks?” Khlit frowned.</p><p>“Why, you are a Persian, and the Kallmark </p><p>Tatars make war on Persians as did their </p><p>fathers. A marriage would be strange. </p><p>Eh, who sent you?” </p><p> Berea lowered her voice further and</p><p>glanced at the Persian armorer who was </p><p>snoring in his corner. </p><p> “One it was who is better not named,”</p><p>she whispered. “He is neither sheik nor </p><p>khan. Listen, Cossack. This is a jewel of </p><p>rare value. It has no mate this side of </p><p>Damascus. Would you like to own it?” </p><p>“Aye,” said Khlit indifferently, “at what </p><p>price?” </p><p> “Service.”</p><p> “Do you want another Toctamish?</p><p>Buy him in the streets of Astrakan. Is a </p><p>free Cossack to be bought?” </p><p> “Nay, Khlit,” whispered Berea leaning</p><p>close to him until her loose curls touched </p><p>his eyes, “the service is for one who can </p><p>use his sword. We heard in Tatary how </p><p>you escaped from Tal Taulai Khan and </p><p>his myriad horsemen. Men say that you</p><p>are truly the father of battles. I have work </p><p>for such a one. Listen! I was sent from </p><p>Rudbar to Kiragai Khan, up the Sea of </p><p>Khozar, and across the Jaick River, with </p><p>one attendant and a box which the attend- </p><p>ant said held jewels and gold bars for my </p><p>dowry. I came to the court of Kiragai </p><p>Khan-” </p><p> “Bah, Sparrow,” Khlit yawned sleepily,</p><p>“you are tiresome. I want sleep, not </p><p>words. In the morning-” </p><p> “We will be gone from Astrakan.”</p><p>Berea held up the sapphire. “You must </p><p>listen, Cossack. I told Kiragai Khan </p><p>my mission, for there were no others to </p><p>speak, and opened the box in the hands of </p><p>the attendant. The jewels were poor </p><p>pearls and no gold was in the box. Then </p><p>Kiragai Khan, before whom I had unveiled </p><p>my face, laughed and said that he had not </p><p>sent for me. At first it came to my mind </p><p>that it was because the jewels were worth- </p><p>less. But it was the truth.” </p><p> “Aye,” said Toctamish suddenly, “it</p><p>was the truth.” </p><p> “I went quickly from the country of</p><p>Kiragai Khan, aided =by Toctamish, who </p><p>pitied me when others tried to sell me a </p><p>slave—of a race that are not slaves. At </p><p>Astrakan we learned the whole truth, for </p><p>here word came to us that the one who sent </p><p>me in marriage had killed my father. I </p><p>was sent to be out of the way, for it would </p><p>not do to sell one of my blood as slave. </p><p>Such is not the law. He who killed my </p><p>father heeds no law, yet he is crafty.” </p><p>“Then,” inquired Khlit, “you would slay </p><p>him? Give Toctamish a dagger and a dark </p><p>night and it is done.” </p><p> Iierca shook her head scornfully.</p><p> “No dagger could come near this man,”</p><p>she said bitterly. “And he is beyond our </p><p>reach. He has many thousand hidden </p><p>daggers at his call. His empire is from </p><p>Samarkand to Aleppo, and from Tatary </p><p>to the Indian Sea. He is more feared than </p><p>Tal Taulai Khan, of the Horde.” </p><p> “Then he must be a great sheik,” yawned</p><p>Khlit. </p><p> “He is not a sheik,” protested Berea,</p><p>and her eyes widened. “And his stronghold </p><p>is under the ground, not on it. Men say </p><p>his power lies in his will to break all laws, </p><p>for he has made his followers free from all </p><p>law. What he wants, he takes from others. </p><p>And he is glad when blood is shed. Do </p><p>you know of him?” </p><p> “Aye,” said Khlit, grinning, “the steppe</p><p>fox.” </p><p> “They call you the Wolf,” pleaded Berea,</p><p>“and I need your counsel and wisdom. </p><p>This man I am seeking has a name no one </p><p>makes a jest of—twice. He is called by </p><p>some the arch prophet, by others the Old </p><p>Man of the Mountain, and by others the </p><p>Shadna of the Refik folk. He is the head </p><p>8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>of an empire that lays tribute on every </p><p>city in Persia, Kurdistan, Khorassan, Syria </p><p>and Anatolia. If Allah decreed that I </p><p>should be his death I should be content.” </p><p>“More likely dead,” responded Khlit. </p><p>“Truly, if these are not lies,, your Old Man </p><p>of the Mountain must be a good fighter </p><p>and I would cross swords with him. Can </p><p>you show him to me?” </p><p> “Aye, Khlit,” said Berea eagerly, “if</p><p>you come with me. There is the sapphire </p><p>if you will come to Rudbar with me.” </p><p> Khlit stretched his tall bulk lazily.</p><p> “One way is as good as the other to me,</p><p>if there is fighting,” he muttered sleepily. </p><p>“Only talk not of rewards, for a Cossack </p><p>takes his pay from the bodies of enemies. </p><p>I will kill this Master of the Mountain for </p><p>you. Let me sleep now, for your voice is </p><p>shrill.” </p><p>' When Toctamish and Berea had left the </p><p>shop of the armorer, the former to seek a </p><p>shed outside, and the Persian girl to sleep </p><p>in her recess, Khlit’s snores matched those </p><p>of the Syrian shopkeeper in volume. For </p><p>a while only. Then it happened that the </p><p>snores of the Syrian ceased. </p><p> Without disturbing Khlit who was</p><p>stretched full length on the floor, the Syrian </p><p>silently pushed past the hangings over the </p><p>door. Once outside he broke into a trot, </p><p>his slippers pad-padding the dark street. </p><p>Nor did he soon slacken his pace. </p><p>m </p><p>/ftiL KHLIT and Toctamish did not </p><p>make the best of bed-fellows. Berea, </p><p>*s4ife* however, was careful to see that </p><p>no serious quarrel broke out between the </p><p>two. In a bark that went from Aslrakan, </p><p>the day after their meeting, to the south </p><p>shore of the Sea of Khozar, the two warriors </p><p>of different races occupied a small cupboard </p><p>which adjoined the cabin of the sheik’s </p><p>daughter. </p><p> Khlit had embarked not altogether</p><p>willingly. When the fumes of arak had </p><p>cleared from his head the next morning,</p><p>he had half-repented of his bargain. Curi- </p><p>osity to see the other side of the salt sea, </p><p>which he had known as the Caspian, </p><p>rather than the pleadings of Berea, finally </p><p>brought him aboard the bark with his </p><p>horse from which he refused to be separated. </p><p> The girl had bought their passage with</p><p>the last of her pearls, and some gold of </p><p>Toctamish’s, and had remained in her cabin </p><p>since, to which Toctamish brought food. </p><p>The Cossack, after a survey of the small </p><p>vessel which disclosed his fellow-voyagers </p><p>as some few Syrian silk-merchants, with </p><p>the Tatar crew, took possession of a nook </p><p>in the high poop deck, and kept a keen look- </p><p>out for the islands and other vessels they </p><p>passed, and for Bab-al-abuab, the lofty gate </p><p>of gates as the ship made its way southward. </p><p>Toctamish, who had not set foot on a ship </p><p>before, was very ill, to Khlit’s silent </p><p>satisfaction. </p><p> One day, when the wind was too high for</p><p>comfort on deck, the Cossack sought Toc- </p><p>tamish in the cupboard where the latter lay, </p><p>ill at ease on some skins. </p><p> “Hey, Flat-Face,” Khlit greeted him,</p><p>sitting opposite against the side of the dark </p><p>recess, “you look as if the devil himself </p><p>was chewing at your entrails. Can you </p><p>speak as well as you grunt? I have a word </p><p>for you. Where is the little Berea?” </p><p> “In her cabin, oh, dog without breeding,”</p><p>snarled the Tatar, who was less disposed </p><p>to speak, even, than usual, “looking at </p><p>silks of a Syrian robber. This sickness of </p><p>the sea is a great sickness, for I am not </p><p>accustomed.” </p><p> “You will not die.” Khlit stroked his</p><p>saber thoughtfully across his boots. “Toc- </p><p>tamish, gully-jackal, and dog of an un- </p><p>believing race, you have been a fool. </p><p>Perhaps a greater one than I. How did </p><p>it happen that you became the follower </p><p>of the little Berea? Has she bewitched </p><p>you with her smooth skin and dark eyes?” </p><p> “Nay, that is not so,” Toctamish growled.</p><p>“She has told you her story. It is true </p><p>that Kiragai Khan, my master, did not </p><p>know of her coming. Her attendant and </p><p>slaves ran away and she felt great shame. </p><p>Yet she did not lose courage. When her</p><p>shame was the greatest she begged me to </p><p>take her to Astrakan, saying that I should </p><p>be head of her army. She did not say </p><p>her army was beyond the Salt Sea. Then </p><p>she made me promise to take her to her </p><p>people. As you know, her tongue is </p><p>golden.” </p><p> “Aye,” said Khlit. “Then you are even</p><p>a greater fool than I had thought. Have </p><p>you heard of this emperor she is taking </p><p>us to?” </p><p> Toctamish rolled his eyes, and shook his</p><p>head vaguely. </p><p> “His name is not known in our countries.</p><p>Alamut </p><p>9 </p><p>Mongol Tatars say that their great-grand- </p><p>fathers who followed the banners of Hulagu </p><p>Khan made war on one calling himself the </p><p>Old Man of the Mountain and slew many </p><p>thousands with much booty, beside burning </p><p>the citadel of Alamut, which was his strong- </p><p>hold. They gave me a dagger which came </p><p>from Alamut. It is a strange shape.” </p><p> “If the power of the Old Man of the</p><p>Mountain was broken in the time of Hulagu </p><p>Khan,” said Khlit idly, “how can it exist </p><p>now? Have you the dagger?” </p><p> The Tatar motioned to his belt with a</p><p>groan, and Khlit drew from it a long blade </p><p>with heavy handle. The dagger was of </p><p>tempered steel, curved like a tongue of fire. </p><p>On it were inscribed some characters which </p><p>were meaningless to Khlit. He balanced </p><p>it curiously in his bon}' hand. </p><p> “I have seen the like, Flat-Face,” he</p><p>meditated idly. “It could strike a good </p><p>blow. Hey, I remember where I have </p><p>seen others like it. In the shop of the </p><p>Syrian armorer, at Astrakan. Who brought </p><p>you to the shop?” </p><p> “We came, dog of a Cossack. The</p><p>Syrian bade us stay, charging nothing for </p><p>our beds, only for food.” </p><p> “Does he understand Tatar language?”</p><p>“Nay, Berea spoke with him in her own </p><p>tongue.” </p><p> “Aye. Did she speak with you of this</p><p>Old Man of the Mountain?” </p><p> “Once. She said that her people had</p><p>come under the power of the (Did Man of </p><p>the Mountain. Also that her home was </p><p>near to Alamut.” Toctamish hesitated. </p><p>“One thing more she said.” </p><p> “Well, God has given you a tongue to</p><p>speak.” </p><p> “She said that your curved sword was</p><p>useless against him who is called the Old </p><p>Man of the Mountain.” </p><p> With this the Tatar rolled over in his</p><p>skins and kept silence. Wearying of ques-</p><p>tioning him, Khlit rose and went to the </p><p>door of Berea’s cabin. Toctamish, he </p><p>meditated, was not one who could invent </p><p>answers to questions out of his own wit. </p><p>Either he spoke the truth, or he had been </p><p>carefully taught what to say. Khlit was </p><p>half-satisfied that the girl’s and the Tatar’s </p><p>story was true in all its details, strange </p><p>as it seemed. Yet he was wise, with the </p><p>wisdom of years, and certain things troubled </p><p>him. </p><p> It was not customary for a Tatar of rank</p><p>to follow the leadership of a woman. Also, </p><p>it was not clear why Berea should have </p><p>been so eager for the services of Khlit, </p><p>the Wolf. Again, she had declared that </p><p>the Old Man of the Mountain was not </p><p>to be met with, yet, apparently, she sought </p><p>him. </p><p> Pondering these things, Khlit tapped</p><p>lightly on the door of the girl’s cabin. </p><p>There was no response and he listened. </p><p>From within he could hear the quiet </p><p>breathing of a person in sleep. </p><p> He had come to speak with Berea, and</p><p>he was loath to turn back. Pushing open </p><p>the door he was about to step inside, when </p><p>he paused. </p><p> Full length on the floor lay Berea, on</p><p>the blue cloak she always wore. Her black </p><p>curls flowed over a silk pillow on which </p><p>her head rested. Her eyes were closed and </p><p>her face so white that Khlit wondered it </p><p>had ever been pink. </p><p> What drew the Cossack’s gaze were two</p><p>objects on the floor beside her. Khlit saw, </p><p>so close that some of the dark hairs were </p><p>caught in them, two daggers sticking up- </p><p>right on either side of the girl’s head. The </p><p>daggers were curved, like a tongue of fire. </p><p> Khlit’s glance, roaming quickly about the</p><p>cabin, told him that no one else was there. </p><p>Berea had not carried two weapons of such </p><p>size. Another had placed them there. As </p><p>he noticed the silk cushion, he remembered </p><p>the Syrian silk-merchant who had been </p><p>with Berea. </p><p> With a muttered curse of surprise, Khlit</p><p>stepped forward, treading lightly in his </p><p>heavy boots. Leaning over the girl he</p><p>scanned her closely. Her breathing was </p><p>quiet and regular, and her clothing un- </p><p>disturbed. Seeing that she was asleep, the </p><p>Cossack turned his attention to the </p><p>weapons. </p><p> Drawing the latter softly from the wood,</p><p>he retreated to the door. Closing this, </p><p>he climbed to the deck and scanned it for </p><p>the Syrian merchant. Almost within reach </p><p>he saw the one he sought, in a group of </p><p>several ragged traders, squatting by the </p><p>rail of the ship. No one noticed him, their </p><p>black sheepskin hats bent together in </p><p>earnest conversation. </p><p> With the daggers under his arm, Khlit</p><p>swaggered over to the group, the men </p><p>looking up silently at his approach. </p><p> “Hey, infidel dogs,” he greeted them,</p><p>“Here is a pair of good daggers I found </p><p>IO </p><p>Adventure </p><p>lying by the steps. Who owns them? </p><p>Speak!” </p><p> His eye traveled swiftly over the brown</p><p>faces. None of the group showed interest </p><p>beyond a curl of the lips at his words. If </p><p>he had expected the owner to claim his </p><p>property, he was disappointed. The Syrians </p><p>resumed their talk together. </p><p> “So be it,” said Khlit loudly. “They</p><p>are useless to me. Away with them.” </p><p> Balancing the weapons, he hurled them</p><p>along the deck. As he did so, he glanced </p><p>at the traders. Their conversation was </p><p>uninterrupted. Yet Khlit saw one of the </p><p>group look hastily after the flying daggers. </p><p>It was only a flash of white eyeballs in a </p><p>lean face, but Khlit stared closer at the </p><p>fellow, who avoided his eye. </p><p> Something in the man’s face was familiar</p><p>to the Cossack. Khlit searched his memory </p><p>and smiled to himself. The man who had </p><p>watched the fate of the daggers Khlit had </p><p>seen in Astrakan. The man had changed </p><p>his style of garments, but Khlit was </p><p>reasonably sure that he was no other than </p><p>the Syrian armorer who had offered his </p><p>shop to Berea and Toctamish. </p><p> Fingering his sword, the Cossack hesi-</p><p>tated. It was in his mind to ask at the </p><p>sword’s point what the other had been </p><p>doing in Berea’s cabin. Yet, if the fellow </p><p>admitted he had left the daggers by the </p><p>' girl, and Khlit did not kill him, the Syrian </p><p>would be free to work other mischief. </p><p>And Khlit, careless as he was of life, could </p><p>see no just reason for killing the Syrian. </p><p>Better to let the man go, he thought, </p><p>unaware that he was suspected, and watch. </p><p> As an afterthought, Khlit went to where</p><p>the twisted daggers lay on the deck and </p><p>threw them over the side. </p><p>IV </p><p>IN THE YEAR of the lion, there </p><p>was a drouth around the Sea of </p><p>Khozar, and the salt fields of its </p><p>south shore whitened in the sun. Where </p><p>the caravan route from Samarkand to</p><p>Bagdad crossed the salt fields, the watering- </p><p>places were dry, all save a very few. </p><p> The sun was reflected in burning waves</p><p>from the crusted salt, from which a rock </p><p>cropped out occasionally, and the wind </p><p>from the sea did not serve to cool the air. </p><p>In the annals of Abulghazi, it is written that </p><p>men and camels of the caravans thirsted </p><p>in this year, the year in which the waters </p><p>of Shahrud, by the citadel of Alamut, were </p><p>to be red with blood. </p><p> At one of the few watering-places near</p><p>the shore, Berea’s party of three, with a </p><p>pack-donkey came to a halt, at the same </p><p>time that a caravan, coming from the east </p><p>stopped to refresh the animals. </p><p> The Persian girl watched the Kurdish</p><p>camel-drivers lead their beasts to kneel by </p><p>the well silently. Khlit, beside her, gazed </p><p>attentively, although with apparent indif- </p><p>ference at the mixed throng of white-and- </p><p>brown-robed traders with their escort of </p><p>mounted Kurds. Many looked at Berea, </p><p>who was heavily veiled, but kept their </p><p>distance at sight of Khlit. </p><p> “It is written, Abulfetah Barb Issa,</p><p>Father of Battles,” spoke the girl softly, </p><p>“that a man must be crafty and wise when </p><p>peril is ’round his road; else is his labor </p><p>vain, he follows a luck that flees. Truly </p><p>there is no luck, for Allah has traced our </p><p>lives in the divining sands, and we follow </p><p>our paths as water follows its course. Are </p><p>you as wise as the masters of evil, oh, </p><p>Cossack?” </p><p> The words were mocking, and Khlit</p><p>laughed. </p><p> “Little Sparrow,” he said, “I have seen</p><p>ever so much evil, and there was none that </p><p>did not fade when a good sword was waved </p><p>in front of it. Yet never have I followed </p><p>a woman.” </p><p> “You will not follow me much further,</p><p>Cossack. I will leave you at the foothills </p><p>to go among my people, the hillmen, where </p><p>I shall be safe. You and Toctamish will go </p><p>alone the rest of the way. My face is </p><p>known to the people of Alamut,. who sup- </p><p>pose that I am dead or a slave. In time </p><p>they shall see me, but not yet. Meanwhile</p><p>it is my wish that you and Toctamish seek </p><p>the citadel of Alamut, which lies a two- </p><p>days’ journey into the interior.” </p><p> Khlit shaded his eyes with a lean hand</p><p>and gazed inland. Above the plain of salt </p><p>levels he could see a nest of barren foothills </p><p>which surrounded mountains of great size </p><p>and height. </p><p> “Where lies the path to this Alamut—”</p><p>he had begun, when Berea shook his arm </p><p>angrily. </p><p> “Not so loud, fool of the steppe! Do</p><p>you think we are still by the Volga? We </p><p>are already in the territory of the Old Man </p><p>of the Mountain. Listen, to what I have </p><p>Alamut </p><p>ii </p><p>already told Toctamish. Two days’ travel </p><p>to the south will bring you to the district </p><p>of Rudbar. You will find yourself near </p><p>the River Shahrud which flows from the </p><p>mountains. There will be hillmen about who </p><p>do not love the Old Man of the Mountain. </p><p> “So do not speak, his name, until you come</p><p>to a bend in the Shahrud where the river </p><p>doubles on itself, so, like a twisted snake. </p><p>Across the river will be a mountain of rock </p><p>which will appear to be a dog kneeling, </p><p>facing you. Remain there until armed </p><p>men ride up and question you. Then say </p><p>you are come to join the ranks of Sheik </p><p>Halen ibn Shaddah, who is the Old Man </p><p>of the Mountain.” </p><p> Khlit shook his head and tapped his sword</p><p>thoughtfully. </p><p> “Nay, little Berea,” he said reproachfully,</p><p>“you have told me lies. You said it was </p><p>your wish to slay one who had slain your </p><p>father. And because it was a just quarrel </p><p>and I was hungry for sight of the world </p><p>below the Salt Sea, I came to aid you. </p><p>Are you one, oh, Sparrow, to fight alone </p><p>against a powerful chief? Where are your </p><p>men that you told Toctamish of. Devil </p><p>take me, if I’ll put my head in the strong- </p><p>hold of any sheik, as you call him.” </p><p> Berea bent nearer, rising on tiptoe so her</p><p>breath was warm in his ear. </p><p> “My men are hillmen who will not attack</p><p>until they see an enemy flee. Also, they </p><p>have seen men who opposed Halen ibn </p><p>Shaddah set over a fire, with the skin of </p><p>their feet torn off. The master of Alamut </p><p>is all powerful here. Are you afraid, whom </p><p>they call the Wolf?” </p><p> “Nay, little Sparrow, how should I be</p><p>afraid of women’s tales and a mysterious </p><p>name? Tell me your plan, and I will con- </p><p>sider it. How can this sheik be reached?” </p><p>“Halen ibn Shaddah is safe from the </p><p>swords of his enemies. Yet there is a way </p><p>to reach him, in Alamut. The time will </p><p>come when you and Toctamish will find </p><p>yourselves at the head of many swords. </p><p>How can I tell you, who are a fool in our </p><p>way of fighting, and know not Alamut,</p><p>what is in my mind? I swear that soon </p><p>Halen ibn Shaddah will be attacked. Do </p><p>you believe my word?” </p><p> “Wherefore should I?”</p><p> Khlit tugged at his mustache moodily.</p><p>He was accustomed to settle his quarrels </p><p>alone, and he liked little to move in the dark. </p><p>Yet the woman spoke as one having </p><p>authority, and Toctamish believed in her </p><p>blindly. </p><p> “If this Sheik Halen is powerful and</p><p>crafty-” </p><p> “Still, I am a woman, and wronged by</p><p>a great wrong. I was sent to offer myself </p><p>unveiled to a man who had not sought me; </p><p>and at the same time my father was mur- </p><p>dered, so that the hillmen, of whom he was </p><p>sheik, might come under the shadow of </p><p>Alamut.” The girl’s voice was low, but the </p><p>words trembled with passion and the dark </p><p>eyes that peered at the Cossack over her </p><p>veil were dry as with fever, and burning. </p><p>“Halen ibn Shaddah shall pay for his evil; </p><p>for he is cursed in the sight of Allah. </p><p>Wicked—wicked beyond telling is Alamut </p><p>and therefore cursed.” </p><p> “Chirp shrilly, little Sparrow,” laughed</p><p>Khlit, “while your white throat is still </p><p>unslit. This Sheik Halen has no love for </p><p>you, for one of his men on the bark placed </p><p>two daggers, one on each side of your </p><p>black head. Devil take me, if I did not </p><p>think you would never chirp again. It was </p><p>the Syrian who took you in for so little pay </p><p>at Astrakan-” </p><p> “Fool! Stupid Cossack!” Berea’s eyes</p><p>suddenly swam with laughter, “did you </p><p>think I was asleep when you tiptoed in like </p><p>a bear treading nettles. Or that I did not </p><p>see the dirty Syrian, who thought to catch </p><p>me asleep? Look among the men of the </p><p>caravan, and tell me if you see the Syrian?” </p><p>Cautiously, Khlit scanned the groups </p><p>about the well. Among the Kurdish riders </p><p>and Tatars who were brown with the dust </p><p>of the desert trail from Samarkand, he </p><p>recognized a bent figure in a long gray </p><p>cloak and black kollah. As he watched </p><p>the figure, it bent still further over a box</p><p>of goods, and lifted some silks to view. </p><p>It was the Syrian, without doubt. Khlit </p><p>felt a thrill, as of one who is hunted and </p><p>hears the cry of the chase. He stepped </p><p>forward with an oath, when Berea’s grasp </p><p>tightened on his arm. </p><p> “That is a fedavie of Alamut,” she</p><p>whispered. “I saw the curved daggers, </p><p>and they are the weapons of the Refik folk </p><p>of Halen ibn Shaddah. He must have </p><p>overheard us in his shop at Astrakan, and </p><p>has followed to slay, as is the law of Alamut. </p><p>Probably there are more of the fedavie </p><p>among the men of the caravan.” </p><p> “Then we must deal with the Syrian</p><p>before he can speak to them,” muttered </p><p>12 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Khlit, but again Berea tugged him back. </p><p> “Did I not say you were a fool among</p><p>my people, oh, Wolf,” she whispered. </p><p>“Watch. The Syrian shall have his reward. </p><p>Your folly is very great, yet I need a man </p><p>who is blunt and brave and knows not my </p><p>plans. It is written that none knows </p><p>where his grave is dug, yet the Syrian’s </p><p>grave is here. Watch, and do not move.” </p><p> Khlit waited The fedavie had stooped</p><p>over his box. One or two Kurds gathered </p><p>to look at its contents. Among the group </p><p>Khlit noticed Toctamish who had come up </p><p>quietly. The Tatar pushed past the others, </p><p>heedless of their muttered curses until he </p><p>stood directly in front of the trader. The </p><p>Syrian looked up, and, seeing Toctamish, </p><p>was motionless. </p><p> Khlit saw the Kurds stare and draw back</p><p>as if they sensed trouble. The Syrian, </p><p>still watching Toctamish, rose with a swift, </p><p>cat-like movement, his hand hidden in the </p><p>silks. Toctamish grunted something and </p><p>spat upon the silks. </p><p> “See,” whispered Berea softly, “his grave</p><p>is dug, and the nameless one sees it.” </p><p> Toctamish thrust his yellow, scarred face</p><p>near the Syrian’s. Around him a crowd </p><p>pressed, watching with attention. With a </p><p>cry, the Syrian, who seemed to have found </p><p>the suspense too much for him, drew a pistol </p><p>from the silks in which it had been con- </p><p>cealed. </p><p> Instantly two giant arms were flung</p><p>’round him. Toctamish was on him with </p><p>a speed that baffled him, and the Tatar’s </p><p>huge bulk pressed the Syrian backward </p><p>to the ground. Writhing impotently, the </p><p>Syrian saw Toctamish draw a dagger from </p><p>his girdle. And Khlit grunted as he noted </p><p>that it was the one he had seen with blade </p><p>like a curved flame. While he held the </p><p>smaller man powerless with one arm, </p><p>Toctamish lifted the dagger and thrust it </p><p>carefully into his foe’s body, into stomach </p><p>and chest. </p><p> Then, rising, he wiped the curved dagger</p><p>on a handful of the trader’s silks. For</p><p>a moment the arms and legs of the unhappy </p><p>Syrian stirred on the ground. And Khlit </p><p>saw a strange thing. For, before life had </p><p>gone from the body, several men of the </p><p>caravan, Khirghiz warriors by their dress, </p><p>pushed through the throng with daggers </p><p>like that of Toctamish and struck at the </p><p>Syrian. Not until the body was still did </p><p>they cease to strike. </p><p> Then the Khirghiz men looked around for</p><p>Toctamish, but the stocky Tatar had dis- </p><p>appeared in the throng. Khlit, who had </p><p>missed nothing of what happened, thought </p><p>to himself that it was well that the dagger </p><p>had been in the hand of Toctamish, not of </p><p>the Syrian. Plainly, he thought, the Khir- </p><p>ghiz murderers had been fellows, without </p><p>knowing, to the Syrian. And he wondered </p><p>how men of many races came to be banded </p><p>together, not knowing that he was to wonder </p><p>soon, and very greatly, at other things. </p><p>V </p><p>BERCA had disappeared; and when </p><p>Khlit strode through the crowd of </p><p>the caravan seeking her, his horse </p><p>at his elbow, he met Toctamish. The Tatar </p><p>was mounted and leading the pack-mule. </p><p>“Mount,” he said gruffly, “and follow.” </p><p>“And what of the girl!” queried Khlit, </p><p>who was unwilling to take orders from </p><p>Toctamish. </p><p> “She has told us to go on, as you know,</p><p>caphar,” snarled the Tatar, who disliked </p><p>to talk. “Later, she will send word to us. </p><p>Come.” </p><p> “We are both fools. You, to be the slave</p><p>of a painted girl, and I to seek for an empire </p><p>which is not to be found, to slay a man </p><p>who is hidden.” </p><p> Khlit’s words were silenced by a sudden</p><p>uproar in the caravan. Men sprang to </p><p>their feet and hauled at the camels who </p><p>had kneeled in weariness. Traders who </p><p>had been eating gave shouts of lamentation. </p><p>Laden slaves ran together in confusion. </p><p> Toctamish stared at the uproar, until</p><p>Khlit touched his shoulder. </p><p> “Look!” he said.</p><p> From the south, over the salt desert a</p><p>cloud of dust was threading in and out </p><p>among the rocks. It was advancing swiftly </p><p>toward them, and the Cossack could see </p><p>that it was made by mounted men riding </p><p>very fast. He made out turbans and spear- </p><p>points in the dust. The horsemen were </p><p>headed directly toward the caravan. </p><p> “Robbers-,” said Toctamish briefly;</p><p>“there will be a fight.” </p><p> “A poor one, it seems,” growled Khlit.</p><p>“The Kurds are leaving us as fast as their </p><p>horses can take them and your countrymen </p><p>like the looks of things little—they have </p><p>not drawn sword or bow.” </p><p> In truth, the Tatars who were acting as</p><p>Alamut </p><p>13 </p><p>guard, sat their horses stolidly, while the </p><p>dismayed traders added to the confusion </p><p>by rushing about frantically, trying to </p><p>assemble their goods. Khlit turned his </p><p>attention, in disgust to the oncoming </p><p>horsemen, and counted a bare two score. </p><p>In numbers, the caravan was three times </p><p>as strong; yet no attempt at defense was </p><p>made. </p><p> Instead the traders were anxiously</p><p>spreading out their bales of goods, so that </p><p>all were displayed. Camels and donkeys </p><p>were stripped and their burden placed on </p><p>the ground. In the meantime the horse- </p><p>men who had come up were trampling </p><p>recklessly through the confusion. </p><p> A fat Greek merchant held out an armful</p><p>of rugs to one of the riders who stared at it </p><p>insolently and pointed to the heavy packs </p><p>behind the merchant. Other riders jerked </p><p>out the contents of these packs, and ranged </p><p>them in nine piles. </p><p> Khlit, watching them, saw that they</p><p>were men of varied race. He guessed at </p><p>Persian, Kurd, Circassian, Turk and others </p><p>with whom he was not familiar—dark- </p><p>skinned, and heavily-cloaked who sat their </p><p>horses as a swallow rides the wind. Also, </p><p>the Khirghiz men of the caravan had joined </p><p>the newcomers. </p><p> The first rider flung some words at the</p><p>Greek who was cowering on the ground </p><p>and Khlit thought he caught the phrase </p><p>“Alamut.” Then the horsemen picked up </p><p>three of the nine piles of goods, and flung </p><p>them over pack-horses. Other riders who </p><p>had been similarly occupied joined them. </p><p>All the while the Tatar guardians of the </p><p>caravan watched without interest, as men </p><p>who had seen the like before. </p><p> It was not until the horsemen were well</p><p>away over the salt plain that Khlit recov- </p><p>ered from his astonishment at the sight of </p><p>few robbing many. </p><p> “Better the mountain-folk than these,”</p><p>he growled, spitting in the direction of the </p><p>merchants who were putting their goods </p><p>away amid lamentations. </p><p> So it came to pass that a Cossack rode</p><p>into the foothills of Rudbar where, in the </p><p>words of the historian Abulghazi, none set </p><p>foot who held Allah or Christ for their true </p><p>God, and with him rode a Tatar who, under </p><p>other circumstances would gladly have slain </p><p>him. </p><p> They rode in silence, as rapidly as the</p><p>pack animal could move, and by nightfall </p><p>had gained the edge of the salt deposits </p><p>that made that part of Persia like a frozen </p><p>lake. </p><p> Each made camp after his fashion. And</p><p>two fires were lighted instead of one. </p><p>Khlit produced some barley cakes and </p><p>wine and made a good meal. Toctamish </p><p>took some raw meat from under his saddle </p><p>where he had placed it for seasoning and </p><p>washed it down with his favorite arak. </p><p>Both kindled pipes and sat in silence in the </p><p>darkness. </p><p> Toctamish’s pipe went out first, and</p><p>Khlit knew that the Tatar had swallowed </p><p>the smoke until with the burning arak he </p><p>had lost consciousness. The Cossack was </p><p>soon asleep. </p><p> His sleep was unbroken, except that,</p><p>near dawn, he thought he heard the tramp- </p><p>ling of many horses’ feet, which sounded </p><p>until the rays of the sun, slipping into liis </p><p>eyes, awoke him. He made out at some dis- </p><p>tance the track of a cavalcade in the dust, </p><p>and considered that it might have been </p><p>a caravan. Yet it was out of the path of </p><p>caravans. Moreover, he was reasonably </p><p>sure the track had not been there the night </p><p>before. Toctamish, when wakened, yawned </p><p>in bad spirits and told Khlit he was an old </p><p>woman, of great fear and unmentionable </p><p>descent. </p><p> When they resumed their path, it led</p><p>upward through the foothills of Rudbar. </p><p>A few date trees and some thorn bushes </p><p>lined the way, but for the most part there </p><p>was little foliage and many rocks. The </p><p>grass, however, was good, and this was, </p><p>perhaps, the reason why groups of horses </p><p>were met with under the care of single, </p><p>mounted horsemen who watched Khlit and </p><p>his companion with curiosity. </p><p> They rode apart and silently, as before.</p><p>Khlit’s thoughts dwelt on Berea’s last </p><p>words. The girl had spoken as one having </p><p>authority. She was no ordinary sheik’s </p><p>daughter, living out of sight of men, he </p><p>thought. She was daring, and he wondered </p><p>if she came from one of the hill-tribes where </p><p>the women ride with men. </p><p> Berea had told him they were in the land</p><p>of Halen ibn Shaddah, in the territory </p><p>of the Refik folk, yet Khlit saw no signs </p><p>of a town or city. He did see the tracks of </p><p>multitudes of horses in the mountains </p><p>where caravans were unknown. And the </p><p>horses themselves puzzled him. For he </p><p>could see nothing of their riders. </p><p>14 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Toctamish, apparently, wasted no</p><p>thought on his surroundings. He rode </p><p>warily, but kept his thoughts to himself </p><p>and pressed onward rapidly. Thus it was </p><p>that the two came to a wide, shallow river, </p><p>and followed the bank along a valley that </p><p>seemed to sink further into the hills as </p><p>they advanced. </p><p> Until sunset they rode, making detours</p><p>to avoid waterfalls and fording the river </p><p>where it curved—for it was very shallow— </p><p>and then Khlit who was in the lead came </p><p>to a halt as they rounded a bend. </p><p> “By the bones of Satan,” he swore, “here</p><p>is the place Berea told us of. Devil take </p><p>me, if it does not look like a dog with his </p><p>front paws in the river.” </p><p> Like an arched bow the river curved,</p><p>with the two riders standing at the end of </p><p>the bow looking inward. Across from </p><p>them rose a high point of rock, serried and </p><p>overgrown with bushes, several hundred </p><p>feet. No trees were on the summit of the </p><p>rock. Instead, Khlit could make out </p><p>masses of stones tumbling together and </p><p>overgrown. A few pillars stood up through </p><p>the debris. </p><p> Around the summit ran the semblance</p><p>of a wall. So great was the waste of stone </p><p>that it was hard to see any semblance of </p><p>order in it, but Khlit judged that a citadel </p><p>as big as a good-sized town had Once </p><p>crowned the dog-promontory. The rock </p><p>jutted out to make the massive head of the </p><p>beast, and ridges suggested paws. </p><p> “Here is no Alamut, Toctamish,” growled</p><p>Khlit in disgust. “Truly, we are fools—• </p><p>the little sparrow, Berea, has made game </p><p>of us.” </p><p> “Wait, caphar,” retorted Toctamish,</p><p>dismounting. “She said we would find the </p><p>dog sitting in the river, thus, and we have </p><p>found it. We will wait here and see what </p><p>happens.” </p><p> “Well, we will wait,” laughed Khlit,</p><p>“and see if the dog will give birth to a </p><p>tribe.” </p><p>VI </p><p>LITTLE Khlit suspected how true </p><p>his chance word was to be.- The </p><p>sun had dropped behind the furthest </p><p>mountain summit, and the night cold of </p><p>the high elevation had wrapped around the </p><p>two watchers when they saw a sight that </p><p>made their blood stir. </p><p> The Cossack had stretched on the ground</p><p>a little distance from Toctamish, who had </p><p>subsided into snores. He watched the last </p><p>light melt from the ruins on the summit of </p><p>the cliff, and as he watched he thought </p><p>he heard echoes from across the river, as </p><p>from far off. Straining his ears, he could </p><p>catch bursts of music and shouting. Re- </p><p>membering his experience with the horses </p><p>the previous night, he wondered if the </p><p>mountains were playing tricks with his </p><p>ears. </p><p> The sounds would come in bursts as</p><p>though a gate had been opened to let them </p><p>out, followed by silence. Khlit was not </p><p>at home in the hills, and he did not recognize </p><p>the peculiar resonance of echoes. What he </p><p>thought he heard were songs and shouts </p><p>repeated from mouth to mouth, as by </p><p>giants, in the heart of the rock opposite </p><p>him. </p><p> Lighting his pipe and cursing himself</p><p>for a dreaming fool, Khlit sat up and </p><p>scanned the darkness over the river. As </p><p>if to mock him, the burst of shouting </p><p>became clearer. And then the skfa moved </p><p>along Khlit’s back of its own accord and </p><p>his jaw dropped. He shook his head </p><p>angrily, to make sure he was still awake. </p><p> Out of the rock across the river a multi-</p><p>tude of lights were flickering. The lights </p><p>came toward him rapidly, and the shouting </p><p>grew. There were torches, moving out on </p><p>the river, and by their glare he could see </p><p>a mass of moving men armed with spears </p><p>and bows. Splashing through the water, </p><p>they were fording the shallow river. </p><p> Khlit could see that they were men of</p><p>varied race, turbaned and doaked, armed </p><p>for the most part with bow and arrows, </p><p>much like those who had robbed the cara- </p><p>van. As the throng came nearer, he shook </p><p>Toctamish and stood up. </p><p> “Loosen your sword, Father of Swine,”</p><p>he grunted, “here are men who are not </p><p>triflers.” </p><p> Several of the leaders, who had caught</p><p>sight of the two, closed around them. The </p><p>torchlight was thrown in their faces, and </p><p>for a moment the shouting of the band </p><p>was silenced as they surveyed Khlit and </p><p>his companion. One, very lean and dark </p><p>of face, dressed in a white coat bossed with </p><p>gold, and wearing a tufted turban of the </p><p>same colors, spoke in a tongue Khlit did not </p><p>understand. </p><p> “Hey, brothers,” swore Khlit genially,</p><p>Alamut </p><p>15 </p><p>laughing, for the presence of danger pleased </p><p>him, “have you any who speak like Chris- </p><p>tians? Khlit, called the Wolf, would speak </p><p>with you.” </p><p> After some delay, a dirty tribesman was</p><p>thrust beside the man of white and gold. </p><p> “Wherefore are you here?” the tribesman,</p><p>who seemed to be a Kurd, asked in broken </p><p>Russian, “and what is your purpose? Be </p><p>brief, for the Dais are impatient to march. </p><p>Are you a Christian, Cossack?” </p><p> “Say that you are not,” whispered</p><p>Toctamish, who had caught what was said, </p><p>“for none with a god can go into the </p><p>mountain.” </p><p> “A dog will give up his faith,” snarled</p><p>Khlit, “but a Cossack does not deny God </p><p>and the Orthodox Church. Aye,” he re- </p><p>sponded to the Kurd, “I am a Christian. </p><p>I have come to Rudbar, or to Alamut, </p><p>whatever you call the place, to seek him </p><p>who is called the Old Man of the Moun- </p><p>tain. What is your name and faith?” </p><p> A peculiar look of fear crossed the face of</p><p>the Kurd. </p><p> “Seek you the Master of the Mountain,</p><p>Sheik Halen ibn Shaddah, Cossack? My </p><p>name is Iba Kabash, and I was once a </p><p>Christian. What is your mission with </p><p>the Lord of Alamut?” </p><p> “Tell the unbeliever we have come to</p><p>join the Refik, where there is no law—” </p><p>began Toctamish, but Khlit motioned him </p><p>to silence. </p><p> “Take us to Sheik Halen ibn Shaddah,</p><p>and we will tell him our mission, Iba </p><p>Kabash,” he retorted. “We are not men </p><p>to parley with slaves.” </p><p> The man of white and gold had grown</p><p>impatient, and spoke a few angry words to </p><p>Iba Kabash, who cringed. Several of the </p><p>bowmen ranged themselves beside them, </p><p>and the throng pushed past, leaving a single </p><p>torch with the Kurd, who motioned to </p><p>Khlit to follow him. Leaving their horses </p><p>with an attendant, Khlit and Toctamish</p><p>made their way after Iba Kabash to the </p><p>river. The current was not overswift, and </p><p>the water came barely to their knees. </p><p> “It is the wish of the Dai, Cossack, that</p><p>you shall enter Alamut. What is your mis- </p><p>sion? Tell me and I shall be a true friend. </p><p>I swear it. Surely you have a strong reason </p><p>for your coming,” the Kurd’s greasy head </p><p>was thrust close to the Cossack’s. “Let </p><p>me hear but a word.” </p><p> “If the Dai named you guide, Iba Kabash,</p><p>of the mangy beard, lead us, and talk not.” </p><p> In his heart Khlit distrusted the offered</p><p>friendship of the Kurd. And he watched </p><p>closely where they went, across the Shahrud, </p><p>into the shadows of the further bank. And </p><p>he saw how it was the Dai’s followers had </p><p>come from the mountain. </p><p> Concealed by the shadows, were grottoes,</p><p>where the water had eaten into the rock, </p><p>grottoes which ran deep into the mountain. </p><p>The torch reflected from the dark surface </p><p>of the water, as they splashed forward, </p><p>with the river becoming shallower. Pres- </p><p>ently they stood on dry rock. Here they </p><p>were in a cave, of which Khlit could not see </p><p>the top. </p><p> Iba Kabash pulled impatiently at his arm</p><p>and they went forward, and up. Khlit </p><p>saw that now they were on rock which was </p><p>the handiwork of man. They were ascend- </p><p>ing broad steps, each one a pace in width, </p><p>and so broad that the torch barely showed </p><p>rows of stone pillars on either side. </p><p> Khlit had counted fifty steps when Iba</p><p>Kabash came to a halt, grinning. Lifting </p><p>the torch overhead, he pointed to a square </p><p>stone, set in the rocky roof of the stairs. </p><p>On this rock were lines of writing strange to </p><p>Khlit, and blackened with age and the </p><p>dampness of the place. </p><p> “The gateway of Alamut, oh, Cossack,”</p><p>laughed the Kurd. “And the writing of </p><p>one who was as great as Mohammed, </p><p>prophet of Allah. And the message: </p><p> ‘‘With the help of God</p><p> The ruler of the world</p><p> Loosened the bands of the law,</p><p> Blessed be his name.”</p><p> Khlit was silent. He had not expected</p><p>to find himself in a cave in the heart of </p><p>a mountain. The darkness and damp, </p><p>rising from the river, chilled him. Glancing </p><p>ahead, he saw a rocky passage, wide and </p><p>lofty. The passage had been made by the </p><p>river, perhaps in a former age, when it had </p><p>risen to that level. But the hands of men </p><p>had widened it and smoothed the walls. </p><p>Toctamish, he saw, was scrutinizing his </p><p>surroundings, his slant eyes staring from a </p><p>lined, yellow face. </p><p> “Come,” said Iba Kabash, who seemed</p><p>to enjoy the silence of his visitors, “this was </p><p>not the gateway of Alamut always, in the </p><p>days of the first Master of the Mountain. </p><p>And Alamut has changed. It has sunk into </p><p>the mountain. Men say the old Alamut </p><p>was destroyed.” </p><p>i6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Aye,” said Toctamish suddenly, “by</p><p>Hulagu Khan.” </p><p> The Kurd stared at him curiously.</p><p> “Come,” he muttered, and led the way up</p><p>the winding rock passage. </p><p> Khlit followed closely. Other passages</p><p>joined the one they were in. At times, </p><p>sounds came down these passages—distant </p><p>rumblings, and strains of music. Occasion- </p><p>ally a figure armed with a spear stepped </p><p>from them and scanned the group. Always </p><p>a wind whipped around them, cold, in spite </p><p>of the heat of the air outside. </p><p> After a time, Khlit saw that they were no</p><p>longer in the passage. The torch did not </p><p>reveal walls, and the footing was regular, </p><p>of stone slabs. They had entered a cham- </p><p>ber of some kind. Other torches made their </p><p>appearance suddenly. The sound of voices </p><p>came to them clearly. </p><p> They approached a fire around which</p><p>lay several armed men. Khlit guessed from </p><p>their dress that they were Khirghiz men; </p><p>furthermore, that they appeared drunk. </p><p>Only one or two looked up, without interest. </p><p>Iba Kabash led them past many fires and </p><p>men until they came to narrow stone stairs </p><p>which led away from the rock chambers. </p><p>Here, a giant Turk spoke with Iba Kabash </p><p>before letting them pass. </p><p> “We will speak with Rashideddin,” whis-</p><p>pered the Kurd, “the astrologer of Halen </p><p>ibn Shaddah. Tell me now your mission? </p><p>I can help you.” </p><p> Toctamish would have spoken, fingering</p><p>a money pouch at his belt on which the </p><p>Kurd’s gaze fastened greedily, but Khlit </p><p>shook his head. With a sneer, their guide </p><p>stepped on the stairway. Khlit climbed </p><p>after him, and noted that the stairs wound </p><p>up still further. He guessed that they </p><p>had ascended several hundred feet since </p><p>leaving the bed of the river. </p><p> Then, leaving the stair, he found himself</p><p>in a round chamber, hung with tapestries </p><p>and rugs of great beauty. Several oil </p><p>lamps, suspended from the ceiling lighted</p><p>the place. A warm breath of air caused </p><p>him to look up. A circular opening formed </p><p>the center of the ceiling, and through this </p><p>he could see the stars and the velvet vault </p><p>of the sky. </p><p> Two of the dark-faced men, strange to</p><p>Khlit, like the Dai of white and gold, stood </p><p>by the wall, wearing mail and resting on </p><p>spears. A small ebony table was loaded </p><p>with parchments and instruments which </p><p>the Cossack had never seen before. In </p><p>the center of the floor was a chess-board, </p><p>and sitting on either side of the chess- </p><p>board were two men. </p><p> One, Khlit recognized by his tufted</p><p>turban and brilliant white coat, to be of the </p><p>kind Iba Kabash had called Dai. The other </p><p>wore a close-fitting skullcap and a gray </p><p>cloak without a sash. He looked at Khlit </p><p>and the latter saw a lean face, gray, almost </p><p>as the cloak, 'with close-set black eyes, and a </p><p>loose-lipped mouth, very pale. </p><p> “Oh, Rashideddin,” said Iba Kabash,</p><p>“here are the two who have just come, of </p><p>whom I have sent word. The Cossack is </p><p>a Christian and insolent. The other is alto? </p><p>gether a fool.” </p><p>VII </p><p>gZta RASHIDEDDIN is mentioned in </p><p>the annals of Abulghazi as a savant </p><p>of the khali/ate of Bagdad and </p><p>Damascus. He was a Persian, trained in </p><p>the arts of astrology and divination, who </p><p>could recite from memory the works of </p><p>Jelaleddin Rumi. He was acquainted with </p><p>many languages including Russian and </p><p>Tatar. It is believed that he possessed </p><p>all the works of the Alamut library which </p><p>escaped the destructive hands of Hulagu </p><p>Khan. </p><p> Inscrutable, and gifted, Rashideddin</p><p>made a mockery of the Koran. He kept </p><p>his truly great wisdom to himself, except </p><p>for certain poems which he sent to princes </p><p>of Persia and Arabia, who gained no happi- </p><p>ness thereby. So it was not strange that </p><p>Rashideddin, the savant of dark knowledge </p><p>came to a place of evil, of strange and very </p><p>potent evil. So say the annals of Abul- </p><p>ghazi. </p><p> Rashideddin did not look at his visitors.</p><p>He lifted a piece with care and replaced it </p><p>on the chessboard. The Dai, who Khlit </p><p>observed, was drunk, as were the men </p><p>aroimd the fires, yet very pale, did likewise. </p><p>Khlit, who had small liking for chess, </p><p>watched the players rather than the board. </p><p>Especially did he watch Rashideddin. The </p><p>pale-lipped astrologer sat with half-closed </p><p>eyes, intent and motionless. The gray </p><p>cloak seemed not to move with his breath- </p><p>ing. When he spoke, his deep and musical </p><p>voice startled them. </p><p> “Have you a god, Cossack? Is your</p><p>faith firm in the Christian cross you wear </p><p>around your neck?” </p><p>Alamut </p><p>17 </p><p> Startled, Khlit moved his hand to his</p><p>throat, where hung a small, gold cross. </p><p>Iba Kabash was making hasty signs to him </p><p>which he did not see. </p><p> “Aye, Rashideddin,” said he gravely,</p><p>“the batko has told me about the cross which </p><p>I carry, and it is a talisman against evil. </p><p>Hey, it has been good, that cross, be- </p><p>cause I have killed many and am still </p><p>living.” </p><p> “Evil?” said Rashideddin, and moved</p><p>a jeweled chessman to another square. </p><p>“The earth is evil. If a saint handles </p><p>earth it becomes gold. Yet who has seen </p><p>a saint? Do you seek to bring your cross </p><p>into Alamut?” </p><p> “Not so, Rashideddin,” vouchsafed Khlit,</p><p>crossing his arms. “I bring a sword to </p><p>Alamut, to Halen ibn Shaddah. The cross </p><p>is my own. If you can see it through my </p><p>svitza then you must have good eyes. I am </p><p>outcast from my people of the Ukraine, </p><p>and men told me there was work for swords </p><p>with Halen ibn Shaddah.” </p><p> “And you call yourself Khlit, the Wolf?”</p><p>queried the astrologer. “How did you find </p><p>the gate of Alamut?” </p><p> Khlit was bewildered at the astrologer’s</p><p>knowledge of his name until he remembered </p><p>that he had told it to Iba Kabash. </p><p> “Aye. There was a caravan by the Sea</p><p>of Khozar that a band from Alamut robbed. </p><p>We,” Khlit bethought him swiftly, “fol- </p><p>lowed the riders to the mountains and </p><p>waited by the gate.” </p><p> Rashideddin considered the chessboard</p><p>silently. </p><p> “You came over the Sea of Khozar,” he</p><p>murmured, “from Astrakan? That must </p><p>have been the way. There is another way </p><p>around by land that the caravans take. </p><p>They are our prey. What the Kallmark </p><p>Tatars leave the merchants, we share. Did </p><p>you see a Syrian armorer in Astrakan?” </p><p>“Aye, a bearded fellow. We stayed at </p><p>his house. He told us we might find use for </p><p>our swords with Halen ibn Shaddah.”</p><p>With a delicate movement, Rashideddin </p><p>lifted one of his opponent’s pieces from the </p><p>board. </p><p> “And your companion?” he said.</p><p> “A Tatar horseman who has quarreled</p><p>with his kin,” spoke up Toctamish bluntly. </p><p>“I’m tired of laws, noble sir, and I-” </p><p> “Laws are too complex, Tatar. If a</p><p>man has an enemy, slay him. If a man </p><p>desires a certain thing, take it. Are not </p><p>9. </p><p>these the only laws? In Alamut you are </p><p>free from all laws except those of the Rejik. </p><p>You have an image of Natagai in your </p><p>girdle, Tatar.” Rashideddin had not looked </p><p>at Toctamish since the first moment. </p><p>“Take it and throw it on the floor.” </p><p> Toctamish hesitated. He glanced irreso-</p><p>lutely at Khlit; then drew out a small cloth </p><p>figure, painted like a doll and tossed it on </p><p>the stones. The Cossack saw that it was </p><p>ragged and worn by much use. He had </p><p>not suspected that his companion cherished </p><p>ahy holy image. </p><p> “Spit on it,” directed Rashideddin softly.</p><p> With a muttered curse Toctamish did so.</p><p>His lined face was damp with perspiration, </p><p>and Khlit saw that his hands were trem- </p><p>bling. The shifting eyes of Iba Kabash </p><p>gleamed mockingly. </p><p> “The armorer at Astrakan must have told</p><p>you that Alamut is no place for one who </p><p>has a god,” went on Rashideddin. “There </p><p>is one here who is greater than Mohammed. </p><p>We are his servants. Yet our akd says that </p><p>none go forth who are not of us. Think, </p><p>Khlit, and decide. Meanwhile-” </p><p> The astrologer spoke to Iba Kabash in</p><p>another tongue and the Kurd went to a </p><p>comer of the room where a pile of rugs and </p><p>cloths lay. Selecting a long, white cloth, </p><p>he laid it in front of Khlit. This done, </p><p>he stepped back, licking his thick lips </p><p>softly. </p><p> “Tell the Cossack what you have done,</p><p>Iba Kabash,” said Rashideddin.</p><p> “This cloth,” whispered the Kurd, “is a</p><p>shroud, Khlit. The astrologer may call his </p><p>men and lay you in it dead, unless you say </p><p>you have no god. Do as your friend— </p><p>remember I have given you good advice. </p><p>You are in a place where your life is worth </p><p>no more than a dagger-thrust. Your sword </p><p>will be useless.” </p><p> With a beating heart, Khlit glanced</p><p>around the chamber. The two mailed </p><p>Tatars were watching him silently. He </p><p>thought he could see the dim forms of other </p><p>men in recesses in the wall. And for all </p><p>Rashideddin’s unconcern, he felt that the </p><p>astrologer was alive to every move he made. </p><p>He felt as he had once when the Krim </p><p>Tatars had bound his limbs, leaving him </p><p>powerless. </p><p> “Aye,” he said.</p><p> Without looking at Rashideddin, he</p><p>moved to the pile of cloths and selected </p><p>another shroud. This he brought back </p><p>i8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>and placed beside the other. Iba Kabash </p><p>watched him with staring eyes. The Dai </p><p>frowned and fingered a dagger at his girdle. </p><p>Khlit drew his curved sword and stood over </p><p>the white cloths. </p><p> “Tell Rashideddin, Iba Kabash,” he said,</p><p>“what this othfir shroud is for.” </p><p> “What—how do you mean?” muttered</p><p>the Kurd. </p><p> “It is for the man who first tries to kill</p><p>me, dog,” snarled Khlit. </p><p> The astrologer bent over the chessboard</p><p>impassively. Apparently he was blind to </p><p>what passed in the room and to the words </p><p>of Iba Kabash. The others watched him, </p><p>and there was silence. Until Rashideddin </p><p>raised his head suddenly and compressed his </p><p>pale Ups. </p><p> “You fool,” he smiled, “blunderer of the</p><p>steppes! This is not Russia. Here there </p><p>is one law, *and punishment; murder! </p><p>See!” </p><p> He pointed a white hand at one of the</p><p>mailed Tatars. The man started forward, </p><p>and drew back shivering. </p><p> “Kill thyself, fellow,” said Rashideddin</p><p>quietly. </p><p> The Tatar stared at him and cast a help-</p><p>less glance around the room. Khlit saw his </p><p>right hand go to his girdle and tremble </p><p>convulsively. </p><p> “Fedaviel” the astrologer’s voice was</p><p>gentle, “show the Russian our law. By the </p><p>oath of the Refik, kill thyself!” </p><p> With a grunt of sheer terror the man</p><p>dropped his spear. His right hand rose </p><p>from the girdle, gripping a dagger curved </p><p>like a flame. Rose, and sank into his </p><p>throat. With the hilt of the dagger wedged </p><p>under his chin, the Tatar sagged to the </p><p>floor, quivered and was still. One blood- </p><p>stained hand had fallen among the chess- </p><p>men. </p><p> There was silence in the room for a</p><p>moment, broken by Toctamish. The Tatar </p><p>stepped to Khlit’s side. </p><p> “You and I are brothers, Cossack,” he</p><p>growled, “and your danger is my dan- </p><p>ger.” </p><p> Rashideddin, who had given a sigh of</p><p>pleasure at the death of the attendant, </p><p>studied the disordered chessmen impas- </p><p>sively. The Dai sprang to his feet with an </p><p>oath. For several heart-beats no one </p><p>moved. Iba Kabash stared in fascination </p><p>at a red pool which had formed under the </p><p>dead Tatar’s head. </p><p>vni </p><p>?.™3 THE astrologer, apparently giving </p><p>Bmla lIP as hopeless the attempt to re- </p><p>place the chessmen, stood up. And </p><p>Khlit, who was watching, wondered at his </p><p>figure. The man was bent so that his back </p><p>was in the form of a bow. His head stuck </p><p>forward, pale as a fish’s belly, topped by </p><p>the red skullcap. His gray cloak came to </p><p>the ground. Yet when he moved, it was </p><p>with a soft quickness. </p><p> “You see,” he said, as if nothing had</p><p>happened, “the oath of Alamut—obedience, </p><p>and-” </p><p> He stirred the shroud contemptuously</p><p>with his foot. Then, as if arriving at a </p><p>decision, he turned to Iba Kabash. </p><p> “Take these clowns to the banquet-place,</p><p>and give them food. See that they are </p><p>not harmed.” </p><p> With that he motioned to the Dai and</p><p>retreated through one of the recesses. </p><p>Toctamish wiped his brow on which the </p><p>perspiration had gathered and touched the </p><p>dead man with his foot. </p><p> “The good Rashideddin will not kill you,”</p><p>chanted the Kurd eagerly. “It must be </p><p>a miracle, for you are both fools. You have </p><p>me to thank for your safety. I have given </p><p>good advice, have I not?” </p><p> Toctamish eyed him dubiously. He did</p><p>not feel oversure of safety. Khlit, how- </p><p>ever, whispered to him. Rashideddin was </p><p>not the man to play with them if he desired </p><p>their death. It might be that the astrol-</p><p>oger’s words were in good faith—Khlit </p><p>learned later that the latter never troubled </p><p>to lie—and if so they would gain nothing </p><p>and lose much by staying where they </p><p>were. </p><p> So it happened that both warriors</p><p>sheathed their swords with apparent good </p><p>grace and followed Iba Kabash who led </p><p>them through empty rooms until they came </p><p>out on a balcony overlooking the banquet- </p><p>place of Alamut. And Khlit was little </p><p>prepared for what he saw now. </p><p> The warm wind touched their faces again.</p><p>Iba Kabash pointed up. In the center of </p><p>the lofty ceiling of the place a square open- </p><p>ing let in the starlight. A crescent moon </p><p>added to the light which threw a silver sheen </p><p>over the great floor of the hall. Toctamish </p><p>grunted in surprise. </p><p> At first it seemed as if they were looking</p><p>on the camp of an army from a hillside. </p><p>Alamut </p><p>19 </p><p> Dozens of fires smoldered on the floor</p><p> below them, and a hundred oil lamps</p><p> sprinkled the intervening space. About</p><p> the lamps men were lying, around small</p><p> tables on which fruit, wine and dishes</p><p> massed. A buzz of voices echoed down</p><p> the hall, and Khlit was reminded of bees</p><p> stirring about the surface of a hive.</p><p> The sound of eating and drinking</p><p> drowned the noise of voices. Along the</p><p> stone balcony where they stood other</p><p> tables were placed with lamps. Numerous</p><p> dark figures carried food and drink to these</p><p> h and carried away the refuse left at other</p><p> tables.</p><p> “Slaves,” said the Kurd, “captives of</p><p> the Refik. Let us find a table and eat.</p><p> It is a lucky night that I met you, for I</p><p> shall go into the paradise of Alamut.”</p><p> Khlit paid little attention to the last</p><p> phrase. Later, he was to remember it.</p><p> Being very hungry he sat down with</p><p> Toctamish at a convenient table and took</p><p> some of the bread and roasted meat which</p><p> he found there. Toctamish was less re-</p><p> strained, and gulped down everything with</p><p> zest.</p><p> As he ate Khlit considered his com-</p><p> panions, and the banquet-place. All of</p><p> them, he noticed, seemed drowsy, as if</p><p> drunk, or very gay. In the lamplight</p><p> their faces showed white. They lay in</p><p> heaps about the tables, sometimes one on</p><p> the other.</p><p> To the Cossack drunkenness was no sin,</p><p> yet there was something about the white</p><p> faces and limp figures of the men that</p><p> stirred his blood. And the smell of the</p><p> place was unpleasant, a damp, musky odor</p><p> seemed to rise from the hall under them,</p><p> as of beasts. Piles of fruit lay rotting</p><p> about the floor.</p><p> “It is time,” chattered the Kurd, who</p><p> was sipping at a goblet of wine, “Halen ibn</p><p> Shaddah showed himself. He comes to</p><p> the banquet-place every night, and we</p><p> drink to him. Drink, Khlit—are not</p><p> Cossacks born with a grape in their mouths?</p><p> You are lucky to be alive, for Rashideddin</p><p> is a viper without mercy.”</p><p> “Who is this Rashideddin?” asked Khlit,</p><p> setting down the wine, for it was not to his</p><p> liking.</p><p> “Oh, he is the wise man of the arch-</p><p> prophet—the master of Alamut. He knows</p><p> more magic than all the Greeks and der-</p><p> vishes put together. He reads the stars,</p><p>and tells our master when it is time to send </p><p>out expeditions. They say he has servants </p><p>in every city of the world. But I think </p><p>he learns everything from the magic </p><p>sands.” Iba Kabash’s tongue was out- </p><p>stripping his wit. “There is nothing that </p><p>goes on in Persia and Tartary that he </p><p>does not see. How did he know you wore </p><p>a cross?” </p><p> “He saw the chain at my neck, fool,”</p><p>retorted Khlit. </p><p> He began to feel strangely elated. He</p><p>had had only a little wine, but his head was </p><p>whirling and he had a curious languor in </p><p>his limbs. The trouble extended to his </p><p>eyes, for as he looked at the banquet-place, </p><p>it seemed to have grown wider and lighter. </p><p>He could see that Toctamish was half- </p><p>unconscious. </p><p> Thus it was that Khlit, the Wolf, in the</p><p>banquet-place of Alamut came under the </p><p>influence of the strange evil that gripped </p><p>the place. And came to know of the great </p><p>wickedness, which set Alamut apart from </p><p>the world, as with a curse. </p><p> Khlit, turning the situation over in his</p><p>mind, saw that it was best to play the part </p><p>he had taken on himself. He doubted if </p><p>it were possible to escape past the guards </p><p>by the river stairway, even if he could free </p><p>himself from the guardianship of Iba </p><p>Kabash. Rashideddin, he felt, had not </p><p>left his visitors unwatched. Also, he was </p><p>curious to see further of the strange world </p><p>of Alamut, which was a riddle of which he </p><p>had not found the key. He had seen a </p><p>Tatar kill himself at a word from the </p><p>astrologer, and Iba Kabash who was a man </p><p>without honor, speak with awe of the master </p><p>of Alamut. Who was Halen ibn Shaddah? </p><p>And what was his power over the men of </p><p>Alamut? </p><p> As it happened, it was not long before</p><p>Khlit saw die man he was seeking, and </p><p>whom he was sworn to kill. There came </p><p>a pause in the murmur of talk and Iba </p><p>Kabash clutched his shoulder. </p><p> “Look!” he whispered. “Here is Sheik</p><p>Halen ibn Shaddah, who will choose those </p><p>to go into paradise tonight. You are new- </p><p>comers in Alamut and he may choose you, </p><p>whereon I shall follow behind without </p><p>being seen. Pray that his eye may fall on </p><p>us, for few go to paradise.” </p><p> Across the banquet-place, on the stone</p><p>balcony, Khlit saw a group of torches. </p><p>The bearers were Dais. In the center of </p><p>20 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the torches stood a tall man, dressed as the </p><p>Dais except that he wore no turban, a cloak </p><p>covering his head, drawn down so that </p><p>nothing could be seen of his face. The </p><p>sheik’s shoulders were very broad and the </p><p>hands that rested on his girdle were </p><p>heavy. </p><p> As Khlit watched, Halen ibn Shaddah</p><p>moved along the balcony among the eaters. </p><p>On the banquet floor a murmur grew into </p><p>a shout— </p><p> “Blessed be he that has unmade all laws;</p><p>who is master of the akd; chief of chief, </p><p>prophet of prophets, sheik of sheiks; who </p><p>holds the keys of the gate of paradise.” </p><p> Iba Kabash shouted as if in ecstacy,</p><p>rising on his knees and beating his palms </p><p>together, as the group of the sheik came </p><p>nearer them. Once or twice Khlit saw </p><p>Halen ibn Shaddah beckon to a man who </p><p>rose hastily and followed the Dais. Iba </p><p>Kabash, he thought, was drunk, yet not </p><p>in a fashion known to Cossacks. Klilit </p><p>himself felt drowsy, although clear in mind. </p><p>He saw that the noise had wakened Toc- </p><p>tamish who was swaying on his haunches </p><p>and muttering. </p><p> Halen ibn Shaddah stood over them,</p><p>and Khlit thought that one of the Dais </p><p>whispered to him. The Cossack had fast- </p><p>ened his gaze greedily on the cloaked face, </p><p>for he wished to see the face of the master </p><p>of Alamut. He could make out only a </p><p>round, dark countenance, and eyes that </p><p>showed much white. Vaguely he remem- </p><p>bered that he had seen others who had </p><p>faces like that, but he could not think who </p><p>they were. The sight of Halen ibn Shaddah </p><p>affected him like the foul smell of the </p><p>banquet-place and the rat-eyes of Iba </p><p>Kabash. Halen ibn Shaddah beckoned to </p><p>him and Toctamish. </p><p> Klilit supported his companion to his feet,</p><p>but found that the wine had taken away </p><p>all his own strength. Hands, belonging, </p><p>he suspected to slaves, helped him after the </p><p>white • figures of the Dais. They passed </p><p>from the banquet-place through passages </p><p>that he could see only dimly. The torch- </p><p>light vanished, and there came a silence,</p><p>which was broken by music, very sweet. </p><p>Khlit’s head was swimming strangely, </p><p>and he felt himself moving forward through </p><p>darkness. Darkness in which the music </p><p>echoed, being repeated softly as he had </p><p>heard the voices repeated when they first </p><p>came into the passages of Alamut. </p><p> IX</p><p>IF IT was a dream, Klilit asked </p><p>himself, why should he be able to </p><p>taste the red wine that trinkled </p><p>down his throat? Yet if it were not a </p><p>dream, why should a torrent of the red </p><p>wine issue from a rock? And sunlight </p><p>burn on the red current, when Klilit was in </p><p>the passages of Alamut, under the ground? </p><p> Truly, it must be a dream, he thought.</p><p>It seemed that he was lying on his side </p><p>near the flowing wine, with the sun warm </p><p>on his face. Whenever he wanted to drink, </p><p>he did not need to sit up, for he raised his </p><p>hand and a girl with flowers around her </p><p>head and breast came, and filled some </p><p>vessel which she held out to him. Khlit </p><p>was very thirsty and the wine was good. </p><p> The girl, he felt, sat by him, and her</p><p>finger-nails and the soles of her bare feet </p><p>were red. He had never seen such a </p><p>maiden, for her hair also was red, and the </p><p>sun glinted through it as she drew it across </p><p>his face. Her hair must be perfumed, he </p><p>thought, like the harlots of Samarkand, for </p><p>it smelled very good. </p><p> The music came to his ears from time to</p><p>time, and he snorted, for Khlit was no lover </p><p>of soft sounds. Neither did he fully relish </p><p>the wine, which was oversweet. He was </p><p>well content to be in the sun, and too </p><p>drowsy to wonder how it happened. </p><p> The dream, if it was that, changed, and</p><p>Khlit was in a boat lying on some rugs. </p><p>The boat was drifting along a canal. From </p><p>time to tune it would pass under a porcelain </p><p>kiosk, tasselled and inlaid with ivory. </p><p>From these kiosks girls laughed down at him </p><p>and threw flowers. One of the tinted faces </p><p>was like Berea’s, and Klilit thought then it </p><p>was surely a dream. </p><p> One other thing he remembered. It was</p><p>in a grove of date trees where young boys </p><p>ran, shouting, and pelted each other with</p><p>fruit. In spite of the warmth and pleasant- </p><p>ness, Khlit felt very tired. He was in the </p><p>shade of one of the date trees with his sword </p><p>across his knees. The music was very </p><p>faint here, for which he was glad. He </p><p>seemed very wakeful. The air was clear, </p><p>and looking up he could see the sky, be- </p><p>tween jagged walls of stone. He had seen </p><p>other walls of stone like these. That was </p><p>when he and Toctamish had stood at the </p><p>Shahrud looking up at the dog rock that </p><p>was Alamut. </p><p>Alamut </p><p>21 </p><p> Even in the dream, Khlit felt ill. He</p><p>saw the damsel of the red hair and flowers </p><p>and beckoned to her, for he was thirsty. </p><p>She ran away, probably at the sight of his </p><p>sword. Khlit felt angry, for she had given </p><p>him drink for what seemed many years. </p><p> Then he saw the gray-cloaked figure of</p><p>Rashideddin, the astrologer of Alamut, </p><p>beside him, and the white face stared at </p><p>him until Khlit fidgeted. He heard Rashid- </p><p>eddin speak, very faintly. </p><p> “Where art thou?”</p><p> Khlit was too tired to answer at first.</p><p> “I know not,” he said finally.</p><p> “Thou art in paradise, and by favor of</p><p>Halen ibn Shaddah. Do not forget.” </p><p>Truly, Khlit had not forgotten. There </p><p>were other things he remembered. Vistas </p><p>of blue pools where dark-skinned men </p><p>bathed, and date groves where bright- </p><p>colored birds walked, dragging their tails </p><p>on tije ground. He saw girls pass, hand in </p><p>hand, singing. And the music did not </p><p>cease. </p><p> If it had been a dream, Khlit said to</p><p>himself, how could the taste of the strange </p><p>wine stick to his palate? Or the warmth </p><p>of the sun be still burning on his skin? </p><p>Nay, surely it must have been a dream. </p><p>And the waking was disagreeable. </p><p> The place where he found himself on</p><p>waking was dark, wet and smelled strongly </p><p>of wine dregs. Khlit rose to his knees </p><p>cautiously and felt about him with his hand. </p><p>He could feel the outline of something round </p><p>and moist on all sides except overhead. </p><p>Also he came upon the body of a man lying </p><p>by him, which he identified by its fur tunic </p><p>and peaked helmet as Toctamish. The </p><p>Tatar was snoring heavily. </p><p> “Wake, Flat-Face and son of an unclean</p><p>animal,” he growled, shaking him. “We </p><p>are no longer in paradise. Devil take me, </p><p>if it ain’t a wine cask.” </p><p> Toctamish roused at length and sat up</p><p>reluctantly.</p><p> “Is it you, caphar?” he asked, stretching</p><p>himself. “Many times have I been drunk </p><p>as an ox, but never such as this. May the </p><p>devil bite me, if there was ever such wine! </p><p>Let us find some more.” </p><p> “Then you have been dreaming, also,”</p><p>meditated Khlit. “Did you imagine that </p><p>you saw Berea?” </p><p> “Berea? Nay, but she said that she</p><p>would visit us here. That was no dream, </p><p>caphar, for there was sunlight, and much </p><p>feasting. Did Rashideddin tell you it was </p><p>paradise? I met other Tatars there. They </p><p>told me what it was.” </p><p> “Were they also men who dishonored</p><p>their god at Rashideddin’s bidding? What </p><p>said they concerning this paradise of </p><p>yours?” </p><p> Toctamish snarled in anger, at the</p><p>memory of the scene by the chessboard. </p><p> “You are one without brains, Cossack,</p><p>and it is well that we are here alive. My </p><p>companions said this: that all who came to </p><p>Alamut were admitted to the paradise by </p><p>Halen ibn Shaddah, if they were worthy. </p><p>Then, if they were killed in the ranks of </p><p>the Rejik their souls returned to the para- </p><p>dise. That was a lie, for how can there be </p><p>a soul in a man?” </p><p> Khlit said nothing. But he thought that</p><p>he had found the key to the riddle. Halen </p><p>ibn Shaddah’s power lay in the lusts of his </p><p>men. They looked on him, even so shrewd </p><p>a man as Iba Kabash, as one who held the </p><p>secret of paradise. And, although he did </p><p>not know it, Khlit’s thought had come near </p><p>to the evil of Alamut, which was a plague </p><p>spot on the face of the world. </p><p>X </p><p>IN THE next few days the two </p><p>warriors, bound together by mutual </p><p>interest, although cordially hating </p><p>each other, made frequent explorations of </p><p>the chambers of Alamut. In the daytime </p><p>sunlight filtered in at the banquet-place, </p><p>the round chamber of Rashideddin and </p><p>other places, but at night the only light </p><p>was from lamps or torches. The chambers</p><p>were large enough to hold a hundred men </p><p>in each and there were many. Khlit, who </p><p>had keen eyes, learned several things, in- </p><p>cluding the place of the Refik treasure. </p><p> First, a certain area was guarded against*</p><p>intrusion by picked Tatars and Arabs. </p><p>Into the guarded chambers he had seen </p><p>Dais and other higher dignitaries called </p><p>Dailkebirs go, and he guessed they were </p><p>occupied by Halen ibn Shaddah and his </p><p>court, where was kept the gold that flowed </p><p>into Alamut as tribute money. </p><p> Also, there was no exit from the chambers</p><p>of Alamut save by way of the stairway </p><p>and the river, which was guarded. Fre- </p><p>quently armed bands went in and out, also </p><p>messengers of many races, but all were </p><p>closely watched. Moreover, few except old </p><p>22 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>residents of the place, like Iba Kabash, the </p><p>Kurd, knew the way to the river stairway. </p><p> The slaves, he learned, brought food not</p><p>from the river stairway, but another source. </p><p>Also wood for the fires. The warriors of </p><p>Alamut, fedavie, as they were called, lived </p><p>as they chose, under the eyes of the Dais, </p><p>ornamenting their quarters with spoil taken </p><p>in raids or from caravans. Each man was </p><p>richly decked in whatever suited his fancy, </p><p>of silks or jewels. The Dais who com- </p><p>manded them took interest in them only </p><p>when it was time to take an expedition out </p><p>of Alamut. </p><p> So much Khlit saw, and more he learned</p><p>from the talkative Iba Kabash, who had </p><p>won some gold at dice from Toctamish, and </p><p>was inclined to be friendly. The slaves, </p><p>he said, brought the food from the side of </p><p>Alamut away from the river, where they </p><p>drew it up in baskets to the summit of a </p><p>wall that barred all egress from the citadel. </p><p> Iba Kabash had not been beyond the</p><p>walls of Alamut since his entry. Yet he had </p><p>heard much of the empire of the Refik that </p><p>stretched its power from Semarkand to </p><p>Aleppo and from Astrakan to Basra. The </p><p>murderers of the Refik were feared so </p><p>greatly, he explained, that tribute was </p><p>paid by the cities to Alamut. Questioned </p><p>by Khlit, he admitted that in numbers </p><p>any of the califates were superior to Alamut. </p><p>The power of Halen ibn Shaddah lay in the </p><p>daggers of his men. No enemy escaped </p><p>assassination once he was marked. And </p><p>many were marked. </p><p> “Then there is no way to leave save by</p><p>the river stair?” asked Khlit, who had </p><p>listened attentively. </p><p> Iba Kabash stared and shook his head.</p><p> “Where is the fool who would escape,</p><p>Khlit?” he responded. “Thrice lucky are </p><p>we who are here. There was a calif who </p><p>marched against us with horsemen from </p><p>Irak. We rained down stones and baked </p><p>clay on his men; then sallied forth, and the </p><p>Shadrud was red with blood.” </p><p> “Aye,” said Toctamish sullenly. “There</p><p>are no better fighters than those of Irak. </p><p>Remember Hulaga Khan and his horse- </p><p>men.” </p><p> “Nay, I knew them not.”</p><p> Iba Kabash glanced at the Tatar curi-</p><p>ously, and Khlit laughed to distract his </p><p>mind, for he did not trust the Kurd. </p><p> “There was another who opposed us,”</p><p>continued Iba Kabash. “That was a sheik </p><p>of the hillmen in the mountains around </p><p>Alamut. Him we killed by tearing out </p><p>his belly and bowels. He had a daughter, </p><p>who was a spit-fire. Rashideddin dealt </p><p>with her.” </p><p> “How?” asked Khlit carelessly, recog-</p><p>nizing the description as Berea. </p><p> “Cleverly, very cleverly,” chuckled the</p><p>Kurd, rubbing his hands together. “He </p><p>had Halen ibn Shaddah order her off to </p><p>marry some Tatar chief who knew her not. </p><p>It was when she had gone that we slew the </p><p>old chief slowly, and scattered his tribe.” </p><p>“Truly a shrewd trick.” Khlit gave </p><p>Toctamish a warning blow in the ribs that </p><p>made the stocky warrior grunt. “How </p><p>fared the chief’s daughter at the hands of </p><p>the Tatar? Your knowledge is greater </p><p>than that of others, Iba Kabash. Can you </p><p>tell me that?” </p><p> “Nay, that is a hard one,” laughed the</p><p>Kurd. “I have heard, from a slave that </p><p>the chief’s daughter, Berea, was seen in </p><p>Astrakan. Also that she was taken as a </p><p>slave by some caravan not far from here. </p><p>I know not.” </p><p> “Was the one who told you a slave in</p><p>Alamut?” demanded Toctamish, who was </p><p>becoming restive. </p><p> “Where else, offspring of a donkey?”</p><p>muttered Iba Kabash. “I suppose you will </p><p>also ask how he came to hear of the girl.” </p><p>“Nay,” interrupted Khlit. “Toctamish </p><p>wondered at the power of Alamut. He is a </p><p>clown. You and I, Iba Kabash, are men </p><p>of wisdom.” </p><p> So it happened that Khlit was not aston-</p><p>ished when, as he came from the floor of the </p><p>banquet-place, one night, his head hazy</p><p>with the fumes of the strange wine, a girl </p><p>slave leaned close to him and whispered </p><p>briefly. </p><p> “By the far corner of the balcony,” she</p><p>repeated, “in an hour.” </p><p> He looked thoughtfully at an object the</p><p>slave had thrust into his hand. It was the </p><p>sapphire which Berea had once offered him. </p><p> He did not tell Toctamish of the message.</p><p>And he was at some pains to get rid of </p><p>Iba Kabash before the time appointed in </p><p>the message. So he was alone when he </p><p>went slowly along the stone balcony to a </p><p>dark corner. The slaves had retired from </p><p>the banquet-place and the fedavie were </p><p>watching for Halen ibn Shaddah to come </p><p>from his quarters. Standing so that he </p><p>could not be' seen by those below, Khlit </p><p>Alamut </p><p>23 </p><p>waited. Waited until the torches came, </p><p>with the Dais and the huge figure of Halen </p><p>ibn Shaddah. He felt a touch on his coat, </p><p>and turned. </p><p> “Follow,” whispered the soft voice of the</p><p>Persian, “and do not tread clumsily.” </p><p> Khlit found that this was not so easy.</p><p>Berea carried no light. He could barely </p><p>see her cloaked form by the reflection of an </p><p>occasional candle as she passed swiftly </p><p>through chambers and rock passages. His </p><p>head was light from the wine, although his </p><p>mind was clear. </p><p> Berea kept to passages where there were</p><p>few persons, and these Khlit saw to be </p><p>slaves. She was taking him through the </p><p>slave quarters where he had not been before. </p><p>Through corridors that narrowed until he </p><p>had to turn sideways to pass; by sunken </p><p>walls which smelled evilly. Through a </p><p>corridor that led out of the chambers of </p><p>Alamut into the paradise of Halen ibn </p><p>Shaddah. </p><p> Klilit paused in amazement and felt of</p><p>his head which was throbbing. A half-moon </p><p>glimmered down at him, and a cofll night </p><p>wind played in his hair. The branches of </p><p>date trees stirred lazily. Under his feet </p><p>he could feel grass, and he saw one of the </p><p>strange birds that dragged its tail come </p><p>from the shadow of the date trees. </p><p> Berea shook him angrily by the arm.</p><p> “One without sense, eater of swine flesh!”</p><p>she hissed. “Are you a clown to gape at </p><p>strange things?” </p><p>A FOUNTAIN threw its spray on </p><p>the wind into Khlit’s face, with a </p><p>scent like the roses of Ispahan. </p><p>Below the fountain was a canal, which </p><p>Khlit remembered vaguely, with a boat </p><p>attached to the shore. In the water he </p><p>could see the reflection of the moon gleam- </p><p>ing at him. And he was dizzy. </p><p> “This is the paradise of Halen ibn</p><p>Shaddah,” he muttered unsteadily, “where </p><p>I came by his favor. So Rashideddin </p><p>told me.”</p><p> Berea peered up at him silently. Her</p><p>cloak fell back and Khlit saw the dark </p><p>masses of hair which fell on either shoulder, </p><p>and the white throat under the curved </p><p>dark mouth that was twisted in scorn. </p><p> “A weak fool,” she stormed, shaking him.</p><p>“Toctamish is a better man than you.” </p><p> “Toctamish is drunk. Nay, little Spar-</p><p>row, it is my head. It will be better pres- </p><p>ently. This is no dream. How did you </p><p>come to Alamut, little Berea?” </p><p> For answer the girl drew Khlit, who was</p><p>fighting the dizziness in his head, to the </p><p>canal, and into the boat. Pushing it from </p><p>the shore, she paddled in the water until it </p><p>floated into the shadows. Not content with </p><p>this Berea urged the craft along the bank </p><p>quietly, and Khlit who was flat on his back </p><p>saw the shadow of a bridge fall over them. </p><p> “Nay,” he said drowsily, “the stars are</p><p>good. It is good to see them again. </p><p>Where are we now? How did you bring </p><p>me here?” </p><p> Berea came and sat by Khlit’s head,</p><p>feeling his hot forehead with a small hand. </p><p>She wrapped her thin cloak tightly about </p><p>her and rested her chin on her two hands, </p><p>gazing at the round moon in the water. </p><p> “A man must be crafty and wise,” she</p><p>repeated softly, “yet, lo, it is a weak girl, </p><p>a creature of the false prophet’s paradise, </p><p>who leads him. They told me you were </p><p>very shrewd, oh, my Abulfetlah Harb Issa, </p><p>gray Father of Battles. Soon there will be </p><p>a great battle and the waters of Shahrud </p><p>will be red again. Have you ever seen </p><p>wolves of the steppe tear jackals of the </p><p>mountains into bits, foam-flecked? Have </p><p>you ever run with the pack of wolves, oh, </p><p>one called the Wolf? Nay, they have </p><p>clipped your fangs.” </p><p> “That is a lie, Sparrow,” growled Khlit</p><p>surlily, “give me a horse and freedom to </p><p>swing a sword, and I shall trounce some </p><p>of these evil fedavies for you. Bah, it is a </p><p>hotbed of sin, a reeking plague-house. </p><p>Show me the way out of Alamut.” </p><p> “And your promise,” queried Berea,</p><p>“to cut off the head of Halen ibn Shaddah?” </p><p>Khlit was silent. True, he had promised, </p><p>and was in honor bound to Berea. </p><p> “Likewise, Berea,” he said moodily, “you</p><p>said that there was a plan. Why do you </p><p>keep the plan hidden in your mind, if there </p><p>is one? Better be in good faith with me. </p><p>Say how Halen ibn Shaddah can be killed.” </p><p>“How should I kill so strong a man?” she </p><p>laughed softly. “The Koran reads that </p><p>Allah weakens the stratagems of mis- </p><p>believers. Also that they who store up </p><p>evil shall taste what they store up. Such </p><p>are the words of wisdom, despised by </p><p>Rashideddin. Nay, destruction shall come </p><p>upon Alamut like the storm from a cloud, </p><p>quick as poison from a serpent’s fang, and </p><p>Halen ibn Shaddah-” </p><p>2 4 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Halen ibn Shaddah,” chuckled Khlit,</p><p>“is not easily to be found.” </p><p> Abruptly, he gripped the girl’s wrist.</p><p>Beside the round orb of the moon in the </p><p>water he saw the reflection of a turbaned </p><p>man. It was a stout man, carrying a </p><p>sword as broad as a horse’s neck, or the </p><p>reflection lied. Khlit rose on one elbow </p><p>fingering his saber. At the same time the </p><p>boat moved backward silently under im- </p><p>pulse of the girl’s paddling and passed from </p><p>the bridge along the canal under date trees. </p><p> “A eunuch, one of the tribe who guard</p><p>the creatures of the paradise,” Berea </p><p>whispered. “I have seen them often, </p><p>because I am, also, a celestial houri—while </p><p>it pleases me. I saw you when you came </p><p>here a few days ago. Listen—” her voice </p><p>changed—“for you must serve me, and the </p><p>time is near.” </p><p> Khlit nodded. The fresh night air had</p><p>cleared some of the poison from his brain. </p><p> “I shall take you back to the chambers</p><p>of Alamut, Khlit, by way of the slaves’ </p><p>quarters. We are on the top of Alamut, </p><p>now, where Halen ibn Shaddah, whom may </p><p>Allah lay in the dust, has built an evil </p><p>paradise on the ruins of the old citadel to </p><p>beguile his men. Verily what they have </p><p>made—he and Rashideddin—is a magician’s </p><p>trick. The men who come here are drugged </p><p>with a strange poison that I know not. I </p><p>have tasted it in the wine—may Allah grant </p><p>me mercy—and it is evil.” </p><p> Khlit grunted in assent.</p><p> “It is some secret of Rashideddin’s,” she</p><p>resumed. “The fedavie are foul with it, </p><p>until they lose fear of death. This drug </p><p>chains them to Halen ibn Shaddah. That </p><p>and their lusts. And they have chained </p><p>others by fear of the Refik. Yet their doom </p><p>is near. It is coming from there—” point- </p><p>ing in the direction which Khlit thought to </p><p>be north—“and it is swift as the hunting </p><p>falcon on the wing.” </p><p> “Another riddle, Berea,” muttered Khlit.</p><p>“Where have you seen a falcon?” </p><p> “Where you have seen them, Cossack,”</p><p>she laughed, “and Toctamish has hunted </p><p>with them. Where swords are sharpened </p><p>for the cutting down of the fedavie. In the </p><p>land of the Kallmark Tatars, north of the </p><p>Salt Sea. Oh, the doom of Alamut will </p><p>be very great, and Munkir and Nakir, the </p><p>dark angels that flay dead men in their </p><p>graves will grow big with power.” </p><p>“Another riddle, little Berea. It is many </p><p>generations since Tatar horsemen rode into </p><p>Persia for conquest.” </p><p> “The answer is under your blind eyes,</p><p>Father of Battles. Am I not beautiful as </p><p>the rose garden of Tiflis in Spring? Is not </p><p>my hair dark as the mantle of Melik, and </p><p>my skin white as aloes under the dew?” </p><p>Berea moved her perfumed head close to </p><p>Khlit, and the Cossack drew away. “Nay, </p><p>others have eyes; so, Allah has willed that </p><p>my honor shall be cleared and the doom of </p><p>Alamut shall come.” </p><p> “The Tatars are marching on Alamut?”</p><p>Khlit bit his mustache in glee. “Devil take </p><p>me, that is good news-” </p><p> “Hush, fool.” Berea drew in her breath</p><p>eagerly. “Twenty thousand horsemen are </p><p>riding along the Salt Sea toward Alamut. </p><p>They will not stop to plunder or gather </p><p>spoil. Oh, it will be a good battle. My </p><p>father shall see it from the footstool of </p><p>Mohammed. Aye, it will gladden his eyes. </p><p>I shall open the gate of Alamut to twenty </p><p>thousand Kallmark horsemen. The gate </p><p>that leads to the banquet-place, where </p><p>I bring food every night with the slaves. </p><p>Here is what you must do, Father of </p><p>Battles-” </p><p> She listened intently for a moment.</p><p>The paradise of Halen ibn Shaddah was </p><p>still, and only the birds with long tails </p><p>moved. </p><p> “On the third night, Father of Battles,”</p><p>she whispered, “the Dai who is in command </p><p>at the river stair, will change his sentries </p><p>at the second watch. Do you and Toc- </p><p>tamish get among the sentries of the river </p><p>gate. I have seen you with Iba Kabash </p><p>who is one without honor. Pay him and it </p><p>may be done. Two sentries are as is the</p><p>custom, in the river, outside the gate. On </p><p>the third night, those two must be you and </p><p>Toctamish, none other. That is your task. </p><p>Then will you have a horse to ride, you and </p><p>Toctamish. Meanwhile, keep out of sight </p><p>of Rashideddin-” </p><p> “Aye,” said Khlit, pondering, “Rashid-</p><p>eddin.” </p><p>XI </p><p>IT IS written in the annals of </p><p>Abulghazi that as the year of the </p><p>lion drew to its close, very great </p><p>riches came to the treasury of Halen ibn </p><p>Shaddah from the cities which lived in the </p><p>shadow of fear. Save from the north, by </p><p>the Salt Sea, where the tithes came not. </p><p>Alamut </p><p>25 </p><p>Nor any riders. And in the north, said </p><p>Abulghazi, a storm was gathering, swift </p><p>as wind, rolling up all in its path. Yet no </p><p>murmur of the storm came to Alamut, to </p><p>the man who named himself prophet of </p><p>God, to the banquet-place of the fedavie, to </p><p>the man of wisdom, Rashideddin. </p><p> It was the second day after the visit of</p><p>Berea that Khlit, who had been thinking </p><p>deeply, sought out Iba Kabash where the </p><p>Kurd lay sleeping on the floor of the </p><p>banquet-place and roused him from his </p><p>stupor. </p><p> “I have news for the ear of Halen ibn</p><p>Shaddah himself,” he said, squatting and </p><p>lighting his pipe, “none other. He will </p><p>surely reward me.” </p><p> Iba Kabash ceased yawning and into his</p><p>lined face came the look of a crafty fox. </p><p> “Halen ibn Shaddah will not see you,</p><p>Khlit. He will see nobody except a few, </p><p>old fellows of Alamut, of whom I am one. </p><p>Verily, I have the ear of the master of </p><p>Alamut. Tell me your message and I will </p><p>give it, for you are a man of brains. You, </p><p>Klilit are of the chosen. The others are </p><p>ones without understanding.” </p><p> Khlit knew that Iba Kabash lied, for the</p><p>most part. He considered his pipe gravely </p><p>and shook his head. </p><p> “My news is not to be repeated. Halen</p><p>ibn Shaddah would pay a good price. How </p><p>can you get such a good price for it as I?” </p><p>“Nay,” remonstrated the Kurd, “I shall </p><p>get a better price. For I know well the </p><p>value of news. Tell me and we shall both </p><p>profit, you and I.” </p><p> Khlit grinned under his mustache. For a</p><p>while he played, with the skill of one who </p><p>understood the game well, with the growing </p><p>inquisitiveness of his companion. Iba Ka- </p><p>bash steadily raised the reward he assured </p><p>Khlit, as he sensed the interest of the </p><p>Cossack. </p><p> “Then,” stated Khlit slowly, “you will</p><p>do this. You will go direct to the master </p><p>of Alamut and tell him my news. To no</p><p>other. For here, a man takes what credit </p><p>he can. And as the price of the good you </p><p>will get for the telling, you will aid me in </p><p>the plan I have.. The plan concerns a girl </p><p>that Halen ibn Shaddah would give a finger </p><p>of his left hand to see brought before him.” </p><p>“I swear it,” -said the Kurd readily, “on </p><p>my ahd, the oath of a fedavie. Now tell me </p><p>the news, and it shall go to Halen ibn </p><p>Shaddah as you have said.” </p><p> Khlit nodded. That much the Kurd</p><p>would do, he was sure. Whether Iba </p><p>Kabash would tell the source of his message </p><p>was dubious. Khlit felt in his heart that </p><p>if the news was important Iba Kabash </p><p>would keep the credit for himself. Which </p><p>was what Khlit wanted. </p><p> “Tell Halen ibn Shaddah this,” he said</p><p>slowly, “that Khlit, the Cossack, called the </p><p>Wolf, has learned that Berea, the Persian </p><p>girl who was sent from Rudbar by Rashid- </p><p>eddin has returned, and is in Alamut. </p><p>He will be very curious. Say no more, </p><p>for you and I, Iba Kabash, can find the </p><p>girl and take her to him. If you help me, </p><p>it can be managed. That is my message.” </p><p> Khlit watched the Kurd depart nimbly.</p><p>Iba Kabash had sensed the importance of </p><p>the Cossack’s words. It would be a rare </p><p>tale to pour into the ears of the master of </p><p>Alamut. And, nimbly as the Kurd took </p><p>his way from the banquet-place, Khlit was </p><p>as quick to follow, keeping in the shadows of </p><p>the passages, but well within sight of the </p><p>other. </p><p> So it happened that Iba Kabash did not</p><p>see Khlit when he turned into the winding </p><p>stair that led to the room of Rashideddin, </p><p>but the Cossack saw him and waited by the </p><p>outer chamber. If Iba Kabash had looked </p><p>behind, he might not have gone where he </p><p>did. Yet he did not look behind, and Khlit </p><p>waited patiently. </p><p> Presently one of the Khirghiz men came</p><p>from the winding stair, walking idly, and </p><p>Khlit halted him, asking if the Khirghiz </p><p>had seen aught of a certain Kurd called Iba </p><p>Kabash. </p><p> The man had seen him. Iba Kabash</p><p>had come to the astrologer’s chamber. Of </p><p>a certainty, he had spoken to Rashideddin. </p><p>Why else had he come? Was the astrologer</p><p>one to stare at? They had talked together, </p><p>and he had not heard what was said, </p><p>although he listened carefully, for it was in </p><p>another tongue. </p><p> Rashideddin, swore Khlit, was a man to</p><p>be feared. Doubtless he was the one that </p><p>spoke most often to Halen ibn Shaddah, </p><p>the holy prophet. Nay, he surely had the </p><p>ear of Halen ibn Shaddah, who held the keys </p><p>to the blessed paradise. </p><p> The Khirghiz swore even more fluently.</p><p>It was a lie that Rashideddin spoke with </p><p>Halen ibn Shaddah more than others. </p><p>Rashideddin was favored by the dark </p><p>powers, for he read books. The Khirghiz </p><p>26 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>knew that, for he was one of the chosen </p><p>fedavie of the astrologer. </p><p> Khlit turned, at a step on the stair.</p><p>Instead of Rashideddin, he saw the stout </p><p>figure of Iba Kabash who halted in sur- </p><p>prise. </p><p> “Listen, Cossack,” the Kurd whispered,</p><p>with a glance around the chamber. “I </p><p>have not yet delivered your message, for </p><p>Rashideddin stopped me on my way to </p><p>Halen ibn Shaddah, and ordered me to </p><p>bring you to him. But do not tell Rashid- </p><p>eddin what you know. I shall see that </p><p>you get a good reward, I swear it. We must </p><p>try to get the girl. If you know a way tell </p><p>me, and it shall be done. Remember, say </p><p>nothing to Rashideddin.” </p><p> Khlit weighed the words of the Kurd for</p><p>their gist of truth and foimd very little. </p><p>He little liked to face the astrologer, but he </p><p>ascended the stair at once, swaggering, and </p><p>stamping his boots. </p><p> In the round chamber of the astrologer</p><p>he halted. It was night and candles were </p><p>lighted around the tapestried walls. Rashid- </p><p>eddin was crouched over rolls of parch- </p><p>ment and instruments the like of which </p><p>Khlit had not seen. In a cleared space on </p><p>the floor in front of him the wise man of </p><p>Alamut had ranged a number of images, </p><p>silver and cleverly wrought, of stars. </p><p> The stars formed a circle and in the circle</p><p>was a bag. Rashideddin sat quietly, arms </p><p>crossed on knees, staring in front of him. </p><p>Around the walls of the chamber silk hang- </p><p>ings had been placed, on which were woven </p><p>pictures of scenes which Khlit recognized </p><p>as belonging to the paradise of Halen ibn </p><p>Shaddah. </p><p> “Seat yourself, Cossack,” said Rashid-</p><p>eddin, in his slow, deep voice, “in front of </p><p>me, and watch.” </p><p>Wjijp THE astrologer’s eyes were half- </p><p>closed. Looking into them, Khlit </p><p>could see nothing. The room was </p><p>still and deserted except for the two. Khlit </p><p>wished that others had been there. He felt </p><p>ill at ease, and sucked at his pipe loudly.</p><p> “In the place of darkness, of the spirit</p><p>Munkir,” said Rashideddin, “there are no </p><p>stars. Yet when men are alive they can </p><p>look on the stars. Few can read them. </p><p>From Alamut I have seen them, and </p><p>learned many things. Do they read the </p><p>stars in your country, Cossack?” </p><p> “Nay,” said Khlit, “we know them not.”</p><p> Rashideddin contemplated his circle</p><p>thoughtfully. His hands, yellow and very </p><p>clean, took up a pair of dividers with which </p><p>he measured the distance between the silver </p><p>stars. </p><p> “In the heart of Alamut, we have burned</p><p>the law books of the Persians and the code </p><p>books of the Medes. They were very old; </p><p>yet is the dust of age a sacrament? What </p><p>is there about an old law that makes it </p><p>graven as on stone in the minds of men? </p><p>One prophet has said that he who takes a </p><p>tooth for a tooth is lawful; another has said </p><p>that he who injures another for his own sake </p><p>shall suffer greatly. Which is the truth?” </p><p> “Nay,” answered Khlit, “I know not.”</p><p> “It was written that when one man kills</p><p>another the kin of that man shall kill the </p><p>first. So I have seen many in the world </p><p>outside Alamut kill each other without </p><p>cause. Yet in Alamut, we kill only for a. </p><p>reason.” </p><p> Khlit thought of the dead Tatar who had</p><p>fallen where Rashideddin sat and was silent. </p><p> “Watch,” said the astrologer. Putting</p><p>aside his dividers, he took up the bag. </p><p>Opening the top of this slightly he held it </p><p>over the circle in both hands. Tipping it </p><p>to one side, he allowed a thin stream of sand </p><p>to fall in the space enclosed by the stars. </p><p>The sand heaped itself in moimds, which </p><p>Rashideddin considered carefully, setting </p><p>down the bag. </p><p> “There are laws in the stars, Cossack,”</p><p>he repeated, tracing idly in the sand with </p><p>his dividers. “And I have read them. Is </p><p>it not true that when a man has found the </p><p>sum of wisdom, he has none? The poet </p><p>has said that no beauty is in the world save </p><p>that of power over other men. The stars </p><p>watch the evil and idleness of men. One</p><p>who reads them learns many things. I </p><p>shall tell you what I learned of you, Cos- </p><p>sack.” </p><p> “Aye,” said Khlit grimly, “tell.”</p><p> Under the cover of his bushy eyebrows</p><p>he studied his companion. Rashideddin </p><p>was a magician, and in Khlit’s mind a </p><p>magician was not to be trusted. Was the </p><p>astrologer playing with him, using him as a </p><p>chess-player moves a piece on the board? </p><p>What had Iba Kabash told Rashideddin? </p><p>Khlit waited, paying no attention to the </p><p>stars or the sand, watching only the eyes of </p><p>the other. </p><p> “From the land of Ukraine you came,</p><p>Khlit,” said the astrologer. “Alone, and </p><p>Alamut </p><p>27 </p><p>met Toctamish in Astrakan. When the </p><p>wolf runs with the jackal over the steppe, </p><p>the stars have a riddle to solve. Perhaps </p><p>the wolf is hungry. And the jackal is </p><p>useful.” </p><p> “Aye,” said Khlit, “Iba Kabash.”</p><p> Rashideddin’s expression did not change</p><p>as he stirred the sands with his dividers. </p><p>“At Astrakan there was a fedavie who is </p><p>dead. You and the jackal Toctamish were </p><p>under his roof. You came with him to a </p><p>ship. And the fedavie was slain. Aye, the </p><p>wolf was hungered. Much have I learned </p><p>from the stars. There was a girl with you </p><p>on the ship. She did not come with you to </p><p>Alamut.” </p><p> Khlit made no response, and Rashideddin</p><p>continued to stir the sands. </p><p> “The girl was not one easy to forget.</p><p>You have not forgotten her. The jackal is </p><p>drunk. But you have an ear for wisdom. </p><p>The girl might be found in Alamut. Aye, </p><p>by one who knows her, in the thousands of </p><p>slaves.” </p><p> Khlit shook the ashes from his pipe.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye he saw the </p><p>hangings move behind him. Well he knew </p><p>the chamber of Rashideddin was pregnant </p><p>with danger. The pallid astrologer toyed </p><p>with men’s lives as he did with the magic </p><p>sands. He made no move, waiting for </p><p>what was to come. </p><p> It came in a blinding flash. A burst of</p><p>flame, and the sands leaped upward. </p><p>Smoke and a wrenching smell filled </p><p>Khlit’s eyes and throat. The skin of his </p><p>face burned hotly. Blinking and gasping, </p><p>he rocked back on his haunches. </p><p> “The wolf is wise -in the ways of the</p><p>steppe,” purred the astrologer. “Yet he </p><p>came to Alamut, the vulture’s nest. It is </p><p>a pity. The girl, too, is missing. Perhaps </p><p>she can be found.” </p><p> The face of Rashideddin stared at him</p><p>through thinning clouds of powder smoke, </p><p>and Khlit wiped the tears of pain from his </p><p>eyes. Rapidly, he thought. Rashideddin</p><p>wanted Berea. Halen ibn Shaddah would </p><p>pay a high price for the girl, who was dan- </p><p>gerous, being not as other girls. </p><p> “Aye,” he muttered, coughing, for the</p><p>flame had burned his face, “she may be </p><p>found.” </p><p> “Tomorrow there will be an audience by</p><p>Halen ibn Shaddah for the fedavie. She </p><p>will be there. I shall send for you before </p><p>evening. Fail, and the fedavie will break </p><p>your bones slowly, with stones, or tear the </p><p>skin from your back.” </p><p> Khlit rose to his feet without obeisance.</p><p>“Have the stars,” he asked, “any other </p><p>message for me?” </p><p> For a long moment Rashideddin studied</p><p>him through narrowed lids. Idly, the </p><p>dividers traced patterns in the powder ash </p><p>in the circle of stars. And Khlit cursed </p><p>himself softly. For in the eyes of the other </p><p>was the look of one who measures swords. </p><p>Once too often he had drawn the attention </p><p>of the astrologer on himself. </p><p> Dismissed from the round chamber, Khlit</p><p>sought out Iba Kabash, and secured the </p><p>promise of the Kurd that he would be put </p><p>with Toctamish among the sentries for the </p><p>next night, for being admitted to the para- </p><p>dise of Alamut this was their privilege. </p><p>To gain this point, it was necessary to </p><p>assure the Kurd that Berea could be </p><p>found. Once more, Iba Kabash swore Khlit </p><p>would get a good price, whereupon Khlit </p><p>had the thought that the other was too glib </p><p>with a promise. </p><p> Then he found Toctamish, and told the</p><p>Tatar enough of what had passed in the </p><p>garden of Halen ibn Shaddah to keep him </p><p>sober overnight. This done, Khlit seated </p><p>himself in a comer of the banquet-place </p><p>and took out his sword. Placing it across </p><p>his knees he began to whet it with the stone </p><p>he always carried. As he did so, men near </p><p>him stared curiously, for Khlit was singing </p><p>to himself in a voice without music. </p><p> And Rashideddin sat over the circle of</p><p>silver stars, tracing and retracing patterns </p><p>in the ashes of powder, with the look of one </p><p>in whose soul there is no peace. </p><p>v, xn </p><p>CAME the time of the divan, the </p><p>assembly of the Refik, and closed </p><p>gates that guarded the apartments </p><p>of Halen ibn Shaddah in the cellars of </p><p>Alamut swung open. In poured the fol- </p><p>lowers of the Refik; fedavie, hillmen of </p><p>Persia, men of the Khirghiz steppe, janis- </p><p>saries of Yussouf, prince of princes. Scat- </p><p>tered in the crowd were magicians of </p><p>Rashideddin in white tunics and red girdles, </p><p>in company with white and gold Dais. </p><p>Also came Khlit with the Khirghiz chief </p><p>who had seen fit to keep at his side. </p><p>The throng moved in silence, and Khlit </p><p>waxed curious at this, until he questioned </p><p>28 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the Khirghiz. For reply, he received a hard </p><p>blow in the ribs. </p><p> “You are surely a fool, Cossack,” growled</p><p>the other, “to bray at what is strange. We </p><p>are walking through the talking chambers </p><p>of the Shadna, built by Ala-eddin. </p><p>Harken.” He lifted his voice in a shrill </p><p>syllable. “Aie!” </p><p> Instantly the sound was taken up and</p><p>repeated through the corridors. A hun- </p><p>dred echoes caught the word and flung it </p><p>back. Shrilly, gruffly, it rang further into </p><p>the caverns. Men near them stared and </p><p>cursed. Khlit observed that the corridors </p><p>were lofty and vaulted, with pillars of stone. </p><p> “It is said,” whispered the Khirghiz,</p><p>gratified by the effect of his experiment, </p><p>“that before the time of Rashideddin, when </p><p>the Refik prayed to Allah, these were the </p><p>chambers of prayer. A man could pray a </p><p>thousand times with 6ne word.” </p><p> “And now?”</p><p> “We do not pray.”</p><p> Pushing a way through the crowd reck-</p><p>lessly witii his elbows, the Khirghiz gained </p><p>a place where he and Khlit could see the </p><p>array of the divan. In the center of a </p><p>cleared space in one of the larger chambers </p><p>stood Halen ibn Shaddah, easily marked </p><p>by his great height and the cloak that </p><p>shadowed his face. Around him were </p><p>grouped certain men in heavy turbans and </p><p>green embroidered coats. These Khlit </p><p>recognized as Daikebirs, emissaries of the </p><p>master of Alamut. At his side was the </p><p>bent figure of Rashideddin. </p><p> These were talking in a tongue that</p><p>Khlit did not know, not loudly, for fear of </p><p>disturbing the echoes. His eye wandered </p><p>over the throng. Wandered and halted. </p><p>A woman’s figure stood out from the crowd </p><p>and he swore under his breath. Arm’s </p><p>length from Rashideddin among the Dais, </p><p>her blue cloak closely wrapped on her </p><p>slender form, stood Berea. Her black curls </p><p>were pushed under a fold of the cloak; her </p><p>brown eyes, darting from under fringed </p><p>lashes, swept about the gathered Refik and</p><p>passed Khlit by in unconcern. Yet he felt </p><p>that she had seen him. </p><p> No other woman was present. Khlit</p><p>saw that the eyes of many searched her, </p><p>and he touched the Khirghiz on the </p><p>shoulder. </p><p> “Is there talk about the woman?” he</p><p>asked softly. “Tell me.” </p><p> The chief listened, tolerantly, for a space.</p><p> “Aye,” he said, “there is idle talk. The</p><p>woman is the daughter of a hill sheik. She </p><p>was sent to be the wife of Kiragai Khan. </p><p>That is a good jest, for Kiragai Khan loves </p><p>not the Refik. She has said that she was </p><p>sent without a dowry. So, the painted </p><p>flower has come to one who tramples on </p><p>flowers, to ask that the dowry be given </p><p>her.” </p><p> “And will it be done?”</p><p> “Will the tiger give up its slain victim?</p><p>Nay, you are without understanding, Cos- </p><p>sack. Halen ibn Shaddah does not play </p><p>with such. The sheik’s daughter will find a </p><p>place among the slaves, not otherwise.” </p><p>“Such is not the law.” </p><p> “There is no law in Alamut but one—the</p><p>word of Halen ibn Shaddah. And the law </p><p>that the curved dagger must avenge a </p><p>wrong.” </p><p> Khlit made no reply, considering carefully</p><p>what had been said. Rashideddin, then, </p><p>had found Berea as he had declared he </p><p>would. Was it Berea’s purpose to come </p><p>before Halen ibn Shaddah? Had she for- </p><p>gotten the cunning and cruelty of the man </p><p>who had dishonored her? Perhaps the </p><p>girl’s pride had impelled her to appeal for </p><p>justice and a wedding dowry to give the </p><p>khan to whom she had offered herself. </p><p>Yet Berea had not forgotten the manner </p><p>of her father’s death, of that Khlit was </p><p>sure. Wise in the ways of men, the heart </p><p>of the sheik’s daughter was a closed book </p><p>to him. He looked around for Toctamish. </p><p>The Tatar was not to be seen. </p><p> Meanwhile, Rashideddin had been speak-</p><p>ing to the girl. </p><p> “What said the astrologer?” asked Khlit.</p><p>“The old one is crafty,” grunted the </p><p>Khirghiz. “Aye, he has learned the secrets </p><p>of magic where Marduk hangs by his heels </p><p>in the hell of Babylon. He asked why a girl </p><p>so fair in face and form should bear a gift </p><p>in offering herself in marriage.” </p><p> Berea, who seemed to ignore her peril,</p><p>lifted her dark head and answered quickly </p><p>in tones that stirred the echoes. </p><p> “Hah, the painted flower has a sharp</p><p>tongue,” grunted the chieftain. “She says </p><p>that her beauty has moved the heart of </p><p>Kiragai Khan as wind stirs fire. The khan, </p><p>who desires her, would have taken her for </p><p>his favorite wife. Yet would she not, being </p><p>ashamed for reason of the trick Halen ibn </p><p>Shaddah played her. So she has come </p><p>back to ask a dowry from the hand of the </p><p>Alamut </p><p>29 </p><p>master of Alamut, who is her lawful ruler </p><p>now that her father is dead.” </p><p> The giant form of Halen ibn Shaddah</p><p>turned on Berea, and a peculiarly shrill </p><p>voice reached the ears of Khlit. Once more </p><p>he wondered what kind of man was the mas- </p><p>ter of Alamut, of the giant figure and shrill </p><p>voice. </p><p> “Halen ibn Shaddah says,” whispered</p><p>the other, “that Berea belongs to Alamut. </p><p>She has returned to Alamut and here she </p><p>must stay.” </p><p> Klilit thought of the paradise of the</p><p>master of evil, and understood why the eyes </p><p>of the fedavie in the throng burned as they </p><p>stared at the girl’s slender figure outlined in </p><p>the blue cloak. </p><p> “She asked for justice—” he began.</p><p> “Nay,” interrupted the Khirghiz care-</p><p>lessly, “her father was slain by Halen ibn </p><p>Shaddah. How is she then to be trusted?” </p><p> Khlit did not answer. For the gaze of</p><p>Berea had met his. In it he read anxiety, </p><p>and a warning. Slowly her glance crept </p><p>to Rashideddin and back. Again. And </p><p>Khlit saw the astrologer turn to leave the </p><p>chamber. </p><p> Truly, he considered, the sheik’s daughter</p><p>was daring and proud. And, obeying her </p><p>look, he followed Rashideddin, slipping </p><p>away from the Khirghiz. </p><p> So it happened that when the astrologer</p><p>left the divan, Khlit did likewise. Rashid- </p><p>eddin made his way quickly and alone </p><p>down one of the corridors without waiting </p><p>for a light. Khlit followed him, keeping </p><p>as close as he could without being seen. </p><p>Presently both halted. </p><p> A voice called through the corridor</p><p>clearly, and seemingly very near. </p><p> “A man must be crafty and wise,” the</p><p>voice of Berea came to their ears, “when </p><p>danger is ’round Ills path, else is his labor </p><p>vain.” </p><p> Khlit crossed himself in astonishment.</p><p>For a moment he had forgotten the echoes </p><p>of the corridors of Ala-eddin. </p><p>XIV </p><p>RASHIDEDDIN went straight to </p><p>the winding stairs that led to his own </p><p>apartment. At the foot of these </p><p>stairs Khlit, who had traced the astrologer </p><p>closely, paused. It would not be easy to </p><p>go farther without being seen. And this </p><p>Khlit wanted to avoid. He believed that </p><p>Rashideddin was having him watched, and </p><p>that the Khirghiz had attended him to the </p><p>divan under orders. And at all costs he </p><p>must be free to act that night. </p><p> Rashideddin, thought Khlit, sensed</p><p>something impending. In some way the </p><p>magician of Alamut kept himself informed </p><p>of what went on in the citadel. His spies </p><p>were everywhere. And on the night when </p><p>Berea planned to admit the enemies of the </p><p>Refik, both were under watch. Where was </p><p>Toctamish? </p><p> Khlit wasted no time by the foot of the</p><p>winding stair. There were other entrances </p><p>to the circular chamber where Rashideddin </p><p>kept his henchmen, and the Cossack cast </p><p>about until he came to one of these. A </p><p>passage led upward, unlighted in the </p><p>direction he sought and this Khlit followed </p><p>until he came to a curtain which he sus- </p><p>pected divided it from the chamber of the </p><p>astrologer. Beyond the curtain he could </p><p>hear voices. </p><p> Lifting one edge of the hanging, Klilit</p><p>looked out cautiously. Candle-light in the </p><p>chamber dazzled him for a moment. He </p><p>made out a dozen figures, Rashideddin not </p><p>among them, dressed in the red and white </p><p>pf the magicians’ cult. They were grouped </p><p>around a man prone on the floor. This </p><p>man was Toctamish. </p><p> The Tatar’s coat and shirt had been</p><p>removed. Two fedavie held each of his </p><p>arms outstretched on the floor. His thick </p><p>chest was strangely red, and he gasped as </p><p>if in pain, not once or twice, but long, </p><p>broken gasps that shook his body. </p><p> As Klilit watched, startled, one of the</p><p>fedavie, a gaunt Tatar with a pocked face,</p><p>placed some brown dust on the chest of the </p><p>prostrate man. Khlit recognized the dust. </p><p>It was the same that had singed his face </p><p>when he sat opposite Rashideddin. </p><p> Thrusting aside the hanging, Klilit</p><p>stepped into the room. The fedavie took </p><p>no notice of him, believing that he was </p><p>one of Rashideddin’s henchmen stationed </p><p>in the passage. Toctamish, however, lifted </p><p>his eyes, which gleamed as they fell on the </p><p>Cossack. Khlit saw that his brow was </p><p>covered with sweat, and that blood ran </p><p>from his mouth. </p><p> The man of the pitted face lifted some</p><p>brown powder and sifted it on the chest of </p><p>his victim. Another pushed a torch into </p><p>his hand. Khlit realized then how his </p><p>companion was being tortured. The smell </p><p>IfiPBI </p><p>mm mm </p><p>30 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>of burning in the air came from singed flesh. </p><p>And Toctamish was feeling the angry hand </p><p>of Rashideddin. </p><p> Khlit stepped to the side of the fedavie</p><p>with the torch, and peered closely at Toc- </p><p>tamish. He saw then what made the </p><p>Tatar’s chest red, of a strange shade. </p><p>Strips of skin had been torn off over the </p><p>lungs, and here the powder was laid. </p><p>Khlit swore and his hand strayed to his </p><p>sword. And fell to his side. The fedavie </p><p>numbered a full dozen, armed, and able- </p><p>bodied. To draw his sword would be to </p><p>bring ten whirling around him. </p><p> Khlit had no love for Toctamish. Yet in</p><p>this room the other had stood with his </p><p>sword drawn beside him. And they had </p><p>shared bread and salt. Toctamish was </p><p>standing the torture with the stark courage </p><p>which was his creed. The lips of the </p><p>sufferer moved and Khlit bent closer. </p><p> “Kiragai Khan—Khan of the Horde,”</p><p>the cracked lips gasped, “tell him. Blood </p><p>for blood. We have shared bread—and </p><p>salt, and arak. Tell him.” </p><p> The Cossack nodded. Toctamish was</p><p>asking him to report how he had endured </p><p>torture to Kiragai Khan who was advancing </p><p>on Alamut at the head of his men, and </p><p>claiming vengeance. He was weak, and </p><p>seemed to have no hope of living. </p><p> “What said the dog?” muttered the</p><p>fedavie with the torch who had been trying </p><p>to catch what Toctamish whispered. He </p><p>spoke in a bastard Tatar with a strange </p><p>lisping. “He will not speak and Rashid- </p><p>eddin has said that he must or we will </p><p>hang by the heels.” </p><p> “He is out of his mind,” answered Khlit</p><p>carelessly. “What must he tell?” </p><p> “He stuck a dagger into a fedavie, a</p><p>Syrian, on the shore of the Salt Sea. A </p><p>girl, Berea, the sheik’s daughter, was there </p><p>also. This yellow-faced fool must tell if </p><p>the girl ordered him to do it. Bah! His </p><p>skin is tough as oxen hide, and his flesh is </p><p>senseless as swine.” </p><p> “And he has not spoken?”</p><p> “Nay. Rashideddin was here and ques-</p><p>tioned him, but the Tatar cursed him.” </p><p>Khlit scanned the face of Toctamish. </p><p>The yellow skin was dark and moist with </p><p>sweat. The eyes were bloodshot and half- </p><p>closed. The mouth lifted in a snarl, dis- </p><p>closing teeth pointed as an animal’s. He </p><p>felt that Toctamish would not yield to the </p><p>torture. And great love for the man </p><p>whose courage was proof against pain rose </p><p>in the heart of Khlit whose own courage </p><p>was such that men called him the “Wolf.” </p><p>“Aye,” he growled, “blood for blood. </p><p>That is the law of Alamut. And Kiragai </p><p>Khan shall know.” </p><p> He saw by a quick opening of the eyes</p><p>that Toctamish caught his words. </p><p> “What say you?” queried the fedavie.</p><p>“Kiragai Khan?” </p><p> Toctamish’s knotted figure writhed under</p><p>the hands of his captors. He spat, blood </p><p>and foam combined, at the other. </p><p> “Aye,” he groaned, “Kiragai Khan—lord</p><p>of fifty thousand spears—chief of a hunched </p><p>ensigns—master of Alamut.” </p><p> “He speaks,” interpreted Khlit swiftly,</p><p>“of one Hulagu Khan who conquered </p><p>Alamut. Tell Rashideddin. And cease </p><p>the torture, for the man has nothing to </p><p>confess.” </p><p> The fedavie stared at Khlit suspiciously.</p><p>“Nay,” he snarled, “shall we hang by </p><p>the heels?” </p><p> He thrust the torch near the powder.</p><p>There was a hissing flash, a smell of burning </p><p>flesh. Toctamish’s body quivered spas- </p><p>modically and sank back. The eyes closed. </p><p> Under cover of the flare and smoke Khlit</p><p>slipped back through the circle and sought </p><p>the stair. Gaining this he did not pause </p><p>until he had reached the inner gate of the </p><p>underground citadel where a Dai was </p><p>assembling his men to guard the outer gate </p><p>by the river. </p><p> When Khlit, who was nursing in his brain</p><p>the sight he had just left, went down the</p><p>river stairs to his post in the River Shahrud, </p><p>he found that his companion was the </p><p>bearded Khirghiz chieftain. </p><p> The outer post of the guard around the</p><p>citadel of Alamut was in a small nest of </p><p>rocks several hundred paces from the </p><p>entrance, and midway in the stream. So </p><p>shallow was the river that they could wade </p><p>out to the rocks. The Khirghiz led the way. </p><p> It was not yet the middle of the night,</p><p>and a bright moon lighted the winding </p><p>ribbon of the Shahrud that twisted between </p><p>the rocky heights of Rudbar. The mass of </p><p>Alamut showed dark, giving no sign of the </p><p>evil world it concealed. A wind from the </p><p>heights brushed Khlit’s face and he breathed </p><p>it in deeply, for he was nauseated by the </p><p>stench of the caverns. </p><p> “You and I, Cossack,” said the Khirghiz,</p><p>seating himself unsteadily on a ledge of the </p><p>Alamut </p><p>3i </p><p>rocks, for he had beeir drinking, “will keep </p><p>the outer post.” </p><p> “Aye,” said Khlit, “you and I.”</p><p> He stared out into the moonlight haze</p><p>that hung over the river. Berea had said </p><p>that he and Toctamish were to hold the </p><p>outer post. From some quarter the horse- </p><p>men of Kiragai Khan were nearing the gate </p><p>of Alamut. Khlit realized that unless the </p><p>attack came as a surprise the citadel was </p><p>impregnable. A surprise might carry the </p><p>Tatar horde into the entrance. Berea had </p><p>said there was a way. And this was it. </p><p>Yet, if a surprise was to succeed the </p><p>Khirghiz must be disposed of. He had </p><p>been drinking, but he was still watchful. </p><p>No movement of the Cossack escaped him. </p><p> Quietly Khlit drew out a small vial.</p><p>From this he poured a few grains of a while </p><p>powder into his hand. Lifting his hand he </p><p>made as if to take the powder into his </p><p>mouth. The Khirghiz bent forward, and </p><p>his face lighted with evil desire. </p><p> “Have you—” he began.</p><p> “Come, Brother,” whispered Khlit geni-</p><p>ally, “we will be comfortable on the rocks. </p><p>Is not the bread of the Refik the vintage of </p><p>the Shadna to be eaten? Come.” </p><p> The Khirghiz swore softly and held out</p><p>his hand. In wine and food, the vintage of </p><p>the Shadna was often in the hands of the </p><p>Refik men. But not, except on expeditions </p><p>of the Master of Alamut, or by costly </p><p>bribery of the Dais was the pure powder of </p><p>hashish to be had, the hashish that brought </p><p>bright dreams of paradise and lulled the </p><p>mind with pleasures, that hardened the </p><p>souls of the men of Alamut, and steeled </p><p>their hands to the dagger. </p><p> Khlit, who had discovered the secret of</p><p>the drug through the babblings of Iba </p><p>Kabash, quietly dropped his portion back </p><p>into the vial. Later, he knew, the Khir- </p><p>ghiz would want more and he had but a </p><p>little. </p><p>XIV </p><p>IT WAS not long before Khlit was </p><p>alone. The Khirghiz lay at his side </p><p>on the rocks, muttering to himself </p><p>with enough hashish inside him to make an </p><p>imbecile of an ordinary man. Khlit sat </p><p>by his side, saber across his knees, and </p><p>watched the moonlit sides of the heights </p><p>that frowned down on him. On the slopes </p><p>he could make out the shadowy outlines </p><p>of droves of horses, and he wondered if the </p><p>Dais were planning an expedition that </p><p>night. </p><p> Usually, Khlit was not given to fore-</p><p>bodings. Yet the black mass of Alamut </p><p>rising at his back gave him the feeling </p><p>of approaching danger, and when he scanned </p><p>the shadows along the river they moved as </p><p>if filled with the bands of drug-crazed </p><p>fedavie. Especially, Khlit wondered if the </p><p>spies of Rashideddin were watching him. </p><p>Rashideddin had learned of the murder of </p><p>the Syrian, had connected Berea with it, </p><p>and Toctamish with Berea. Toctamish, at </p><p>his order, had been tortured with such </p><p>devilish cruelty that even the Tatar’s </p><p>fortitude might break down. </p><p> How much did the astrologer know of</p><p>Berea’s secret? Once the alarm was raised </p><p>in Alamut a thousand swords would block </p><p>the stairs at the river gate and the rope </p><p>hoists of the slaves at the rear would be </p><p>drawn up. There were no signs of activity </p><p>that Khlit could see, but few ever saw the </p><p>movements of the fedavie. Accustomed as </p><p>he was to war on the steppe, he was skeptical </p><p>of horsemen taking such a stronghold as </p><p>Alamut. </p><p> Once the Tatar horde forced the entrance</p><p>there would be a battle such as Khlit had </p><p>never seen before. Himself a Cossack, he </p><p>cared little whether Refik or Khan were the </p><p>victor—except that he had sworn an oath, </p><p>a double oath, that the life of the Master </p><p>of Alamut, Halen ibn Shaddah, would fall </p><p>to his sword. Wherefore, he waited pa- </p><p>tiently, eyes searching the road by the river </p><p>where the invaders might come. </p><p> Berea had told him that twenty thousand</p><p>Tatars were riding through the hills to </p><p>Alamut. Yet the road was narrow and </p><p>the way twisted. It would be hard to move </p><p>quickly. And there were the horse-tenders </p><p>on the hills who would give the alarm.</p><p>Khlit had come to grant a grudging admira- </p><p>tion to the sheik’s daughter who had defied </p><p>Halen ibn Shaddah. But she was in </p><p>Rashideddin’s hands, and the astrologer </p><p>was the man Khlit had marked as most </p><p>dangerous of the Refik. </p><p> Rising suddenly, Khlit drew in his breath</p><p>sharply. Outlined against the summit of </p><p>a hill he saw a horse and rider moving very </p><p>swiftly. The man was bent low in his </p><p>saddle and Khlit thought he saw the long </p><p>cloak of the fedavie before the rider came </p><p>over the brow of the hill. Half-way down </p><p>the descent the horse stumbled and fell. </p><p>32 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Khlit saw a dark object shoot from the</p><p>rolling horse and lie passive, clear in the </p><p>moonlight. The messenger, if such it was, </p><p>of the fedavie would not reach his destina- </p><p>tion. And at the same time Khlit saw </p><p>something else. Before his eyes as if by </p><p>magic he beheld Kiragai Khan and thou- </p><p>sands of his horsemen. </p><p> Then Khlit, surnamed the Wolf, buckled</p><p>tight his belt and drew on his sheepskin hat </p><p>firmly. There was to be a battle that </p><p>would redden the waters of the Shahrud </p><p>and, among the swords of the fedavie Halen </p><p>ibn Shaddah was to be found. </p><p> Apparently there was nothing stirring</p><p>on the mountain slopes of Rudbar except </p><p>the shapes of the horse droves that drew </p><p>down to the river as was their custom, </p><p>awaiting the bands of the Dais which came </p><p>out for mounts. Tonight there were no </p><p>men issuing from Alamut. And it was only </p><p>when one of the herds moved across the face </p><p>of the moon that Khlit saw the tips of Tatar </p><p>helmets moving among the horses, and </p><p>understood why the horses seemed more </p><p>numerous than before. </p><p> Even as Berea had promised, the Tatar</p><p>horde was approaching the gate of Alamut. </p><p>One of the herds reached the river’s edge </p><p>and pressed on, in the shadow of the hill- </p><p>side. Khlit could see the faces of men </p><p>peering at him, and catch the glint of their </p><p>spears. He gave a hasty glance at his com- </p><p>panion. The man was sleeping heavily. </p><p> Familiar with the ways of the Tatars, the</p><p>Cossack could guess how their whirlwind </p><p>rush into Rudbar had cut off all news being </p><p>sent to the citadel, and how, after dark, the </p><p>Refik horse-tenders on the pastures had </p><p>been singled out and cut down. One had </p><p>broken away with the news that was to </p><p>carry the doom of Alamut, only to fall by </p><p>the river. </p><p> The foremost warriors had reached him,</p><p>clinging closely to the sides of their horses. </p><p>A low voice called out to him cautiously. </p><p> “You are the Cossack who will guide us?”</p><p> “Aye,” said Khlit, “but the moon is</p><p>bright here and there are others within the </p><p>caverns. Are you ready to rush forward </p><p>at once?” </p><p> “Lead,” said the voice, “and we will</p><p>follow. Lead us to the gate of Alamut and </p><p>we will purge the devil’s hole of its filth.” </p><p> Khlit cast a quick glance at the hillsides.</p><p>Other bodies were moving down. Some </p><p>were nearly at the river. Thousands were </p><p>coming over the hillcrest. More were </p><p>coming by the river road. On the far </p><p>flanks detachments were moving to the rear </p><p>of Alamut. </p><p> Drawing his sword, he sprang down into</p><p>the river and splashed toward the shore. </p><p>Dark forms closed in beside him, and the </p><p>welcome stench of sweat and leather filled </p><p>his nose. The river was full of moving </p><p>forms, and horses that dashed, riderless, to </p><p>either side. Khlit’s heart leaped, and his </p><p>clasp tightened on his sword. One of the </p><p>foremost caught him roughly by the arm. </p><p>Khlit had a quick glimpse of a dark, lined </p><p>face and flashing eyes. </p><p> “I am Kiragai Khan, Cossack. Where</p><p>is Toctamish? He was to stay by the side </p><p>of Berea!”. </p><p> “She sent him to watch with me. Yet,</p><p>very likely he is dead by now.” </p><p> The other swore, as they gained the</p><p>shelter of the caverns. </p><p> “Take me to her, then,” he snarled.</p><p> So it happened that before the light of</p><p>day touched the date trees on the summit of </p><p>Alamut, citadel of the Refik, and place of </p><p>plague and evil, the first of the horde that </p><p>had ridden from the shores of the Salt Sea </p><p>entered the river gate, overcoming a few </p><p>guards, forced their way up the stair, and </p><p>spread through the passages of Alamut, </p><p>making no sound but silently, as tigers </p><p>seeking their prey. </p><p>XV </p><p>IN THE annals of Abulghazi it is </p><p>written how, in the year of the lion, </p><p>came the doom of Alamut. The </p><p>Refik folk were cornered in the cellars of</p><p>the citadel, and taken by surprise. The </p><p>swords of the Kallmark Tatars flashed in </p><p>the passages, and their sharp arrows sped </p><p>through the corridors. And, as the proph- </p><p>ecy said, the waters of the Shadrud were red. </p><p> Yet in the book of Abulghazi and the</p><p>annals of the Persian dynasties there is </p><p>nothing said of the fate of Halen ibn </p><p>Shaddah who was the last leader of the </p><p>Refik. The followers of Kiragai Khan </p><p>sought through Alamut from the wine </p><p>chambers to the gardens among the ruins </p><p>on the summit, and they did not find </p><p>Halen ibn Shaddah. </p><p> The battle was not over for many hours.</p><p>Separate bands of mounted Tatars had </p><p>surrounded the height on which Alamut </p><p>\ </p><p>Alamut </p><p>33 </p><p>stood, and when throngs of slaves, and the </p><p>eunuchs with the houris of the gardens </p><p>swept out from hidden tunnels and were </p><p>lowered over the wall, they were cut down. </p><p>They were not spared, for that was the </p><p>word of Kiragai Khan. The fedavie, cor- </p><p>nered, and led by their Dais, rallied and </p><p>attacked the columns of invaders which </p><p>were penetrating to the heart of Alamut. </p><p> The Tatars without their horses and</p><p>fighting in the gloom of the caverns were </p><p>at a disadvantage, which was offset by </p><p>greater numbers and the leadership of </p><p>Kiragai Khan. For the fedavie had no </p><p>leader. Messengers who sought through </p><p>the tapestried apartments of the Shadna </p><p>for Halen ibn Shaddah found none but </p><p>panic-struck Daikebirs. The tide of battle </p><p>flung the fedavie back to the banquet-place, </p><p>and to the treasure-house beyond. If </p><p>there had been a leader they might have </p><p>held the dark passages until the Tatars were </p><p>sickened by the slaughter of their men. </p><p> Such was the doom of Alamut. Torches</p><p>flaring through chambers hung with gold </p><p>cloth and Uttered with jeweled statuary </p><p>from Trebizond, with silk rugs of Ispahan. </p><p>Swords flashing in dark tunnels, where </p><p>naught was heard but the gasping of men </p><p>bitten by steel and the sound of bodies </p><p>falling to the earth. Wailing and lamenta- </p><p>tion in the gardens under the date trees </p><p>which were the evil paradise of Halen ibn </p><p>Shaddah, and the splash of stricken women </p><p>in the canals. Dark-faced, squat men in </p><p>mail and fur cloaks trampling through </p><p>treasure-rooms where the riches of a thou- </p><p>sand caravans and a hundred cities stood. </p><p> Never had the followers of Kiragai Khan</p><p>taken spoil so rich. Pearls from Damascus, </p><p>golden fish from Che-ting, emeralds and </p><p>sapphires from Tabriz,, urns of gold shekels </p><p>from the merchants of Samarkand and </p><p>ornaments from the califate of Bagdad that </p><p>would grace the court of a Mongol emperor. </p><p>Slant eyes of the Kallmark horsemen </p><p>widened, and they urged their dogs into </p><p>the rivers of wine in the gardens, ripping </p><p>into shreds rugs and hangings, splintering </p><p>porcelain kiosks with rocks, and trampling</p><p>on the bodies of the dead. Few lived. </p><p> And still the Master of Alamut was not</p><p>found. Once Iba Kabash, who had at- </p><p>tached himself to the winning side, and was </p><p>spared because he brought Berea safe to </p><p>Kiragai Khan, paused beside the body of a </p><p>very large man, cloaked and jeweled. But </p><p>he spumed it with his foot when he turned </p><p>it over, for the giant face was that of a black </p><p>eunuch. </p><p> Yet there was one who said he had found</p><p>Halen ibn Shaddah. Iba Kabash, who was </p><p>eager to find favor with his new lord, </p><p>offered, trembling, to take him to the </p><p>circular chamber of Rashideddin. Berea </p><p>came with them, for she was not one to </p><p>leave the side of Kiragai Khan in battle, </p><p>being the daughter of a hill sheik and not a </p><p>Tatar woman. </p><p> They climbed the winding stairs escorted</p><p>by the renegade with torch-bearers and </p><p>armed Kallmarks. In the circular chamber </p><p>of the astrologer they saw a strange sight. </p><p>The room had been dark. By the flare </p><p>of their torches they made out three men, </p><p>two dead, and the third sitting on the floor. </p><p>Kiragai Khan paused for a moment by the </p><p>body of Toctamish, burned and bloody, </p><p>for the man had been one of his lieutenants, </p><p>and very brave. </p><p> “He died under torture, lord and Celestial</p><p>Master,” gibbered Iba Kabash, pointing. </p><p>“For he would not tell of the queenly Berea, </p><p>or the coming of the noble Tatars.” </p><p> Kiragai Khan said nothing, passing to</p><p>the next body, and pressing the hand of </p><p>Berea when the girl cried out. This one </p><p>was Rashideddin, his gray robe stained with </p><p>red, and his lean face convulsed. His arms </p><p>flung wide, and sightless, leering eyes </p><p>staring upward through the opening to the </p><p>stars, the astrologer had died in the grip of </p><p>anger. Berea, leaning over him, watched </p><p>vainly for a breath to stir the gray cloak. </p><p>Seated beside Rashideddin she saw Khlit, </p><p>wiping his sword calmly with a corner of </p><p>the dead man’s cloak. </p><p> “Have you seen Halen ibn Shaddah?”</p><p>demanded Iba Kabash officiously. “The </p><p>noble Kiragai Khan has missed you, since </p><p>he came into the entrance of Alamut. Was</p><p>it you that killed Rashideddin?” </p><p> “Aye,” answered Khlit, looking up indif-</p><p>ferently. “Have the Kallmarks or the </p><p>Refik the upper hand? I have seen Halen </p><p>ibn Shaddah.” </p><p> “The battle is over, Klilit,” exclaimed</p><p>Berea pressing forward, but keeping the </p><p>hand of the Tatar leader. Her eyes were </p><p>shining, and she held her head proudly. </p><p>“The doom of Alamut has come, as I swore </p><p>it would. It was my will that it should, </p><p>mine and my lord’s. For I came to him </p><p>without a gift and was ashamed. Yet did </p><p>34 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>he marry me in spite of that. And I swore </p><p>to him that if he would avenge my father </p><p>such a gift should be his as no other bride </p><p>could bring. Alamut would be his, with </p><p>the treasure of the Refik. And now he has </p><p>seen that the gift is rich. All that Halen </p><p>ibn Shaddah had.” </p><p> Khlit’s glance sought that of the Tatar</p><p>leader, and they measured each other </p><p>silently. </p><p> “The way is long from Tatary,” went</p><p>on Berea, tossing her head, “but I am very </p><p>beautiful in the sight of my lord, and he </p><p>consented to my plan—to come to open the </p><p>gate to him—saying only that Toctamish </p><p>should come. I picked you, Cossack, as </p><p>my father of battles. Yet I am grieved. </p><p>You swore that you would slay for me Halen </p><p>ibn Shaddah-” </p><p> “Have you seen,” broke in Kiragai Khan</p><p>gruffly, “the one who is called Master of </p><p>Alamut?” </p><p> “Aye, he was here.”</p><p> “Which way did he go? Speak.”</p><p> “He did not go.”</p><p> The khan looked around the chamber.</p><p>It was empty except for the two bodies. A </p><p>sudden blast of air from the opening over- </p><p>head made the flame of the torches whirl, </p><p>and cast a gleam on the face of Rashideddin </p><p>as if the dead man had moved. Berea drew </p><p>back with a smothered cry. </p><p> “The man who was called Halen ibn</p><p>Shaddah,” said Khlit, “was a eunuch of </p><p>great size. The real Master of Alamut was </p><p>another. He concealed his identity to avoid </p><p>the daggers of those who would slay him. </p><p>Yet is he slain. And I have kept my oath, </p><p>Berea, princess.” </p><p> The eyes of the others strayed to the body</p><p>of Rashideddin, and rested on the red stains </p><p>that garnished the gray cloak with the red </p><p>ribbons of death. The blind eyes of Halen </p><p>ibn Shaddah were fixed on the stars visible </p><p>through the opening in the ceiling. And</p><p>Khlit, seeing this, knew that he would be </p><p>very glad to turn his horse again toward the </p><p>steppe and away from Alamut. </p><p>TO A SOLDIER </p><p>BY RUTH LAMBERT JONES </p><p> “ \ GOOD start in business—</p><p> f*- Wasted!” you say.</p><p> That’s your only regret</p><p> As you march on your way.</p><p> What of your start</p><p> In the business of living?</p><p> What of your start</p><p> In the business of giving?</p><p> That others may live</p><p> You are giving your all:</p><p> The business of Life—</p><p> Do you count it small?</p><p> “A good start in business—</p><p> Wasted!” you say.</p><p> Man, you are starting</p><p> Life’s business today!</p><p>SHOOITN I </p><p>FSJ.;S # V - If u&amp;Qi jg4_X EA R L ENNIS '^£^3 </p><p> Author of "By Primilial Code.”</p><p>GRIT is one of the few remaining </p><p>towns on the Mojave Desert </p><p>that represents a survival of </p><p>much that has passed away in </p><p>other portions of the West. </p><p> Adobe houses, warped and crumbling</p><p>from a half-century of sun and rain, a </p><p>main street, double-flanked by saloons, and </p><p>an array of horse-troughs, mongrel dogs </p><p>and nondescript Mexicans, are still its chief </p><p>characteristics. Many of the old-time tra- </p><p>ditions and habits still linger about the </p><p>place, recalling the period when gold-dust </p><p>was the chief currency at Roaring Jack bar, </p><p>and sourdoughs went bravely out to loot </p><p>the hills of their hidden wealth. </p><p> Among the things that still survived,</p><p>when the events of this story occurred, was </p><p>the official range pay-day, when sun- </p><p>browned, lithe-flanked cowboys came riot- </p><p>ously in from the south and east to waste </p><p>the earnings of months over the green felt </p><p>tables; the faro parties that lasted the night </p><p>out, leaving the players heavy-eyed and </p><p>spent, with empty pockets and the eternal </p><p>hope of ultimate bonanzas burning in their </p><p>brains; the perpetual arguments between </p><p>cowmen and sheep-herders over the rights </p><p>of the range. And then—not least among </p><p>the institutions of Grit, there was Sheriff </p><p>Bill Doble in his grimy-windowed office, </p><p>adjoining the general store, with his rows </p><p>of dust-hung law books and his picture gal- </p><p>lery of reward placards. </p><p> Bill had been sheriff in Grit so long he</p><p>had earned the repute of an institution. </p><p>Like the alkali dust that filtered in with the </p><p>Autumn sandstorms, and the night wind </p><p>that bit down on the flatlands from the San </p><p>Bernardino Mountains, old Bill, tilted back </p><p>in his swivel-chair, rowelling the antique </p><p>desk with his spurs, had become an integral </p><p>part of local scenery. In Los Angeles, Bill </p><p>would have been classified as a tourist </p><p>attraction and the world taught to make </p><p>a pathway to his door. But in Grit the </p><p>world passed him by, when it passed at all, </p><p>with a friendly salute, content that he stood </p><p>sponsor for the law and order for which the</p><p>town was famed afar. </p><p> Personally Bill was just the kind of a</p><p>sheriff one would expect to find in a desert </p><p>town. He was solid and substantial from </p><p>his spurs to his snake-belted sombrero. </p><p>What he had to say was short and pithy </p><p>and his convictions left no room for misun- </p><p>derstanding. In fact, Bill never had but </p><p>one argument, and that it had been but </p><p>five times disputed was plainly on record. </p><p>The heavy Colt six-gun that dangled from </p><p>his belt bore carefully carved notches on </p><p>the butt. The further reputation of always </p><p>giving a “square deal” and of standing for </p><p>unvarying honesty had brought the respect </p><p>of the entire range country. </p><p> Such was the status of affairs when, into</p><p>the even tenor of Grit’s daily program, on a </p><p>hot July night came “Buck” Saunders. </p><p>Buck’s advent was a bomb hurled into the </p><p>tranquility of the town’s regular routine, </p><p>which left a changed order of tilings that </p><p>is still discussed in reminiscence around </p><p>camp-fires in the cow-country, when the </p><p>“chuck” ceremonies are over and the brand- </p><p>ing crews rest from their strenuous labors. </p><p> As a foreword to the arrival of Buck</p><p>35 </p><p>36 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Saunders, mention of the transfer of </p><p>“Rusty” McGee, roper and buckaroo, to- </p><p>gether with his “caballo” and his personal </p><p>effects from the Hashknife rancho to the </p><p>Double-O headquarters is of more than </p><p>passing importance. For Rusty had con- </p><p>siderable to do with Buck Saunders in the </p><p>eventful days that ensued, albeit their </p><p>arrival in the same territory was purely </p><p>coincidental. Rusty came with a good </p><p>recommendation, a mat of fiery red hair, </p><p>and a cheerful [smile—a bond on the </p><p>range where men are appraised, and ac- </p><p>cepted or rejected, frankly on their face </p><p>value. </p><p> Rusty McGee was Irish, which explains</p><p>at once his hair, his grin and his eternal </p><p>brag of himself, his family, and all that </p><p>pertained thereto. Rusty had a brother </p><p>Jim who was a ranger with the Canadian </p><p>Northwest Mounted Police. To Rusty, the </p><p>sun rose and set in Jim. He spent hours </p><p>telling the Double-0 boys about the won- </p><p>derful things Jim had done up in the coun- </p><p>try where the lakes are fastened together </p><p>and the bull caribou thunder down with the </p><p>flare of the Northern Lights at their heels. </p><p>At first it all made little impression. But </p><p>water dropping upon a rock will eventually </p><p>wear a dent, and after a time the punchers </p><p>began subconsciously to absorb a little of </p><p>Rusty’s creed. </p><p> They were still in the preliminary stages</p><p>of appreciation when Buck Saunders left his </p><p>haunts on the Mesa Perdita, where he had </p><p>been rustling cattle for a pastime, and set </p><p>out for new worlds to conquer. He chose </p><p>for want of something better, the gambling- </p><p>house of “Money” Meek, which occupied a </p><p>leading position among similar institutions </p><p>in the town of Grit. As Johnnie Murray, </p><p>foreman of the Hashknife rancho, who wit- </p><p>nessed the whole episode, afterward de- </p><p>scribed him. Buck was “an ornery varmint </p><p>with a mean eye, who wore his sombrero </p><p>on the hump of his nose, and packed a gun </p><p>on each leg, with the toe of the holsters tied </p><p>down for a greased lightnin’ draw.” </p><p> Buck picked a sweltering night when the</p><p>place was full. He kicked open the swing- </p><p>ing doors and walked in with a Colt in each </p><p>hand. While two-score cowboys and sheep-</p><p>men stood with upraised hands he made his </p><p>wants known in succinct language. The </p><p>situation was plain to even the stupidest </p><p>Mexican among them. </p><p> “Git a move on,” Buck adjured. “I got</p><p>other business besides waitin’ on you horn- </p><p>bres.” </p><p> Under the outlaw’s direction, die bar-</p><p>tender emptied the contents of the till and </p><p>the faro-dealer’s drawer into a bandanna </p><p>handkerchief. Then he went through the </p><p>pockets of those present and added what </p><p>he found to the collection. The whole he </p><p>handed to Buck, who tucked it in his shirt, </p><p>backed from the place with a wary eye for </p><p>possible gun-play, and disappeared from </p><p>sight into the shadows of the night on a </p><p>mean-faced pinto. </p><p> “And there we stood,” said Johnnie Mur-</p><p>ray, “like five minutes to one, not a gun </p><p>in the crowd, nobody havin’ figgered on the </p><p>genuine article payin’ us a visit like that.” </p><p>jpsai AS MIGHT be surmised, the liold- </p><p>pVyj up formed the main topic for dis- </p><p>cussion at breakfast the next mor- </p><p>ning, when the Double-0 outfit stamped </p><p>into the ranch-house with the tingle of </p><p>pump water still on their faces. Sheriff </p><p>Bill Doble had come out of his lethargy, </p><p>organized a posse and long before midnight </p><p>had set out across the mesa on the trail of </p><p>the bandit. Some of the punchers were </p><p>optimistic about the result; others were </p><p>noticeably silent. But Rusty McGee was </p><p>openly scornful. </p><p> “Up in Canada,” he said, “there wouldn’t</p><p>be no such tom-foolery as sendin’ an army </p><p>out to get a four-flusher like Buck Saun- </p><p>ders. He’s a one-man job. What’s the </p><p>matter? Is your sheriff gettin’ old?” </p><p> The boys tried to explain that age cut</p><p>no figure in the matter. That it was cus- </p><p>tom, dating back to time immemorial, and </p><p>based upon the exigencies of the occasion </p><p>and plain “lioss” sense. But Rusty McGee </p><p>refused to see it that way. He argued that </p><p>the thing was being overdone, and that a </p><p>fugitive had his chances of escape increased </p><p>by being able to both see and hear a posse, </p><p>while a single officer, well armed and coura- </p><p>geous, could run him down with greater</p><p>surety. </p><p> “That’s what Jim says,” he added as a</p><p>clinching argument, “and he ain’t never </p><p>lost a man yet.” </p><p> Rusty’s position was considerably</p><p>strengthened when, along toward nightfall, </p><p>the posse returned empty-handed and worn </p><p>out with eighteen hours’ -fruidess beating of </p><p>cottonwoods and mesquite. Johnnie Mur- </p><p>ray saw them first and he noted the general </p><p>Hip Shootin’ </p><p>37 </p><p>attitude of the riders. He nudged “Clothes- </p><p>pin Mills” with his elbow and pointed toward </p><p>the cloud of dust kicked up by the lagging </p><p>hoofs of the animals. </p><p> “They done lost him,” he commented.</p><p>“That red-headed Rusty McGee ain’t such </p><p>a-fool as he looks.” </p><p> “The which I was thinkin’ when I heard</p><p>him palaver,” agreed Clothespin sapiently. </p><p> The posse turned its horses into the</p><p>Double-0 corral for the night. They had </p><p>few comments to make, being too tired and </p><p>hungry for conversation. Sheriff Bill, al- </p><p>ways reticent, bordered on taciturnity. He </p><p>ate his dinner in silence and vouchsafed </p><p>only monosyllabic grunts to the questions </p><p>plied by the curious punchers. </p><p> “Rodeo Sam,” one of the posse and a</p><p>wrangler from the Triangle-Z outfit, ex- </p><p>pressed the general sentiment in an under- </p><p>tone to Johnnie Murray as they were turn- </p><p>ing into the bunks for the night. </p><p> “Bill’s takin’ these things to heart more’n</p><p>he used to,” he said. “I remember when </p><p>he used to liquor up and call it a night. </p><p>He would say there is always a manana.” </p><p>“Mebbe he’s wore out,” suggested John- </p><p>nie Murray. </p><p> “Shouldn’t wonder. Bill ain’t so young</p><p>as he used to be.” </p><p> Johnnie Murray recalled Rusty McGee’s</p><p>remark and he found himself speculating. </p><p> The posse spent the rest of the week</p><p>searching the foothill region without un- </p><p>covering a trace of the outlaw. The hunt </p><p>finally dwindled away to sporadic excur- </p><p>sions into the cottonwood and yucca dis- </p><p>trict in the hope that something might </p><p>show which would approximate a clew. </p><p>A score of inquiries spread broadcast </p><p>through the medium of cattlemen failed </p><p>to bring even a hint of the where- </p><p>abouts of Buck Saunders, save that once a </p><p>glimpse of a crouching figure on a pinto </p><p>pony had been had by a passing sheepman </p><p>at the lower end of the county.</p><p> While this was taking place, Rusty Mc-</p><p>Gee was making the most of his opportunity </p><p>for impressing the Double-0 boys with his </p><p>theory of the duty and obligations of a </p><p>sheriff. Rusty had nothing against old </p><p>Bill Doble. Down in his heart he held a </p><p>secret admiration for him. But he could </p><p>not help making comparisons between old </p><p>Bill and his brother Jim. He meant to be </p><p>fair. He tried to be just. But Rusty was </p><p>a product of his race, and always it was </p><p>the sheriff who suffered by comparison. </p><p> From an outspoken question regarding</p><p>Bill’s age and incident lack of capacity, as </p><p>he saw it, he one day broke into open criti- </p><p>cism. But there he fell afoul of one of the </p><p>strongest traditions of the cow-country. </p><p>For no matter what other faults the aver- </p><p>age range-rider may have, he is loyal to his </p><p>sheriff. He will crawl out of a warm bunk </p><p>on the coldest nights and ride through slush </p><p>and mud and in pouring rain to go to his </p><p>assistance. He is always ready with horse </p><p>and weapon to support the man who wears </p><p>the star to the limit of his ability. </p><p> Rusty, embarking upon his reckless cen-</p><p>sure of Sheriff Bill Doble’s attainments, </p><p>found himself suddenly jerked to earth and </p><p>called upon for proof. Whereupon he swore </p><p>by all the sacred standards of the carrot- </p><p>haired McGees that he would one day ad- </p><p>duce this evidence. </p><p> “I ain’t sayin’ that old Bill wasn’t a</p><p>regular hellion in his day,” he would say </p><p>in the lulls between “Sad-eyed Pete’s” </p><p>baritone solo on “The Deep Blue Sea” and </p><p>the harmonica obbligato of “Latigo” Jones, </p><p>“but that was a long time ago. Some one </p><p>of these here days, Bill’s goin’ to come in </p><p>all draped nice and neat over his saddle- </p><p>horn, the same bein’ proof plenty sufficient, </p><p>he had got too old for fast work. You </p><p>hombres ’11 be feelin’ some regretful about </p><p>then, I’m thinkin’.” </p><p> The boys of the Double-O would listen</p><p>to his words and spit in the fire thought- </p><p>fully. </p><p> Rusty had his golden opportunity about</p><p>a month later when Buck Saunders, tiring </p><p>of inaction, dropped into San Luis, a sister </p><p>city to Grit and farther north on the Mo-</p><p>jave. One of the first places he visited was </p><p>that of “Sandy” McPherson, a Scotchman, </p><p>who ran the principal general merchandise </p><p>store in the place. The streets were de- </p><p>serted, it being early in the day, and most </p><p>of the inhabitants, save for the hangers-on, </p><p>attending to such indoor duties as would </p><p>keep them out of the morning heat. </p><p> The outlaw walked in and called for a</p><p>tarpaulin. McPherson threw a stack on </p><p>the counter and named the price. </p><p> “Too much!” snapped Buck.</p><p> “Take it or leave it,” rapped back Mc-</p><p>Pherson, turning on his heel. </p><p> The outlaw stared at him with an ex-</p><p>pressionless face. Then he whipped his </p><p>revolver from its laced scabbard. Without </p><p>38 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>a trace of visible feeling he shot the Scotch- </p><p>man twice, in the back, as he bent over </p><p>a bin with a sugar scoop in his hand. Mc- </p><p>Pherson fell to the bin and died there. </p><p>Citizens of Grit, attracted by the sound of </p><p>the shots, rushed to the spot, to find him </p><p>with his feet sticking out of the bin gro- </p><p>tesquely—his wife pulling helplessly at </p><p>him. Buck, she said, had ridden away with </p><p>the tarpaulin. </p><p>PPH RUSTY McGEE and some of the </p><p>§||§i Double-O boys were in town at </p><p>the time and came up with the rest. </p><p>They got Sheriff Bill on the long distance </p><p>and received his loud assurance that he </p><p>would be right over. While they waited, </p><p>the boys questioned the storekeeper’s wife, </p><p>who had been a witness of the shooting, as </p><p>to what had taken place. From her, they </p><p>gleaned as a striking fact that Buck Saun- </p><p>ders had shot from the hip-line without </p><p>raising his weapon. </p><p> “Can’t you see?” bleated Rusty McGee.</p><p>“He’s a hip-shooter! They’re the worst in </p><p>the world. It’s suicide to put old Bill up </p><p>against a hombre like him. Now Jim </p><p>says-” </p><p> But Latigo Jones interrupted the solilo-</p><p>quy. </p><p> “Oh, shut up, can’t you, you bandy-</p><p>legged maverick,” he growled, jerking his </p><p>head toward the terrified woman. “Ain’t </p><p>you got no sense at all?” </p><p> Rusty, realizing that he had picked the</p><p>wrong time and place to stiffen his credit, </p><p>relapsed into unwilling silence. But he </p><p>was not to be suppressed. </p><p> When Sheriff Bill arrived he promptly</p><p>split the Double-O in half, taking men he </p><p>knew to be seasoned riders and best able to </p><p>stand the long gruelling test to which they </p><p>would be put. To these he added a hand- </p><p>ful of local friends of the dead man, out of </p><p>respect to the latter’s memory. In a few </p><p>minutes, cow-punchers were scurrying in all </p><p>directions, gathering ammunition and pro- </p><p>visions, blankets and Winchesters. Within </p><p>half an hour after Buck Saunders had shot </p><p>down the peaceable Scotchman fifty well-</p><p>armed, determined men were hot on his </p><p>trail with Sheriff Bill Doble riding well in </p><p>the lead on a big bay mare that was known </p><p>to be one of the hardest and longest trav- </p><p>elers on the range. </p><p> Rusty McGee was among the Double-0</p><p>boys that Bill had selected to accompany </p><p>him. He was a good rider, an excellent </p><p>shot and, with all his talk, nerve and grit </p><p>to the backbone. He had been picked with </p><p>the rest at the suggestion of “Sawbones” </p><p>Hawkins, foreman of the Double-O, who </p><p>had been irritated at Rusty’s criticism of </p><p>the sheriff and wanted him to get ac- </p><p>quainted with Bill Doble at close range. </p><p>In this, the code of the cow-country was </p><p>being followed to a nicety—the code which </p><p>never seeks to change a man’s opinions by </p><p>argument, but leaves it to the more em- </p><p>phatic school of experience. </p><p> Straight out across the Mesa Perdita they</p><p>rode, into the purple twilight haze, where </p><p>turquoise and lavender met and mingled </p><p>with crimson and gold. At their head rode </p><p>“Indian Joe,” an Indian trailer who was </p><p>invaluable to every posse when trails turned </p><p>to hard ground and aboriginal skill became </p><p>more valuable than white men’s logic. For </p><p>the most part the men were silent, attend- </p><p>ing strictly to the business of conserving </p><p>their mounts across the uneven ground. </p><p>The only sounds were the jingle of bridles, </p><p>the steady drum of the horses’ hoofs, and </p><p>the rattle of mile after mile of mesquite </p><p>against the stirrup leathers, with now and </p><p>then some brief comment of the trail. </p><p> The sky, which had been lowering all</p><p>day, settled down at dusk into an ominous </p><p>blackness. Little gusts of wind puffed in </p><p>their faces, bringing odd desert odors. The </p><p>mesquite gave way to matted chaparral </p><p>and the jaws of Dead Man’s Canon closed </p><p>in upon them. Clothespin Mills sniffed the </p><p>air like a hound and muttered to himself. </p><p> “What say?” chirruped Latigo Jones,</p><p>swinging in his saddle. </p><p> “Rain cornin’.”</p><p> “It’s goin’ to be nice ridin’ tonight.”</p><p> “Sure is. Where are we headin’?”</p><p> “The Johnson ranch, I reckon.”</p><p> “I think old Bill’s wrong on that.”</p><p> “Same here. That maverick Buck Saun-</p><p>ders never wasted no time cornin’ this way. </p><p>He double-tracked back at Morgan’s water- </p><p>hole, and went south. That’s where he </p><p>hangs out. ‘Bud’ Stutz met him down </p><p>there last week.” </p><p> “Did you tell Bill that?”</p><p> “Bill was with me when Stutz told us</p><p>about it. But Bill’s got his own ideas. You </p><p>can’t argue with Bill.” </p><p> “Well, I’d a heap sight rather bunk at</p><p>the Johnson ranch than go stompin’ ’round </p><p>in the slush on a night like this.” </p><p>Hip Shootin’ </p><p>39 </p><p> He emphasized his remark with a glare</p><p>at the lowering sky. Latigo Jones grunted </p><p>his agreement. </p><p> “Well, you know the deal—fresh caballos</p><p>at the Johnson ranch, and keep on goin’. </p><p>I know Bill. He figgers on makin’ Big </p><p>Eye Butte by mornin’. You can see a heap </p><p>of country from there, you know. Get </p><p>me?” </p><p> “Yeah, I get you, but I ain’t savin’</p><p>nothin’. Me—I’m doin’ a heap o’ thinkin’.” </p><p> Rusty McGee had been an interested</p><p>listener to the conversation. He swung </p><p>his horse in closer and lowered his voice. </p><p> “What do you say we drop out and^ trail</p><p>down by the water-hole way?” he asked. </p><p> “Not me,” declared Clothespin with</p><p>finality. “This here is Bill’s own private </p><p>funeral. Besides, there’s hot grub ahead, </p><p>and I’m strong for it.” </p><p> The posse was in the canon now. The</p><p>way was narrow and the little band strung </p><p>out in single file, picking its way among the </p><p>boulders with difficulty. The work de- </p><p>manded their full attention and conversa- </p><p>tion lapsed. An hour’s laborious riding, </p><p>and they came out of the upper end. The </p><p>lights of the Johnson ranch were just visible </p><p>through the sudden night when the rain </p><p>overtook them. By the time they reached </p><p>the friendly shelter of the ranch build- </p><p>ings, the water was pouring down in </p><p>torrents. </p><p> The severity of the shower changed the</p><p>aspect of things. The boys turned their </p><p>tired animals into the corral and clattered </p><p>into the ranch-house, where Johnson, the </p><p>owner of the place, gave them a cordial </p><p>welcome. </p><p> “Fan up old Betsy,” he said, jerking his</p><p>thumb toward a cast-iron stove in the mid- </p><p>dle of the living-room. “I’ll tell the Chink </p><p>to hunt out some chuck steak and a pan </p><p>of soda biscuits. Some rain, ain’t it?” </p><p> The posse needed no second invitation.</p><p>They stoked the fire, spread out their wet</p><p>clothing and thawed themselves into some </p><p>semblance of comfort. By the time the </p><p>feed was ready, everybody was in better </p><p>spirits. Buck Saunders became a remote </p><p>wraith of rain and storm, to be forgotten </p><p>until tomorrow. </p><p> “You ain’t calculatin’ on goin’ on to-</p><p>night, are you?” asked the ranch-owner, as </p><p>they pushed back their plates and felt for </p><p>pipes and cigaret papers. The sheriff shook </p><p>his head morosely. </p><p> “No use,” he replied. “Trail’s plumb</p><p>washed out. We’ll hit it up at dawn.” </p><p> The boys gave a sigh of relief. They</p><p>wanted to round up the outlaw. But trail- </p><p>ing through wet adobe in a pelting rain was </p><p>mighty disagreeable. There was little </p><p>chance they would overtake him with the </p><p>dark in his favor. There would be better </p><p>opportunity with the daylight. He would </p><p>take a chance then of being seen by a pass- </p><p>ing herder or cowman. That would start </p><p>a fresh trail. There was plenty of time. </p><p>They do not ride to a kill in one day ,on the </p><p>range. It is persistence and not the time </p><p>element that counts in a desert man-hunt. </p><p>So they settled down to the intricacies of </p><p>stud poker in the bunk-house with the </p><p>ropers from the ranch. </p><p>AT DAWN the following morning, </p><p>with freshened mounts under saddle, </p><p>the posse swung upward into the </p><p>foothills. The sky had cleared and every- </p><p>thing was new-washed and fresh. A lilac </p><p>haze hung along the upper levels and in the </p><p>distance the rugged outlines of Big Eye </p><p>Butte stood out in relief like a sharp-cut </p><p>cameo. The little cavalcade wound its </p><p>way across the steaming earth, discarding </p><p>known trails for less frequented roads, most </p><p>likely to show a sign of the man they </p><p>sought. </p><p> “I’ll bet a squaw-hitch he turned off at</p><p>that water-hole,” snapped Rusty McGee, in </p><p>growing irritation. </p><p> “Listens reasonable,” opined Clothesipn</p><p>Mills. “Reckon we might take a look </p><p>’round on the way back.” </p><p> Accordingly, when late in the day,</p><p>Sheriff Doble finally backtracked toward </p><p>home, after hours of fruitless search through</p><p>the “bad lands” of the mesa, the two cow- </p><p>boys dropped behind the rest. When they </p><p>reached the water-hole they turned into an </p><p>arroyo past a salt-lick, to where green stuff </p><p>sprouting from the earth gave indication </p><p>of hidden water. A brief space and they </p><p>came to the hole itself, its edge stippled with </p><p>innumerable cattle tracks running in all </p><p>directions. </p><p> Rusty jumped from his horse and studied</p><p>the ground closely. Clothespin hooked one </p><p>knee over his saddle-horn and rolled a cig- </p><p>aret. As he licked his wheat-straw into </p><p>position, a sudden exclamation from Rusty </p><p>brought him to the red-headed roper’s side. </p><p> “Look,” said Rusty.</p><p>40 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> He indicated the mark, of a shod horse</p><p>in the sand. Beside it was the print of a </p><p>man’s boot—a high-heeled, Mexican boot </p><p>of the type ropers wear to give a firm an- </p><p>chorage in the ground. Clothespin followed </p><p>McGee’s outstretched finger. </p><p> “It’s Buck, sure as shootin’,” said Rusty,</p><p>his hand shaking. </p><p> “Humph!” ejaculated Clothespin, bend-</p><p>ing down for a closer inspection. </p><p> Rusty continued:</p><p> “He got off here for somethin’, gave his</p><p>animile just time to water and then kept </p><p>on a-goin’.” </p><p> Head down, he began' to circle like a</p><p>hound. Suddenly he swung off abruptly </p><p>along the bed of the arroyo to a clump of </p><p>underbrush. Gun in hand, he stepped </p><p>through the bushes, Clothespin Mills at his </p><p>elbow. Directly under a cottonwood tree </p><p>a horse was tethered by a slim correa with </p><p>a single knot. The animal whinnied as the </p><p>two men came into view. </p><p> “Buck’s hoss,” exclaimed Clothespin, his</p><p>mouth close to Rusty McGee’s ear. </p><p> They stood silent and tense—listening.</p><p>There was only the faint rustle of small </p><p>ground-animals scurrying through the dry </p><p>branches underfoot. Rusty waved the nose </p><p>of his weapon at the animal. </p><p> “He changed animiles here,” he com-</p><p>mented. “This here is the one he was </p><p>ridin’ when he plugged Mac.” </p><p> The two cowboys crept out into the open,</p><p>alert for possible ambush. But they were </p><p>unmolested. Earth trampled down by </p><p>restless hoofs and tracks running east and </p><p>west told the story to their trained eyes. </p><p>It was as Rusty had said. The outlaw had </p><p>tied an extra animal at the water-hole for </p><p>emergencies. Riding to the utmost limit </p><p>of his horse’s speed, he had gained sufficient </p><p>headway to give the beast a drink and </p><p>change saddles. This done, he had ridden </p><p>away again on a fresh mount, more than a </p><p>match for the jaded posse behind him.</p><p> Rusty glanced along the bed of the arroyo</p><p>where an ordinarily dry bed had become </p><p>a creek from the downpour of the night </p><p>before. </p><p> “Ain’t no use in tryin’ to foller him</p><p>now,” he said. “If we’d come in here last </p><p>night we’d ’a’ had him where he belonged, </p><p>just like I thought.” </p><p> Clothespin Mills scratched his head re-</p><p>flectively. </p><p> “We might get the boys and lay ’round</p><p>in the bushes for awhile,” he suggested. </p><p>“He might come back after the caballo.” </p><p> Rusty McGee shook his head.</p><p> “Not Buck.” There was conviction in</p><p>his tone. “He’s too foxy to walk into any- </p><p>thing like that. Nope—we just nachully </p><p>lost him this time. That’s all there is to </p><p>it. “The next time I’m gonna use my </p><p>own judgment—and not some other hom- </p><p>bre’s.” He flung the last with sudden </p><p>venom. “Jim told me a long time ago, </p><p>when I was man-huntin’ to play a lone </p><p>hand. You can’t never bet on any other </p><p>fellow, he says.” </p><p> Clothespin Mills dropped his weapon</p><p>back into its holster and nodded his head </p><p>thoughtfully. </p><p> “That’s no lie,” he said with conviction.</p><p> The finding of Buck Saunders’ rendez-</p><p>vous and the manner in which Rusty </p><p>McGee’s judgment had been sustained in </p><p>the matter of outlaw-hunting, as related by </p><p>Clothespin Mills next morning to the </p><p>Double-0 contingent, raised the red-headed </p><p>cow-puncher several notches in the esti- </p><p>mation of his fellow ropers. His standing </p><p>was still further enhanced when the out- </p><p>law, emboldened by his first success, held </p><p>up two more saloons within the course of </p><p>the next fortnight. One was in Pacheco, </p><p>thirty miles from Grit. The other at Du- </p><p>barte, just across the Mesa Perdita. In </p><p>each case, Sheriff Bill Doble had gone out </p><p>across the sands at the head of a posse in </p><p>pursuit. In each case he had returned </p><p>empty-handed and disgusted, conscious of </p><p>a growing unrest among his men.</p><p> It was not that the posse blamed Sheriff</p><p>Bill entirely. Buck was a genius for </p><p>swooping down on an unprotected or unpre- </p><p>pared community. In addition, he had a </p><p>secret hiding-place somewhere in the bad </p><p>lands to which he always returned when </p><p>the hunt grew close, and which had not </p><p>yet been discovered. Buck’s habit was to </p><p>lay low in the daytime and ride only at </p><p>night. It was a combination hard to over- </p><p>come in a desert country mostly wide, un- </p><p>guarded stretches of canon and valley. A </p><p>posse might ride all day and be no nearer </p><p>the outlaw at sun-down than when it </p><p>started. </p><p> It was after Buck held up and robbed</p><p>the bank at Malona, in the middle of the </p><p>day, shot the cashier blind, and escaped </p><p>with his booty, and the posse saddle-weary </p><p>and dusty, had returned without their man </p><p>Hip Shootin’ </p><p>41 </p><p>and carrying the realization that the out- </p><p>law had changed his night-riding tactics </p><p>to open defiance, that matters came to a </p><p>head. </p><p> From the minute Sheriff Bill gave the</p><p>order to return home, after following an </p><p>aimless trail into the Mohave sand, he was </p><p>aware that there was a change in his men. </p><p>Conversation dropped out entirely. Here </p><p>and there he caught a furtive glance from </p><p>beneath a hat-brim, supplemented by sul- </p><p>len mutterings and monosyllabic grunts. </p><p>He was not surprised when they followed </p><p>him into his office in Grit, and hung over </p><p>his furniture in uncomfortable attitudes. </p><p> Johnnie Murray, foreman of the Hash-</p><p>knife rancho, cleared his throat and stepped </p><p>forward, aided by the urgings of several </p><p>elbows and covert glances of encourage- </p><p>ment. </p><p> “Bill,” he said, twisting his sombrero</p><p>between nervous fingers. “The boys— </p><p>that is—we-” </p><p> He glanced around the room, and re-</p><p>ceiving several nods of approval, gathered </p><p>courage. </p><p> “You see, Bill, it’s like this. You’ve</p><p>been sheriff a long time now and you’ve </p><p>done your share and a lot more. We ain’t </p><p>sayin’ you ever fell down on the job. As </p><p>far as that goes, I’d be the first to knock </p><p>the block off’n any hombre that said dif- </p><p>ferent.” He glared belligerently around </p><p>the room. “But times has changed, and </p><p>old ideas kinda bogs down like a chuck </p><p>wagon in wet ’dobe. Huntin’ a bad-man </p><p>is—well, Bill, it’s a young man’s job. Get </p><p>me? We been kinda talkin’ it over, and </p><p>while we ain’t aimin’ to discount nothin’ </p><p>you’ve done, Bill, we—that is—the boys, </p><p>is hankerin’ for a change of administration, </p><p>sort of.” </p><p>HE WAITED, and a dense silence </p><p>fell on the room. Old Bill glanced </p><p>around the circle. There was no </p><p>eye to meet his own. The members of the </p><p>posse sat or stood in uncomfortable pos- </p><p>tures, their eyes on their feet, the ceiling, </p><p>out of the window—everywhere, except in</p><p>his direction. Johnnie Murray was star- </p><p>ing at a band of sunlight that came through </p><p>the open window and made a pencil of yel- </p><p>low on the floor. Instinctively Bill followed </p><p>the shaft of light until the distant hills, </p><p>tinted with mellow, Autumn colors crossed </p><p>his vision. </p><p> Yonder beyond those hills lay the great</p><p>Mohave Desert. It was the one place in </p><p>all the world he knew and loved best. The </p><p>rolling dunes with their undulating out- </p><p>lines, the rugged sandstone outcrops that </p><p>shoved through from beneath like a giant </p><p>fist thrust upward; the flaming grandeur of </p><p>the evening skies, more beautiful than a </p><p>preacher’s heaven; the fresh, fragrant mor- </p><p>nings with the shifting colors of the dawn— </p><p>it was all his world, his country, his life. </p><p> His best years had been spent there.</p><p>Posse after posse he had led across the trails </p><p>he knew like the lines in the palm of his </p><p>hand. Man after man he had brought back </p><p>to pay the price according to range-land’s </p><p>idea of justice. Until the coming of Buck </p><p>Saunders, no outlaw in his territory had </p><p>escaped the reckoning. The idea of quit- </p><p>ting had never entered his head. He had </p><p>expected, of course, to die in his spurs— </p><p>most likely in the saddle. Now—they were </p><p>making it plain to him that he had failed </p><p>—“a young man’s job”—Bill glanced once </p><p>more at the circle that ringed him in. </p><p> There was a cold glint in his eyes now.</p><p>So he was growing old, was he? Suppose </p><p>his eye did hit fifty yards or so shy of his </p><p>record and his leg latches were getting a </p><p>might tight? Couldn’t he pick a running </p><p>jack from the saddle five times out of six </p><p>with his old Colt yet, and do a day’s riding </p><p>with the best of them? Abruptly he </p><p>straightened his shoulders and cleared his </p><p>throat. </p><p> “You want me to quit—is that the idea?”</p><p> Johnnie Murray nodded, his eyes still on</p><p>the shaft of light on the floor. His voice </p><p>seemed to have left him. </p><p> Without a word Sheriff Bill unfastened</p><p>his rusty star and dropped it on the desk. </p><p>His handcuffs followed—and a bunch of </p><p>heavy keys. From a drawer he took some </p><p>private papers which he tucked in his </p><p>pocket. Then he walked to the door.</p><p> “The blank warrants is in the top drawer</p><p>and the code book’s over yonder on the </p><p>window-sill,” he said. “The big key fits </p><p>the jail door; the rest of ’em unlocks the </p><p>desk.” For the barest second he hesitated. </p><p>“S’long, boys,” he said, and banged the </p><p>door behind him. </p><p> There was a dead silence for a full mita-</p><p>ute after Bill Doble left. “Red-eye” Weeks </p><p>broke it derisively. </p><p> “Well,” he ejaculated with elaborate sar-</p><p>casm, “I hope you mavericks is satisfied. </p><p>42 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Me—I’m goin’ out and apologize to some </p><p>low-down coyote for herdin’ with a bunch </p><p>of hombres like you. Pore oP Bill!” </p><p> He kicked a chair across the room by</p><p>way of emphasis and went out cursihg tor- </p><p>ridly. </p><p> That afternoon, representatives of the</p><p>ranches along the desert’s rim met in the </p><p>back room at Black La Farge’s gambling- </p><p>hall to select Sheriff Bill’s successor. The </p><p>Double-O, Hashknife, Stutz, Lazy-Fish and </p><p>Circle-8 ranches sent delegates. The Stutz </p><p>crowd suggested Johnnie Murray, owing to </p><p>his reputation for daring and handiness </p><p>with a gun. But the foreman of the Hash- </p><p>knife rancho declined the honor in a charac- </p><p>teristic speech. </p><p> “Nix,” he said, and his tone was em-</p><p>phatic. “I let myself be drawed into this </p><p>mess ag’in my will, but I’m blamed if I’m </p><p>goin’ to wear any grave clothes to please </p><p>a bunch of merry widows. If you-all’s </p><p>chuckle-headed enough to think you got a </p><p>sheriff among you, why go right to it. </p><p>I’ve done all the dirty work I’m going to. </p><p>Me, knowin’ the whole bunch of you, I </p><p>opines you’re a fine bunch of sucklin’ doves </p><p>—the same bein’ all strut and no eggs. </p><p>Huh!” </p><p> The speaker’s remarks nettled Rusty Mc-</p><p>Gee, whose tinder was always laid to flare. </p><p> “Oh, I don’t know; there’s some of us</p><p>’round here could make pretty blamed-good </p><p>sheriffs, I’m thinkin’,” he declared. </p><p> Johnnie Murray whirled and looked the</p><p>red-headed roper in the eye. </p><p> “Rusty,” he said. His tone was omi-</p><p>nously quiet. “I call you. You’re for- </p><p>ever shoo tin’ off your face; now, it’s about </p><p>time to make good. Come to think about </p><p>it, it was considerable your kickin’ that </p><p>rowelled us into askin’ old Bill to take a </p><p>pasear. From your conversation, I now </p><p>takes it you are makin’ a bid for the job </p><p>of bein’ sheriff in his place. They not </p><p>bein’ any rush of can’dates to the fore, I </p><p>moves the nom’nations be closed.” </p><p> Somebody tittered and a laugh ran around</p><p>the circle. Then the puchers saw that the </p><p>Hashknife foreman was in earnest and the </p><p>idea caught like wildfire. To the men from </p><p>most of the ranches Rusty McGee was as </p><p>good a chance as any other. To the boys </p><p>of- the Double-0 outfit, the suggestion repre- </p><p>sented a chance to end Rusty’s perpetual </p><p>stream of conversation about “brother </p><p>Jim.” With all that talk on the left side </p><p>of the ledger, they had a right to look for </p><p>something to strike a balance, and with </p><p>Buck Saunders loose on the range, they </p><p>knew Rusty would be too busy to spend </p><p>much time in reminiscence. Clothespin </p><p>Mills was open in his admiration. </p><p> “Well, you little ol’ son-of-a-gun.” he</p><p>said, grinning widely at the foreman. “That </p><p>shorely was a right smart little mouthful.” </p><p>Rusty started to protest, but a roper </p><p>clapped him between the shoulders, and </p><p>before he could get his breath back, they </p><p>were rushing him down the street to the </p><p>office of Grit’s only justice of the peace, </p><p>where the necessary legal formalities were </p><p>complied with. This done, Johnnie Mur- </p><p>ray swung on the new sheriff of Grit. </p><p> “Now you piebald son of cactus parents,”</p><p>he said. “You been tellin’ us for some </p><p>time what ‘brother Jim’ would ’a’ done </p><p>with this here Buck Saunders person. Well </p><p>—you got Buck Saunders all to your little </p><p>self now. What’s more, you ain’t gonna </p><p>be interfered with, not-at-all. Whenever </p><p>you feels called on to uphold your family </p><p>reputation while a few handsome cow- </p><p>punchers looks on and sees how it’s done, </p><p>we ain’t goin’ to stop you. Speakin’ for </p><p>the community, some general, you needn’t </p><p>be over-particular about bringin’ Buck with </p><p>you, the which we ain’t aimin’ to run no </p><p>hotel down at the jail. Likewise we’ll be </p><p>some tickled to death to come and look </p><p>him over after you’ve done hip-shot him </p><p>into hell-fire.” </p><p> Rusty McGee polished Bill Doble’s rusty</p><p>old star on his sleeve and pinned it in posi- </p><p>tion. He seemed oddly serious—for Rusty </p><p>McGee. He walked to his horse with- </p><p>out making reply. Only when he had his </p><p>foot in the stirrup, did he throw back a </p><p>response over his shoulder. </p><p> “Gents,” he said, “I’m askin’ you-all to</p><p>remember one thing. That what you done </p><p>for a joke I’m takin’ dead serious!” </p><p> And leaving the thought to soak in, he</p><p>jumped his animal and galloped off to the </p><p>Double-0 bunk-house to get his personal </p><p>belongings. </p><p>THE grass was showing green on </p><p>the grazing-lands around Vaca, a </p><p>town four miles to the north of </p><p>Grit, and the general headquarters for the </p><p>sheepmen of the community, before things </p><p>began to grow interesting for Rusty McGee </p><p>in his new capacity as sheriff of Grit. The </p><p>Hip Shootin’ </p><p>43 </p><p>herders were happy, for an unusual Fall </p><p>rain meant good prices for mutton in the </p><p>early Spring, with plenty of Winter feed. </p><p>As a result the ranch-owners were paying </p><p>good money to their men, and the gambling- </p><p>halls and saloons were running to a more </p><p>than lucrative season. </p><p> “Lonesome Jack” Miller was one of the</p><p>wealthiest of the upper foothill sheepmen. </p><p>He was the owner of the Paseo Grande </p><p>ranch, at the upper end of Smoot’s Pass, </p><p>and during the late months of each year </p><p>would occasionally drop down to some of </p><p>the desert towns for a three days’ spree </p><p>and “spend-fest.” Vaca, whose reputation </p><p>must have made Nero revolve in his grave </p><p>for envy, was his favorite stamping-ground, </p><p>especially if he had more than his usual belt </p><p>of money to fling away. </p><p> It was his custom to pick out some par-</p><p>ticularly rabid dance-hall, where greasers, </p><p>half-breeds and railroad “wops” were wont </p><p>to congregate, and sit in on a poker game </p><p>until the last of his ample bank-roll was </p><p>gone. In this amusement, he was generally </p><p>aided by most of the population of Vaca, </p><p>whose personnel would have made an honest </p><p>penitentiary blush for shame. </p><p> Lonesome Jack and Rusty McGee were</p><p>bosom friends and pals. They had for- </p><p>merly worked in Arizona together, where </p><p>Miller had saved McGee’s life from a mad- </p><p>dened steer during a late-year rodeo. Out </p><p>of the episode had grown a friendship that </p><p>had led Rusty, more than once, to cross the </p><p>strip of sand to the pestilent little town, to </p><p>help his former chum liven things up among </p><p>the hated sheepmen by “tying a can on </p><p>life.” Whenever Miller had spent all that </p><p>he brought down from the hills, barring </p><p>enough for a supply of “sow-belly and </p><p>aigs,” it was always Rusty who put him </p><p>on a horse and started him homeward </p><p>bound. </p><p> On the night that Buck Saunders, the</p><p>outlaw, made his famous display of hip- </p><p>shooting de luxe, Rusty had left Lonesome </p><p>Jack peaceably playing stud poker in the </p><p>Hell-Abendin’ bar, and had crossed to an- </p><p>other equally disreputable place across the </p><p>street with a couple of Double-0 boys and</p><p>a crowd from the Hashknife outfit who had </p><p>been on after rustlers. </p><p> They had just about reached the fourth</p><p>drink, when the sound of gun-play across </p><p>the way brought them back on the run. </p><p>They found Lonesome Jack Miller lying on </p><p>the floor with two bullets in his stomach— </p><p>dead. The others in the room were backed </p><p>up against the bar in a state of panic—“a </p><p>band of wall-eyed blatties at a fox party,” </p><p>as a Hashknife roper later described it. </p><p> Rusty McGee took three steps into the</p><p>room. Then he stopped and his Colt six- </p><p>gun came out. </p><p> “Who done it?” he snapped.</p><p> His voice grated, for Lonesome Jack was</p><p>his friend. </p><p> “Buck Saunders!” A score of voices</p><p>answered him as they crowded around. </p><p> From the proprietor of the place, Jim</p><p>Bledsoe, Rusty McGee obtained the most </p><p>coherent account of what had happened </p><p>and it sustained all that the Grit contingent </p><p>had heard about the outlaw’s capacity as </p><p>a killer. </p><p> “Lonesome Jack was settin’ in on stud,”</p><p>said Bledsoe, “when this here Buck Saun- </p><p>son blows in and buys a stack. I don’t </p><p>reckon a man in the place had any sort o’ </p><p>notion who he was, for he sets in right cheer- </p><p>ful—him with his back against the wall. </p><p>Tilings was runnin’ smooth when I heard </p><p>some chairs scrape, the which in this town </p><p>is fust cousin to gun-play. Thinks I, there’s </p><p>somethin’ wrong! </p><p> “I takes a look. Here was this coyote</p><p>and Lonesome Jack facin’ each other over </p><p>the table. Jack had his hand on his wea- </p><p>pon like he was gosh-a’mighty ready to </p><p>pull it. Buck was standin’ up with his </p><p>gun-hand danglin’ loose with his fingers all </p><p>spraddled out like they had candy on ’em. </p><p>And I’m tellin’ you gents, I been passin’ </p><p>forty-rod over the boards for fifteen years </p><p>in some mighty tough places, but I ain’t </p><p>never seen nothin’ like that hombre's face </p><p>for double-barrelled, crocodile meanness. </p><p>Right then I knowed without no further </p><p>introduction he was doin’ business with</p><p>Buck Saunders. But says I to myself, for </p><p>onct in his life, he done picked the wrong </p><p>hombrel </p><p> “Jack leans over the table so’s Buck’ll</p><p>get him good and he says: ‘Yuh low-down, </p><p>no-good, squint-eyed coyote’—just like that, </p><p>kinda drawlin’ the words out. </p><p> “I was lookin’ right at Buck—me not</p><p>reachin’ for my old sawed-off seein’ as how </p><p>Jack was plenty ahead on the deal—and, so </p><p>help me God—the only thing that maver- </p><p>ick Buck done was to hitch his shoulders a </p><p>couple of inches like a Frenchie sayin’ ‘I </p><p>don't know.’ The next minnit his Colt </p><p>44 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>was spoutin’ flame and destruction from </p><p>both hands like a human volcano. He </p><p>plugs twice and then braced the crowd for </p><p>a comeback. But there wasn’t none. Jack </p><p>just kinda shuts his eyes like he was tired </p><p>and wilted down on the floor. Buck gives </p><p>the rest of the room the once-over and </p><p>seein’ none of us was hankerin’ to act hos- </p><p>tile after the gun-play we’d seen, he backs </p><p>out and fades. We looks at Jack, but he </p><p>was deader’n a flounder. He never got </p><p>no chanct to pull his gun ’tall.” </p><p> Rusty McGee stood silent at the conclu-</p><p>sion of the narrative, wrapped in thought. </p><p>Then he turned abruptly and started for </p><p>the door. The boys from the two ranches </p><p>made to follow him, but he held up his </p><p>hand. </p><p> “Nothin’ doin’, hombres,” he said. “I’m</p><p>playin’ a lone hand in this game. There’s </p><p>been some palaver about me roundin’ up </p><p>this Buck person, the which ain’t altogether </p><p>appealed to my sense o’ humor. Under the </p><p>circumstances I’m not needin’ any help. </p><p>If I ain’t back in a week you can ride out </p><p>and get us both!” </p><p> Rusty swung quickly into his saddle and</p><p>lashed his horse into top-speed, swinging </p><p>toward the Llano Placido, leaving the </p><p>punchers and sheepmen open-mouthed with </p><p>astonishment. </p><p> “Well, the little red-headed runt!” ex-</p><p>ploded Red-eye Weeks. “Ain’t he the </p><p>stuck-up kid, though? Want any help? </p><p>‘No, kind sir,’ says he. ‘I’m rollin’ this little </p><p>hill myself. I ain’t no common cow-punch </p><p>no more. Me—I’m the sheriff!’ ” </p><p> And Johnnie Murray shook his head.</p><p> “No,” he said. “You got Rusty dead</p><p>wrong, Red-eye. He’s hell-bent for action </p><p>this time. We done kidded him too much. </p><p>Besides, Jack was his pal and he’s double </p><p>sore, with all the mean on top. Bein’ Irish, </p><p>he pulls a heady play and acts plumb fool- </p><p>ish. He didn’t want us to figger he was </p><p>afraid to go up ag’in’ Buck single-handed, </p><p>the which he ain’t. But the blamed little </p><p>fire-and-tow fool will ride up on that killin’ </p><p>houn’ head down and Buck’ll shoot the</p><p>tripe outen him for practise. -! Why </p><p>was fools made, anyhow?” </p><p> The picture drawn by the big cattleman</p><p>struck the punchers as significant, for their </p><p>knowledge of the outlaw’s tricks supplied </p><p>only too vividly the details‘that Johnnie </p><p>Murray omitted. But what to do? There </p><p>was little or no use in going after him, for, </p><p>a posse would only increase his danger of </p><p>discovery now and double Buck’s guard. </p><p> “He’s shore goin’ up against the scur-</p><p>viest maverick on the range for fair,” de- </p><p>clared “Windy” Smith, one of the Hash- </p><p>knife ropers. “I plumb hate to see that </p><p>little show-barker called thataway.” </p><p> “Yeah, and there’s a ring ’round the</p><p>moon, too,” chimed in another, “and that </p><p>means more rain and a washed trail.” </p><p> The boys stared at each other glumly.</p><p>A man-hunt through the sagebrush flats, </p><p>along the crumbling edge of buttes and over </p><p>slippery clay patches, where a horse can get </p><p>no foothold with all its instinctive skill, </p><p>was bad enough under the best conditions. </p><p>But with all marks of previous travel </p><p>washed out, with hands blue from the cold </p><p>of the soaking mountain mist, saddle leather </p><p>creaking from the wet, and a listening, </p><p>human viper lying somewhere out in the </p><p>night with the nose of a rifle trained over a </p><p>sheltering rock—this was no sinecure. The </p><p>boys missed none of it as they visualized </p><p>the situation to themselves. </p><p> “Let’s trail the red-headed ijit,” snapped</p><p>Johnnie Murray suddenly, wheeling on the </p><p>others. “It’s like this. Rusty ain’t no </p><p>child and he ain’t goin’ to walk into no </p><p>suicide club. Besides, bein’ Irish, he’ll </p><p>get over his peeve, meanin’ principally us, </p><p>before he’s pounded out ten miles of sand, </p><p>and this here aggregation of gents bein’ </p><p>some loaded for cattle-rustlers, might be </p><p>considered reasonable fine backin’ before </p><p>this thing’s over. What say?” </p><p>THE idea was received with en- </p><p>thusiasm. An hour later, well armed </p><p>and with fresh mounts, a grim band </p><p>of cow-punchers loped easily off across the </p><p>Llano Placido toward the foot of Bone</p><p>Mountain. Johnnie Murray insisted on </p><p>taking Injun Joe, the half-breed, profes- </p><p>sional trailer, along. Red-eye Weeks had </p><p>been selected for the job of interpreter, </p><p>being the only one in the party who could </p><p>understand the half-breed’s gibberish. With </p><p>hardly a word spoken between them, the </p><p>self-constituted posse steadily loped along, </p><p>covering many miles of ground before mid- </p><p>night. </p><p> The prophecy of the ring around the</p><p>moon was sustained, when, shortly after </p><p>that hour, the mist that had settled around </p><p>them thickened into a drizzle. For two </p><p>hours the horses, their bodies steaming and </p><p>Hip Shootin’ </p><p>45 </p><p>lathering, splashed ahead through the </p><p>mud and rain. Finally Red-eye Weeks, </p><p>who had been riding in front with the </p><p>trailer, called a halt. </p><p> “This here eddicated product in the flap-</p><p>jack pants,” he announced, “says he’s lost </p><p>the trail.” </p><p> Johnnie Murray exploded.</p><p> “-!” he exclaimed. “I could ’a’ done</p><p>that good, myself. Ask him what he thinks </p><p>we brought him along for.” </p><p> Red-eye exchanged several grunts with</p><p>the Indian, who was by this time off his </p><p>animal, feeling around in the mud. After </p><p>a few minutes the “product” waved his </p><p>arms above his head. </p><p> “No use,” growled Red-eye, “he says</p><p>‘big-water’ done washed everything out and </p><p>he’s lost.” </p><p> “Can’t he sniff ’round or somethin’?” de-</p><p>manded the Hashknife foreman. “For the </p><p>love of Pete, what’s the use of bein’ an </p><p>Injun if you’re goin’ to fall down like </p><p>this?” </p><p> “Say!” shouted Red-eye, in exasperation.</p><p>“You talk to him, will you? You make </p><p>me sick.” </p><p> “Well, he makes me sick,” retorted John-</p><p>nie Murray in deep disgust. “I got a blind </p><p>sheepdog that can’t smell that would ’ve </p><p>done a blamed sight better.” </p><p> Red-eye tried a few more scraps of scram-</p><p>bled English and Indian with the trailer, </p><p>but all to no purpose, so the posse finally </p><p>gave it up and took stock of their location </p><p>as best they could without a light. After </p><p>some circling they finally located some </p><p>scrub cottonwood, under which they hud- </p><p>dled with dripping ponchos until the first </p><p>breaking of the dawn disclosed their posi- </p><p>tion in a small arroyo which opened into </p><p>Nuevo Cut. Beyond, lay Perdito Valley, </p><p>objective of the ride. </p><p> As they swung their stiffened limbs to</p><p>saddle, Windy Smith noticed the Indian </p><p>sound asleep with his back against a tree. </p><p>He stirred him up with his toe. </p><p> “Wake up, ol’ blubberin’ Choctaw,” he</p><p>said. “The trail’s done come home to roost </p><p>whilst you was sawin’ wood.” </p><p> The Indian jumped to his feet, got his</p><p>bearings and shook his head. Then he un- </p><p>burdened himself of a few guttural remarks </p><p>to Red-eye Weeks, hopped his bare-backed </p><p>cow-pony and clattered off down the arroyo </p><p>in the direction they had come.. </p><p> “What’s happened to little Weak-in-the-</p><p>Head?” asked Johnnie Murray, staring </p><p>after him. </p><p> “He says,” chuckled Red-eye, “as how</p><p>he’s goin’ no further with a loquero because </p><p>cow-puncher always was plumb foolish </p><p>anyhow, and besides he’s wet and he wants </p><p>to go back to his squaw and get something </p><p>hot to drink.” </p><p> The boys broke into a laugh that seemed</p><p>to wipe out the incipient grouch that every- </p><p>body wore. Johnnie Murray cinched his </p><p>saddle-leather another hole and looked off </p><p>toward the end of the valley. Ahead </p><p>loomed Big Eye Butte, a huge granite jut </p><p>that stood out like a ruined pyramid </p><p>with a great top overlooking the flatlands </p><p>beneath. Somewhere at the base of that </p><p>great pile was the rendezvous of Buck Saun- </p><p>ders, for whose capture, dead or alive, Rusty </p><p>McGee was taking his life in his hands. The </p><p>thought acted as a stimulant. </p><p> “Reckon we’ll be movin’ on,” he said</p><p>softly, and flipped his horse into action with </p><p>the end of his riata. </p><p> Single file, the little cavalcade wound up</p><p>through the cut, across the upper end of the </p><p>valley toward the base of the mountain. </p><p>As" they topped the rise that led down into </p><p>the floor of Big Butte Valley, Murray sud- </p><p>denly threw up his arm. Every rider in the </p><p>party immediately sat his horse back on </p><p>its haunches. Following the foreman’s out- </p><p>stretched finger, they made out a speck </p><p>crawling up the side of Big Eye Butte just </p><p>across the canon from Bone Mountain, so </p><p>near the ridge as to be outlined almost </p><p>in silhouette.</p><p> “Rusty McGee!” cried one of the party.</p><p> The foreman shook his head.</p><p> “Take another look,” he said. His head</p><p>was thrown back and his hat was pulled low </p><p>on his nose as he scrutinized the moving speck </p><p>through half-closed lids. Suddenly he slap- </p><p>ped his leg and gave a shout of excitement. </p><p> “I knowed it, I knowed it!” he exclaimed.</p><p>“I knowed there was something familiar </p><p>about that ridin’. There ain’t but one </p><p>man in this whole blamed county that can </p><p>ride a hoss up the side of Big Eye Butte </p><p>thataway and not have to pick a trail.” </p><p> The boys crowded closer.</p><p> “By Crickey, it’s old Bill Doble!” they</p><p>shouted almost in unison with an exclama- </p><p>tion from Red-eye Weeks. </p><p> There could be no mistake once the like-</p><p>ness was placed, for Bill had his own way </p><p>of sitting a horse. </p><p>46 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “He sure ain’t headin’ for the top of Big</p><p>Eye, is he?” queried Windy Smith, leaning </p><p>forward. </p><p> “Not him,” replied Johnnie Murray.</p><p>“He’s headin’ for Bone Mountain. This </p><p>here is a short-cut along the side. Any- </p><p>body hidin’ on the top of Bone couldn’t </p><p>see him cornin’ thisaway, while t’other way </p><p>Bill would be ridin’ in the open.” </p><p> “Wise Bill,” commented Red-eye in ad-</p><p>miration. “He shore is one clever ol’ coot!” </p><p>Presently as they watched, the speck </p><p>crossed the skyline of the Butte and van- </p><p>ished over the edge on to the plateau be- </p><p>yond, thence to reappear again a moment </p><p>later on the slight depression that dipped to </p><p>the greater slant of Bone Mountain. Johnnie </p><p>Murray galvanized into sudden action. </p><p> “Fellows,” he said. “BUI ain’t ridin’</p><p>like that for his health. Likewise, Bone </p><p>Mountain ain’t such a bad place the which </p><p>to take a squint over the country for Rusty. </p><p>I reckon we’ll just take a little pasear up </p><p>there and see what’s goin’ on. How?” </p><p> The effect of his words was electrical. A</p><p>pack of astonished horses were suddenly </p><p>roweled into life and the next instant the </p><p>cowboys were tearing across the open space </p><p>with the Hashknife foreman in the lead. </p><p>It took them just two hours to make the </p><p>top of the mountain—such was the condi- </p><p>tion of the country through which they rode </p><p>—taking the same trail followed by Bill </p><p>Doble on his big bay mare. When they </p><p>finally swept out oh the level plateau, as </p><p>flat as a table-top, they gave one look across </p><p>the surface and fell to swearing with all the </p><p>fluency with which a puncher is gifted. </p><p>From edge to edge of the mile-square rect- </p><p>angle, there was not a sign of life! </p><p> The cowboys gave their horses a chance</p><p>to breathe, and then, impatiently, they can- </p><p>tered across the level space toward the far </p><p>edge. There, on the very rim—weary, </p><p>dusty, their nerves and patience worn to a </p><p>raveling—they clustered in a compact knot </p><p>and peered over the edge, to find, with unex- </p><p>pected suddenness, spread out nearly a thou- </p><p>sand feet below, in the natural amphitheater</p><p>of the Taza Caliente, a drama that would </p><p>have thrilled a movie producer to the soul. </p><p>THE Taza Caliente, as the name </p><p>indicates, is the “hot bowl” of an </p><p>B' extinct volcano. It is nothing more </p><p>than a huge pit, resembling a natural </p><p>arena, spooned out of the hills by some </p><p>igneous action of prehistoric days. The </p><p>floor of the bowl is perhaps an eighth of a </p><p>mile in diameter, stippled with huge gray </p><p>boulders and blocks of once molten rock. </p><p>In the center a score of tiny geysers or </p><p>hot springs of sulfurous waters, bubble out, </p><p>draining through a narrow crack in the </p><p>bowl, which extends off toward the south. </p><p>The sides are pitted with caverns and grot- </p><p>tos until the ensemble looks, as Windy </p><p>Smith expressed it, “like the entrance to </p><p>hell with the gate left open.” </p><p> There, lying on the floor on the Taza</p><p>Caliente, comfortably braced against a </p><p>boulder which sheltered him from the heat, </p><p>was Buck Saunders. His rifle was resting </p><p>in his arm, conveniently located for rapid </p><p>use. His horse was nowhere to be seen </p><p>and the boys inferred, rightly, that it was </p><p>hobbled in one of the near-by caverns. On </p><p>one side of the outlaw was a hot spring, </p><p>bubbling and simmering in the heat. On </p><p>the other was a hole of quicksand, deadly </p><p>and treacherous. The only path by which </p><p>he could be reached was over the huge </p><p>boulder toward which his rifle was pointing. </p><p> Some two hundred feet away from the</p><p>outlaw, tucked behind another rock of </p><p>jagged formation was Sheriff Rusty McGee. </p><p>But what a Rusty! His hat was gone. </p><p>His shirt was torn half-off so that the skin </p><p>showed through in patches of white. From </p><p>head to foot he was plastered with dried </p><p>adobe. His face was grimed and bloody, </p><p>where he had fought his way through innu- </p><p>merable acres of matted underbrush. All </p><p>these details the boys got later, for, stand- </p><p>ing on the edge of the overhanging butte, </p><p>all they saw at that height was the figure </p><p>of the red-headed sheriff worming along the </p><p>limestone bottom on his stomach toward </p><p>the unsuspicious Buck Saunders. </p><p> “Gosh A’mighty,” ejaculated Windy</p><p>Smith. “The little red-head is goin’ to get </p><p>his man sure.” </p><p> He slapped his leg in excitement.</p><p> “’Less Buck hears him cornin’,” com-</p><p>mented Red-eye Weeks skeptically. </p><p> Johnnie Murray gave the speaker a ma-</p><p>lignant glance. Then he whipped his rifle </p><p>from its saddle scabbard and slid to the </p><p>ground. There came the sound of a shell </p><p>sliding into the discharge chamber—and </p><p>then Johnnie Murray cursing softly. </p><p> “Damnation,” he muttered, squinting</p><p>along the sights. “I can’t make him.” </p><p> Heat waves dancing up out of the bowl</p><p>Hip Shootin’ </p><p>47 </p><p>disconcerted the aim and made a steady </p><p>bead impossible. </p><p> “-, you couldn’t hit a fat man settin’</p><p>still,” declared one of the Hashknife outfit, </p><p>in disgust. </p><p> “Let’s go down the slant and get in on</p><p>the finish,” suggested another. </p><p> “No use,” said the foreman. “It’ll be</p><p>all over before we get there. </p><p> Buck was smoking a cigaret. They could</p><p>see little puffs of smoke sail up into the air </p><p>and disappear. Rusty was crawling toward </p><p>him, dragging his rifle in the warm mud. </p><p>The boys packed together in a tense group, </p><p>their eyes taking in every movement. </p><p> “God!” exclaimed Johnnie Murray. “This</p><p>here is gettin’ on my nerves. Why don’t </p><p>they start shootin’?” </p><p> Rusty kept up his crawling until only the</p><p>rock separated him from the outlaw. Leav- </p><p>ing his rifle on the ground, he drew his re- </p><p>volver, a puncher’s invariable weapon for </p><p>close work, and edged along on his elbows. </p><p>It was apparent to the watchers on the rim </p><p>of the bowl above that he had an exact idea </p><p>of where Buck Saunders was located. It </p><p>was also equally apparent that the outlaw </p><p>did not know that a soul was within miles </p><p>of him. </p><p> Buck finished the cigaret he was smoking</p><p>and flipped the stub into the hot spring. </p><p>Then he stood up, shook the sand from his </p><p>clothes and picked up his rifle. It was at </p><p>that instant that Sheriff Rusty McGee laid </p><p>one hand on a shelf of rock that projected </p><p>from the big boulder and, in two lightning </p><p>bounds, vaulted to the top. Buck whirled </p><p>at the sound and swung his rifle under his </p><p>armpit with one motion. Together the </p><p>two weapons shattered the silences of the </p><p>steaming caldron. </p><p> Rusty McGee’s hat sailed across the area</p><p>with a bullet-hole through the crown. The </p><p>outlaw’s weapon described a parabolic </p><p>curve in mid-air and sank in the quick- </p><p>sand pit.</p><p> The exchange left Rusty in command of</p><p>the situation. He slid down the face of the </p><p>rock until he fronted the outlaw on the </p><p>level. Buck’s back was half-turned. He </p><p>stood rubbing his left arm, which had been </p><p>jarred numb by the impact of the heavy </p><p>revolver bullet on his rifle stock. Rusty </p><p>appeared to be talking, his weapon at the </p><p>outlaw’s middle. They could see him ges- </p><p>ticulate with Ills free hand. Once he </p><p>pointed off toward Vaca, as though he was </p><p>referring to the murder of Lonesome Jack </p><p>Miller. Of a sudden, he reached for his </p><p>handcuffs. </p><p> As the steel bands glittered for an in-</p><p>stant in the sunlight, there came a quick </p><p>spurt of flame from under the outlaw’s arm. </p><p>Instantly McGee’s weapon coughed back— </p><p>a single flash. The sounds came up to the </p><p>tense little group of watchers with a hollow </p><p>plop-plop that was taken up by the walls </p><p>of the bowl and echoed and reechoed in </p><p>diminuendo. For the barest fraction of a </p><p>second, the two men stood motionless, as </p><p>though each was awaiting the next move of </p><p>the other. Then Rusty McGee curled for- </p><p>ward on his face, his fingers plucking at the </p><p>warm sand beneath him. </p><p> “Oh, my God! He’s got him!” moaned</p><p>Johnnie Murray. </p><p> His voice sounded high and cracked like</p><p>an old man’s. The rest caught the rasp of </p><p>his rifle hammer as he dropped on one knee </p><p>to steady his aim. Before he could fire, the </p><p>drama, that had become in the- twinkling of </p><p>an eye a grim tragedy, was interrupted. </p><p> Buck was in the act of dropping his still</p><p>smoking weapon back into its holster when </p><p>his attention was caught by a movement </p><p>high up on the side of the bowl. The boys </p><p>of the posse, clustered on the rim, above </p><p>caught it at the same time. There, in </p><p>plain sight, about three hundred feet from </p><p>where Rusty McGee lay, a silent figure on </p><p>the ground, stood the one man everybody </p><p>in that part of the country had forgotten—• </p><p>old Bill Doble. </p><p> The former sheriff was mud from head</p><p>to foot. His hat was pulled low over his </p><p>eyes to shut out the glare of the sun. From </p><p>beneath the rim, his white hair stuck out</p><p>in a matted fringe. Slung over his shoul- </p><p>der, English fashion, was a belt of car- </p><p>tridges that glistened in the sun. In one </p><p>hand he balanced his old-fashioned Colt </p><p>six-gun—the one with the notches on the </p><p>handle. Clearly exposed to the outlaw’s </p><p>fire and within easy range, he made no pre- </p><p>tense of seeking cover as Buck Saunders </p><p>swung on him. </p><p> The outlaw had just time to register the</p><p>picture when he went into action with both </p><p>hands. Straight from the hip he fired, </p><p>again and again, the bullets tin-owing up </p><p>little flecks of dust around Bill Doble’s feet. </p><p>The shots rippled together like the ha-ha-ha </p><p>of a machine-gun, as he sprayed a deadly </p><p>hail of lead up the hillside toward his enemy. </p><p>48 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Four—six times he shot while the white- </p><p>haired figure before him stood motionless. </p><p> And then—with all the calm deliberation</p><p>of a man shooting down clay pipes in a </p><p>gallery, Bill Doble raised his old-fashioned </p><p>six-gun with its wickedly long barrel in a </p><p>hand as steady as the rocks that surrounded </p><p>him, and with perfect precision, shot Buck </p><p>Saunders neatly between his eyes. </p><p> The group on the rim of the bowl above</p><p>watched the bad man flounder in the sand </p><p>and then lie still. The wreath of smoke </p><p>from Bill Doble’s weapon hung idly in the </p><p>air for a moment and dissipated. After a </p><p>bit, he threw out the empty shell and began </p><p>to feel in his pockets for a jack-knife. The </p><p>action broke the tension. The eyes of the </p><p>little group met. </p><p> “Reckon we might as well go down and</p><p>get Rusty,” said Johnnie Murray. </p><p> His voice was unsteady, and his hand,</p><p>as he dropped his rifle back in the saddle </p><p>scabbard was shaking. </p><p>GRIT was just shutting up for the </p><p>night when a cavalcade of horsemen </p><p>trotted down the main street with </p><p>old Bill Doble in the lead with the dead </p><p>body of Buck Saunders swung over the </p><p>pommel of his saddle and Rusty McGee </p><p>swaying dizzily in his stirrups. The whole </p><p>town turned out to hear the details, crowd- </p><p>ing into the sheriff’s office while the dead </p><p>bandit was spread out on the floor and a </p><p>physician bandaged up a bullet crease in </p><p>Rusty’s skull. The story was told with </p><p>much embellishment and illustration, while </p><p>everybody shook old Bill by the hand and </p><p>whacked him on the back in bursts of jubi- </p><p>lation. </p><p> After a bit, McGee began to show signs</p><p>of speech. He motioned to Red-eye Weeks. </p><p> “Where’s the judge?” he asked weakly.</p><p> “Reckon he’s over at La Farge’s,” said</p><p>the other. </p><p> “Get him here, pronto,” ordered Rusty.</p><p> He fumbled in his pocket and brought</p><p>out the handcuffs he had never had a chance </p><p>to use. Then he unfastened the star from </p><p>his shirt. These and a bunch of keys he </p><p>shoved into Bill Doble’s hands. </p><p> “Gents,” said Rusty, “as the last offi-</p><p>cial act, the which I’m goin’ to perform as </p><p>sheriff, I want to pick my successor—the </p><p>same bein’ the former sheriff of this here </p><p>community, Bill Doble! And if there’s any </p><p>hombre what wants the privilege of sleepin’ </p><p> alongside of Buck yonder, let him say dif-</p><p>ferent. </p><p> “Me—I’m through. I got enough.</p><p>Houndin’ after coyotes like this here ani- </p><p>mile, trailin’ through the rain, wallowin’ </p><p>in mud, feelin’ ’round a hot spring and get- </p><p>tin’ all cooked up like an egg, and then get- </p><p>tin’ plugged in the head, ain’t my idea of a </p><p>good time, howsomever it might tickle Bill </p><p>Doble most to death. Give me a leg-nippin’ </p><p>cayuse or a loco longhorn to wrastle any </p><p>day in the week and all the time. I’m </p><p>goin’ back to punchin’ cattle. They’re </p><p>human!” </p><p> Old Bill Doble looked at the handcuffs</p><p>and the keys and the star which Rusty had </p><p>thrust into his hand. Then he laid them </p><p>down on the desk and started for the door. </p><p>A dozen hands brought him back, hands </p><p>used to “flopping” steers for a pastime. It </p><p>was at this juncture that Judge Smalley, </p><p>Grit’s justice of the peace, who had sworn </p><p>Rusty McGee into office, appeared sud- </p><p>denly in the doorway, propelled violently </p><p>from the rear by Red-eye Weeks. The </p><p>judge’s hair was disheveled, his eyes in- </p><p>flamed and his hands shaking from one of </p><p>his periodic encounters with Black La </p><p>Farge’s “Best Snake” whisky. Indignation </p><p>over his enforced method of travel showed </p><p>in his face. But he was also distinctly </p><p>worried about something. </p><p> “Step up, old Fire-Tongs,” greeted Rusty</p><p>McGee, “and view the or’nariest carcass </p><p>that ever flopped to the glory of Grit. When </p><p>you’ve got an eye-full you-all untie that dis- </p><p>tinction you done hog-tied on me, the same </p><p>bein’ too onhandy for my temp’rament, </p><p>and belongin’ by rights to the killer of that </p><p>hip-shootin’ devil on the floor.” </p><p> Judge Smalley peered at the recumbent</p><p>and late Mr. Buck Saunders, bad man. </p><p>Then a flicker of comprehension showed in </p><p>his eyes. </p><p> “Thash a’ ri’,” he said. “No sher’mony</p><p>nesh’ary. Thash whash been worryin’ </p><p>me.” </p><p> He nodded his head with an expression</p><p>of relief. </p><p> “What do you mean, no ceremony neces-</p><p>sary?” </p><p> “ ’Zactly what I shay,” said the Judge.</p><p>“Rushty couldn’t reshign f’m offish ’cause </p><p>he never wash sher’ff. ’Shnot legal make </p><p>sher’ffs th’ way I made ’em. I got all mixed </p><p>up. Looked it up in book afterward. </p><p>Zhash wha’ I did.

Always </p><p>was sher’ff.” </p><p> The crowd broke into a storm of laugh-</p><p>ter and cheers. Old Bill Doble blew his </p><p>nose violently and spat on the stove. </p><p>Rusty McGee took the star out of his hand </p><p>and pinned it on Bill’s shirt—back in the </p><p>same old holes where he had worn it before. </p><p>Then he grinned under his bandage. </p><p> “Say, Bill,” he said. “Tell me somethin’,</p><p>will you? How came this maverick didn’t </p><p>wing you when he was doin’ all that fancy </p><p>hip-shootin’? I got a mild curiosity for </p><p>information, now it’s all over. He was </p><p>hell’s lightnin’ on the trigger, that Buck </p><p>was, and faster’n scat on the draw. And </p><p>yet, by Jinks-” </p><p> He left the sentence unfinished.</p><p> Sheriff Bill Doble cleared his throat and</p><p>spat again on the stove. </p><p> “Son,” he said, “I done learned a lot of</p><p>things in my time. But one thing I learned </p><p>powerful strong—that a hip-shooter and a </p><p>mule is consid’rable alike. Close up, they is </p><p>hell. But git off a ways and there ain’t </p><p> neither of ’em can hit nothin’. Consequent,</p><p>when I does business with one or t’other of </p><p>’em, I does it from a distance and takes my </p><p>time.” </p><p> Rusty McGee glanced down at the out-</p><p>law, once terror of the Mojave, “spread- </p><p>eagled” on the floor with a bullet-hole </p><p>through the center of his forehead. </p><p> “I reckon ye’re right, Bill,” he said,</p><p>facing the wide smiles around him. “I </p><p>shore reckon ye’re right. And I guess I </p><p>done learned a few things myself, only I </p><p>learned ’em some recent. One of ’em is, </p><p>that it ain’t any kind of shootin’ that makes </p><p>a sheriff. It’s just plumb natural hoss</p><p>sense, the which is powerful oncommon.” </p><p> He reached up and caressed the bandage</p><p>on his head. </p><p> Johnnie Murray had his golden oppor-</p><p>tunity and he took it. </p><p> “You ain’t goin’ back on yore brother</p><p>Jim up in Canada, are you, Rusty?” he </p><p>asked maliciously. </p><p> The red-headed roper threw him a bale-</p><p>ful glance. Then he dropped into a near-by </p><p>chair and buried his aching head in his </p><p>hands. </p><p> “-!” he said. “You never could be-</p><p>lieve a word Jim said. He always was a </p><p>-liar!” </p><p> SWORDFISHIN’</p><p>by WARREN ELLIOT CARLETON </p><p> IF A swordfish whirls when you heave the harpoon,</p><p> And churns the green water white in his wake,</p><p> Then say a quick prayer and sing a hymn-tune</p><p> And take the last breath that you ever will take.</p><p> v</p><p> He’ll come for you like a torpedo let loose;</p><p> You can row for dear life, but it won’t be no use.</p><p> He won’t give you time to get out of his track,</p><p> But he’ll stave in your dory; then turn and charge back.</p><p> He can handle his sword like a lancer his lance,</p><p> So with you in the water, you won’t have a chance.</p><p> Then make up your mind that your time’s cornin’ soon</p><p> If a swordfish whirls when you heave the harpoon!</p><p>4 </p><p>Author of “The Admiral of the Line,” “Chaplain to the Buccaneers," etc. </p><p>THE anvil-chorus of the kling-kling </p><p>birds in the coconut palms over </p><p>Sam Chung’s rum-shop awoke </p><p>Warden, the American visitor. </p><p>What stirred the Anglo-Jamaican in his </p><p>cot on the other side of the room was </p><p>the whack of the American’s shoe hitting </p><p>that spot on the wall where a huge spider </p><p>had been a second before. </p><p> Through sleepy eyes Hambridge, the</p><p>sun-scorched man with the faded biue eyes </p><p>and fair hair, amusedly observed his guest’s </p><p>apprehension over the fact that the spider </p><p>had mysteriously reappeared right above </p><p>the American’s bed. Warden, pajamaed </p><p>and slipperless, shot from his cot and armed </p><p>himself with the tin wash-basin—loaded. </p><p> “Can the brute swim?” he asked, per-</p><p>ceiving that Hambridge was awake. </p><p> “That spider,” said the Anglo-Jamaican</p><p>banana-man with a yawn and a drawl that </p><p>had creole languor in it; “that spider, </p><p>buccra, can do anything. It can turn it- </p><p>self into a man or any other sort of beast. </p><p>It can vanish and reappear somewhere </p><p>else at will. It’s the Br’er Fox of West </p><p>Indian lore. It’s name is ‘Nancy’ and it’s </p><p>harmless, so far as its bite goes. In darkest </p><p>Africa it was the great god Ananzi—god of </p><p>cunning—and it’s the most infernal bad </p><p>luck to kill one. Now, how about caw- </p><p>fee?” </p><p> “Mean to tell me that lump of hair and</p><p>legs isn’t poisonous? Wow! It’s as big </p><p>as my fist with the fingers spread!” </p><p> “He’s also the god of beneficence,” said</p><p>Hambridge solemnly, “if you believe in </p><p>him. If you don’t—ask any roadside </p><p>Quashie how buzzards came by their bald </p><p>heads.” </p><p> The overseer chuckled but suddenly</p><p>turned his head toward the jalousied door </p><p>leading to the native outhouses. His voice </p><p>arose in the broad dialect: </p><p> “A weh dat gyal, Habigail? Dis buccra</p><p>not gwine hab cawfee dis fine marnin’?” </p><p>“Ah cornin’ ri’ dis minnit, busha (over- </p><p>seer)!” sing-songed a voice from the out-</p><p>house kitchen. </p><p> “Mek it soon-soon den, for dis Banana</p><p>Day—yah?” urged the busha. </p><p> Warden still eyed the motionless spider</p><p>on the wall above his cot. He would rather </p><p>have dispelled his doubts by slaughter, for </p><p>he was not superstitious. Yet who was he </p><p>to cast doubt upon the mystic beliefs of </p><p>darkest Africa, especially when his Anglo- </p><p>Jamaican host shared them. </p><p> “I suppose if I lammed the brute,” said</p><p>Warden humorously, “and Pereira got </p><p>ahead of you today by a single banana </p><p>bunch, you’d boot me out of Rio Hacha.” </p><p>“N-no,” said Hambridge, rising lazily, </p><p>“but if my runners heard you’d killed a </p><p>Nancy before breakfast they’d chuck the </p><p>fight before it was started. Ho, gyal! </p><p>Weh dat cawfee?” </p><p> “Cornin’, busha!”</p><p> The jalousied door swung open and a</p><p>beaming mulatto girl entered with a bent </p><p>tray bearing two tin cups of steaming Blue </p><p>Mountain, flanked by a couple of star-apples </p><p>5° </p><p>The Great God Ananzi </p><p>5i </p><p>and some bread buttered with canned </p><p>bluenose. </p><p> “Mamin’, buslia” said the girl with a</p><p>white-toothed grin. </p><p> To the visitor she accorded less genial</p><p>deference. Without the grin she bowed to </p><p>Warden and said— </p><p> “Marnin,’ buccra.”</p><p> That any fight was in the air Nature at</p><p>least denied. Outside the rough shack </p><p>which was the port’s headquarters of the </p><p>Caribbean Fruit Company, Rio Hacha lay </p><p>like a dead Spanish ruin before being resur- </p><p>rected by the promise of new day. </p><p> It was a semi-circle of crumbling, slave-</p><p>built houses on one side of a white sand road </p><p>that curved inward between two horns of </p><p>volcanic rock goring out to sea. On the </p><p>eastern horn, under the coconut palms </p><p>where the kling-kling birds clamored their </p><p>anvil-chorus, Sam Chung, the heathen, let </p><p>down the bars of his saltfish, quattie bread </p><p>and rum store in preparation for the great </p><p>business of the week—Banana Day. On </p><p>the other horn, Pereira, the Portuguese </p><p>creole, emerged from the shack which was </p><p>his abode and Rio Hacha headquarters of </p><p>the banana trust, the Amalgamated, and </p><p>scanned the field of prospective battle with </p><p>his small, soft eyes. </p><p> There was no promise of conflict either</p><p>in him or the scene. The world was tinged </p><p>with rose. The sun’s rim was not up over </p><p>the edge of the still, oily Caribbean. The </p><p>sea-breeze was not due for an hour, and the </p><p>noon roar of the surf on the reef was but </p><p>as yet a mere sigh. </p><p> Between the horns, on the inner side of</p><p>the incurving sand road, Rio Hacha still </p><p>slept. It would sleep late this morning, </p><p>for the day would properly begin at noon </p><p>and last through the ensuing night. About </p><p>midday the place would wake up when </p><p>Pereira took his station at the buying wharf </p><p>of the Amalgamated Banana Company, </p><p>when his rival, Hambridge of the Caribbean, </p><p>occupied his overseer’s bench at the inde- </p><p>pendents’ pier, and when the runners of</p><p>the two companies began to squabble over </p><p>the incoming drays, carts, donkeys and </p><p>black humanity laden with banana bunches </p><p>from the plantations and the native patches. </p><p> As the Banana Day progressed the fight</p><p>would grow more bitter as price and de- </p><p>mand soared or declined as the required </p><p>fruit fell short or otherwise. The steamers </p><p>of the rival lines would appear, racing neck </p><p>and neck, perhaps, for the mouth of the </p><p>bottle-shaped lagoon. Then would begin </p><p>the loading, and when the last whaleboat </p><p>was emptied of its green-gold treasure the </p><p>race would be resumed for the market- </p><p>ports of Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York </p><p>and Boston. Then Rio Hacha, like many </p><p>another port, would fall asleep again for </p><p>another week. </p><p>BUT at that early hour there was </p><p>no hint of the banana war, another </p><p>battle of which was presently to be </p><p>waged; the war which had been growing in </p><p>heat for weeks between the banana trust </p><p>and the independents who sought a place </p><p>in the sun where the tiger defied all comers. </p><p> For a year the Amalgamated Banana</p><p>Company had been making a point to put </p><p>the Caribbean Fruit Company out of busi- </p><p>ness. To defeat this—at Rio Hacha at </p><p>least—the independents had sent Ham- </p><p>bridge to that fruitful port to match his </p><p>brains against a pastmaster of banana- </p><p>running—Jose Pereira of the trust forces. </p><p>Hambridge, with a white man’s mental </p><p>energy, plus native birth and understand- </p><p>ing, had made good in all branches of the </p><p>business, from selecting and clearing ground </p><p>to reaping a crop of “straights.” </p><p> Pereira, wily behind his sleek, sleepy</p><p>exterior, looked as harmless a West Indian </p><p>as ever lost energy by climate and slack </p><p>morals. He was unhealthily fat. His </p><p>smooth, swarthy cheeks trickled humidity </p><p>on all occasions. His silk shirt—he had </p><p>a weakness for unwashable silk—clung to </p><p>his perspiring girth like a clammy balloon. </p><p> He also wore sandals, strained crash</p><p>pants and a broad felt hat which it was </p><p>said he bought by width—it looked like a </p><p>limp parasol. And he had a fondness for a </p><p>sprinkling of dried lavender sprigs in his </p><p>tobacco. When the breeze wafted a whiff</p><p>of lavender from the west Hambridge was </p><p>wont to become profanely energetic. </p><p> Pereira, having smelled the air and</p><p>scanned the eastern horizon where the </p><p>steamers would appear on the race from </p><p>port to port, retired to morning coffee and </p><p>buttered roast plantain. </p><p> Hambridge and his guest, Warden, having</p><p>disposed of Blue Mountain and bluenose, </p><p>strolled in their pajamas to the Rio Hacha </p><p>for the morning swim. Usually they took </p><p>the guns along, or Mitch-Chell, the buska’s </p><p>black henchman, brought the rods and live </p><p>52 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>shrimps for tarpon, but—this was Banana </p><p>Day. </p><p> Some power in the North who had</p><p>thought not beyond his desk, or possibly </p><p>was trying an experiment on public opin- </p><p>ion, had proposed a tax on bananas. That </p><p>the people howled mattered little to the </p><p>banana-men at banana sources. It was all </p><p>right about “the poor man’s luxury” so </p><p>long as the poor man bought. </p><p> At present the poor man’s agents—the</p><p>middlemen up North—were buying on his </p><p>behalf, the other half for themselves. The </p><p>dealers were stocking their refrigerators </p><p>with green fruit to be ripened by raising </p><p>the temperature in sympathy with the ante. </p><p> Already the price per bunch, as yet the</p><p>same to the poor man who bought “fingers,” </p><p>“hands” at most, from the corner grocer, </p><p>was soaring among the banana islands. </p><p>Future bunches “fitting” on the trees were </p><p>being snapped up by contract and for fancy </p><p>prices. Before the tax proposal the busi- </p><p>ness had been at unusually low ebb, </p><p>“straights” down to thirty-five cents on </p><p>the tropic wharves, seven-handed bunches </p><p>down to eighteen cents, “sixes” rejected </p><p>altogether as not worth their stem weight </p><p>and returned with all smaller bunches for </p><p>Quashie’s family pot and pig-feed. </p><p> But since the tax proposal prices had</p><p>moved steadily upward. The first week </p><p>the Rio Hacha quotations of both the </p><p>Amalgamated and the Caribbean companies </p><p>fluctuated from fifty cents to fifty-five, </p><p>with a tot of rum for the donkey-man who </p><p>brought in not less than four “straight” </p><p>bunches. The second week, while “Con- </p><p>stant Reader” and “Pro Bono” discussed </p><p>the tax up North, the islands’ price went </p><p>up to sixty-five and seventy cents per </p><p>“straight” with frequent fist-fights between </p><p>the runners of Pereira and Hambridge. </p><p> In one such fight a scared jackass, laden</p><p>with five eleven-handed bunches—extra </p><p>“straights”—fled with its coveted load and </p><p>committed inadvertent suicide in the Rio </p><p>Hacha. And once Hambridge, irritated by </p><p>lavender floating down from westward, </p><p>called Pereira a soor kaboocha, which Pe-</p><p>reira, ignorant of Hindustani, but sus- </p><p>picious, resented. </p><p> The third week Hambridge’s chief hench-</p><p>man, Mitch-Chell, smote the Amalgama- </p><p>ted’s chief runner in the eye, Pereira’s </p><p>man had called him a “t'iefin’ porpus,” </p><p>which is not Hindustani but has to do with </p><p>the questionable honesty of a person who </p><p>has once been in a home for paupers. Both </p><p>were arrested, but promptly released. The </p><p>police force owed both Hambridge and </p><p>Pereira since the last poker game—a love- </p><p>feast which occurred on the evening fol- </p><p>lowing each Banana Day, when the nights </p><p>again grew lonesome. </p><p> Now it was the dawn of the fourth Ba-</p><p>nana Day since the tax proposal. In his </p><p>hip pocket Pereira had a written slip </p><p>brought in the night by a black boy on a </p><p>mule. It was from the Amalgamaled’s </p><p>boss at Port Antonio. It tersely stated his </p><p>instructions: </p><p> Rio Hacha: Fifteen thousand bunches—sixes up.</p><p>Average seventy-five cents—dollar limit. Steamer </p><p>Haciendado arrive 4 p.m. to clear at midnight. </p><p> At the Caribbean’s shack Hambridge</p><p>had a message from the independents’ </p><p>chief, whose headquarters were at Port </p><p>Maria. The chief happened to be War- </p><p>den’s father. His son, fresh from an </p><p>American college, was in Jamaica to ob- </p><p>serve Ananzi spiders, the native and other </p><p>animals, and to learn the difference between </p><p>Para and Guinea grass, white yams and </p><p>afu, and particularly the difference between </p><p>a banana and a plantain. The bus ha was </p><p>expert in these matters. </p><p> Warden Sr.’s message of instruction was</p><p>less formal: </p><p> Buy all you can lay hands on and keep out of</p><p>jail. Go Pereira’s limit and then some. Tax on </p><p>bananas taxing demand. If we don’t get the trim- </p><p>mings the Amalgamated will. Show the rah-rah </p><p>boy something. </p><p> This message Hambridge studied again</p><p>after the swim, when he and the rah-rah </p><p>boy had returned to the shack. It was a </p><p>perfectly clear message. There was nothing </p><p>about it that should have brought a moody </p><p>frown to the busha’s sun-scorched brow.</p><p>He studied it, turned it over, and even held </p><p>it up to the light. Once when the Amal- </p><p>gamated had been waylaying the Carib- </p><p>bean’s dispatch bearers, the busha himself </p><p>had written an important message with </p><p>banana-juice, which remained invisible un- </p><p>til it had been laundered with a hot flatiron. </p><p> But this message from Warden Sr. was</p><p>all on the surface. It was just as Ham- </p><p>bridge had expected the wording would be. </p><p>Yet he was troubled. He did not know </p><p>himself why or what about. He had had </p><p>the same vague feeling that time he put </p><p>his money on a sure favorite in the Overseers’ </p><p>The Great God Ananzi </p><p>53 </p><p>Sweepstakes and lost a month’s pay, a </p><p>saddle and faith in his own perspicacity. </p><p>His abstracted reverie was disturbed by </p><p>Warden Jr. </p><p> “But how can you tell it isn’t a taran-</p><p>tula?” he asked. </p><p> The Ananzi was still on the wall.</p><p> “You can tell shortly after it bites,” said</p><p>the banana-man irritably. “The banana </p><p>bunches are full of them and I never knew </p><p>one bite except in the New York papers.” </p><p> He rose and went to the jalousied door.</p><p> “Mitch-Chell!” he roared. “Go bring</p><p>come a gallon a rum—yah?” </p><p> “'Eu-eu, busha,” assented a guttural from</p><p>without. </p><p> “An’ tell he no sen’ dis buccra parafeen</p><p>all color up wi’ annotta like las’ week,” </p><p>said Hambridge. “Jamaica man no fool </p><p>’bout good rum.” </p><p> “As bad as all that?” said Warden when</p><p>Mitch-Chell had departed Chungward. </p><p> “A nigger out of the bush will fall for a</p><p>three-farthings’ of rum where he’ll turn </p><p>down a threepence extra on the bunch,” </p><p>the busha growled. </p><p> He went into the cubbyhole which was</p><p>his office. Presently his runners, ragged, </p><p>bare-footed, black and shiny as wet ebony, </p><p>gathered around him for a war council over </p><p>a sheet of names. </p><p> With a pencil the busha checked off this</p><p>man of the hills and who were expected </p><p>to bring in fruit before nightfall. This </p><p>man was no good—Pereira’s body and soul </p><p>—Pereira had loaned him money. This </p><p>fellow was doubtful, but Mitch-Chell was </p><p>at his brother’s wake, wasn’t he? Mitch- </p><p>Chell must take care of him. Pereira had </p><p>been angling for this other fellow—a regu- </p><p>lar six-straight-bunch man. Give him a </p><p>drink first, then talk him up! </p><p> And so on. Pereira on the western horn</p><p>was holding a similar war council with his </p><p>native runners, the chiefest of whom had a </p><p>bruised eye. </p><p> Warden had taken a gun, after one more</p><p>respectful glance at the great god Ananzi </p><p>on the wall, and gone off to the Hacha </p><p>swamp to pot baldpates on the rise to the </p><p>hog-plum feeding in the hills. </p><p>WHEN the American visitor re- </p><p>turned to Rio Hacha it was past </p><p>noon. His steps had taken him </p><p>over into the Bengal plantation where he </p><p>had become interested in the barracks of </p><p>the indentured coolie laborers and a beauti- </p><p>ful but brainless creature of no caste what- </p><p>ever who looked like Oriental romance </p><p>under the sounding name of Latchimi. </p><p> But he forgot about his Hindi flower—</p><p>who had been married when she was nine, </p><p>although he did not know it—when lie </p><p>tried to recognize Rio Hacha. The settle- </p><p>ment which at morn had seemed as dead </p><p>as the Spaniards who built it under Don </p><p>Sasi, was now alive with Jamaican clamor </p><p>and American hustle. </p><p> The wharves of the rival companies were</p><p>scenes of activity. On the piers half-clad </p><p>negroes were piling bunches of green-gold </p><p>fruit, at each pile a mulatto clerk in an </p><p>immense hat checking the bunches as they </p><p>were passed into a whaleboat by perspiring </p><p>handlers. </p><p> In the doorway of the Caribbean’s wharf-</p><p>building Hambridge sat under a huge pith </p><p>helmet watching the battle which was going </p><p>on directly before him on the sand road. </p><p>Down at the Amalgamated’s wharf, where </p><p>the Portuguese sat complacently breath- </p><p>ing lavender, there was, on the other hand, </p><p>comparative order. </p><p> The main road from the hills entered</p><p>Rio Hacha from the east, and the incoming </p><p>fruit-carriers ran the rivals’ gantlet at the </p><p>Caribbean’s wharf. Once past that point </p><p>it was agreed that the spoils were to Pe- </p><p>reira. But that worthy’s runners were on </p><p>the job with Hambridge’s at the danger </p><p>point. Both sides yelled, cursed, cajoled, </p><p>threatened and tried to bribe the dazed </p><p>Quashie from the interior, who had ar- </p><p>rived with his humble donkey and his</p><p>banana patch’s yield of “fit” bunches for </p><p>the week. </p><p> Clashes between the rival runners, be-</p><p>tween the banana-sellers and the over- </p><p>zealous banana-buyers, were so frequent </p><p>that one continuous fight was in progress. </p><p>The moment one was settled and peace </p><p>established, generous libations at Sam </p><p>Chung’s rum-counter led to renewed re- </p><p>criminations. </p><p> When Warden arrived on the scene he</p><p>witnessed a typical collision. A well-to- </p><p>do native planter had arrived with twenty </p><p>“straight” bunches in a small dray dragged </p><p>by an unhappy mule that was half-sus- </p><p>pended between the shafts. The negro was </p><p>a newcomer to Rio Hacha, drawn thereto </p><p>by the promise of high prices. </p><p> Unused to Rio Hacha methods he flayed</p><p>54 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the belligerent runners with his cowhide </p><p>whip. Failing to dislodge them from the </p><p>top of his dray he turned his lash upon the </p><p>mule, urging it out of this pandemonium. </p><p>Knowing that if the dray once passed the </p><p>Caribbean’s wharf the fruit was lost to </p><p>Pereira, Hambridge’s runners seized the </p><p>animal’s head. Pereira’s runners tried to </p><p>dislodge them. The proprietor raised his </p><p>arms to heaven and called upon his Maker </p><p>to bear witness that he was a Baptist in </p><p>good standing and had never backslid or </p><p>been in the poorhouse—whatever these </p><p>virtues had to do with the case. </p><p> Then the mule took a part in the affaip—</p><p>resentfully. It let loose with its hind legs. </p><p>The traces broke; a shaft cracked. Two </p><p>minutes later Pereira got the mule and </p><p>sections of harness. Hambridge’s men bat- </p><p>tled in the dust with the rival runners for </p><p>possession of the fruit. That which sur- </p><p>vived undamaged presumably found its </p><p>way to Baltimore by the Caribbean’s </p><p>steamer. </p><p> The man from the hills went back to his</p><p>yam-patch and his dusky bride with a </p><p>smashed dray, a penitent mule in mended </p><p>harness, the price of nine good bunches </p><p>mostly in his head, the rest being in Sam </p><p>Chung’s till, five “rejects” and the remains </p><p>of six mutilated banana stems. But then </p><p>he had learned much. </p><p> Hambridge observed all this without</p><p>once rising from his bench or removing the </p><p>pipe from his mouth. Occasionally he </p><p>wrote an order and had it passed to Mitch- </p><p>Chell. It usually was a command to give </p><p>some prospective banana-seller a la-a-arge </p><p>drink of rum. </p><p> “How goes the battle, General?” asked</p><p>Warden, coming to the busha’s side. </p><p> “Good enough,” said Hambridge, rather</p><p>gloomily. “We hold our own. He’s ahead </p><p>of us on his contracted fruit, of course, and </p><p>he’s turned a lousy trick or two. But the </p><p>day’s young.” </p><p> He spoke with a kind of abstraction, a</p><p>certain doubt. Warden thought the over- </p><p>seer did not look quite himself—a touch of</p><p>fever perhaps. He advised a personal </p><p>application of the bribe-bottle as a stimu- </p><p>lant to zest. </p><p> “I don’t as a rule,” said the bus ha</p><p>thoughtfully, “but I may before I’m </p><p>through.” </p><p> The afternoon lengthened and swift dusk</p><p>came. Into Rio Hacha trundled more </p><p>donkeys, drays and natives burdened with </p><p>bananas. Many lights appeared on land </p><p>and sea and the tropic heavens lit their </p><p>million candles. The fireflies danced among </p><p>the coconut palms and the low logwood </p><p>greenery. </p><p> In the semi-darkness the broad negro</p><p>voices, hilarious with rum or furious with </p><p>rage, and the constant squealing and bray- </p><p>ing of mules and donkeys contrasted oddly </p><p>with the mirroring sea from which the day- </p><p>breeze had fled. Against the dense blue </p><p>of the evening sky the palms rose as sten- </p><p>ciled things in mid-air. The kling-kling </p><p>birds, returning in pairs to the palm-crests, </p><p>again beat out their anvil chorus, but not </p><p>with the unanimous gusts of dawn. </p><p> Already the rival steamers had appeared,</p><p>the Caribbean’s Amato first because it had </p><p>gained time through failure to get its quota </p><p>at the other ports along the coast. The </p><p>Amalgamated’s Haciendado was now in the </p><p>lagoon, too. Her gun-ports were wide </p><p>open and the trust’s handlers were passing </p><p>in thousands of bunches of bananas. From </p><p>the wharf at the western end of the bay </p><p>Pereira’s loaders could be heard number- </p><p>ing the bunches for the checker in a sing- </p><p>song with doggerel rhymings: </p><p> Bana-a-ana—four'</p><p> Come gimme one mo-ore—O!</p><p> Bana-a-ana—fi-ive!</p><p> Ho, boy, look ali-ive—O!</p><p> The Amato had not begun to load. The</p><p>first whaleboat had just left the Caribbean’s </p><p>wharf and it would be some time before </p><p>Hambridge could keep the passers as busy </p><p>as the stevedores desired to be. Things </p><p>were going badly. </p><p> Earlier in the afternoon he had received</p><p>another dispatch from Warden Sr. at Port </p><p>Maria. </p><p> Amalgamated cleaning up everything all along.</p><p>Amato not half laden! It’s up to you! </p><p> It was up to him. Yet what could he</p><p>do to save the company from sending a </p><p>half-laden steamer North, for ordinarily </p><p>she cleared from Rio Hacha? And go she </p><p>must with her perishable cargo ripening in </p><p>her holds. But even if he captured every </p><p>bunch that came into Rio Hacha, even if </p><p>he stole fruit regularly contracted to Perei- </p><p>ra, even if he assassinated the fat, lavender- </p><p>soaked sponge and lifted his deliveries from </p><p>The Gfeat God Ananzi </p><p>55 </p><p>the piled wharf, still he could not hope to </p><p>fill the Amato. </p><p> So he told the anxious supercargo who</p><p>came ashore from the Amato the minute </p><p>she dropped her hook. But he went to </p><p>work to do his best, although somehow that </p><p>mysterious prescience followed him like a </p><p>shadow. His pupil and guest, Warden, </p><p>caught the fever of the game and went so </p><p>far as to leap himself to the driver’s seat </p><p>of a newly arrived dray, shoulder the pro- </p><p>prietor off and drive the load of bananas </p><p>into the Caribbean’s shed. </p><p> “There!” he cried, dismounting, flushed</p><p>with battle. “I like this game, buskat” </p><p> “You-fool!” said Hambridge thickly.</p><p>“You can’t do that. He’s Pereira’s man. </p><p>It’s contract fruit.” </p><p> “What’s the odds! He’s turned a trick</p><p>or two on us! All’s fair-” </p><p> “Drive out that dray!” said the busha</p><p>to the negro planter who had picked him- </p><p>self up and was calling down anathema </p><p>upon “de mad young buccra from obersea.” </p><p> “What’s the matter with you?” de-</p><p>manded Warden of his father’s employee. </p><p> “Nothing,” said Hambridge with a queer</p><p>laugh. </p><p> He waved a hand to the spangled skies.</p><p> “God’s in’s heav’n-”</p><p>HE TURNED and walked, slightly </p><p>unsteady, toward the shack across </p><p>the way. Warden remained, </p><p>stunned out of action. Hambridge, the </p><p>best man the Caribbean had, the man his </p><p>governor chose for his example in the busi- </p><p>ness, had been drinking! </p><p> No doubt the negro hands knew it and</p><p>slacked accordingly. It seemed to Warden </p><p>that most of them were drunk, too. No </p><p>wonder! They did precisely what the </p><p>busha did. He was a white man and could </p><p>do no wrong. What he did was worthy</p><p>of emulation. </p><p> No wonder Pereira was winning—had</p><p>won—banana hands up! He would hate </p><p>to tell the governor of this, but—he ought </p><p>to. Hambridge was the company’s best </p><p>man. Ye gods! Drunk! </p><p> Presently the busha came back. There</p><p>was the curious grin on his face, the </p><p>inane smirk of a man half-paralyzed by </p><p>liquor. </p><p> “Come on!” said Warden, thinking the</p><p>lapse might be merely temporary—a touch </p><p>of fever and consequent light-headedness. </p><p>“Let’s lean up against it. We’ll turn a </p><p>trick on that lavender chest yet!” </p><p> “What’s the use?” gulped Hambridge,</p><p>slumping down on his bench. “He wins. </p><p>-tax on b’nanas anyway!” </p><p> “Wins!” shouted Warden, his Yankee</p><p>hatred of defeat cropping out. “Not by a </p><p>darn sight! And if you’re that sort of </p><p>weak-spined rabbit-” </p><p> Hardly knowing what he expected to</p><p>accomplish right away, he grabbed a bunch </p><p>of bananas from the hands of one of the </p><p>negroes and— just as quickly dropped it </p><p>again. He sprang back aghast. The ne- </p><p>gro also leaped away. </p><p> From the bunch had dropped a huge</p><p>spider, even larger than that which had dis- </p><p>mayed him in the shack. </p><p> “Spidah!” yelled the negro.</p><p> It was Mitch-Chell.</p><p> Warden, ashamed of the fact that the</p><p>bunch he had dropped had burst into three </p><p>pieces, sprang with both feet upon the in- </p><p>sect, intent upon vengeance. He did not </p><p>miss. That spider emerged from the im- </p><p>pact a flat mess of pulp and quivering, </p><p>hairy legs. </p><p> “Now you’ve done it!” said the Anglo-</p><p>Jamaican overseer. “That settles it. I </p><p>tell you—” He hiccouped—“might’s well </p><p>a killed Nancy this morning. Nancy heard </p><p>ya, an’way. Killed the luck! That settl* </p><p>zit. ’Ve killed a Nanzi spider!”</p><p> “But, busha—!” Mitch-Chell protested.</p><p> “Shut up—you!” shouted Hambridge,</p><p>glaring at his henchman. </p><p> “But, busha-”</p><p> “Will you close your black mouth!”</p><p>roared the busha. “Get me a drink!” </p><p> “My God!” groaned Warden, the pupil,</p><p>and he turned toward the shack in despair. </p><p> He would have to talk to the governor.</p><p> Before he entered the shack he looked</p><p>back at the wharf-shed. The chief runner, </p><p>Mitch-Chell, appeared to be arguing with </p><p>the busha. Hambridge had gripped the </p><p>negrp by the shoulders—possibly for sup- </p><p>port or in drunken affection—and he was </p><p>laughing in his face. Warden went to the </p><p>room in the shack where he had slept every </p><p>night for nearly a week—for no purpose </p><p>except to be alone with his thoughts. The </p><p>first thing his eyes sought and found was </p><p>the Ananzi spider of the morning, still im- </p><p>pending over his cot. </p><p> It had not moved. It was like a dead</p><p>insect fastened by some invisible web. </p><p>56 </p><p>Adventu?&amp; t </p><p>Only the light of the hurricane lamp caught </p><p>two little gleaming points in its head. </p><p> He shuddered slightly. He desired to</p><p>kill it, attributing to the strange creature </p><p>somehow the ill-luck of the day; desiring </p><p>more to slay it because Hambridge seemed </p><p>to believe in its power, that he himself was </p><p>half-inclined. . .Bah! </p><p> He picked up one of his still sodden</p><p>bathing-shoes and balanced it for an accu- </p><p>rate shot. But as he swung his arm a voice, </p><p>thick with inebriation, said behind him: </p><p> “Don’ do it! Musn’ do it, ol’ fella!”</p><p> Warden gave the busha one contemptu-</p><p>ous look and hurled the shoe with all his </p><p>force. The spider vanished. The Ameri- </p><p>can turned furiously upon the overseer, </p><p>who was chuckling inanely. Hambridge </p><p>pointed waveringly to the opposite wall. </p><p> “Misshed!” said he.</p><p> There was the spider! How it had got</p><p>over there, whether it had leaped or—some </p><p>magic. It seemed impossible; yet there it </p><p>was. </p><p> The overseer reeled toward the wash-</p><p>stand. He poured a half tumbler of liquid </p><p>from a black bottle which had stood there </p><p>and drained it off. Then he fairly col- </p><p>lapsed on his cot. </p><p> Warden, disgusted, dismayed beyond</p><p>expression, went out into the night. A </p><p>fury raged in him. He would not let his </p><p>dad lose because his dad’s trusted best man </p><p>had fallen down. </p><p> He took charge; but he might as well</p><p>have followed the busha’s example, at least </p><p>in the matter of going to bed. The hands </p><p>listened dully to his orders, or quite ignored </p><p>them. They, too, had slacked up. They, </p><p>too, had been drinking. They worked </p><p>slowly, clumsily. Bunches of bananas were </p><p>dropped and shattered. They pitched </p><p>other bunches into the whaleboat, bruising </p><p>them against marketable possibility. They </p><p>allowed dray after dray to run the gantlet </p><p>unchallenged. The victorious Pereira on</p><p>the other horn chuckled as he heard of the </p><p>doings. </p><p> “Soused—on Banana Day!” he said to</p><p>his chief runner. “Never knew him take a </p><p>drink before, even. Well, it’s an ill wind— </p><p>my tally says twenty-two thousand </p><p>bunches. How about yours, Amos?” </p><p> As a last resort Warden appealed to</p><p>Mitch-Chell, the faithful. Upon him, too, </p><p>the spell of evil had descended. He, too, </p><p>seemed more than half drunk. </p><p> “Wehfado, buccra?” (“What else can we</p><p>do, white man?”) he said. “You no kill </p><p>Nancy spidah, buccra?” </p><p>THE Amalgamated’s steamer, IIa- </p><p>ciendado, cleared at midnight with </p><p>her holds full. The Caribbean’s </p><p>Amato cleared hours later with less than </p><p>half the cargo for which she had capacity. </p><p>She headed back to Port Maria for in- </p><p>structions. It had been a disastrous week </p><p>for the independents, especially at Rio </p><p>Hacha. Pereira had exceeded his order </p><p>for fifteen thousand bunches by seven </p><p>thousand. Hambridge shipped only nine </p><p>thousand. </p><p> While the Caribbean’s hands finished</p><p>their debauch on the beach at the eastern </p><p>end of the bay and on the other horn </p><p>Pereira’s victors celebrated, Warden re- </p><p>turned to the shack, tired, disappointed, </p><p>disgusted. On the other cot lay the busha, </p><p>apparently dead to the world. By his side </p><p>was a broken chair and on it the black </p><p>bottle and a glass. </p><p> What was the man drinking, anyway?</p><p>The dregs in the glass were not red or brown </p><p>or amber, but transparent and colorless. </p><p>Was it possible he had sunk secretly to the </p><p>last resort of the tropic tippler—gin? </p><p> Sadly anxious to know the worst, Warden</p><p>tiptoed to the side of the man he had ad- </p><p>mired until that night. He smelled of the </p><p>liquid in the glass. It had no odor. </p><p>Neither had the remainder of it in the black </p><p>bottle. He poured a few drops on the palm </p><p>of his left hand and touched it with the tip </p><p>of his tongue. </p><p> It was plain water! Yet ....</p><p>§|p||[ IN THE morning there was little </p><p>IIIjkI to be said. The busha, naturally </p><p>enough, slept late. Warden took </p><p>his dip in the Rio Hacha alone. </p><p> Pereira came around, as usual after</p><p>Banana Day, to talk it over, offer to shake </p><p>hands and call it a deal for another week. </p><p>On this occasion he expressed the sympathy </p><p>of good fellowship. </p><p> “We all do it, even the best of us, at</p><p>times,” said he. “Suppose you have a </p><p>hair of the dog, Hambridge?” </p><p> “No, massa,” said Hambridge gravely.</p><p>“I never touch the stuff.” </p><p> Pereira chuckled and helped himself</p><p>from the bottle he had brought along for </p><p>diplomatic use. </p><p>The Great God Ananzi </p><p>57 </p><p> When Warden came back from the river</p><p>he found them seated together, quite friend- </p><p>ly, talking over the setting of a turtle </p><p>net. </p><p> Warden did not like it. The dark</p><p>thought occurred that these two—alone so </p><p>much together—might be closer than he </p><p>had been led to believe; that possibly the </p><p>Amalgamated, through Pereira, had bought </p><p>the bus ha into the secret service of the trust. </p><p>He would certainly have a talk with the </p><p>governor. </p><p> After the late tropic breakfast Warden</p><p>announced his intention of returning to </p><p>Port Maria. The busha did not press him </p><p>to remain. The farewells were rather awk- </p><p>ward. Warden felt he ought to be frank. </p><p> “I’m sorry, Hambridge,” said he, “but</p><p>there were things last night. I needn’t say </p><p>more, except that it’s clearly up to me, as </p><p>my father’s son-” </p><p> “Go ahead,” said the busha wearily.</p><p>“When I make an ass of myself I bray but </p><p>don’t kick. It’s my funeral. So long.” </p><p>When Warden Jr. told Warden Sr. of </p><p>the matter of which he felt he was bound to </p><p>speak, the governor’s face expressed utter </p><p>disappointment and dismay. </p><p> “If you weren’t my own son I’d call you</p><p>a liar,” said he. “But this explains yes- </p><p>terday. I’ve been twisting my brain for </p><p>some explanation of the fall-down of Rio </p><p>Hacha. We didn’t expect Hambridge to </p><p>raise twenty-two thousand bunches as </p><p>Pereira did—he gets half that in contracted </p><p>fruit—but we did bank on twelve thous- </p><p>and, maybe fifteen. He was authorized to </p><p>go Pereira’s limit, and then some. I didn’t </p><p>understand, but now—Hambridge! Drunk! </p><p>And I’d meant to make him general man- </p><p>ager. Well, I’ll give him a fair hearing.” </p><p>Hambridge, upon a summons to Port </p><p>Maria next day, rode there huddled in his </p><p>saddle like a bag of loose bricks. His face </p><p>was stamped with wo and his brow fur- </p><p>rowed with remorse. Possibly he had been </p><p>an ass, a superstitious fool, but ever since </p><p>that time he lost on the favorite in the </p><p>Overseers’ Sweepstakes he had been more</p><p>and more inclined to listen to that inward </p><p>voice. No, not voice. That. . .What was </p><p>it the Americans called it? Ah, well, it </p><p>didn’t matter now. </p><p> It was therefore a much surprised over-</p><p>seer who, walking listlessly into Warden </p><p>Sr’s. office at Port Maria, suddenly found </p><p>himself enclosed in that banana magnate’s </p><p>arms and being given a lesson in the two-step. </p><p> The busha backed off. The head of the</p><p>independent company trod mincingly </p><p>around the office, cackling like a gander </p><p>and waving a pink slip of paper. </p><p> “Go out and get drunk again, Ham-</p><p>bridge, me boy,” he chanted chortlingly. </p><p>“Go out and get paralyzed!” </p><p> “I never touch the stuff,” said the busha,</p><p>his usual languid tones heavy with melan- </p><p>choly. </p><p> “Eh!” ejaculated Warden Sr. “But</p><p>there—that’s all right. Don’t discuss it. </p><p>I won’t. Luckiest thing ever happened, </p><p>only don’t do it again. Listen to this!” </p><p> He started to read the cablegram, but</p><p>broke off to explain in full what the laconic </p><p>words meant. </p><p> “Bottom’s dropped out of the boom</p><p>banana market,” he declaimed. “Tax on </p><p>bananas gone up in smoke. ‘Constant </p><p>Reader’ and ‘Pro Bono Publico’ and the </p><p>‘poor man’s food’ and all that—killed it </p><p>before it was born. Markets Hooded with </p><p>bananas to be sold at a loss by dealers. </p><p>Prices dropped through the basement </p><p>floor and-” </p><p> “And—?” the busha chimed in, leaning</p><p>forward with a great light in his eyes. </p><p> “And!” roared Warden Sr. “The Amal-</p><p>gamated has six steamers crammed to the </p><p>gunwales steaming seventeen knots to Bal- </p><p>timore, Philadelphia, New York and Bos- </p><p>ton, and they’ll have to chuck the whole </p><p>caboodle overboard, as they’ve done be- </p><p>fore, or further spoil the market. The </p><p>Caribbean loses only a poor half cargo on </p><p>the Amato, for the Jacquelin and the Por- </p><p>tuondo of our fleet couldn’t make up and</p><p>turned over their fruit to the Amato and </p><p>didn’t sail at all!” </p><p> “Imphm!” was the busha’s comment.</p><p>There was a queer look on his sun- </p><p>scorched face. </p><p> “Now, as to my getting drunk—”</p><p>“Not a word!” interrupted Warden Sr. </p><p>“As I say, it was the luckiest thing ever </p><p>happened, only-” </p><p> “As to my getting drunk,” continued</p><p>Hambridge lazily, “it was like this. One </p><p>time I bet a month’s salary and a fifty- </p><p>dollar saddle on a sure thing in the Over- </p><p>seers’-” </p><p> “Oh, can that old yam! Only-”</p><p> “And ever since I’ve sort of leaned to a</p><p>bet on the possibility of a rank outsider </p><p>finishing first. Now, I had a feeling-” </p><p>58 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “A hunch?” said Warden Sr., becoming</p><p>grave at once. </p><p> “Much obliged,” said the busha, re-</p><p>lieved. “I’ve been hunting that word for </p><p>nearly two days—a hunch. I had a hunch </p><p>that that tax wouldn’t go through, and the </p><p>high prices of the last month and the way </p><p>we’ve been flooding the market meant— </p><p>you see? My hunch was for its happening </p><p>this week, between sailing and arriving in </p><p>the States—within these five days. It was </p><p>such a strong—er—hunch. Then there </p><p>was a fool thing about a Nancy spider-” </p><p> “What about the Ananzi spider?” asked</p><p>some one in the doorway. </p><p> It was Warden Jr., a curious grin on his</p><p>face. </p><p> “Hullo, Warden,” said Hambridge coolly,</p><p>and went on, “Maybe that was what got </p><p>me started. Your young man here missed </p><p>it with his boot and it stayed right in the </p><p>room all day. Maybe I pleaded for its life </p><p>and—maybe Ananzi took a hand in grati- </p><p>tude.” </p><p> Warden Sr. was shaking with mirth.</p><p>He knew the native-born Jamaican’s super- </p><p>stition about Br’er Ananzi. </p><p> “The Nancy stayed in the room and I</p><p>got a feeling—a hunch—it had something </p><p>on its mind; that it had a hunch, too, and </p><p>wanted to tip me off on a sure thing. </p><p> “Wien I got word how badly things were</p><p>going at the other ports, I went to the shack </p><p>and had a long confab with Br’er ’Nancy— </p><p>in my mind, you know. That’s what was </p><p>on my mind,” turning to Warden Jr. </p><p>“Fever be blowed! And when you sug- </p><p>gested a drink—a thing I never do—it </p><p>occurred to me the only way to cover up a </p><p>lie-down before Pereira was to get para- </p><p>lyzed. ) I drank so much water out of that </p><p>black bottle that after you left I had to go </p><p>over to Sam Chung's for a real drink— </p><p>something I never do. </p><p> “It was just a—a hunch, you see.”</p><p> “Hmm! There was a good deal of cold</p><p>reasoning behind that hunch,” said War- </p><p>den Sr. </p><p> “I’m sorry, old man,” said Warden Jr.</p><p>“Honest—I thought you were really—all </p><p>to the bad, and—and I was disappointed. </p><p>I’m frank, and I want to apologize.” </p><p> “I meant you to think so,” said the busha.</p><p>“I meant everybody to think so—so it </p><p>would come straight to Pereira. Even </p><p>Mitch-Chell believed it until I put him on </p><p>and thereafter he proceeded to demoralize </p><p>the whole handling staff.” </p><p> “But why pretend to be drunk at all?”</p><p>asked Warden Jr. </p><p> “As I never touch the stuff,” the busha</p><p>drawled, “it was the only thing would ac- </p><p>count to Pereira for my falling down. He </p><p>would have been suspicious of anything else </p><p>and would have got a—a hunch, maybe, </p><p>that I had private information from head- </p><p>quarters. A throw-down of the tax on </p><p>bananas would have been the first thing to </p><p>occur to him. I didn’t want him to put </p><p>that into the heads of the Amalgamates at </p><p>Port Antonio. I wanted ’em to go on buy- </p><p>ing—and they sure did. I helped ’em all I </p><p>could.” </p><p> “But how can you give any credit to the</p><p>Ananzi, or my not killing it? Didn’t I </p><p>smash one to pulp that time in the wharf- </p><p>shed?” </p><p> “Oh, that?” said Hambridge with a queer</p><p>smile. “Mitch-Chell knew. That’s why </p><p>I had to shut him up sharp. I wanted you </p><p>to think it was a Nancy. If it had been, </p><p>I’d ha’ known we were really in bad. That </p><p>was a tarantula! </p><p> “Your Nancy is still doing business at</p><p>the same stand. It was right on the ceiling </p><p>over my head last night when Pereira, Sam </p><p>Chung, the police force and I had our little </p><p>weekly game. Sam Chung has a mortgage </p><p>now on the constable’s horse and I stung </p><p>Pereira for eighty-seven cold dollars.” </p><p>However, when the busha was promoted </p><p>to the general managership at Port Maria, </p><p>Warden Sr. presented him with a seal ring </p><p>upon which was engraved the great god </p><p>Ananzi in the shape of a spider, somewhat </p><p>reduced.</p><p>I SAW him surveying the house with </p><p>great care, until, as if satisfied, he put </p><p>his hand on the gate and tentatively </p><p>fumbled with the catch. But, having </p><p>gone so far, he hesitated; and I, watching </p><p>him from behind window curtains, intoler- </p><p>ant of strangers, cordially hating all man- </p><p>ner of sellers of things and suspicious of </p><p>every one else, found myself curiously </p><p>disappointed when he nervously took </p><p>his hand off the gate and began to walk </p><p>away. </p><p> An old man, whom I knew at once for a</p><p>sailor, he acted for all the world like a boy </p><p>who has a fault to confess and dreads the </p><p>consequences of his confession; and as he </p><p>walked slowly away he kept turning his </p><p>head to look back, so I went out to the </p><p>porch, and sat down in the long cane chair </p><p>I keep there during fine weather; and </p><p>he, seeing me do this, turned about and </p><p>walked toward the gate again, his keen old </p><p>eyes taking in every detail of me, although </p><p>he at no time allowed his scrutiny to develop </p><p>the rudeness of a stare. </p><p> Then, as I was wondering what he would</p><p>do next, he threw open the gate with </p><p>startling abandon, and began an extraor- </p><p>dinary progress up the path of my garden, </p><p>while I tried to make a diagnosis from </p><p>his walk—at first inclining to tablets, but </p><p>switching almost immediately to alcohol, </p><p>because of the absence of certain indica- </p><p>tions of the former malady. But suddenly </p><p>my shameful pathological promptings were </p><p>swept aside, and, half rising from my chair, </p><p>I realized that the ragged vagabond caper- </p><p>ing so curiously up the path was performing </p><p>his involved gyrations from an excess of </p><p>pure joy. </p><p> What little thing is it that brings recog-</p><p>nition after many years? The face of my </p><p>visitor was covered with a ragged growth, </p><p>obliterating the trim mustache memory </p><p>looked for; and the weird dance of his un- </p><p>dignified approach bravely tried to hide a </p><p>knee-tremble which was an unkindly </p><p>stranger to the husky young Irishman who </p><p>had taught me to steer. And his rags, and </p><p>the sorry existence they proclaimed as he </p><p>careered along with but a pitiful physical </p><p>echo of the jocularly active Brennan whom </p><p>I knew before life’s bubbles lost their colors </p><p>and most of them burst. And by what un-</p><p>canny methods had he found me? </p><p> I had his hand, and our eyes met bash-</p><p>fully—as if all the things we had done since </p><p>we last saw each other were watching us, </p><p>making us diffident; and we did not at first </p><p>speak, finding our throats very dry. But </p><p>there would be much to tell, and I would </p><p>listen, as I did when a boy, to his tales. In </p><p>that last word lurks the courtesy due a guest. </p><p> He teetered just a bit from weariness as I</p><p>led him inside, where he took off his nonde- </p><p>script hat with the respectful politeness of </p><p>the sailor going aft to the cabin; and he </p><p>admired my bits of things with that silent </p><p>flattery which is instinctive with the Irish </p><p>but unknown to any other race. Then we </p><p>drank, as yet wordless, because there was so </p><p>much to say that neither of us knew where </p><p>to begin. </p><p> “And how did you find me—by acci-</p><p>dent?” I asked, after we had beamed at </p><p>cach other for several minutes. </p><p>59 </p><p>Author of “The Tide-Mating,” “Taste of the Sail," etc. </p><p>6o </p><p>Adventure </p><p> He had about him—exuded it, in fact—</p><p>something more than a mere atmosphere of </p><p>heavily tarred rigging and strange old car- </p><p>goes of dead and gone sailing ships. The </p><p>mystery and magic of the sea enfolded him, </p><p>so that he might have been a goodly com- </p><p>pany of seafaring men woven cunningly into </p><p>one personality, yet with every strand of the </p><p>weave showing distinctly—coming from the </p><p>loft of eternity to the measuring loom of </p><p>time: Drake’s men, Hawkins’ men, pirates, </p><p>adventurers and decent seamen. These </p><p>looked at me from the back of his eyeg when </p><p>he grinned: </p><p> “As to that, it was easy. I meets an old</p><p>shipmate—hadn’t seen him for years—and </p><p>we gets to talking. He was after, he told </p><p>me, with a scheme he had to catch a sub- </p><p>marine alive, before the square-headed </p><p>crew of her could destroy the innards of her </p><p>out of shape, so to speak. A reward, he </p><p>tells me, he’ll get for the catching of one. </p><p>By and by your name comes up.” </p><p> I smiled back at him, brushing aside the</p><p>memory of the weaknesses that had brought </p><p>him to his pathetic age, remembering only </p><p>that once he had been my ideal, and that </p><p>always he had been ray friend. </p><p> “That would be Ted Gillet,” I answered.</p><p>“He left here when the State went dry. </p><p>An old, old man for such a job—if he </p><p>meant it!” </p><p> “So I came along,” added Brennan lu-</p><p>minously. “Of course Ted told me about </p><p>you and where you lived, but him being </p><p>such a liar always I had to come along here </p><p>to see for myself.” </p><p> “And very welcome,” I said.</p><p> “Ye were a small boy at sea, and me</p><p>showing ye the ropes,” he went on, after </p><p>lighting his pipe. “And how long is it </p><p>now?” </p><p> “Oh, it must be thirty-five years,” I ad-</p><p>mitted. </p><p> “And ye remember it all?”</p><p> “I do. You began instructing me by</p><p>explaining how it was the stars in the China </p><p>Sea moved around the world the opposite </p><p>way to what they do in the Atlantic.” </p><p>“And the fight I trained ye for?” he asked </p><p>eagerly. </p><p> Yes, I remembered, for it brought me fine</p><p>weather, but that Brennan should have </p><p>dragged it up—oh, well, he is Brennan. </p><p>Now, I wonder will you think, as I do often, </p><p>that coincidence lifted a corner of the veil </p><p>that night, and showed me reality? </p><p>IT HAPPENED in Liverpool, with </p><p>me hardened to a most plebeian </p><p>toughness, the ship lying in the </p><p>Herculanean Dock, and Brennan running </p><p>aboard with much excitement and a few </p><p>drinks in him to find me. </p><p> “I’ve been ashore,” he made needless ex-</p><p>planation. “Now, Barney, me boy, lay </p><p>aside your book, and get out of your bunk </p><p>for a blessed minute—it’s a teacher of school </p><p>ye’ll be some day, that’s sure—and listen </p><p>to me, will ye?” </p><p> I put the book under my pillow, and at-</p><p>tended with the gravity befitting what </p><p>promised to be a matter of importance. </p><p> “It’s a fight,” he plunged to finality.</p><p> Boijks were as far as the moon, borne</p><p>away by the atavistic tidal wave raised by </p><p>the vision of combat. </p><p> “Between—?” I asked, getting out of my</p><p>bunk quickly. </p><p> “You and a red-headed feller,” he ex-</p><p>plained. </p><p> “Oh,” I answered, looking at the door of</p><p>the forecastle, and expecting it to frame my </p><p>antagonist. </p><p> “A real, proper fight, with a referee and</p><p>all,” went on Brennan, interpreting my look. </p><p>“Sit down, and I’ll tell ye.” </p><p> So we sat down on the wooden chest con-</p><p>taining his few belongings, and he talked </p><p>zestfully. </p><p> “He works for the keeper of a public</p><p>house just a bit off Paradise Street, at </p><p>swabbing floors and washing glasses, and the</p><p>like. A bit unhealthy he looks, but, oh, </p><p>the ugly face of him. The ugly face and the </p><p>red head of him—fighting signs, me boy. </p><p>You’ve a lot of training to do, with me for </p><p>your trainer. I’ve bet ten shillings on ye, </p><p>and the spectators will make up a ‘purse’, as </p><p>it’s called, of three or four bob, for the </p><p>winner. A hard, ugly face he lias—but I’ll </p><p>have ye in condition.” </p><p> “When is it to be?” I asked.</p><p> “This very night,” replied Brennan.</p><p> To his racial peculiarities Brennan added</p><p>a topsey-turvy fasliion of doing things that </p><p>was all his own, but he was too much my </p><p>ideal sailor for me to utter criticism. Yet I </p><p>may have ventured a suggestion concerning </p><p>my condition, and the lack of any need of </p><p>even the startlingly intensive “training” he </p><p>planned for me. But he was decided. </p><p> Fights he had known in plenty, but never</p><p>such a fight as this. Usually he had been a </p><p>principal, a more than willing combatant; </p><p>Maze of Memory </p><p>61 </p><p>but now he was an organizer, a director, a </p><p>trainer, a second, a man of functions. And </p><p>this was no common fight—no mere differ- </p><p>ence of opinion followed by a blow and a </p><p>struggle among cuspidors and men’s feet </p><p>on a barroom floor. </p><p> No, this was to be a well-conducted con-</p><p>test, with—had he not told me—a watch for </p><p>the keeper of time, a referee, certain wagers </p><p>and a purse for the winner. And was not </p><p>training the invariable preliminary to all </p><p>such deliberate entertainments? Was, </p><p>then, a small matter like shortness of time </p><p>to be allowed to upset a well-established </p><p>custom? Would we let the keeper of the </p><p>public house, the referee and all the other </p><p>patrons of sport think us ignorant? </p><p> Brennan was very serious. And there</p><p>was the other side of it. Did he not want </p><p>to do the best for me? And how could I </p><p>fight my best if I were not trained? I was </p><p>not sure myself, and my vague notions </p><p>respecting time were dissipated by his </p><p>earnestness. Only, there did seem to be </p><p>something wrong about training for a fight </p><p>a few hours away. But who was I to argue, </p><p>and hurt his feelings? Besides, if it hadn’t </p><p>been for him there wouldn’t have been any </p><p>fight. And no fight meant no purse of three </p><p>or four shillings. </p><p> Three or four shillings would buy a lot of</p><p>second-hand books. And Brennan might </p><p>be right, after all. Of course I was big and </p><p>strong, and had taught myself to read al- </p><p>most all the words in my precious books, </p><p>but—I was only a bit over fifteen, and </p><p>Brennan was a man. He must know best. </p><p>Train I would. And we had the ship to </p><p>ourselves, for the officers and crew were </p><p>ashore. </p><p> I felt that Brennan would have liked to</p><p>have an audience, but there was only the old </p><p>night-watchman, puffing a contemplative </p><p>pipe over the galley door, and watching our </p><p>performance with a face expressive of the </p><p>utmost approval. </p><p> The shadows gathered as I trained—</p><p>around the deck as fast as I could run, and </p><p>up and down the rigging almost as rapidly </p><p>—until the few lanterns that flickered about</p><p>the dock told that the night of adventure </p><p>was upon us. The day-time voice of the </p><p>city had hushed to a soothing undertone, </p><p>the smoke of the many chimneys was drift- </p><p>ing out to sea in fantastic shapes which it </p><p>would never again assume, and I, utterly </p><p>exhausted, was fed with mastodonic zeal, </p><p>and played with advice that I regarded as </p><p>cunning beyond price. </p><p> Then, hardly able to move, I was assisted</p><p>to my bunk, where I at once fell asleep. </p><p> Shades of an ultra-perfect digestion, and</p><p>an imagination as little likely to trouble as a </p><p>faitliful dog to bite! An hour later I was </p><p>awakened, and I awoke reluctantly—so </p><p>tired and sleepy that even the lure of dis- </p><p>figuring another human had no attraction </p><p>for me. And with Brennan in the smelly, </p><p>dimly lit forecastle was the night-watchman, </p><p>shrilling unheeded reminiscences in the </p><p>cracked treble of age about the gory battles </p><p>in which he himself had had a hand. </p><p> An examination into my physical condi-</p><p>tion followed, the result of which afforded </p><p>entire satisfaction to both my trainer and </p><p>his ancient admirer. Often, in the light of </p><p>the knowledge of further years, did I muse </p><p>upon the method of that examination, find- </p><p>ing a fascination in its uniqueness—as if, </p><p>testing the fitness of a horse about to run a </p><p>race, the color of its tail was the crucial </p><p>consideration. Yet I was genuinely glad </p><p>that Brennan found no fault in me, and that </p><p>the night-watchman’s toothless comments </p><p>rose to the shrill exclamation that he </p><p>wouldn’t mind betting a shilling on me </p><p>himself, that he wouldn’t. </p><p> So what wonder if I took on new dignity</p><p>as I dressed to go ashore—a dignity that a </p><p>chill drizzle, pattering in a melancholy way </p><p>into the water of the dock, and dripping dis- </p><p>mally off everything else, in no wise ruffled </p><p>or upset. The gaunt masts and rigging of </p><p>many ships looked an impartial understand- </p><p>ing out of their own stressful fives, the </p><p>watchman waved his smoky lantern, and I </p><p>set out upon my crusade with my squire </p><p>carrying a pair of swimming trunks—the </p><p>armor in which I was to fight. </p><p> And, indeed, I felt something of knight-</p><p>hood in my attitude toward the affair, spite </p><p>of the victor’s wreath being a matter of</p><p>three or four shillings: for was I not content </p><p>to fight without question, out of sheer loy- </p><p>alty to my rather erratic friend, who had </p><p>shown his faith in me by what to him was a </p><p>large wager? Could I imagine keener joy </p><p>than that coming from his pat on the back </p><p>of gratitude when he pocketed the money I </p><p>had won for him? </p><p> And the prospect of the fight itself was no</p><p>mean delight, and every step of our muddy </p><p>progress brought its thrill of anticipation. </p><p>Little fun had life offered me—no school, no </p><p>62 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>playmates, never a “show” or a “party”— </p><p>what wonder, then, that I became as happy </p><p>and excited at the thought of what was </p><p>before me as a luckier child would have been </p><p>on the way to a circus. </p><p> But Brennan did not guess my state of</p><p>mind. Perhaps I seemed thoughtful, for I </p><p>saw him glancing at me furtively whenever </p><p>we passed under a street lamp, and he began </p><p>to regale me with funny stories, told with a </p><p>nervous haste that betrayed his fear of my </p><p>mental condition—something which even </p><p>his system of training could not take care </p><p>of—the while he pushed his way through </p><p>the crowds with an eye to my protection </p><p>from the jostling drunkenness of both sexes. </p><p> His solicitude pleased and flattered me.</p><p>Indeed, I strutted, swelling slightly at my </p><p>unusual importance—for I had no memory </p><p>of ever having been of greater consequence </p><p>than a fathom of rope or a pot of paint. </p><p>A FEW yards past the grotesquely </p><p>abominable “Museum of Anat- </p><p>omy,” we turned down a dingy side- </p><p>street that had no lamps of its own, and into </p><p>which the lights of the main thoroughfare </p><p>hardly penetrated. It was a very narrow </p><p>place, uneven cobblestones under foot, and </p><p>no sidewalk. </p><p> Two gin-sodden women veritably flung</p><p>themselves at us, hiccuping, “Hello, </p><p>dearie,” like two cuckoo clocks. They </p><p>clawed at us as they swayed, and Brennan </p><p>grabbed my hand and hurried me along, the </p><p>women laughing jarringly after us. Crea- </p><p>tures of a bat-like repulsiveness brushed </p><p>past us, others leaned against the walls with </p><p>a lack of movement that was mummy-like, </p><p>their baleful eyes watching with the inhu- </p><p>manity of devilfish. </p><p> Brennan muttered an explanation which</p><p>I did not catch, and presently we reached a </p><p>wooden door which he pushed open to ad- </p><p>mit us to the back yard of the public house; </p><p>a place littered with empty casks, bottles, </p><p>straw and packing-cases, through which </p><p>raffle we made our way to the door of the </p><p>cellar, where my friend paused and put a </p><p>hand on my shoulder. He loomed up wetly </p><p>in the gloom, and his voice trembled</p><p>slightly, as if he were cold. </p><p> “Ye ain’t afraid, are ye, Barney?” he</p><p>asked. </p><p> “Of course not,” I answered, not quite</p><p>truthfully, for the latter part of the walk </p><p>had made me nervous. </p><p> “It’s the quick way of me to settle</p><p>things between two drinks, me boy, with- </p><p>out so much as your leave. But ye don’t </p><p>mind, do ye?” </p><p> “Of course not,” I repeated, shaking the</p><p>rain from my cap. </p><p> “And ye don’t feel—ye feel all right?”</p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “Then,” with a rather feeble laugh, “let’s</p><p>go in out of the wet.” </p><p> He knocked on the door, but nobody</p><p>answered. So he knocked again, more </p><p>loudly. And then we heard footsteps, and </p><p>the drawing of bolts, and the door opened </p><p>widely enough for a head to protrude and </p><p>break the uncanny secrecy of the perform- </p><p>ance by asking what we wanted. </p><p> “It’s us,” whispered Brennan.</p><p> A gust of wind blew a spluttering of rain,</p><p>and the head swore. </p><p> “And who in-is ‘us’?”</p><p> “Me and the boy for the fight,” explained</p><p>my companion. </p><p> “Oh,” said the head, withdrawing itself</p><p>to open the door. “Why didn’t you say </p><p>that at first? Come in.” </p><p> We entered what felt like a narrow pass-</p><p>age, and the owner of the place—for the man </p><p>who had opened the door was this impor- </p><p>tant person—fumblingly replaced hi6 bolts </p><p>and bars, panting obesely as he did so. It </p><p>was as dark as a tomb, and smelt horribly. </p><p>I shivered for many reasons, and was </p><p>cheered but little when the saloon-keeper lit </p><p>a piece of candle which he produced from </p><p>somewhere about his person after a series of </p><p>grunts—each grunt indicating a different </p><p>place of search. </p><p> I looked at him apprehensively in the</p><p>little light. He can be simply described </p><p>as a selfish mass of fat, impregnated with </p><p>villainy. He started to paw me with a </p><p>beastly hand, but I shuddered away from </p><p>him. </p><p> “Scared, eh?” he sneered.</p><p> I did not answer, so he turned to Bren-</p><p>nan, who stood regarding the brute with </p><p>that species of awe which partially par- </p><p>alyzes. The bird shows it when the cat </p><p>approaches, certain animals bow before the </p><p>snake because of it, and the old-time sailor </p><p>always manifested it when in the presence </p><p>of the crimp or saloon-keeper, both of whom </p><p>made their living by robbing him. Bren- </p><p>nan answered servilely, and I felt shocked. </p><p> “You say he ain’t sixteen?” the saloon-</p><p>keeper grunted. </p><p>Maze of Memory </p><p>63 </p><p> “Just a bit over fifteen,” replied Brennan,</p><p>with a deprecating giggle. </p><p> “-,” exclaimed the other, “he’s ugly</p><p>enough for twenty.” </p><p> Brennan laughed loudly, and seemed de-</p><p>lighted that the other appreciated his </p><p>laughter. </p><p> “And where’s your boy?” he asked, show-</p><p>ing pride in the saloon-keeper’s toleration of </p><p>his tentative familiarity. </p><p> “Oh, I never lets him out till the fight is</p><p>ready to start. He’s that fierce that if he </p><p>saw your boy he’d jump at him and tear </p><p>him to bits. And then there wouldn’t be </p><p>no fight.” </p><p> Again Brennan laughed, his care for me</p><p>forgotten. He laughed until the fat man </p><p>hushed him with a reminder about the </p><p>police, who were very active at suppressing </p><p>these illegal fights—hence the cellar. Then </p><p>they turned and walked down the passage </p><p>together, and I trailed along behind, physi- </p><p>cally and spiritually sick, keeping back my </p><p>tears with a great effort. </p><p> The saloon-keeper opened another door,</p><p>and the place of battle flared before us, lit </p><p>with lanterns strung from the floor above </p><p>and along the walls. A small—far-too- </p><p>small—ring, without any padding, occu- </p><p>pied the center of the cellar, and crowded </p><p>around it upon a heterogeneous collection of </p><p>seats were about two dozen men, who were </p><p>varying the monotony of smoking by spit- </p><p>ting generously upon that part of the floor </p><p>where presently I would have to stand and </p><p>fight. </p><p> We were greeted by what the parlia-</p><p>mentary reports call “cheers and laughter,” </p><p>and I shrank under the unkindly curiosity </p><p>of the spectators, whose attention was un- </p><p>necessarily directed to my unhappy self by </p><p>the owner of the place— </p><p> “’Ere’s the fighter!” he announced.</p><p> Then he said something to Brennan which</p><p>I did not hear, and my “second” beckoned</p><p>me to follow him to a comer of the room, </p><p>where I shiveringly undressed and put on </p><p>the swimming-trunks, after wringing the </p><p>rain out of them as well as I could. Of </p><p>course I had no rubber shoes, only my </p><p>clumsy every-day affairs, but Brennan </p><p>did not appear to notice this need, or, </p><p>perhaps, he did not know that they were </p><p>needed. </p><p> Yet I tried to smile at him, finding no</p><p>hate in me, and—oh, well, we all revolve </p><p>within our limitations, the years have mel- </p><p>lowed the memories, and the seed of early </p><p>association has grown into a friendship that </p><p>finds nothing to forgive. </p><p> Then a burst of real cheering announced</p><p>the entrance of my antagonist, and I looked </p><p>over at him, startled and much afraid. </p><p>Brennan had said that he was ugly, and his </p><p>description was not unkind. The saloon- </p><p>keeper had said that I was ugly enough for </p><p>twenty. I do not flatter myself, but using </p><p>the same method of calculation the boy I </p><p>was about to fight must have been nearly a </p><p>thousand; and he was at least twenty </p><p>pounds heavier. </p><p> Then Brennan led me back to the ring,</p><p>leaving my one poor suit as a careless offer- </p><p>ing to any thief that unpleasant gathering </p><p>might contain, and I found myself sitting </p><p>on an up-ended box, waiting for the end of </p><p>the world and hoping it would’come quickly. </p><p>The main events of my unhappy little life </p><p>came before me, and I had not felt so miser- </p><p>able since somebody stole the barrel in </p><p>which for three weeks I had once made my </p><p>home. For Brennan was the one friend I </p><p>had known, the only human being from </p><p>whom I could remember receiving any sign </p><p>of affection, any sort of kindness; and now </p><p>he had denied me for the laughter of a </p><p>saloon-keeper. </p><p>AT THE opposite comer sat my </p><p>rugged opponent, attended by his </p><p>seconds—two young fellows like </p><p>himself, posturing with what they obviously </p><p>regarded as the correct amount of tough- </p><p>ness. The spectators were pridefully ad- </p><p>vertising their friendship for the boy I was </p><p>to fight with vociferous questions concern- </p><p>ing his health, and to these questions he re- </p><p>turned the properly condescending replies; </p><p>but after some minutes of this they became</p><p>silent, and I found myself the object of their </p><p>wordless appraisement. </p><p> I tried to look back at them all, not to</p><p>show my courage, but with the vague, vain </p><p>hope of finding just one spark of pity, which </p><p>perhaps might lead them to “let me off”— </p><p>my body shaking with the mixed emotions </p><p>of a schoolboy about to be publicly </p><p>thrashed, and a felon waiting to be hanged. </p><p>But there was no pity, only regret that I did </p><p>not appear to be enough of a fighter to make </p><p>the affair interesting. </p><p> Then Brennan patted me timidly on the</p><p>back, and I felt that he was sorry for what </p><p>he had done; so I warmed to him, like a </p><p>64 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>hungry dog grateful to the one foot in a </p><p>crowd that does not kick him. </p><p> There was a slight disturbance at the</p><p>back of the crowd where some steps led to </p><p>the bar above, and the saloon-keeper ap- </p><p>peared, half-supporting a tall, thin man with </p><p>a huge mustache, who was evidently very </p><p>drunk, but whose dress, and an indefinable </p><p>something, proclaimed the “gentleman”—a </p><p>proclamation which the extreme deference </p><p>of the owner of the house corroborated. </p><p>With some difficulty this person was as- </p><p>sisted to a seat at the ringside, where he im- </p><p>mediately fell asleep. </p><p> “Captain Blake, the referee,” announced</p><p>the saloon-keeper, pulling out his watch </p><p>with the intimation that he would keep time </p><p>and look after the refereeing until the cap- </p><p>tain “felt better”; an arrangement to which </p><p>no one offered any objection—for after all </p><p>the “fight” was merely a show, to amuse the </p><p>customers of the place into buying more </p><p>drinks from the two frowsy potmen who </p><p>were kept busy navigating through the fog </p><p>of tobacco smoke. </p><p> Blake had probably offered to referee in a</p><p>moment of drunken»whimsy, and the saloon- </p><p>keeper, anxious to oblige a good customer, </p><p>had accepted the offer, regarding the ap- </p><p>pointment as a distinctly humorous for- </p><p>mality and using it as an added lure for Bren- </p><p>nan’s bet of ten shillings. For it is unlikely </p><p>that any of the spectators saw any necessity </p><p>for having a referee, and some of them saw </p><p>no need for a timekeeper—prefering to see </p><p>me beaten to a pulp without the minute </p><p>rests between punishments; but the major- </p><p>ity were of a more epicurean leaning, with </p><p>esthetic tastes demanding a more lingering </p><p>brutality. </p><p> Only Brennan found a glimmering of</p><p>doubt regarding the ethical status of this </p><p>dual official, and, doubtless feeling that his </p><p>cordial reception at the cellar door entitled </p><p>him to intimacy, he approached the saloon- </p><p>keeper smiling deprecatingly and timidly </p><p>whispered his objection, adding, as his rea- </p><p>son for speaking, a laughing but most un- </p><p>diplomatic reference to the ten shillings— </p><p>which, by the way, he had not only bet with </p><p>the saloon-keeper, but, also, with child-like</p><p>faith, had “put up” with him. </p><p> “Ho,” shouted the master of the cere-</p><p>monies loudly, “wot is it?” </p><p> In the dead silence that naturally followed</p><p>Brennan murmured something about the </p><p>double job being too much for one man. </p><p> “Speak up,” bellowed the saloon-keeper,</p><p>making great pretense of listening with a </p><p>hand cupped over an ear. “Speak up, I </p><p>carnt ’ear yer.” </p><p> But Brennan could not speak, up or</p><p>otherwise. Under the leering gaze of every </p><p>man in the place, except the sleeping Blake, </p><p>he flushed and shuffled his feet uneasily. </p><p>Then, with a pitiful effort to appear uncon- </p><p>cerned, he returned to his place behind me, </p><p>the saloon-keeper winking elaborately to the </p><p>crowd and raising an appreciative laugh. </p><p>For Brennan, so far as the owner of the place </p><p>was concerned, had long ceased to exist, and </p><p>the wager had changed hands when the </p><p>money had changed pockets. </p><p> It was always thus with Brennan’s type</p><p>ashore. In a ship’s forecastle, not only </p><p>would their positions have been reversed, </p><p>but the fat man would have been washing </p><p>Brennan’s place after meals—out of sight of </p><p>land, that is. Now my friend was as help- </p><p>less as a shanghaied sailor in the power of </p><p>the crimp, and he tried to hide his ignominy </p><p>by whispering plaintively to me: </p><p> “The referee, me boy, is a real gentleman</p><p>—he’ll see ye get fair play. Once he was an </p><p>officer in the army—just a bit of a habit he </p><p>had of cheating at cards was what got him </p><p>put out. So-” </p><p> But his doubtful testimonial was inter-</p><p>rupted by the saloon-keeper, who called </p><p>“Time,” and waved his hand expressively. </p><p>Then I saw my opponent dancing toward me </p><p>in fighting attitude—I forgot to mention </p><p>that it was a “bare fist” fight—and all that </p><p>I knew of right and wrong bade me get up </p><p>and meet him. But I was unable to move. </p><p>I sat helpless, not so much from fear—al- </p><p>though fear was but half-suppressed—as </p><p>from a strange pity that suddenly grew into </p><p>a most extraordinary fondness for every one </p><p>in that cellar, the result of the emotional </p><p>storm I had been through. I craved affec- </p><p>tion, not contest.</p><p> And my opponent was coming nearer—</p><p>he had almost reached the center of the ring </p><p>—but still I could not move. My thoughts </p><p>were racing past my ego, like hurricane-torn </p><p>clouds driving across the face of the moon. </p><p>The dreams of my very earliest years </p><p>whirled up from the dark horizon of forget- </p><p>fulness, and I wondered again why I had </p><p>been put into a world for which I had no </p><p>desire. I forgot, became oblivious to my </p><p>surroundings. </p><p> The fact of another human’s intention to</p><p>Maze of Memory </p><p>65 </p><p>“beat me up” became as relatively unim- </p><p>portant as it was absolutely so. The hoarse </p><p>roaring of the spectators was the wind in </p><p>the rigging, and it was soothing. I was </p><p>very sleepy, and I would go to sleep. Yes, </p><p>I would sleep, and perhaps I would not be </p><p>obliged to wake up any more. </p><p> But there was a discordant note in the</p><p>wind, and because of that discord I could </p><p>not sleep. I tried to ignore it, but it per- </p><p>sisted with devilish insistency. And then </p><p>I made out that it was Brennan’s voice </p><p>howling, and patting my back as he howled: </p><p> “Up at him, Barney, and scatter every</p><p>feature of his face.” </p><p> At that I jumped to my feet, and made</p><p>for my opponent, who had just reached the </p><p>center of the small ring. I had no wish to </p><p>fight, and I was still a bit dazed, and I </p><p>looked at the red-headed boy with the for- </p><p>lorn friendliness of a stray puppy. He </p><p>laughed at me, dropping his hands in- </p><p>sultingly; whereupon the saloon-keeper, who </p><p>was still in the ring, also laughed, and the </p><p>jovial spectators added their hilarity to the </p><p>general mirth. Now, even a dog resents </p><p>being laughed at. </p><p> A cold anger stiffened my spine, cleared</p><p>my tired brain and added strength to my </p><p>ijody; an ancient ancestor-lent me his stone- </p><p>age ferocity, the cruelty of those who had </p><p>long been dust stirred my Ijlood, and a cu- </p><p>riously pleasant determination to smash the </p><p>ugly face of my antagonist became the sole </p><p>reason of existence. He leaned toward me </p><p>tauntingly, his hands by his sides, and as his </p><p>vile breath puffed into my face I jabbed him </p><p>viciously on the nose—the sudden spurt of </p><p>blood cheering me more than anything I </p><p>had ever seen. He hit back, and his blow </p><p>landed somewhere, but I felt no pain. So, </p><p>we stood, toe to toe, slugging at each other. </p><p>U I I MUST imagine that the specta- </p><p>prg? tors were surprised, and that the </p><p>saloon-keeper nearly dropped his </p><p>watch in astonishment, for I was too busy </p><p>to notice them; but the pained grunts of my </p><p>opponent were not imaginary, nor was the </p><p>change that underwent his expression—not </p><p>only that of blood and bruises, but the</p><p>change from the grinning leer of confidence </p><p>to the dawning fear of possible defeat. </p><p> He stepped back, and I followed; then he</p><p>desperately drove at me until he bore me by </p><p>sheer weight to my corner, getting home a </p><p>terrific blow on my left eye which almost </p><p>blinded me; then for some time we struggled </p><p>in a clinch, the referee making no attempt </p><p>to separate us, because I was at a disad- </p><p>vantage owing to my being th’e lighter. </p><p> But, in spite of Brennan’s training, I was</p><p>in the better condition by far. Even with </p><p>his extra weight, my opponent tired of the </p><p>wrestling before I did, and at last he </p><p>loosened his hold on me and stepped back, </p><p>dropping his guard as he did so. Seeing my </p><p>opportunity, I drove my fist into that part </p><p>of his body where ribs cease to be ribs— </p><p>where flesh is weak, and had my full </p><p>strength been behind it, that blow would </p><p>have ended the fight, but, as I hit him, his </p><p>fist hit my biceps, and the power of my </p><p>punch was lessened. </p><p> Nevertheless, it looked as if he would col-</p><p>lapse. His knees sagged inward, his head </p><p>dropped forward, and so sure was I that all </p><p>was over that I stepped back without the </p><p>finishing blow I could have so easily given. </p><p>Then he pluckily straightened, and began </p><p>to retreat. Too late, I followed excitedly, </p><p>hitting at him with far more energy than </p><p>skill, making most remarkable swings at his </p><p>head, more often than not missing that </p><p>ugly aim by a foot, and forgetting all about </p><p>the vulnerable portion of his anatomy I had </p><p>recently disturbed. </p><p> Why hadn’t I finished him when I had</p><p>the chance? Why had I held back—wasn’t </p><p>I there to beat him up? Was I going to let </p><p>him win? And so on—I prodded myself </p><p>into a sort of desperation, forgetting what </p><p>little boxing I knew, but utterly changed </p><p>from the scared child who had come into </p><p>that cellar. Twice I bumped into the </p><p>saloon-keeper, who had cast aside the dig- </p><p>nities of timekeeper and referee, and who </p><p>was exhorting his boy with the zeal of both </p><p>backer and second—the boy responding by </p><p>swinging at me as wildly as-I swung at him, </p><p>and making about as many hits. </p><p> It was a frantic scene, with the spectators</p><p>on their feet, yelling advice and criticism,</p><p>dropping pipes and upsetting beer mugs, </p><p>hands waving, fists pounding palms. </p><p> Sometimes I got a glimpse of their faces,</p><p>gibbering like strangely pale baboons at the </p><p>bars of a cage, with the uncertain fog of </p><p>smoke billowing fantastically. Occasion- </p><p>ally I slipped, and occasionally the other </p><p>boy slipped, but a curious chivalry grew be- </p><p>tween us, so that neither hit when the other </p><p>was on his knees. </p><p> But I could see that the saloon-keeper</p><p>66 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>could hardly keep from hitting at me him- </p><p>self, and knew that at the first chance he </p><p>would do something foul to defeat me. </p><p>And here I must give credit to my antag- </p><p>onist; for once when his boss told him, com- </p><p>manded him, to hit me when I was down, he </p><p>found something in his soul which told that </p><p>obese brute to “go to-1” </p><p> The noise increased, and wilder became</p><p>our boxing. It seemed ages since I had </p><p>drawn a satisfactory breath, and my </p><p>throbbing heart was reaching up into my </p><p>throat. The lights swayed uncertainly, </p><p>and my opponent’s ghastly, bloody face </p><p>was as difficult to hit as that of the chief </p><p>devil in a nightmare. The arcs described </p><p>by our swinging fists became smaller, and </p><p>the fists themselves took on the weight of </p><p>cannon-balls. </p><p> Amid my physical distress I found myself</p><p>wondering if my face was as badly mauled </p><p>as that of the red-headed boy. Then, as if </p><p>both of the same mind, we fell into a clinch, </p><p>sobbing, not breathing, upon each other’s </p><p>shoulder; and through the tumult of voices </p><p>came that of the saloon-keeper— </p><p> “Time.”</p><p> Instead of three minutes, we must have</p><p>been fighting for ten; and whether he </p><p>stopped us because we could fight no longer, </p><p>or because he was afraid the noise would </p><p>bring the police, is something I have never </p><p>decided. With uncertain steps, I stag- </p><p>gered in the general direction of Brennan, </p><p>but instead of taking the box he hastily </p><p>pushed forward for me to sit upon I lay </p><p>down upon that indescribably dirty stone </p><p>floor, finding it as delicious a haven as ever </p><p>offered by a feather bed. </p><p> And my unexpected success had won me</p><p>some adherents. Half-conscious, I knew </p><p>that a pillow of empty sacks was being put </p><p>under my buzzing head, that rough hands </p><p>were lifting my brusied body tenderly and </p><p>laying another sack between it and the </p><p>floor, and that Brennan was fanning me with </p><p>amateurish vigor and the tails of my shirt, </p><p>but I also knew that no power either in </p><p>heaven or in earth could get me in shape to </p><p>continue the fight at the end of the pre-</p><p>scribed interval of one minute. </p><p> I need not have concerned myself, for the</p><p>saloon-keeper had no intention of allowing </p><p>his duty as timekeeper to interfere with the </p><p>workings of his “natural affection” for his </p><p>protege. He was swearing horribly at the </p><p>unfortunate boy because I was as yet un- </p><p>licked, while the two seconds rubbed and </p><p>fanned him, but several minutes passed </p><p>without his showing any interest in his </p><p>watch, and I knew that the red-headed one </p><p>would be allowed to fully recover before the </p><p>next round. </p><p> But the spectators were impatient. They</p><p>wanted to see somebody beaten properly, </p><p>and the delay annoyed them. It was noth- </p><p>ing to them if the saloon-keeper’s boy was </p><p>licked. There were other saloon-keepers </p><p>with fighting boys, who sold as good beer </p><p>for the same price; and as my strength and </p><p>wind came back to me, until I felt almost as </p><p>well as I had done before the fight, I under- </p><p>stood what I had hitherto been ignorant of. </p><p> Competition was keen between the differ-</p><p>ent public houses of the district, and, price- </p><p>cutting having gone the limit, some sort of </p><p>attraction was required to get the business. </p><p>Hence these fighting boys. Every saloon- </p><p>keeper had one, and the red-headed boy had </p><p>proven the best of them all. Therefore, he </p><p>was a valuable asset, and his boss did a </p><p>bigger business than his rivals. </p><p> It was all very simple— had I looked to</p><p>have had a chance, we would have been told </p><p>at the cellar door that the fight was off; and </p><p>now that I was more than holding my own, </p><p>every dirty trick would be tried to defeat </p><p>me. The red-headed boy lacked my con- </p><p>dition, and the spectators were booing and </p><p>whistling, like the audience in the gallery of </p><p>a theater, for the show to continue. </p><p> “Time—call time,” yelled one large-</p><p>lunged individual at the ring side. </p><p> “’Taint quite time yet,” replied the</p><p>saloon-keeper placatingly, his pig-like eyes </p><p>looking in my direction with an illuminating </p><p>malevolence. </p><p> “Call time,” the other yelled back at him.</p><p>“Call-” </p><p> Then, suddenly the bibulous but some-</p><p>times benevolent god of the chances </p><p>prompted him, and he leaned over and </p><p>shook Captain Blake’s shoulder. </p><p> “’Ere, you’re the referee, ain’t yer? Make</p><p>’em fight!” and he laughed heartily, the </p><p>crowd laughing with him, and the saloon- </p><p>keeper readily grasping the opportunity for </p><p>further delay. </p><p> “Lor’, BUI, you’re the funny one,” he</p><p>wheezed. “You’U be the death of me yet.” </p><p> And the funny one, greatly encouraged,</p><p>again prodded the captain, who stirred un- </p><p>easUy and then opened liis eyes and looked </p><p>about him, evidently sober after his sleep. </p><p>Maze of Memory </p><p>67 </p><p>I WAS sitting up by now, ready to </p><p>go on, and the captain’s eyes rested </p><p>on me for a moment, and mine </p><p>dropped—that is, the one I could see out of </p><p>did—for I had never seen such wonderful </p><p>eyes; masterful eyes that men obey, and </p><p>when he looked around that motley assem- </p><p>bly it suddenly became quiet. </p><p> “What were you saying?” he asked, his</p><p>cool, cultured voice rendered the more no- </p><p>ticeable by the environment. </p><p> “I were asking you to make ’em fight,</p><p>sir,” said Bill, very politely. “You’re the </p><p>referee, sir.” </p><p> “Oh, yes—of course—forgot about it,”</p><p>drawled Blake, getting to his feet leisurely </p><p>and adjusting a monocle. “I thank you for </p><p>reminding me.” </p><p> “Yes, sir—thank you, sir,” replied the</p><p>subdued Bill. </p><p> Of course this happened in the late</p><p>eighties, when the impalpable mantle of </p><p>caste brought a homage to its wearer that is </p><p>less in evidence in the England of today; </p><p>yet Blake was a man to command respect </p><p>anywhere, when he was sober, and the easy </p><p>way he obtained obedience in that cellar was </p><p>not surprising—the unusual, with its more </p><p>than a hint of life-tragedy, lay in his being </p><p>there at all, in his non-association with his </p><p>kind, in his spending his time and income in </p><p>the private bar of the public house, seeking </p><p>the most holy grail of forgetfulness. </p><p> He looked at the ring with a frown of dis-</p><p>gust, and hailing one of the hurrying pot- </p><p>men, ordered him to bring a sack of the </p><p>sawdust used to sprinkle the floor of the bar- </p><p>room, and spread it on the floor of the ring. </p><p> “Men can not fight on that slippery</p><p>dirt,” he said. “And, besides, I’m going to </p><p>referee inside, American fashion.” </p><p> He wiped his hands fastidiously, and fas-</p><p>cinated me by tucking his handkerchief up </p><p>his sleeve, and, the potman having spread </p><p>the sawdust—the spectators watching with </p><p>admiring silence—he stepped into the ring. </p><p> “Well, Briggs,” he asked, “what’s the</p><p>delay?” </p><p> “’T’aint quite time yet, sir,” answered</p><p>the saloon-keeper. </p><p> “Yes, it is,” yelled the crowd. “Make</p><p>’em fight, sir.” • </p><p> “ ‘The voice of the people,’ you know,</p><p>Briggs,” said the captain. “So, you’re </p><p>keeping time?” </p><p> “Yes, sir,” Briggs’ voice was full of some</p><p>emotion. </p><p> “All right—get out of the ring.”</p><p> “Sir?”</p><p> “Get out of the ring.”</p><p> “All right, sir,” obeying slowly. “It’s all</p><p>in your hands, sir.” </p><p> “Call time, then.”</p><p> Briggs obeyed, and again the red-headed</p><p>boy and myself stood toe to toe, slugging at </p><p>each other with more energy than skill. </p><p>Now, unless he expected to get me with a </p><p>lucky punch, I could see no reason for his </p><p>wasting his strength with this continued </p><p>swinging. It was obvious that I was in the </p><p>better condition, and that if he kept at it </p><p>at this rate he would tire out, and be at my </p><p>mercy. That was my job, then—to make </p><p>him waste his strength with these wild </p><p>swings, keep out of danger and wait for my </p><p>opportunity. It was very simple. </p><p> So, we whaled away at each other, Blake</p><p>watching us carefully and the spectators </p><p>yelling their appreciation. But this did not </p><p>last long. As I had expected, my opponent </p><p>began to back away from me, showing every </p><p>sign of weariness, while I was fairly com- </p><p>fortable. I followed him, still swinging and </p><p>occasionally getting home lightly. And </p><p>then he backed against the ropes, his head </p><p>lolling tiredly. I had him! </p><p> He wavered, his hands dropped, and I</p><p>steadied myself for the final blow. Next </p><p>moment came the realization that I was a </p><p>second or two too late; for the other boy </p><p>straightened up, and putting all his remain- </p><p>ing strength into the blow, beat me to the</p><p>punch—getting home on the point of my </p><p>chin—and I landed in a quivering heap on </p><p>the trampled sawdust. </p><p> But I was not out, and I felt no pain.</p><p>Only I was so angry at myself for falling </p><p>into so simple a trap that I could have cried. </p><p> Over me Captain Blake was counting, and</p><p>his was the only voice in the cellar, except </p><p>that of Brennan, who was putting up some </p><p>wonderful prayer to the numerous queer </p><p>deities of his acquaintance. </p><p> But I was puzzled. Why was the cap-</p><p>tain counting me out? Couldn’t he see that </p><p>I could get up as soon as I wanted to? Did </p><p>he think I was hurt? Why, I was all right. </p><p>I would just he there for a little while, and </p><p>rest up. </p><p> “Five—six.”</p><p> This was absurd. And everybody watch-</p><p>ing me, and so quiet, too. Of course, I knew </p><p>that a man was beaten when ten seconds </p><p>were counted over him, but that meant a </p><p>68 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>hurt man—I was not hurt—I could get up </p><p>if I wanted to. </p><p> “Seven.”</p><p> There he went again. One thing about</p><p>it, the seconds seemed to be long ones, like </p><p>those when one is half-asleep. But it was </p><p>all rot. Surely the captain knew that the </p><p>red-headed boy could’nt hit hard enough </p><p>to hurt me? </p><p> “Eight.”</p><p> “Barney, Barney—get up, get up!”</p><p> Oh, well, I thought drowsily, suppose I</p><p>must. How often had Brennan roused me </p><p>to go on deck, like this, when I wanted to </p><p>sleep. Awful nuisance. But, must get up. </p><p>I yawned. </p><p> “Nine.”</p><p> I don’t remember getting to my feet. I</p><p>felt the fist of my opponent swing past my </p><p>head without touching, and then the im- </p><p>petus of his blow carried him into me, and I </p><p>clung desperately. </p><p> “Break—break,” commanded Blake.</p><p> Still I hung on.</p><p> The captain tried to pry us apart.</p><p> “It’s time,” I shouted. “More than</p><p>three minutes.” </p><p> Blake pulled out his watch, and looked</p><p>sternly at the saloon-keeper, who wilted </p><p>under that look, and called “time.” I </p><p>stumbled into Brennan’s arms, and was </p><p>eased down upon the kindly sacks. </p><p> “So,” Blake was saying, “you let the</p><p>time pass. Want your boy to win, eh? </p><p>After this, I’ll keep time myself. A little </p><p>more nerve, Briggs, and you would have </p><p>succeeded—I hadn’t looked at my watch for </p><p>hours until just now.” </p><p> I really wasn’t much hurt, although I</p><p>heartily wished for more than one minute</p><p>rest; and when the captain, totally ignoring </p><p>the saloon-keeper, called “time,” I had no </p><p>trouble stopping the rushes of the red- </p><p>headed boy, and presently I felt that he was </p><p>far more tired than I was. </p><p> But now I was not swinging—contenting</p><p>myself with blocking, and waiting for a cer- </p><p>tain opening, and at last it came; the other </p><p>boy dropped his guard for a moment, and I </p><p>hit him again where ribs end, and he sank, </p><p>groaning, to the floor, apparently all in. It </p><p>happened so suddenly that it looked like a </p><p>fluke, and perhaps it was, but I was not </p><p>worried by that. I was too pleased to hear </p><p>the captain counting over somebody else to </p><p>care how that somebody came to be counted </p><p>over. </p><p>BUT that boy was plucky, and </p><p>when he struggled to his feet at the </p><p>count of nine, I felt sorry for him. </p><p>Only a few minutes before he thought he </p><p>had won, and my youthful health had </p><p>cheated him. Besides, his very existence </p><p>depended upon his winning, while to me the </p><p>fight was but an incident, an experience to </p><p>remember and talk about. He staggered </p><p>pathetically as he got up, and the specta- </p><p>tors held their breath, waiting for the finish. </p><p> I didn’t want to do it. I saw no reason</p><p>why I should hit the poor devil again. He </p><p>was a stranger to me, and, somehow, I </p><p>had grown to like him. Why take away his </p><p>living, then? And then I remembered </p><p>Brennan’s ten shillings, and the purse of </p><p>three or four bob, of which I had seen no </p><p>evidence. </p><p> Since I had entered that cellar, the</p><p>changes of years had passed over me. I had </p><p>come to understand that certain things </p><p>must be done, however much we may dis- </p><p>like doing them, and however much we </p><p>may wonder why the Absolute should allow </p><p>conditions which make it necessary we </p><p>should do them. </p><p> Now, it was necessary that I should re-</p><p>duce that red-headed boy to a condition </p><p>where he could fight no more. I put up my </p><p>hands. </p><p> A few feet away my opponent stood</p><p>swaying on sagging legs. I made a step </p><p>toward him, and then the saloon-keeper lost </p><p>control of himself and deliberately pushed</p><p>his foot into the ring and tripped me </p><p>heavily. </p><p> It was the rottenest trick I had ever seen,</p><p>and I was mad clear through. I forgot the </p><p>red-headed boy, turned ’round, hearing a </p><p>babble of voices, and hit the saloon-keeper </p><p>in the middle of his fat face. </p><p> That was the most comforting blow I ever</p><p>struck. But it had the most extraordinary </p><p>results. One of those causeless panics, </p><p>which occur in herds of humans and other </p><p>cattle, was the consequence; and it all hap- </p><p>pened so rapidly that to tell about it is </p><p>difficult. </p><p> The red-headed boy seems to have started</p><p>it. Whether he thought that my striking </p><p>his boss was a sort of sacrilege, or whether </p><p>it was his notion of the end of the earth, or </p><p>whether he knew that Mr. Briggs’ temper </p><p>for some hours would be a thing best </p><p>avoided, and, consequently, lost his head in </p><p>his haste to escape, I know not. Let it be </p><p>Maze of Memory </p><p>69 </p><p>simply told that he dived under the ropes, </p><p>with more activity than I thought he had </p><p>left, shouting at the top of his voice— </p><p> ‘ ‘Police—police—help—murder. ’ ’</p><p> He forgot to shout “fire,” but even with</p><p>that omission the cellar cleared with start- </p><p>ling rapidity. I seemed to hear the cap- </p><p>tain telling the saloon-keeper that he was a </p><p>dirty rotter, then came a noise like a ship </p><p>being dismasted in a cyclone—the disturb- </p><p>ance of the heterogeneous collection of </p><p>seats impeding a frantic audience, doubtless </p><p>—and then there was nobody there but the </p><p>captain, Brennan and myself. The crowd </p><p>had left nothing but its odor. </p><p> “Well,” drawled Blake, “what a rout—</p><p>what a bally routl” </p><p> “But what was the matter, sir?” asked</p><p>Brennan, somewhat agitated. </p><p> The captain shrugged his shoulders.</p><p> “You saw as much as I did. Mobs are</p><p>like that, and so, sometimes, are armies.” </p><p> I began to dress, feeling rather blue. If</p><p>the spectators had gone, where would my </p><p>purse of three or four shillings come from— </p><p>presuming that my opponent’s running </p><p>away implied my victory? I mentioned </p><p>this to Brennan, adding rather plaintively </p><p>that I would not be able to buy the books </p><p>I so badly needed. </p><p> “What?” broke in Blake. “Books—is it</p><p>books you want? Boys don’t, usually. </p><p>Tell me about it.” </p><p> Brennan explained with some enthusiasm,</p><p>somewhat proud of his ability as an or- </p><p>ganizer, but dubious concerning his skill as a </p><p>collector. Would the captain be so kind as </p><p>to teH him how he was going to get his ten </p><p>shillings from Mr. Briggs? </p><p> “So,” answered Blake, “this boy is not</p><p>your son?” </p><p> “No, sir,” replied Brennan, laughing,</p><p>“he’s a boy on our ship. His parents are </p><p>dead.”</p><p> “Yes, sir,” I amplified, “my father was a</p><p>captain in the army, like yourself. When I </p><p>was a year old, my mother and father were </p><p>killed in a carriage. Mother was driving, </p><p>and the horses ran away—over a cliff. I </p><p>lived with my aunt till I was ten, then I ran </p><p>away from her.” </p><p> “What is your name, and what was your</p><p>father’s regiment?” asked the captain rap- </p><p>idly, his voice shaking. </p><p> I told him, and he put his arm around me.</p><p>He was greatly agitated, and his whole body </p><p>trembled. For some minutes we stood like </p><p>this, silent, Blake staring into the shadowy </p><p>corner of the cellar. Then, suddenly, he </p><p>turned furiously upon Brennan. </p><p> “So,” he said, taking his arm from me,</p><p>and shaking his fist at Brennan. “So, you </p><p>subjected this boy, this son of a dead lady, </p><p>to this vile outrage, in order that you might </p><p>win ten shillings, did you?” </p><p> Brennan hadn’t looked at it in that light,</p><p>and he tried to stammer some sort of an </p><p>explanation, but the captain cut him short. </p><p> “It’s in the mind of me to give you in</p><p>charge,” his Irish increasing with his anger. </p><p>“It’s six months with hard labor you’ve </p><p>earned.” </p><p> “I don’t think he meant any harm—and I</p><p>wanted to win the books,” I broke in.” </p><p> “Of course ye’d be loyal,” he said gently.</p><p>“But ye don’t understand.” He smiled at </p><p>me, then turned again to Brennan. “Get </p><p>out of here, and don’t let me see your face </p><p>again. You, and your dirty ten shillings. </p><p>Go, now.” And Brennan went, looking </p><p>very shamefaced. </p><p> 1 was very much mystified, and not a little</p><p>embarrassed and uncomfortable, as I went </p><p>on with my dressing with the captain watch- </p><p>ing me—his hard, masterful eyes filled with </p><p>a yearning that was painful. </p><p> “Ye may think it’s calling the kettle</p><p>black, I am?” he said suddenly. </p><p> I had no answer to this, for my life had</p><p>told me to consider drunkenness from its</p><p>funny side. Besides, in those days it was </p><p>too fashionable to be frowned upon as it is </p><p>today. </p><p> “But,” he continued with apparent irrel-</p><p>evance, “don’t ye believe them when they </p><p>tell you that it’s the bad women that send </p><p>men to hell. It’s losing a good one that </p><p>does that.” </p><p> There was a noise of argument in the bar</p><p>overhead. </p><p> “I think your friend is trying to get his</p><p>ten shillings,” said Captain Blake. “He </p><p>must want it mighty bad. By the way, </p><p>what do you want most in all the world?” </p><p>“Enough to eat, a place to live in away </p><p>from ships, and all the books I can read, </p><p>sir,” I answered promptly. </p><p> “Well, now,” said the captain, “I tliink</p><p>that can be arranged.” </p><p> And it was.</p><p>Author of “The Madness oj Quill McHenry," “The Rag and the Roaring Giant," etc. </p><p>TINY” MARKENSON was </p><p>called Tiny because he was a </p><p>mere slip of a fellow, weighing </p><p>but one hundred and ninety </p><p>pounds, and was set up like a draft horse. </p><p>He also had brains and knew how to use </p><p>them. Perhaps that is why the Island </p><p>Trading Corporation made him its resident </p><p>agent and instructed him to take up head- </p><p>quarters on Tamana Island and look out </p><p>for its thousands of square miles of planta- </p><p>tions on Tamana and a hundred other </p><p>islands lying about in the Pacific. </p><p> While life among the natives of Poly-</p><p>nesia is not exactly the sort of life a white </p><p>man stlects above all things, Markenson </p><p>managed to make out. At frequent inter- </p><p>vals excitement and adventure intervened </p><p>to wipe out monotony and the drudge of </p><p>routine work among the islands. Hence </p><p>this story. As it opens, Markenson is </p><p>seated in a deck chair on the awning-shaded </p><p>quarterdeck of the auxiliary schooner Jane </p><p>Nichols at anchor in Tamana harbor, idly </p><p>gazing forward. </p><p> Presently Doctor Craig Jarvis, an ex-</p><p>citable little man, came up the cabin hatch </p><p>and threw himself wearily into the loam- </p><p>mock stretched from the mizzenmast to </p><p>the skylight. Both men were as nearly </p><p>naked as civilized men dare to be and still </p><p>retain a measure of their modesty; but the </p><p>heat waves that danced and quivered along </p><p>the unshaded portions of the deck seemed </p><p>to make a mockery of any attempts to be </p><p>comfortable. As the doctor sat down in </p><p>the hammock Markenson tamed on him </p><p>with questioning eyes. </p><p> “What’s the trouble?” he inquired when</p><p>the other advanced no information after a </p><p>reasonable lapse of time. </p><p> Jarvis fitted his big, shell-rimmed glasses</p><p>to the bridge of his nose with a spasmodic </p><p>twist of his slender fingers. </p><p> “What’s the trouble with anybody who’s</p><p>fool enough to parade around in a billion </p><p>horse-power sun without a hat?” he replied </p><p>petulantly. “He’s loony, that’s the trou- </p><p>ble!” </p><p> “Serious?”</p><p> “I tell you he’s crazy!” snapped back the</p><p>other. </p><p> Markenson muttered a disgruntled</p><p>“Humph!” and fell to watching the rising </p><p>and falling brown backs of the Kanakas </p><p>as they beat the rust from a length of chain </p><p>cable on the forecastle. For two solid </p><p>hours the two men sat on in silence and the </p><p>sun went down behind the rim of the sea </p><p>and the Kanaka crew knocked off with the </p><p>chain, then Markenson removed his bulky </p><p>frame from the chair in which he sat and </p><p>moved toward the low rail. At the rail he </p><p>stopped and looked back. </p><p> “I’ll be at the bungalow if you need me,”</p><p>he said shortly. </p><p> Receiving a curt nod in return he stepped</p><p>overside into the boat moored there and </p><p>pulled toward the beach a quarter of a mile </p><p>away. Jarvis followed the boat with dreamy </p><p>eyes until it reached the beach and its </p><p>occupant disembarked and disappeared in </p><p>70 </p><p>The Madness of Johnny Dyer </p><p>7i </p><p>a grove of date palms that but half con- </p><p>cealed a spacious bungalow, then he too </p><p>rose to his feet and went below to see how </p><p>his patient was coming along. </p><p> Neither of the sane members of the</p><p>“Trinity,” as the Islands knew the three </p><p>friends, could remember when one of its </p><p>number had been laid low by the hand of </p><p>the sun; yet there was Johnny Dyer, me- </p><p>chanical engineer for the corporation, lying </p><p>in a bunk in the cabin of the Jane Nichols, </p><p>talking as no sane man talks as a concrete </p><p>proof that calamity plays no favorites. </p><p> He rambled on and on through the realms</p><p>of fantasy, calling up stray bits of life that </p><p>began at the end and ended at the begin- </p><p>ning, which made it all very hard to under- </p><p>stand. But no matter how far distant his </p><p>hallucinations led him he always returned </p><p>to the person whom he called “Edith, dar- </p><p>ling.” He muttered over and over, seem- </p><p>ingly to the girl, that it was a “blasted </p><p>he!” Jarvis, who had paused beside the </p><p>bunk where the sick man lay tossing, heard </p><p>and shook his head sadly. He picked up a </p><p>small, silver-framed photo of a girl he found </p><p>on Dyer’s pillow and gazed at it long and </p><p>intently, his gaze at intervals wandering </p><p>to Dyer’s flushed face. </p><p> Then he replaced the photo on the pil-</p><p>low and swore softly to himself. Jarvis </p><p>had never been in love, but he knew some </p><p>things not in medical books. It is better </p><p>to give a man latitude in which to express </p><p>his delirium audibly than to give him medi- </p><p>cine to make him sleep and choke him with </p><p>phantasmagoria, so Jarvis betook himself </p><p>to his own bunk across the passageway and </p><p>left his patient to fight it out. </p><p> Some time in the very early morning of</p><p>the next day, before the veil-like mist had </p><p>blown out to sea, Markenson was awakened </p><p>from a fitful sleep at the bungalow by a </p><p>tumultuous knocking on the veranda. </p><p> “What’s the row?” he yelled.</p><p> “Is Johnny here, Tiny?” came a voice</p><p>which the agent instantly recognized as </p><p>belonging to his doctor friend. </p><p> An anxious note in the voice caused him</p><p>to hop hastily from his bunk. </p><p> “What about Johnny?” he inquired, ap-</p><p>pearing on the veranda where stood Jarvis </p><p>clad in very little of nothing except his </p><p>glasses with their retaining ribbon stream- </p><p>ing in a festoon about their wearer’s neck. </p><p> Markenson noted that his caller was</p><p>white-faced. </p><p> “Well, what about Johnny?” he de-</p><p>manded a second time when the doctor </p><p>seemed to be lost in peering into the dark- </p><p>ness where the Jane Nichols’ riding light </p><p>glimmered like a star on the water. • </p><p> “He’s gone!” the doctor burst out finally.</p><p>“What?” A scared look flashed into </p><p>Markenson’s eyes. “When did you miss </p><p>him?” </p><p> “About an hour ago.”</p><p> “You searched the schooner carefully?”</p><p>“All over—everybody searched,” replied </p><p>the little doctor brokeply. </p><p> “How about the boats?”</p><p> “All there except the one you came ashore</p><p>in. I wonder if-” </p><p> Jarvis stopped abruptly and threw a</p><p>frightened glance down toward the surf </p><p>breaking softly on the beach not a hundred </p><p>feet away. </p><p> “My God! Not that!” gasped the agent.</p><p>“Too many sharks for swimming!” </p><p> “That’s the only way to explain—” began</p><p>Jarvis when a warning glance stopped him </p><p>—“Blake is standing by for orders—sug- </p><p>gests that we circle the island,” he finished. </p><p>Markenson shook his head hopelessly. </p><p>“A waste of time,” he said. “If he’s not </p><p>aboard and none of the boats are missing </p><p>we’ve got to take it for granted that—the </p><p>other, you know. The white-bellied dev- </p><p>ils!” </p><p> He, too, threw a glance toward the water,</p><p>but it was more a glance of hatred than of </p><p>fear. </p><p> “Get back to the schooner and have</p><p>Blake fix rations for twenty men for ten </p><p>days. You and Frankie bring the stuff </p><p>ashore; I’ll want both of you to go in one </p><p>of the parties. Bring automatics for you </p><p>and me. And, Jarvis,” he called as the </p><p>other man turned away, “better bring along </p><p>a coil of two-inch manila and a grapnel; </p><p>we may have work of that sort. Now </p><p>hustle!” </p><p> Jarvis hastened back to the beach where</p><p>he had left his-boat and pulled off to the </p><p>schooner, while Markenson hastily dressed </p><p>and rushed off to the copra sheds to rout </p><p>out the natives. By dawn Jarvis and </p><p>Frankie Blue, Kanaka boatswain of the </p><p>schooner, had landed at the bungalow with </p><p>the provisions and other gear for an ex- </p><p>tended trip. After a hasty breakfast two </p><p>parties immediately set out for the interior </p><p>of the island; one party of ten men under </p><p>Markenson heading northeast, the other </p><p>72 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>party of twelve men under Jarvis heading </p><p>northwest, both gradually shaping their </p><p>course toward Big Rock, which stood near </p><p>the center of the island. </p><p>ENCOUNTERING interminable </p><p>toil and hardship in the reeking </p><p>jungles, the two parties met three </p><p>days later under the towering cliffs of Big </p><p>Rock. Big Rock got its name from the </p><p>fact that it was indeed no less than a mam- </p><p>moth rock, circular in shape, about two </p><p>miles in diameter, and circumscribed on all </p><p>sides by sheer cliffs from one to two hun- </p><p>dred feet high. </p><p> “No luck,” confessed Jarvis weakly when</p><p>the parties met. </p><p> “And I am positive nothing escaped us</p><p>but our luck was no better,” said Marken- </p><p>son, sitting down in dejection. “But he’s </p><p>somewhere on the island, of that I’m sure,” </p><p>he declared, trying to keep his thoughts </p><p>from dwelling on the monsters darting about </p><p>in Tamana harbor. </p><p> “Well, where?” demanded the doctor im-</p><p>patiently. </p><p> “I don’t know,” was the forlorn reply.</p><p>“We’ve got to keep going until we find him.” </p><p>Failure in their quest made Markenson </p><p>peevish, for he added— </p><p> “Are you sure you didn’t skip anything?”</p><p> “Are you?” was the pointed retort.</p><p> “Well, somebody has been neglectful.”</p><p>The little doctor looked at his companion </p><p>narrowly and somewhat resentfully. </p><p> “Well, it’s not me!” he snapped.</p><p> Just what proportions this embryo argu-</p><p>ment might have reached is a matter for </p><p>conjecture, but at that moment kind Provi- </p><p>dence stepped in and saved the day. Provi- </p><p>dence was represented in the person of one </p><p>of the natives who suddenly gave a shout </p><p>and pointed toward a tongue of rock jut- </p><p>ting out from the top of the cliff. </p><p> The others looked and saw a naked man</p><p>standing on the tongue of rock, his hands</p><p>on his hips, looking down at them with </p><p>great concern. They could see his features </p><p>distinctly. It was the missing Dyer. When </p><p>he saw that he was discovered he emitted </p><p>a whoop and swung his arm in a wide arc, </p><p>and the next moment a heavy stone came </p><p>crashing down into their midst. </p><p> “You fool!” yelled Markenson, dodging</p><p>as the stone caromed against a boulder and </p><p>went bounding away, narrowly missing one </p><p>of the natives in its flight. </p><p> “Stop it!” supplemented the little doctor</p><p>noisily, and scooped up a stone and threw </p><p>it with all his strength at the man above. </p><p> It fell short by a good measure and called</p><p>forth a derisive, taunting yell from the man </p><p>on the cliff, who then disappeared beyond </p><p>the edge of the cliff and they saw him no </p><p>more. </p><p> Markenson turned to the natives, who</p><p>were standing nearby in a huddled, fright- </p><p>ened group, and engaged one of them in </p><p>conversation. He had not gone far in his </p><p>questioning when he saw that the man was </p><p>cowering under an abject fear; he trembled </p><p>visibly. Markenson shot a quick glance </p><p>at the other natives and saw tliat the same </p><p>was true of them; they appeared like dogs </p><p>afraid of a master’s whip. </p><p> The man to whom he was talking stut-</p><p>tered and halted in his speech and nothing </p><p>intelligible came from his lips. Finally, in </p><p>disgust, Markenson caught the fellow </p><p>roughly by the arm and ordered him to </p><p>divulge the secret he was apparently at </p><p>such great pains to keep. Despite his </p><p>threats, commands and entreaties, however, </p><p>the agent was forced to give it up. He </p><p>swore. </p><p> “He says there’s no way to get up there,”</p><p>he said savagely, turning to Jarvis. </p><p> “Ask the beggar how Johnny got up</p><p>there,” returned the little doctor dryly. “I </p><p>think he’s a liar!” </p><p> “So do I, and we’ll have to take it out</p><p>in thinking.” </p><p> The next several minutes Markenson</p><p>spent in scrutinizing the cliff before him. </p><p>Search as he would, however, his keen eyes</p><p>could discover no projection or depression </p><p>that might afford foot or liand hold. The </p><p>face of the cliff was as absolutely smooth </p><p>and flat as a wall of glass. Though he had </p><p>lived on Tamana Island a matter of three </p><p>years Markenson knew practically nothing </p><p>about Big Rock. From what he had been </p><p>able to gather from the native it was inac- </p><p>cessible. No one had ever been on top of </p><p>it; that is, no human. Dyer was a pioneer. </p><p> Yet Markenson was certain that he had</p><p>been lied to. Had he been more the brute </p><p>and less the man he would have whipped </p><p>the truth from a native’s tongue with a </p><p>rope’s end; being a man he swore and sat </p><p>down on a convenient boulder to think it </p><p>over, his keen eyes roving constantly. Then </p><p>at length he got up again and smiled to </p><p>himself. </p><p>The Madness of Johnny Dyer </p><p>73 </p><p> “But there is more than one way to kill</p><p>a cat, Doc,” he said, and at once occupied </p><p>himself with the rope and grapnel brought </p><p>from the schooner. </p><p> Jarvis carefully adjusted his glasses and</p><p>inspected the cliff at length and in detail, </p><p>then shook his head dubiously. </p><p> “It can’t be done, Tin}',” he declared</p><p>emphatically. “Now if you had a life- </p><p>saver’s gun you might shoot the grapnel up </p><p>there, but since you haven’t—well, it can’t </p><p>be done, that’s all.” </p><p> Again he shook his head.</p><p> “Which proves that your knowledge of</p><p>things is limited to anatomy,” replied the </p><p>other scornfully. </p><p> The little doctor muttered something</p><p>about “fools in their wisdom” and sat down. </p><p>With the assistance of Frankie Blue, Mark- </p><p>enson stretched the rope to its full length </p><p>along the ground, some three hundred feet, </p><p>and with his sheath knife cut off about </p><p>a hundred feet of the line. One end of the </p><p>longer line he fastened to the “eye” on the </p><p>shank of the grapnel, and one end of the </p><p>shorter line he fastened to one of the three </p><p>hooks of the grapnel. </p><p> He then turned his attention to a single</p><p>coconut palm that stood somewhat apart </p><p>from a clump of its fellows. This tree </p><p>seemed to have been produced by a nature </p><p>anticipating the needs of the Trinty, for </p><p>it lent itself very readily to the scheme the </p><p>big agent had in mind. It grew with a </p><p>slight inclination away from the cliff, its </p><p>base, which was about seventy-five feet </p><p>distant from.the base of the cliff, rooted </p><p>at the very edge of a steep incline. The </p><p>bole was smooth and supple, terminating </p><p>in a scant clump of foliage about fifty feet </p><p>from the ground. </p><p> With a satisfied nod Markenson ordered</p><p>one of the Kanakas to shinny up the tree </p><p>with the free end of the grapnel line and </p><p>fasten it at the top. When this had been </p><p>done and the man once more stood on the </p><p>ground the agent led the two lines with the </p><p>grapnel dangling between down the incline</p><p>directly away from the -face of the cliff. </p><p>Then Markenson paused and looked at the </p><p>little doctor and grinned. </p><p> “A catapult, eh?” said the doctor, return-</p><p>ing the grin. </p><p> “History has a habit of repeating itself,”</p><p>admitted the agent proudly. </p><p> The idea was to shoot the grapnel to the</p><p>top of the cliff with the spring of the palm. </p><p>All hands now “tailed” on and began to </p><p>haul away, Frankie Blue passing several </p><p>turns of the hauling line about a convenient </p><p>tree and taking in the slack as the others </p><p>hauled it back to him. Foot by foot and </p><p>inch by inch the supple bole of the palm </p><p>bent away from the cliff until it formed a </p><p>deep bow and the line was as taut as a fidclle- </p><p>string. </p><p> When all was in readiness Markenson</p><p>slashed the shorter hauling line close to the </p><p>grapnel. The palm whipped up with a </p><p>rush of wind, the long line with the grapnel </p><p>at its end trailing after. Up and up went </p><p>the grapnel, sailing over the top of the palm </p><p>and continuing its swift flight over the edge </p><p>of the cliff where it lodged. </p><p> As the grapnel disappeared a howl of</p><p>terror went up from the natives, and before </p><p>either of the white men knew what was </p><p>transpiring the Kanakas were streaming </p><p>away down the incline in the direction of </p><p>the jungle a short distance away. Frankie </p><p>Blue alone hesitated and was lost; the </p><p>threatening glance he received from Mar- </p><p>kenson, though not sufficient to quell the </p><p>uprisings of Frankie’s barbarous nature, </p><p>was yet sufficient to stay his itching legs. </p><p> “What the devil!” ejaculated the little</p><p>doctor, who stood in wide-eyed wonder until </p><p>the last of the bounding Kanakas had dis- </p><p>appeared in the jungle. </p><p> Markenson hesitated between a laugh and</p><p>an oath, the former finally mastering him. </p><p> “They’re a bit frightened, Jarvis, that’s</p><p>all,” said he laughingly. “The gentlemen </p><p>with whom I conversed a while ago in- </p><p>formed me that Buwani, God of Things, </p><p>dwells atop the cliff and we’ve desecrated </p><p>holy ground. In short, we’ve stepped in</p><p>where angels fear to tread.” </p><p> “Rats! The missionaries haven’t been</p><p>idle!” scoffed the other. </p><p> “To judge from this they have,” was the</p><p>reply. “A native can’t forget his ancestral </p><p>gods in a day, you know.” </p><p> Jarvis dismissed the thing with a shrug</p><p>of his shoulders. </p><p> “Thank the Lord, they’ve left us the</p><p>grub,” he said fervently. </p><p>BY THIS time the sun was hanging </p><p>a blood-red disk in the west and they </p><p>decided 1o let matters rest until the </p><p>morning. Climbing hand over hand up a </p><p>swinging rope against the face of a sheer </p><p>cliff would in the light of day be a big </p><p>74	Adventure</p><p>job; after dark it would be as much as a </p><p>man’s life was worth to attempt it. So </p><p>Frankie'Blue, all ashiver from what he had </p><p>seen and still expected to see, made a fire </p><p>in the lee of a boulder and prepared a sup- </p><p>per of canned beef, ship’s bread and coffee. </p><p> The meal over the two whites sat puffing</p><p>at their pipes and talking, then sought their </p><p>couches of freshly cut leaves and slept the </p><p>sleep of the just. Not so Frankie Blue? </p><p>superstition and fear had put him in a </p><p>state of mind where he could hardly bat </p><p>his eyes without conjuring up a thousand </p><p>devils to torment him. At times he felt </p><p>an almost uncontrollable impulse to fly, </p><p>but a glance at the sleeping form of the big </p><p>agent nearby quelled the impulse. He was </p><p>pretty much like a man between the devil </p><p>and the deep sea, was the Kanaka boat- </p><p>swain—if he remained the devils would </p><p>probably destroy him, and if he fled there </p><p>was much likelihood of losing his soft snap </p><p>as boatswain of the Jane Nichols. </p><p> So debating the matter with himself he</p><p>sat with his knees drawn up under his chin </p><p>and stared moodily into the fire. It was </p><p>just before daybreak when Markenson </p><p>quickly opened his eyes and looked up into </p><p>the Kanaka’s terror-stricken face. The </p><p>agent’s sudden wakening was caused by </p><p>Frankie prodding him gently in the ribs. </p><p> “Come quick!” whispered the Kanaka</p><p>tensely when he saw that his master was </p><p>fully awake. </p><p> He started away.</p><p> Markenson, sensing something unusual,</p><p>grabbed up his automatic and followed the </p><p>man. At the base of the cliff the Kanaka </p><p>halted and pointed upward. Markenson </p><p>threw back his head and saw outlined in </p><p>clear relief against the graying sky a swing- </p><p>ing, swaying object that he could not quite </p><p>identify. That it was not a man he was </p><p>certain, for the thing possessed none of the </p><p>general forms of a man. </p><p> But that some one was fooling with the</p><p>grapnel line was plainly apparent; more- </p><p>over, it was evident that the object, what- </p><p>ever it was, would soon disappear over the </p><p>edge of the cliff. In haste Markenson threw </p><p>up his automatic and emptied its contents</p><p>into the rapidly ascending object. Hardly </p><p>had the reports of the shots died away when </p><p>a shower of fine, granulated substance came </p><p>raining down. </p><p> If Frankie Blue’s brown skin had been</p><p>capable of such a thing it would at that </p><p>instant have transformed itself to a livid </p><p>white. </p><p> “The sacred meal! Buwani! Buwani!”</p><p>he screamed, and dashed away yelping at </p><p>the top of his lungs. </p><p> Jarvis, awakened by the uproar of the</p><p>firing and the Kanaka’s yelling, came rush- </p><p>ing up. </p><p> “For heaven’s sake! What’s up?” he</p><p>gasped, groping wildly for his glasses, which </p><p>he found at the end of their ribbon and </p><p>clapped them to his nose. </p><p> Markenson’s answer was a disgusted</p><p>grunt. Going to the fire he shortly re- </p><p>turned with a blazing brand, and by its </p><p>light stooped and scooped together a palm- </p><p>ful of the substance that had fallen on his </p><p>and the boatswain’s heads. He looked at </p><p>it critically a moment, then chuckled. </p><p> “Behold! The sacred meal of Buwani,”</p><p>he chortled, and thrust the stuff under the </p><p>little doctor’s nose. </p><p> Jarvis studied the white grains with a</p><p>puzzled expression, then sniffed at them. </p><p> “Rats! That’s rice,” he asserted with</p><p>conviction. </p><p> “Right, little man,” agreed the other.</p><p> “Let’s have the tale from the beginning,”,</p><p>commanded the doctor tartly. </p><p> So they returned to the fire and Marken-</p><p>son began with the moment he had opened </p><p>his eyes and wound up with the fleeing boat- </p><p>swain, the listener lifting his brows little </p><p>by little as the narrative proceeded. </p><p> “Which means that Johnny was actually</p><p>down here in camp,” said Jarvis at the con- </p><p>clusion of the recital. </p><p> “Exactly; unless you can offer a more</p><p>logical explanation for the fact that one of </p><p>our grub packs has disappeared over the </p><p>edge of the cliff on the end of the rope.” </p><p> But as the doctor could not, or at least</p><p>did not, offer that more logical explanation </p><p>he suggested that as it was now growing </p><p>daylight they get breakfast and make a </p><p>start somewhere. They had hardly sat </p><p>down to a hastily prepared breakfast, if </p><p>coffee and bread could be called a break- </p><p>fast, when a deep booming sound assailed </p><p>their ears. Coming on them so abruptly, </p><p>it was positively disconcerting. </p><p> They twisted their heads this way and</p><p>that in an effort to fathom the mystery, but </p><p>could make neither heads nor tails of it. </p><p>It was not the booming report of a gun they </p><p>were quite sure, though small cruisers fre- </p><p>quently put in at Tamana; it possessed more </p><p>The Madness of Johnny Dyer </p><p>75 </p><p>the ringing qualities of a bell, yet it was </p><p>unlike the sound of any bell they had ever </p><p>heard. The first few notes were intermit- </p><p>tent, each note complete and distinct in </p><p>itself, then they blended into a continuous </p><p>weird singing noise of great volume. In </p><p>that desolation of hills and jungle it was </p><p>uncanny. </p><p> “It gives a fellow the creeps,” whispered</p><p>Jarvis. </p><p> For fully fifteen minutes the sound con-</p><p>tinued, then died down to a whisper and </p><p>finally ceased altogether. The two men </p><p>finished their breakfast in silence. </p><p> “Well, the rope’s gone, Tiny,” said the</p><p>doctor as they rose to their feet and began </p><p>to lash their packs. “What now?” </p><p> “We’ll look for the path,” replied Mar-</p><p>kenson. “Last night’s episode convinces </p><p>me that there is a path to the top of that </p><p>rock; else how did Johnny get down here?” </p><p> “Perhaps he came down on the rope,”</p><p>suggested Jarvis. </p><p> Markenson shook his head.</p><p> “Perhaps, but I don’t think so. Going</p><p>on the supposition that there is a path </p><p>we’ll start here and work our way clear </p><p>around this blasted rock. Then if we don’t </p><p>find anything we’ll hire a balloon and get up </p><p>that way.” </p><p> Therewith they threw their packs on their</p><p>backs and hiked away toward the west. </p><p>They had gone but a short distance, exam- </p><p>ining every inch of ground carefully, when </p><p>they encountered a tangle of jungle that at </p><p>first glance appeared to be well-nigh im- </p><p>penetrable. But Markenson swore by all </p><p>heathen gods and his own that nothing short </p><p>of death would balk him, to which noble </p><p>declaration the little doctor nodded a hearty </p><p>amen. They forged ahead. At noon they </p><p>halted in a little glade, cool and inviting </p><p>after the toil of the morning, and here they </p><p>had dinner. </p><p> Just how it all happened Markenson did</p><p>not remember; it came on him so suddenly</p><p>that he did not have time to think. All </p><p>he remembered was that after dinner he </p><p>walked over to the base of the cliff where </p><p>something had attracted his attention and </p><p>stepped on an innocent mat of vines trail- </p><p>ing along on the ground. The vines rushed </p><p>up to meet him and, yelling, he fell into </p><p>darkness. When he came to he was lying </p><p>on his back with Jarvis leaning over him </p><p>bathing his head, which felt immensely dis- </p><p>torted and painful. </p><p> “It’s all right, old man; stay where you</p><p>are,” he heard an anxious voice saying as </p><p>he opened his eyes and looked into the little </p><p>doctor’s goggle-eyed face. </p><p> It requires more than a nasty fall to kill</p><p>some men, however, and despite the medi- </p><p>cal man’s protests Markenson sat up. He </p><p>put his hand to his head and it came away </p><p>stained with blood. He looked at Jarvis </p><p>for an explanation. </p><p> “You tumbled down a deep, deep well,</p><p>Tiny,” said Jarvis, interpreting the expres- </p><p>sion on the other’s face aright. “A very </p><p>silly thing to do but you did it nevertheless. </p><p>And inadvertently you stumbled on the very </p><p>tiling we have been looking for—the path. </p><p>At least, that’s the way it looks to me. </p><p>Would you care to look at the place?” </p><p> The agent signified his willingness and</p><p>Jarvis helped him to his feet and led the </p><p>way to the cliff' where the mat of vines lay. </p><p>The doctor pushed back the vines with his </p><p>foot to disclose a black rift. Markenson </p><p>leaned over and looked down, but the place </p><p>was as dark as a velvet pocket and he saw </p><p>nothing. </p><p> “And down there I had to go and drag</p><p>you out,” went on the doctor, letting the </p><p>vines fly back in place. “Tiny, when </p><p>you’re unconscious you’re about as handy </p><p>to handle as an elephant,” he laughed. </p><p> “How in the world did you manage it?”</p><p>queried the big man in amazement, eyeing </p><p>the slight figure of the doctor from head to </p><p>feet. </p><p> “Goodness knows—I had to,” replied</p><p>Jarvis. “But hold on, I forgot to say that </p><p>I had the assistance of a perfectly good </p><p>flight of stairs.” </p><p> “What?”</p><p> The doctor nodded. “Yes, a flight of</p><p>stairs. That’s why I say we’ve found the </p><p>trail at last.” </p><p> “That settles it!” burst from Markenson,</p><p>and he would have shouldered his pack and </p><p>made an immediate start down into the </p><p>“well” had not the other held him in leash. </p><p> “No, you don’t; we stay right here until</p><p>you are fit to travel,” protested the doctor. </p><p>“Haste makes waste, you know,” he coun- </p><p>seled. “We’ve got plenty of grub and </p><p>oceans of time, so we can afford to take it </p><p>easy.” </p><p> “But Johnny—” began the injured man,</p><p>but was interrupted by a curt gesture of the </p><p>little man's hand. </p><p> “Johnny’s an ass! Let him wait!”</p><p>76 </p><p>Adventure. </p><p>interposed the doctor explosively. “If it </p><p>wasn’t for Johnny we wouldn’t be breaking </p><p>our hearts and backs traipsing around look- </p><p>ing for him.” </p><p> Markenson growled at the restraint, but</p><p>Jarvis was obdurate and hinted broadly </p><p>that his orders would be obeyed if he had </p><p>to enforce them with the butt end of an </p><p>automatic “over a thick head.” He spoke </p><p>so earnestly that the big agent smiled and </p><p>gave in. They saw or heard nothing of </p><p>Dyer during the next day or so. They did </p><p>hear, however, sometimes at night and </p><p>sometimes during the day, the weird, boom- </p><p>ing sound; but they did not connect the </p><p>missing Dyer with the booming. </p><p> At the end of the third day following his</p><p>tumble into the “well” Markenson pro-, </p><p>nounced himself fully recovered, and to </p><p>prove the assertion he picked the doctor up </p><p>bodily and threw him across his big shoul- </p><p>ders with ease. That was sufficient proof of </p><p>his fitness, so they agreed to make a start </p><p>the next morning. </p><p>BY DAYLIGHT of the next day </p><p>they had finished breakfast a*hd </p><p>made a torch of dry twigs; then </p><p>again taking up their packs they started </p><p>for the “door to hell,” as Markenson ex- </p><p>pressed it. Tying back the vines at the </p><p>point where the stairs began Markenson </p><p>lit the torch and led the way down. </p><p> The center of the step6 was deeply</p><p>grooved, proving that they had been used </p><p>very extensively in their day. The sides </p><p>of the “well” were composed of small, </p><p>smoothly-hewn stones, damp and cold to </p><p>the touch, and thickly studded with niter, </p><p>which glittered like diamonds in the fitful </p><p>light of the torch. </p><p> Arriving at the bottom of the stairs, about</p><p>forty steps in all, they found themselves </p><p>looking into a dark, forbidding tunnel the </p><p>height of which was barely sufficient to per- </p><p>mit the big agent to walk upright. Into </p><p>the tunnel they plunged, and at the end of </p><p>five minutes they turned an abrupt curve </p><p>and saw a faint light ahead. Hurrying on, </p><p>they presently stepped out into the light </p><p>of day.</p><p> The light was rather feeble, however,</p><p>owing to the fact that it filtered in at the </p><p>top of a narrow crevasse about two hun- </p><p>dred feet long and more than a hundred </p><p>feet deep. It was for all the world as if </p><p>they were standing at the bottom of a tall </p><p>chimney of unusual and erratic dimensions. </p><p>Plainly the crevasse was the work of a </p><p>terrestrial convulsion, and owing to a freak </p><p>of that convulsion the crevasse could be </p><p>seen only by approaching it through the </p><p>tunnel or from the top of the rock. </p><p> At first glance it appeared that the way</p><p>was blocked. But Jarvis, who had been </p><p>looking around, suddenly caught his com- </p><p>panion excitedly by the arm and pointed </p><p>to a narrow fissure extending from top to </p><p>bottom at one side of the crevasse. At </p><p>regular intervals up this fissure thick iron </p><p>rods had been embedded in its sides, thus </p><p>forming a ladder of sorts. </p><p> “It will be like climbing a Jacob’s-ladder</p><p>to heaven!” cried Jarvis. </p><p> “It’s the only way up,” said Markenson</p><p>grimly; “so let’s be at it.” </p><p> Jarvis, as the lighter man, elected to</p><p>start first. He stepped on the bottom </p><p>round of the ladder and began the ascent, </p><p>testing each round of the ladder carefully </p><p>before trusting his weight to it. Marken- </p><p>son soon followed. To the man who has </p><p>not had his share of perilous feats the </p><p>climbing of such a ladder up a narrow crack </p><p>in the earth might present drawbacks; but </p><p>to men who on numerous occasions had </p><p>faced death in various guises the feat was </p><p>merely one of those prosaic incidents that </p><p>go with a day’s work. </p><p> At last the two men stepped from the</p><p>crack at the top of the rock and stood work- </p><p>ing the cramps from their limbs and looking </p><p>about them. Their eager eyes beheld a </p><p>scene of gorgeous beauty. They surmised </p><p>that at the moment they were standing on </p><p>the lip of the crater of an extinct volcaao, </p><p>the diameter of the crater almost equal to </p><p>the diameter of the rock, about two miles. </p><p>In truth, Big Rock itself was no less than </p><p>the upstanding, colossal throat of the volcano. </p><p> From the hp the crater at every point</p><p>on its circumference swooped sharply down </p><p>to a depth of fifty feet or more, then </p><p>leveled itself and flowed away, a beautiful </p><p>flat plain carpeted with a verdant growth </p><p>of grass, with here and there clumps and </p><p>rows of bushes and trees of variegated </p><p>colors. The whole appeared as a pro- </p><p>digious bowl, upon the inner surface of </p><p>which a gigantic artist had painted a </p><p>pastoral scene of surpassing beauty; and </p><p>as the immensity of the picture impressed </p><p>itself upon the two spectators they gasped </p><p>with wonder and appreciation. </p><p>The Madness of Johnny Dyer </p><p>77 </p><p> But what surprised them even more and</p><p>caused further exclamations to leap from </p><p>their lips was the solitary, two-story build- </p><p>ing that stood in the very center of the bowl. </p><p>Moreover, from the building a thin column </p><p>of smoke drifted lazily into the still air. </p><p>“Buwani!” cried the man of medicine. </p><p>“Johnny!” echoed Markenson. </p><p> They both laughed.</p><p> “Now if I were an archeologist I would</p><p>say that we have discovered something </p><p>valuable,” went on the agent, after an in- </p><p>terval. “Once I entertained a party of </p><p>tourists here at Tamana, and among them </p><p>was a Professor Dawes, who informed me </p><p>that the islands in the Pacific were once </p><p>component parts of an extensive continent </p><p>maintaining a superior civilization.” </p><p> “There’s your evidence,” said Jarvis, in-</p><p>dicating the building with a nod of his head. </p><p>“However, let’s find Johnny; we can sift the </p><p>evidence afterward.” </p><p> “We haven’t seen any evidence of his</p><p>having a gun,” said Markenson as they pre- </p><p>pared to go on, “but that’s no sign he hasn’t </p><p>one. Crazy men are not apt to be dis- </p><p>criminating, so let’s be careful.” </p><p> They made their way to a point on the</p><p>lip of the crater several hundred yards far- </p><p>ther along, where a row of trees extended </p><p>down the side of the bowl and across the </p><p>plain to within a hundred or so feet of the </p><p>building. Down they plunged, using the </p><p>trees as concealment, and at last stood but </p><p>a short distance from the building. Clearly </p><p>now they saw that the structure before </p><p>them was of heroic proportions. </p><p> It had the general appearance of one of</p><p>the community houses of the Navaho In- </p><p>dians,. but instead of the adobe brick and </p><p>mud of the Navaho houses this building </p><p>was constructed of the small stones similar </p><p>to those they had seen in the “well” beyond </p><p>the cliff. They scrutinized the place closely </p><p>but saw no sign of human habitation except </p><p>the wisp of curling smoke rising from the </p><p>roof. Suddenly a rumbling boom broke </p><p>the silence, and courageous though the two </p><p>men were, they instinctively shrank. Jar-</p><p>vis whipped out his automatic. </p><p> “Hold on!” cried the agent in alarm,</p><p>sweeping the gun down with a quick motion </p><p>of his hand. “Don’t get excited and plug </p><p>Johnny, little man!” </p><p> With a shame-faced grin Jams replaced</p><p>the gun in its holster. The boom ceased </p><p>with the single stroke, but in its stead, as </p><p>if to further play upon their taut nerves, </p><p>there came from the interior of the building </p><p>a mocking laugh. Markenson swore. </p><p> “Come on!” he said savagely.</p><p> Therewith, gritting their teeth, they</p><p>marched out from the shelter of the trees </p><p>and made for the building. As they went </p><p>they heard the mocking laugh again, then </p><p>again and again, and at last it ended in a </p><p>series of croaking, derisive guffaws. </p><p> “The poor, poor devil,” muttered Jarvis</p><p>compassionately. </p><p> Jarvis had heard such sounds before issu-</p><p>ing from the lips of madmen and knew of </p><p>the great disaster that lay behind them. </p><p>Johnny was doubtless a babbling, slobber- </p><p>ing idiot. </p><p> Without mishap they reached the build-</p><p>ing and entered by one of the several doors </p><p>on that side. They stepped inside with </p><p>every sense alert, every muscle tensed and </p><p>ready for instant action should occasion </p><p>warrant. As men go, Dyer was not a giant, </p><p>but life in the open had developed him </p><p>beyond the ordinary and he was as tough </p><p>as wire nails. In a scrimmage he would </p><p>no doubt prove himself a wicked if not </p><p>altogether triumphant adversary, so dis- </p><p>cretion was indeed the better part of valor. </p><p> By the light reflected into the building</p><p>from outside the two men had no difficulty </p><p>in finding their way about. The room in </p><p>which they stood was spacious and bare of </p><p>all furnishings, unless a rough ladder stand- </p><p>ing in one corner, which lost itself in a trap- </p><p>door affair in the ceiling, could be called </p><p>furnishings. From room to room they </p><p>made their cautious way, hearing no sound </p><p>except their own footsteps and seeing noth- </p><p>ing but the naked walls and floors. The </p><p>place seemed to be utterly deserted.</p><p> “Up stairs,” said Markenson shortly when</p><p>they had looked into the last room on the </p><p>ground floor. </p><p> He led the way to the room where they</p><p>had noted the ladder and without hesita- </p><p>tion began the ascent, Jarvis following </p><p>closely on his heels. At the top the agent </p><p>paused and thrust his head cautiously above </p><p>the aperture, half expecting to feel a club </p><p>come smashing down on his skull. Nothing </p><p>of the sort occurred, however, and they </p><p>went on up and stepped into a black void. </p><p> If the room in which they found them-</p><p>selves contained a window or a door it was </p><p>hermetically sealed; the only light in the </p><p>place came from the blotch which marked </p><p>78 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the trap-door through which they had just </p><p>come, and that was negligible. The dark- </p><p>ness closed in about them like something </p><p>tangible, something that they could feel and </p><p>cut with a knife. Their ears tensed to catch </p><p>the faintest sound, they stood listening. </p><p> ABRUPTLY, like a flash from a</p><p>V Ty clear sky, the sound came. It </p><p>’ poured over them like a rushing </p><p>river, tumbling and surging and swirling </p><p>about them eddies of deafening sound, </p><p>crashing and roaring one moment, the </p><p>next sighing and crying into their ears </p><p>like the wailing of a gale on the open sea. </p><p> BoomI B-o-o-o-ml It came rushing at</p><p>them like an invisible, clutching hand that </p><p>would choke the very lives from their bodies, </p><p>smothering and suffocating them with its </p><p>detonations. Beings of flesh and blood </p><p>have their limitations. </p><p> Jarvis jerked his ever-ready automatic</p><p>from its holster and emptied its contents </p><p>into the vast wells of darkness about them, </p><p>then with a cry flung the weapon from him </p><p>and leaped for the ladder. When almost </p><p>to the bottom of the ladder he lost his foot- </p><p>ing and fell, sprawling on the floor of the </p><p>room below like a fish stranded on the beach. </p><p> Markenson followed an instant later, but</p><p>more fortunate than his companion, landed </p><p>right-side-up and ran blindly. Scrambling </p><p>to his feet, the erstwhile dignified physician </p><p>followed his big friend into the sunlight. </p><p>The little doctor was, indeed, a disreputable </p><p>sight. </p><p> What little clothing he wore was ripped</p><p>and torn and the grub pack on his back, </p><p>now twisted awry, was a wreck which per- </p><p>mitted its contents to leak out and mark </p><p>the path of flight. Over his right eye was </p><p>a cut from which the blood oozed slug- </p><p>gishly. Nor was Markenson much better </p><p>off. They were both visibly and shock- </p><p>ingly scared. At a safe distance from the </p><p>building they stopped and looked back, </p><p>Jarvis fumbling for his glasses and clamp- </p><p>ing them to his nose. </p><p> A strange sight met their gaze and one</p><p>not conducive to relieve their outraged feel-</p><p>ings to any appreciable degree. Standing </p><p>on the roof of the building, one foot resting </p><p>on the low parapet and leaning indolently </p><p>on a huge wooden maul, stood the missing </p><p>man. He was looking down at his two </p><p>comrades with an expression of mingled </p><p>surprise and mirth. But far from being </p><p>disrobed as they had seen him on a previous </p><p>occasion, he was now garbed in the conven- </p><p>tional white duck trousers and soft shirt of </p><p>the gentleman of the Pacific, a wide- </p><p>brimmed straw hat cocked rakishly over </p><p>one eye. </p><p> “Hello there, you boobs! Were you look-</p><p>ing for some one?” he called down after a </p><p>long interval of staring. </p><p> The little doctor gulped. Surely such</p><p>rational words could not issue from the lips </p><p>of a madman! A further exceedingly mi- </p><p>nute diagnosis of the madman’s face con- </p><p>vinced the doctor that Dyer was perfectly </p><p>sane; there was none of that wild, aimless </p><p>staring so noticeable in the eyes of one </p><p>mentally unbalanced. Markenson was the </p><p>first of the two to regain control of himself. </p><p> “What the—” he began, but got no fur-</p><p>ther; he choked with wrath and the ques- </p><p>tion transformed itself into a violent burst </p><p>of swearing. </p><p> Dyer laughed.</p><p> “Come up and let’s talk it over,” he in-</p><p>vited. “You’ll find steps on the other side </p><p>of this shebang.” </p><p> There was no alternative, so the two men</p><p>walked around the building to the other </p><p>side and found the steps as directed. In a </p><p>few moments they stood on the roof. Dyer </p><p>eyed them suspiciously, holding himself in </p><p>readiness for flight or battle at the first </p><p>signs of hostility. </p><p> “Is there anything you’d like to know,</p><p>gentlemen?” queried the madman after a </p><p>time. </p><p> His words were the pattern of elaborate</p><p>graciousness. </p><p> “No, not a thing, we assure you,” replied</p><p>Markenson with biting sarcasm, but the </p><p>sarcasm was lost on Dyer, who grinned</p><p>good-naturedly. </p><p> “What’s the meaning of this foolishness?”</p><p>demanded the little doctor angrily, glaring </p><p>at Dyer as if he would eat him. </p><p> “I’ll let Buwani tell you part of the</p><p>story,” replied Dyer. “From what I’ve </p><p>seen of this place I imagine Buwani used to </p><p>have the careful attentions of a priest, but </p><p>as the priest hasn’t been around for a hun- </p><p>dred years or so, I’m filling the job tem- </p><p>porarily. Listen to what Buwani has to </p><p>say.” </p><p> Taking the wooden maul he held in his</p><p>hands, Dyer walked across the roof to an </p><p>object which the others had not before </p><p>noticed, or if they had noticed it, had </p><p>The Madness of Johnny Dyer </p><p>79 </p><p>thought it of no consequence. The object </p><p>was a gallows-like affair from which was </p><p>suspended a smooth log of wood about ten </p><p>inches in diameter and six or seven feet long. </p><p>It swung free of the roof and much resem- </p><p>bled a man hanging by the neck, thus </p><p>heightening the illusion of a gallows. </p><p> Going up to this contrivance, Dyer swung</p><p>the maul and brought it with great force </p><p>against the log. The result was a deep, </p><p>resonant boom that literally made the roof </p><p>tremble. It was the sound Markenson and </p><p>the doctor had heard the first time beyond </p><p>the cliff. The apparatus was, in fact, a </p><p>one-note xylophone on a large scale. Dyer </p><p>swung the maul for a second stroke, but </p><p>Jarvis made the intervening distance and </p><p>caught his arms. </p><p> “For God’s sake let the thing alone!</p><p>I’ve had enough of Buwani!” he cried. </p><p> “I should think so,” said the other laugh-</p><p>ingly, throwing the maul down. “Yet, </p><p>you must admit it is a wonderful instru- </p><p>ment, my friend; on a still day its music </p><p>can be heard ten miles. The native monks </p><p>in Morocco use such a device for frighten- </p><p>ing devils, though I know of a case where </p><p>white men-” </p><p> A dangerous glint in two pairs of eyes</p><p>warned him that he was treading on dan- </p><p>gerous ground. </p><p> “What else, gentlemen?” he finished</p><p>quietly. </p><p> Markenson seated himself on the parapet</p><p>and pulled Dyer down beside him. </p><p> “Tell me, Johnny, how did you get</p><p>ashore?” he inquired, his eyes fastened, on </p><p>Dyer’s face. </p><p> “In a boat.”</p><p> “No lies! There were no boats missing.</p><p>How did you get ashore?” repeated the </p><p>agent ominously. </p><p> “Well, then, one of the natives brought</p><p>me ashore in his canoe,” replied Dyer. </p><p> Thereupon Markenson looked daggers at</p><p>the doctor. </p><p> “I said somebody had been neglectful!”</p><p>he growled. </p><p> “And wasn’t it up to you to look after</p><p>the shore boats?” retorted Janas acidly. </p><p> Markenson snorted and ignored the slur.</p><p> “If you came ashore in a native’s canoe,</p><p>why weren’t we told of it?” he asked, turn- </p><p>ing again to Dyer. </p><p> “That’s a fair question and deserves a</p><p>fair answer,” replied the other after a mo- </p><p>ment’s study. “You see, Tiny, I bribed </p><p>one of the niggers to bring me ashore.” </p><p> “Well?”</p><p> “When you get back to the bungalow</p><p>take an inventory of your stock of liquor; </p><p>you will find a bottle of Scotch missing. I </p><p>purloined it. I promised my abductor an- </p><p>other if he would keep his mouth shut.” </p><p>“Insult to injur}'; with my own whisky, </p><p>too,” moaned Markenson. </p><p> “But,” broke in the excitable little man</p><p>of medicine at this point, “what’s the idea </p><p>for all this? Why did you sneak away? </p><p>Why have you put us to all this trouble? </p><p>Why did—oh, the devil—why everything? </p><p>Speak?” </p><p> Then Johnny Dyer sighed a happy sigh</p><p>and from his shirt-pocket took a sack of </p><p>tobacco and papers. He painstakingly </p><p>rolled a cigaret and lit it. Then to further </p><p>aggravate his companions he leisurely puffed </p><p>at the cigaret and sent delectable clouds of </p><p>smoke from his nostrils. </p><p>“LISTEN, my dear friends,” he </p><p>began impressively. “I have done </p><p>what I have done to get square with </p><p>you. Perhaps your weak brains will per- </p><p>mit you to recall that you two miserable </p><p>sinners played a joke on me not so very </p><p>long ago. To an Auckland newspaper you </p><p>sent an article wherein was set forth that </p><p>one Johnny Dyer, which was myself, was </p><p>married to one of the native queens down </p><p>this way. Securing a copy of the paper </p><p>in which your article appeared you marked </p><p>the article and forwarded the paper to a</p><p>certain lady in the States. Unfortunately </p><p>she believed every last word of that in- </p><p>famous lie. </p><p> “ ‘Never let me see your blackguard face</p><p>again,’ she told me in a letter which she </p><p>wrote immediately upon receipt of your </p><p>paper, and by numerous blotches appear- </p><p>ing on that letter I was sure it cost her a </p><p>great deal to write it. However, after much </p><p>trouble, chiefly caused by securing affi- </p><p>davits from prominent people in these </p><p>parts, I was again admitted to the lady’s </p><p>affections.” </p><p> “Oh, Lord, have mercy!” groaned Jarvis.</p><p>“Yes, the Lord have mercy,” said Dyer </p><p>bruskly; “I have none.” </p><p> “It was only a joke, Johnny,” cut in</p><p>Markenson lamely, trying to defend a posi- </p><p>tion which he knew full well was inde- </p><p>fensible. </p><p> Dyer laughed scornfully.</p><p>8o </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “And a fine joke it was,” was his cynical</p><p>rejoinder. “If you have ever been in love </p><p>you’ll realize what your silly joke cost me; </p><p>I lived in hell for several weeks, believe me. </p><p>I took a solemn oath to get even with you </p><p>fellows and here you are. Not so long ago </p><p>I chanced to hear our doctor friend here </p><p>telling you about one of your niggers who </p><p>had been bowled over by the sun. That </p><p>was my clue. If the sun would knock out </p><p>a nigger, what would it do to a white man? </p><p>Knock him silly, eh, Doc? At any rate, </p><p>it knocked me silly; at least, that’s the sup- </p><p>position. </p><p> “Remember how I went about without</p><p>my hat? It was a risky thing to do, I </p><p>admit, but I had to make the evidence </p><p>plain. I read in one of your medical books, </p><p>Jarvis, how a man acted when he got a </p><p>touch of the sun, so I did some practising </p><p>to get the hang of it. Yet, my friends, it </p><p>is you who were loony; not I. While you </p><p>were groaning and moaning over my con- </p><p>dition I was laughing at you.” </p><p> “Detestable wretch!” rasped Jarvis.</p><p> “Detestable wretches you mean,” grimly</p><p>corrected Dyer. “As a climax to my sup- </p><p>posed insanity,” he went on, “I bribed a </p><p>nigger to paddle me ashore while you slept. </p><p>I had a few things stowed away at the copra </p><p>sheds, so I got them and came up here. I </p><p>took it for granted that my good freinds </p><p>would not let me perish, and that -you’d </p><p>come seeking me. Oh, men, I had great </p><p>faith in ye!” </p><p> “Naturally you knew all about the path</p><p>up here and said nothing about it,” said </p><p>Markenson ironically. </p><p> “Certainly,” responded the other quickly.</p><p>“About two weeks ago I came up this way </p><p>hunting and by the merest chance stumbled </p><p>on that hole down by the cliff. Since I </p><p>took your rope I suppose you came the </p><p>same way. I fully intended to tell you </p><p>about my find, but before I got back the </p><p>big idea came to me. It struck me that </p><p>I could use my secret to get square with </p><p>you fellows. </p><p> “One thing following another, I fixed</p><p>things with the native and went mad. Then </p><p>I vamoosed and let you dig in and enjoy </p><p>yourselves. To judge by personal appear- </p><p>ances, I wouldn’t say you’ve been to a </p><p>picnic. ‘Trouble, trouble, toil and trouble,’ </p><p>eh? Besides, what would your many </p><p>friends think of this story?” </p><p> He paused and looked at them eloquently.</p><p> For a time after Dyer ceased speaking</p><p>there was an unbroken silence, then Mar- </p><p>kenson, urged on by certain signs of appro- </p><p>bation from the doctor, said: </p><p> “Johnny, your point is well taken. But</p><p>remember what the Book says in regard to </p><p>such things, ‘Forgive them, for they know </p><p>not what they do.’ Now, in order to make </p><p>amends and set you right in the estimation </p><p>of this—ah—er-” </p><p> “Miss Edith,” supplied the little doctor</p><p>with a sly glance at Dyer. </p><p> “A-hum—this Miss Edith, yes,” con-</p><p>tinued the agent, “we will, Doc and I, </p><p>write her an explanatory letter fully </p><p>exonerating you from all sin. Is that </p><p>enough?” </p><p> The eyes Markenson turned on Dyer</p><p>were so filled with repentance and con- </p><p>trition, Dyer was himself somewhat ashamed </p><p>of his revenge. He grabbed the agent’s </p><p>hand and gave it a liberal squeeze, doing </p><p>the same for Jarvis. </p><p> “I forgive you both,” he said.</p><p> “Thanks, Johnny,” came the echo.</p><p> “But it is indeed an ill wind that blows</p><p>no good,” spoke Dyer at length, looking </p><p>out across the plain. “I’ve made an im- </p><p>mense discovery in this old crater, a dis- </p><p>covery that will have a far-reaching effect </p><p>on international affairs. This crater is one </p><p>huge solid deposit of sodium nitrate and </p><p>sulfur, my friends. Of course, you know </p><p>without being told that the former is a base </p><p>for a number of high explosives and the </p><p>latter is used extensively in the manufac- </p><p>ture of common powder. What do you </p><p>think of that?” </p><p> “What has that got to do with the cor-</p><p>poration?” inquired Markenson, his keen </p><p>eyes on Dyer’s face in search for a hidden </p><p>meaning. “The corporation has no rights </p><p>here except on the plantations.” </p><p> “Did I say anything about the corpora-</p><p>tion?” demanded the other. “I am think- </p><p>ing of something far greater than the cor- </p><p>poration.” </p><p> “Well, what?” said Jarvis, striving vainly</p><p>for light. </p><p> “I am thinking of the United States Gov-</p><p>ernment!” almost shouted Dyer. “The </p><p>United States owns every grain of these </p><p>immense deposits, and when you consider </p><p>that the greater part of the world’s supply </p><p>of sodium nitrate comes from Chili, a </p><p>country none too friendly to our interests, </p><p>you will realize what it means to Uncle </p><p>A Lucky Cross </p><p>81 </p><p>Sam. And the Government doesn’t know </p><p>that these deposits are here. </p><p> “Funny, I admit, but it’s a fact. I am</p><p>the discoverer of these deposits, gentlemen. </p><p>The records on file merely state that </p><p>Tamana is an island of volcanic origin and </p><p>of little value. Oh, Lord! Of little value!” </p><p>“Bully boy!” shouted the little doctor as </p><p>the full import of the thing came home to </p><p>him. </p><p> “Well done, thou good and fraudulent</p><p>lunatic!” yelled Markenson. </p><p> But the madman only grabbed the maul</p><p>and beat on Buwani until that abused god </p><p>sang “The Star-Spangled Banner” in one </p><p>note. </p><p>A LUCKY CROSS </p><p> by BERT VAN</p><p>George “frenchy” bur- </p><p>GOYNE was what we called, in </p><p>Montana, a cayuse-Frenchman, </p><p>if there is such a hyphenated </p><p>nationality. He punched cows for a liv- </p><p>ing, sang songs because his nature de- </p><p>manded it, and grinned when somebody </p><p>wanted to fight. Not that he wanted to </p><p>fight, but as he said: </p><p> “When somebody she goes on de prod,</p><p>dere mus’ be somebody to accommodate.” </p><p>George carried an old bone-handled Colt, </p><p>and gained the respect of every one, when </p><p>he emptied the old gun in a saloon one eve- </p><p>ning, and obliterated the features of a lith- </p><p>ographed damsel, who knelt at a spring and </p><p>advertised the wonders of a certain mineral </p><p>water. The head would measure about </p><p>three inches, and George was fifty feet away. </p><p> “Kid” Haley hated George. For no</p><p>known reason except that George laughed </p><p>all the time, while the Kid was of a sullen, </p><p>morose disposition, prone to soak his sys- </p><p>tem in absinthe and whisky, and their na- </p><p>tures clashed. Haley was a bartender, and </p><p>was painfully cross-eyed. He had made </p><p>threats that some day he would wipe the</p><p>grin off that - Frenchman, but when </p><p>George heard about it he laughed and shook </p><p>his head: </p><p> “Non. She ees dere to steek. Dat Keed</p><p>is too cross in de eye.” </p><p> Came the night of a dance, and the little</p><p>cow-town was in its glory. Haley was </p><p>tending bar at the Eureka saloon, and get- </p><p>ting more sullen at every drink, while </p><p>George danced and sang, and leaned </p><p>against the bar and drank whisky like it was </p><p>water. </p><p> I had left the saloon and started for the</p><p>dance-hall, when I heard the sputter of pis- </p><p>tol shots in the saloon. A few seconds later </p><p>I heard the door slam, and somebody came </p><p>running down the street. It was the </p><p>Frenchman, and he was choking with </p><p>laughter when he caught up with me. </p><p> A few pistol shots more or less was noth-</p><p>ing unusual, especially on the night of a big </p><p>dance, but I knew there must have been </p><p>something out of the ordinary connected </p><p>with that fusillade. I waited until his joy </p><p>subsided, and then inquired as to the cause </p><p>for his hilarity. </p><p> “Haw, haw, haw!” he roared. “She’s</p><p>one good joke: </p><p> “Keed Haley shoot t’ree, four times at me,</p><p>hard he could blow! Haw, haw, haw!” </p><p>“Laughable,” I agreed. “Did you kill </p><p>him, George?” </p><p> ‘ Non! What’s de use? She ees worse</p><p>den death.

Child </p><p>of the streets as he was, “clouds of glory” </p><p>hadn't yet ceased to trail about his boy- </p><p>hood; and since other forms of righteous- </p><p>ness were rather in eclipse in his world, </p><p>Jimmy had been compelled to build all his </p><p>creed upon the one article of faith called </p><p>personal loyalty. </p><p> He answered Hendricks suitably enough</p><p>in words; but more convincing was his </p><p>expansive smile, wide, beaming, trustful, </p><p>and altogether trustworthy. A smile which </p><p>Hendricks immediately recognized as an </p><p>asset in his business, in which the appear- </p><p>ance of friendship availed much. </p><p> When Hendricks asked him what he had</p><p>done for a living Jimmy replied naively— </p><p>“Folks.” But that answer was actuated </p><p>mainly by a desire to please. True, a </p><p>certain cleverness at craps was Jimmy’s; </p><p>but on occasions he had worked, too,' </p><p>peddled extras, carried messages, once for </p><p>a whole week held a regular job in a grocery </p><p>store. All in all, his had been a rather </p><p>harmless existence. But it can not be </p><p>denied that, knowing no home, he had </p><p> become quite adept in the tricks, ruses and</p><p> camouflage of the pavements, and in the</p><p> various arts of getting without giving by</p><p> which, according to his teaching, men ac-</p><p> quired merit.</p><p> “In a month he’ll be as fly as they make</p><p> ’em,” his patron assured Hendricks, who</p><p> was standing at the time in the middle of</p><p> his shabby office back of the bar.</p><p> Hendricks shot his cold, passionless eyes</p><p> into the boy’s shrewd ones, carefully scruti-</p><p> nized the young-old, freckled, wise face,</p><p> and decided it might be true. So Jimmy,</p><p> who looked fourteen and might have been</p><p> eleven, was taken into the Cobweb, which</p><p> was to the world of legitimate trade as the</p><p> jackal to the useful beast of burden, and</p><p> forthwith began his real business career.</p><p> During the next- six months he learned</p><p> many things well, not the least of which</p><p> was the principle that anything that is easy</p><p> and profitable is right, provided it is suf-</p><p> ficiently safe. As a lookout he acquired an</p><p> uncanny, intuitive ability to recognize any</p><p> one connected with the police; as a runner</p><p> he became acquainted with most of the</p><p> habitues of the fascinating, shadowy dis-</p><p> trict north of Portsmouth Square, and</p><p> learned to carry cryptic, unintelligible</p><p> messages without altering a syllable. Also</p><p> he made wide observation of the various</p><p> methods of turning drunkenness to good</p><p> account; and he came to look without any</p><p> particular repugnance upon Hendricks’</p><p> specialty, which was that of the “knock-</p><p> out”—not, however, by fistic means.</p><p> One night when fog lay upon the city</p><p>82 </p><p>Square </p><p>83 </p><p>like a cloak, dulling business in the dance- </p><p>halls—already interfered with past all </p><p>reason by some new freak ideas of the po- </p><p>lice—Hendricks drew Jimmy through the </p><p>side door of the Cobweb, which opened off </p><p>the office. On Hendricks’ full, rather </p><p>handsome, broken-nosed face was an avid, </p><p>eager light, the look of a hunting animal </p><p>that stalks its prey. </p><p> “You got me?” he asked, holding Jimmy</p><p>for a moment in the doorway. </p><p> “I gotcha all right. The Chino’s?”</p><p>Jimmy flashed the ghost of his old smile on </p><p>Hendricks. </p><p> “Sure. Don’t make no bull, now. That</p><p>dude’s got a roll like an elephant’s trunk, </p><p>and the ‘dicks’ are all down Commercial </p><p>Street, for a wonder. If you ain’t back in </p><p>twenty minutes you’ll wish you were.” </p><p> He slipped Jimmy a dollar.</p><p> “Now hustle.”</p><p> Jimmy wasted no time in starting.</p><p>Hendricks watched him disappear down </p><p>the blurred street, then turned and drew </p><p>the door shut behind him. The sound of </p><p>blaring near-music and of shuffling feet had </p><p>been coming out of the dance-hall; but the </p><p>closed door shut this off, and shut the light </p><p>off too, leaving only the blank, unpainted </p><p>board wall, with the mist swirling against </p><p>it, and dripping down. </p><p> Full of curious chances as was Jimmy’s</p><p>world, it would nevertheless have suiprised </p><p>him a little had he known that the moment </p><p>Hendricks was gone a figure detached itself </p><p>from that wall. It was the figure of a man, </p><p>a very thin man with flapping black clot hes </p><p>and a j&gt;aper-white face, of nervously jerk- </p><p>ing shoulders and twitching fingers—such </p><p>a man, ih short, as Jimmy might easily be- </p><p>come. He hurried after Jimmy; and the </p><p>flaring street light at the corner showed </p><p>his mean, predatory features crossed with a </p><p>look of desperate urgency. </p><p> Jimmy, his thoughts boyishly vagrant,</p><p>but concerned principally with the dollar </p><p>or so of easy money that might come to</p><p>him from his errand, turned down Kearny </p><p>Street for two blocks. Here, where the </p><p>sidewalk was full of men, was a good chance </p><p>for his pursuer to close up on him, and he </p><p>improved it. When the two turned off </p><p>into a side street, they were perhaps fifty </p><p>yards apart. </p><p> This section overlooks the down-town</p><p>district, which was flooded with a garish </p><p>yellow light, at one end of which the ferry </p><p>building pointed upward like a dully illu- </p><p>minated monstrous needle. But where </p><p>Jimmy walked there were few open shops; </p><p>and the lights from thesef discouraged- </p><p>looking Chinese restaurants and pawn-shops, </p><p>hardly thrust back the curtain of night. </p><p>The fog was so thick that what few loiter- </p><p>ers there were seemed to be waiting in </p><p>ambush, the hurrying figures loomed up </p><p>suddenly and then were gone like specters, </p><p>and everything seemed shrouded in the </p><p>folds of mist. </p><p> But there was nothing about this that</p><p>conveyed a warning to Jimmy; and pres- </p><p>ently he passed into an even more desolate </p><p>street, where the ramshackle buildings </p><p>seemed to have jostled each other to the </p><p>point of tumbling, and there were no other </p><p>passers-by at all. Here the white-faced </p><p>man lengthened Ins stride, putting his feet </p><p>down at the same instant as did Jimmy, </p><p>and so creeping upon him unheard. And </p><p>in the middle of a block, with a swift, noise- </p><p>less rush, he pounced upon the boy, gripped </p><p>his throat with one hand, and dragged him </p><p>sideways into an alley and down upon the </p><p>ground. </p><p>^ SUDDEN as was the attack, Jimmy </p><p>f* could have cried out, but he didn’t. </p><p>_E2jThat was another lesson he had </p><p>earned at the Cobweb. Noise might </p><p>bring regular assistance, but it would be </p><p>more apt to bring the police, and in the </p><p>forces of the law there is no redress for the </p><p>lawless. So he fought like a trapped rat, </p><p>squirming, wriggling, scratching. </p><p> “Where’s that money? Turn over that</p><p>money?” came in a hiss. </p><p> “You-traitor!”</p><p> The demand told Jimmy it was one of</p><p>his own world that had attacked him, un-</p><p>speakable treachery, and what little fear </p><p>he had felt was drowned in a rush of rage. </p><p> Somehow Jimmy managed to twist his</p><p>head until he got his assailant’s arm be- </p><p>tween his teeth, and he crunched down </p><p>savagely. But the other wrenched his-arm </p><p>free, and ground Jimmy’s face against the </p><p>pavement. </p><p> “You—yer worse’n a snitch!” It was</p><p>the uttermost insult. </p><p> He felt the man’s hand pressing into his</p><p>trousers pocket, and was suddenly worried </p><p>by the thought that Hendricks’ plans </p><p>would be delayed, probably nullified alto- </p><p>gether, because of his own lack of alertness. </p><p>84 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “You petty larceny thief,” he cried.</p><p> And then rescue came, just as Jimmy</p><p>felt the dollar fished from his pockets. It </p><p>came sauntering along the street in the </p><p>shape of a man who loomed enormous in </p><p>the gloom. Deftly he reached down, </p><p>plucked up the two combatants bodily, </p><p>and pulled them apart. He did it with </p><p>gentleness, albeit with absolutely irresistible </p><p>strength; and there was a certain large </p><p>good humor in his first words that held </p><p>Jimmy over his instinctive impulse to try </p><p>to wrench away. </p><p> “Waal, waal, what’s the rumpus? Dirty</p><p>place to be sploshin’ around in. Why, </p><p>what the devil!” his tone quickly changing </p><p>to anger. “I thought you was both kids. </p><p>What d’ye mean, ye big-” </p><p> One glance had sufficed Jimmy to classify</p><p>the man. The high boots, corduroy trous- </p><p>ers and flannel shirt were unmistakable </p><p>signs; and Jimmy knew that, had it been </p><p>lighter, the broad, roughly hewn face of </p><p>his rescuer would have shown brick-red </p><p>from sun exposure. He was one of the </p><p>large-hearted, good-natured race whom </p><p>Jimmy had nevertheless learned to despise; </p><p>and because he was, Jimmy voiced his ap- </p><p>peal confidently. </p><p> “Oh, mister, he’s got-”</p><p> But the gutter-man was of no mind to</p><p>wait for judgment. At the beginning of </p><p>the boy’s wail, he had writhed sideways and </p><p>twisted under the restraining arm. It was </p><p>a clever dodge, devised primarily for the </p><p>confusion of policemen and their ilk, and </p><p>it wasn’t to lie expected the hand of the </p><p>rustic would prevail against it. Like a </p><p>shot, the fellow was off down the black </p><p>alley, leaving his erstwhile captor staring </p><p>stupidly after him. </p><p> But Jimmy was not content to stare.</p><p>He flung after the fleeing man an entirely </p><p>unexpurgated string of epithets, until the </p><p>countryman put a protesting hand on his </p><p>shoulder. </p><p> “Tut, tut! Them’s strong words off a</p><p>young belly, m’son. Not that I ain’t in </p><p>entire agreement, for a grown-up man </p><p>that’ll beat up a kid is anything you want </p><p>to say. What the dickens was the mat- </p><p>ter, anyway?” </p><p> Whereupon Jimmy, realizing there were</p><p>still possibilities in the situation, choked </p><p>back his anger and recalled himself to the </p><p>practical side of life. </p><p> “He stole my dollar,” he cried as plain-</p><p>tively as he knew how. “I gotter have </p><p>that dollar. It’s for medicine, for my </p><p>sick-” </p><p> “Pshaw, now, that’s too bad. But a</p><p>dollar ain’t so much, except when you ain’t </p><p>got another. I reckon—there y’are.” </p><p> Jimmy grinned in the darkness. Hicks</p><p>certainly are easy, he reflected. </p><p> “T’ank yer,” he said aloud. “I gotter</p><p>pay yer back some time,” he added, as the </p><p>proper sort of afterthought. </p><p> The man laughed. He had a deep, real</p><p>laugh, such as the gray and sordid lives of </p><p>Jimmy’s companions didn’t seem to </p><p>produce. </p><p> “You’d have one fine time findin’ me,</p><p>kid. What’s your name?” </p><p> “Jimmy!”</p><p> “Mine’s Jenkins.”</p><p> Gravely he extended his hand, and as</p><p>Jimmy took it, he perceived that the man </p><p>was not wholly free from drink. </p><p> “I’ll tell you, Jimmy, I don’t b’long here,</p><p>no more’n a rabbit. I five up Nevada </p><p>City way, and then some, way back where </p><p>the world all stands up on edge, and there </p><p>ain’t nothing but rocks and trees and wild </p><p>things and—and God. A miner I am, </p><p>placer-miner, one-man claim, but it pays. </p><p>And say, kid, I’m so plumb lonesome for </p><p>them old hills that-” </p><p> He waved his hand generally in the</p><p>direction from which Jimmy had come. </p><p> “Seems like in town I got to have some</p><p>company. But I’m goin’ back in the </p><p>mornin’, so — d’ye really want to square </p><p>this up?” </p><p> “Sure,” said Jimmy, since promises cost</p><p>nothing. </p><p> “Well, you just pass it along, then.</p><p>When you see a fellow that ain’t got no </p><p>chance, like you hadn’t, you just pass along </p><p>any little help you can scrape up, and the </p><p>dollar, too, if he needs it. That’ll make it </p><p>square far as I’m concerned. Will you do </p><p>it?” </p><p> “I—I—sure.” Jimmy was conscious</p><p>of feeling unpleasantly and uncharacteris- </p><p>tically solemn. </p><p> “That’s all right, then.” Jimmy was</p><p>edging away. “So long.” </p><p> “So long,” said Jimmy. And, “So long,</p><p>Hick,” he flung over his shoulder as he </p><p>retreated. </p><p> Probably it was perversity that made</p><p>him add that last derisive word; but some- </p><p>thing else than perversity caused him to </p><p>Square </p><p>85 </p><p>voice it so the miner could by no means </p><p>have heard it. </p><p> Then Jimmy was running up the street,</p><p>worried a little by the delay, but with cer- </p><p>tain other strange emotions crowding his </p><p>heart, too. Promises made in such a case </p><p>certainly meant nothing, but as certainly </p><p>there was something about this one that </p><p>clung to his mind. Maybe it was the </p><p>miner’s use of the word “square,” since </p><p>squareness was Jimmy’s one rule of life. </p><p>To be square to the gang—but my, how </p><p>the miner had twisted the meaning of the </p><p>word! </p><p> “When you see a man that ain’t got no</p><p>chance-” </p><p> What chance would the dude have—the</p><p>dude with the plethoric bankroll in the </p><p>annexation of which Jimmie’s present </p><p>errand was to end? The same chance that </p><p>any of his predecessors had had, to be </p><p>drugged, dragged out, robbed, and left to </p><p>the mercy of the black alley. Jimmy </p><p>thought with a rather twisted smile how </p><p>quickly he could redeem his promise if he </p><p>chose. </p><p>PRESENTLY Jimmy, still with his </p><p>thoughts unpleasantly confused, </p><p>turned into Pacific Street, hurried </p><p>up that thoroughfare for a block and a half, </p><p>and then into a narrow passageway. Up </p><p>a certain rickety flight of steps he climbed </p><p>to the second story, rapped softly on a door, </p><p>and muttered a password. The door </p><p>opened, he entered, and came out a minute </p><p>later with a tiny bottle in his hand. </p><p> As he started down the steps he dropped</p><p>that bottle, as he had been taught, over </p><p>the balustrade upon a little space of soft </p><p>mud that received it without a sound. He </p><p>had done this many times before, super- </p><p>caution it had seemed; but this time the </p><p>trick served him well. For as he reached </p><p>the ground a heavy hand came out from </p><p>behind the stairs and gripped him. </p><p> “Where is it?”</p><p> “Where’s what? Le’ me loose.”</p><p> “The dope. Come, quick with it.”</p><p> A detective had him. A plain-clothes</p><p>“dick”, arch-enemy, and by Jimmy’s creed </p><p>despised of all true men. A muscular, </p><p>middle-aged, heavy-set man, with a black </p><p>mustache and a harsh and threatening </p><p>voice. </p><p> “I ain’t got no dope. Le’ me go.”</p><p> “We’ll see about that.”</p><p> The search was intimate and thorough,</p><p>but it revealed nothing but a broken- </p><p>bladed pocket-knife and a dog-eared story- </p><p>book. </p><p> “What did you want with that Chink?”</p><p> “Hendricks sent me up to pay him some</p><p>money, s’elp me.” </p><p> “The old story,” said the detective. “A</p><p>lie, of course, but we can’t raid every Chino </p><p>joint in town. And then there’s the drug- </p><p>stores. See here, Jimmy.” His voice </p><p>changed to the cajoling note. “You’d </p><p>better cough up.” </p><p> “What yer talkin’ about?”</p><p> “You know, all right. You’re clean this</p><p>time, but we’ve got your number. And </p><p>the chief’s passed the word the game’s got </p><p>to be stopped. You’re runnin’ with a </p><p>smooth gang, but we’ll get ’em, and you </p><p>with ’em, and you’re too fine a lad to go to </p><p>quod. There’s fifty dollars cash in it for </p><p>tellin’ us what you know, and a good job </p><p>besides, and I’ll-” </p><p> Jimmy’s little frame stiffened and anger</p><p>and contempt came into his voice. </p><p> “You go chase yerself. Bet yer was a</p><p>-stool yerself before-” </p><p> “Aw, I was, eh?”</p><p> Cruelty flourishes where men prey upon</p><p>men and in turn are preyed upon. The </p><p>detective’s back-hand blow caught Jimmy </p><p>and knocked him sprawling, and Jimmy, </p><p>scrambling to his feet, knew he was lucky</p><p>to have escaped so easily. </p><p> “Get along with you,” rasped the de-</p><p>tective. “I’ll see you with nippers on, and </p><p>in the reform school,” </p><p> Jimmy went, reeling from the effect of</p><p>the blow, and quivering all over. He went </p><p>as far as the end of the alley. There he </p><p>hid, and when he was sure the coast was </p><p>clear, came back and retrieved the bottle. </p><p>Then he ran as fast as he could back to the </p><p>Cobweb. </p><p> He went through the side door into the</p><p>office, signaled the bartender, and Hen- </p><p>dricks came out. </p><p> “A devil of a fly boy you are! What</p><p>kept you? But give me the peter.” </p><p> His harshness didn’t hurt Jimmy, how-</p><p>ever, for later he could explain the delay </p><p>and win praise. And though Jimmy’s </p><p>head still throbbed, he rather liked to feel </p><p>the throbbing. It reminded him that </p><p>under pressure of fear and a bribe enor- </p><p>mous he had kept faith. But the scene he </p><p>knew was to follow inside the dance-hall </p><p>86 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>drew him with an unpleasant fascination. </p><p>Presently he followed Hendricks and crept </p><p>cautiously—for there was a silly police </p><p>prohibition against his presence in the bar- </p><p>room—to the end of the bar. </p><p> Try as he would, Jimmy had not yet</p><p>learned to like this part of the game. He </p><p>was not gifted in self-analysis, and the </p><p>stirring of his not yet dead moral sense </p><p>went unrecognized; but there was some- </p><p>thing about it from which he shrank. It </p><p>was easy money, it was fairly safe, it was </p><p>the practise of the gang, and he had accus- </p><p>tomed himself to join in their merriment </p><p>over it. But—well, Jimmy’s was as yet a </p><p>boy’s inquiring mind, and he sometimes </p><p>wondered, with all the talk of squareness, </p><p>to whom the gang was really square. </p><p> Things in the Cobweb were about as</p><p>usual, men and women dancing, men and </p><p>women drinking, determined light-hearted- </p><p>ness everywhere, and all sadness prohibited, </p><p>except perhaps in the make-believe human </p><p>heart. And Jimmy, with just the slightest </p><p>cloud upon his own spirit, peered around </p><p>among the tables until he caught sight of </p><p>Hendricks. </p><p> Hendricks had already taken his seat</p><p>and was beckoning a waiter, affability per- </p><p>sonified. There were three other men at </p><p>his table; two of them Jimmy knew as </p><p>Hendricks’ usual confederates in affairs like </p><p>this, “Red Sam” and McCarthy. But the </p><p>intended victim sat on the other side of </p><p>Hendricks, and Jimmy could see only liis </p><p>forearms, lying loosely on the table. </p><p> But at sight of those forearms Jimmy</p><p>started. Clearly the program had changed </p><p>in his absence, for they were not the fore- </p><p>arms of a dude. They were heavy, power- </p><p>ful, and roughly garmented—and then </p><p>Jimmy gasped, for Hendricks had moved </p><p>in his chair, and the face of his prey was </p><p>revealed. </p><p> The waiter was coming with the drinks.</p><p>On Hendricks’ face was a smiling mask; he </p><p>was talking smoothly, jocularly, entertain- </p><p>ingly, as he knew so well how to talk. And </p><p>—no, there could be no mistake—the man </p><p>who listened to Hendricks with a broad</p><p>smile of good-fellowship on his sunburned </p><p>face was Jenkins, the stalwart miner. </p><p> Jenkins, the man who had rescued</p><p>Jimmy and befriended him without need, </p><p>the man whose hearty voice and wholesome </p><p>words still rang in Jimmy’s ears and stirred </p><p>his heart. Jenkins, who had made possible </p><p>the success of Jimmy’s errand, and by that </p><p>act made possible his own undoing. </p><p> And Jimmy? Jimmy’s face whitened,</p><p>tautened. His eyes widened, his lips parted </p><p>as though for a warning cry. And then a </p><p>dark angel whispered in his ear, and he </p><p>grinned. </p><p> A joke it was, the finest joke the Cobweb</p><p>had ever known. The jest of a man being </p><p>hoisted by his own petard, being poisoned </p><p>by the draft which his own money had </p><p>bought. Such a fine humorous sense had </p><p>Jimmy’s gang given him—and to an under- </p><p>standing heart the smile on Jimmy’s face </p><p>would have been sadder than any tears. </p><p> A comic twist to the little drama of the</p><p>night—but, still grinning, Jimmy found </p><p>himself coming forward between the tables, </p><p>and as to the force that impelled him to do </p><p>this he could not have given a guess. </p><p>What was it the miner had said? </p><p> “When you see a man that ain’t got no</p><p>chance-” </p><p>Tip] THE waiter placed the foaming </p><p>Ijjlj glasses. He placed them with care- </p><p>■*—ful carelessness, the miner’s glass </p><p>well to his right, almost before Hendricks. </p><p>He placed them so that Hendricks had </p><p>only to lean forward, and the miner’s glass </p><p>would be hidden from the man who was to </p><p>drink it. And then. . . . </p><p> Jimmy remembered that in the dark</p><p>alley he had given the miner his hand. But </p><p>the gang were Jimmy’s pals. The grin had </p><p>quite faded from Jimmy’s lips by now. </p><p> “A man that ain’t got no chance!”</p><p> Drugged, dragged out, robbed, and left</p><p>lying like a corpse, all in the name of friend- </p><p>ship, in pretense of caring for one suddenly </p><p>overcome by drink—that was the chance </p><p>that would be given the miner. Then in</p><p>the morning the terrible awakening. </p><p>Money gone, brain muddled, the horrible </p><p>reaction of drug and drink upon him, </p><p>memory of this present scene like an inco- </p><p>herent nightmare—what chance would he </p><p>have even then for redress against men who </p><p>could buy alibis with their cigars? </p><p> Jimmy saw a tense, alert look flash into</p><p>the eyes and across the smiling faces of </p><p>McCarthy and Red Sam. He saw Hen- </p><p>dricks bend over to the miner’s ear in a </p><p>confidential whisper, and raise his right </p><p>hand swiftly. In the palm of that hand </p><p>lay the tiny vial of deadly chloral hydrate. </p><p>At that all the good that still lived in the </p><p>Square </p><p>87 </p><p>boy roused itself in one last passionate </p><p>appeal—the appeal of a terrible memory. </p><p> To be dragged out, robbed, and left to</p><p>lie like a corpse! Jimmy remembered one </p><p>victim of this most humorous game that </p><p>had lain like a corpse indeed. He remem- </p><p>bered the shuddering fear of the gang at the </p><p>sight of the black headlines next morning. </p><p>And then he did that which seemed to him, </p><p>in the doing, to be unreal and fantastic as </p><p>a dream. </p><p> Past two crowded tables he leaped, and,</p><p>just as Hendricks’ hand poised itself above </p><p>the miner’s glass, Jimmy caromed with all </p><p>the force of his young body against Hen- </p><p>dricks’ elbow. And he saw the thin, color- </p><p>less liquid spill itself, not into the miner’s </p><p>glass, but upon the table. </p><p> With the sickening knowledge that his</p><p>■world was wrecked, Jimmy saw the miner, </p><p>perceiving in a glance what had been about </p><p>to happen to him, spring to his feet. </p><p> “Damnation!” cried Hendricks, and then</p><p>the miner struck him in the mouth. </p><p> From all sides men came running, for the</p><p>most part friends of Hendricks. Chairs </p><p>and tables crashed over in a general pande- </p><p>monium. McCarthy swung at the miner, </p><p>missed him; but Red Sam gripped him </p><p>about the waist. The miner seized an </p><p>empty beer-glass. </p><p> “Dey’ll kill you, Hick,” cried Jimmy.</p><p>“Dey’ll kill you.” </p><p> The out-of-doors man, swiftly aware of</p><p>his peril, shattered the rim of his beer-glass </p><p>with one blow on the edge of the over- </p><p>turned table. The resultant ragged, pro- </p><p>jecting edges made it a terrible weapon. </p><p>He raised it against Red Sam’s face, and </p><p>the man released him and leaped back. </p><p> The miner whirled and sprang toward</p><p>the door. Jimmy, who had hovered on the </p><p>outskirts of the group, started after him. </p><p>Hendricks tried to reach Jimmy with his </p><p>fist, but the blow fell short. Half-way to </p><p>the door the miner checked himself, and, </p><p>seizing Jimmy, pushed him ahead of him</p><p>into the street. </p><p> He flung the swinging-doors back with</p><p>such terrible force that the foremost of his </p><p>pursuers were knocked off their feet. But </p><p>there was no need of that. Once in the </p><p>street they were safe enough. Provided </p><p>they kept out of the shadows they were </p><p>safe. The miner, with one arm flung about </p><p>Jimmy’s shoulder, started down the middle </p><p>of the street. </p><p> But what was this? Jimmy’s shoulder</p><p>was quivering under his touch. The boy </p><p>was sobbing. </p><p> “It’s all right, kid, all right, Jimmy,” the</p><p>miner said, reassuringly. </p><p> But to Jimmy it was not all right. It</p><p>was, indeed, all wrong. For to him who </p><p>had periled his life to save the man who </p><p>had succored him had come the unutterable </p><p>loneliness that only an unprotected boy </p><p>can feel, and not unfounded fear of the </p><p>vengeance of the gang that had been his, </p><p>and, worst of all, remorse. And he an- </p><p>swered with something like a curse. </p><p> Puzzled, the miner questioned him.</p><p>“What’s the matter? Everything’s all </p><p>right. And that was the gamest tiling, the </p><p>squarest tiling-” </p><p> “Square!” cried Jimmy, thinking angrily</p><p>that for this stranger’s sake he had crossed </p><p>his only friends and trampled his one creed </p><p>into the mire. “Square! The-it was!” </p><p> But an hour later Jimmy was seated on</p><p>a bench in Portsmouth Square with a man </p><p>who was no longer a stranger. They had </p><p>talked of many tilings—the miner had got </p><p>a pretty clear idea of Jimmy’s life and the </p><p>shadows through which his soul had wan- </p><p>dered—but principally they had talked of </p><p>the crooked trail of the man who would be </p><p>square to those who are square to no one </p><p>else. And the end of their talk was this: </p><p>“Listen, Jimmy,” said the miner. “May- </p><p>be you saved my life tonight, and maybe </p><p>not; but anyway, it ain’t any reward I’m </p><p>offerin’ you. It’s darn lonesome up there </p><p>in the hills, and I sure would like you to </p><p>say yes. You better come with me, out</p><p>where the birds sing and the trees grow, </p><p>and there ain’t nothing in earth or heaven </p><p>you need to be square to—except just the </p><p>whole world.” </p><p> Jimmy, in whose mind a vision of a new</p><p>life had already begun to unfold, could </p><p>only reply faintly— </p><p> “You—yer kiddin’ me.”</p><p> “Am I?” said the miner. “We’ll see.”</p><p>And so Jimmy, waif of the streets, came </p><p>out into the world of larger loyalty. </p><p>FORI </p><p>I	■ W I</p><p> \ul n I \ Hi</p><p> II	rl\m</p><p>}i'3 </p><p>^LAG! </p><p>. pH’s	- ■ ■ =</p><p>,iW </p><p>:;l.i •• ;/ • . f? : • </p><p>Bflllll </p><p>M </p><p> ■IKlto&amp;iL</p><p>pmK </p><p>v *v </p><p>:f ■ v </p><p>" • ■  •' •. *r  </p><p>'  </p><p> I?'/  • !i  </p><p>' « *. \ ’  ’ 'i  </p><p>:? an  • iY  •i'.:</p><p> • * a</p><p>t &gt; '? ;•  * ,  ti;!</p><p>, f\l  &gt;j;;:</p><p>&gt;*w  Hi  </p><p>I * ---  </p><p>. •..•Vi:  </p><p>•‘‘-SAI  </p><p>m  </p><p>i;n Wi </p><p>in'?i 9M« </p><p>fciS; tflpi </p><p>A POUR • !V\ </p><p>SXORV,? PART THREE </p><p>rQ&gt;j/ THOMAS ADDISON </p><p> Author of "The Boss of Powdermlle,” “G-2 Defective,” etc.</p><p> The first part of the story briefly retold in story form</p><p>■pATE pulls the strings of human destinies and </p><p>A the puppets at the ends of them move in igno- </p><p>rance of the force they are elected to serve.</p><p> Such a victim was James Perry, Jr., of Norfolk,</p><p>Virginia. Convalescing from pneumonia he sailed </p><p>South and landed at Cortina, the seat of Govern- </p><p>ment of Zanhoria, Central America, the early part of </p><p>April. </p><p> By a darkened bedroom window in her home in</p><p>the Calle Dolores, Winifred Brewer stood look- </p><p>ing out across the public park. It was eleven </p><p>o'clock, the hour of retiring. A man’s white-flan- </p><p>nelcd figure loomed in the rays of a street lamp. </p><p>As he passed a poinsettia thicket a hand shot out. </p><p>The man fell. Hands dragged the body swiftly </p><p>into the bushes. </p><p> Screaming, the girl ran downstairs, and out into</p><p>the street. She did not stop for her father, who, </p><p>alarmed at her outcry, had appeared in the hall </p><p>below. In the street Winifred ran into Enrique </p><p>Segovia. Together they searched the park and </p><p>found Jimmy Perry prone under some bushes. </p><p>Perry’s head was bleeding from the blow. He had </p><p>been robbed. </p><p> In Walter Brewer’s home Jimmy’s wound was</p><p>treated. He introduced himself to his host and </p><p>rescuers. Leaving the house, Enrique asked </p><p>Jimmy if the latter remembered reading of a Wil- </p><p>liam Bowman, a Richmond real-estate dealer, who </p><p>had absconded recently with a quarter of a </p><p>million dollars. Jimmy did. </p><p> Apprehended by the police, Juan Lopez, Jimmy’s</p><p>assailant, disclosed information that led officials </p><p>to believe the Germans were trying to cause trouble </p><p>between Zanhoria and the United States. Jimmy </p><p>and Enrique planned, with the aid of officials, to </p><p>checkmate the conspiracy. </p><p> Intent on calling on Miss Brewer, Jimmy was told</p><p>she and her father had deserted the house in the </p><p>Calle Dolores. </p><p>AT THE Banco Nacional, Jimmy and Enrique </p><p>conversed with Sefior Morales, the bank presi- </p><p>dent, and were introduced to Miss Mary Taylor, a </p><p>traveler and author. Miss Taylor was the guest </p><p>of Senor and Dona Morales, having just arrived </p><p>from Guatemala. </p><p> Mopping the perspiration from his face, Senor</p><p>Morales flipped from his pocket a card, bearing the </p><p>letters “D—VIII—K.” Jimmy picked it up and </p><p>returned it to the banker. </p><p> From the bank, Jimmy went to the American</p><p>Legation to call on the Hon. John Henry Lane, </p><p>United States Minister to Zanhoria. </p><p> Closeted with the minister Jimmy asked him to</p><p>send in the official code to Washington a letter to his </p><p>father. Mr. Lane granted the request. Jimmy ex- </p><p>plained what he had learned about the German </p><p>conspiracy. </p><p> In the street again, Jimmy saw Winifred Brewer</p><p>drive by in an automobile and stop at a pharmacy. </p><p>He hastened to her and petitioned her and her </p><p>father’s assistance to foil the German plot. She </p><p>pledged herself to the cause. </p><p>88 </p><p>For The Flag	89</p><p> The Brewers’ new home, she told Jimmy, was at the</p><p>Rafael Fernandez hacienda on the Santa Maria Road. </p><p> Shortly after President Wilson made his speech,</p><p>prior to the United States’ declaration of war on </p><p>Germany, Jimmy, Enrique, Don Luis Valera, Secre- </p><p>tary of State, and Don Emilio Ortega, Slate Super- </p><p>intendent of Police, questioned Lopez about what </p><p>he knew of the conspiracy. </p><p> Lopez told of secret meetings of five mysterious</p><p>men at Senor Morales’ home. From his descrip- </p><p>tion one of the conspirators was recognized as Herr </p><p>Adolph Kaufman, the German minister. At this </p><p>juncture, Jimmy told of the card bearing the letters </p><p>“D—VIII—K.” </p><p> “Ah!” said Enrique. “It is simple. D stands</p><p>for Domingo (Sunday). Thus, Domingo—the </p><p>eighth—Kaufman. Kaufman writes to Morales </p><p>from Arraca and sets a date for their meeting.” </p><p>Arraca was a German lumber camp on the Rio </p><p>Negro River. </p><p> Zanhoria’s sympathies, Senor Valera explained,</p><p>were with the United States, and the German </p><p>scheme was to overthrow President Hurango of the </p><p>republic and place a German sympathizer at the </p><p>head of the Government. By this means, Kaufman </p><p>hoped to foment revolutions in Central America </p><p>and thus divert a part of the United States’ forces </p><p>from her allies abroad. </p><p> The proposal to kidnap Kaufman was then made</p><p>by Jimmy. He called on Brewer to obtain the use </p><p>of the hacienda as a prison for the German minister. </p><p>Brewer consented. While on the way to the haci- </p><p>enda, Jimmy met Mary Taylor, who broached him </p><p>for a ride in his automobile. He declined gracefully. </p><p> Driving away from the Brewer place, Jimmy</p><p>passed Miss Taylor, out riding in Senor Morales’ </p><p>car. She nodded to the American. </p><p> “I lied to her and she caught me,” wailed Jimmy</p><p>as he sped toward Cortina. </p><p>CEATED at a table in the dining-room of the </p><p>Europa, Cortina’s hotel, were Billy Smith and </p><p>Jimmy. An automobile bearing Miss Taylor and </p><p>Segovia stopped at the entrance. </p><p> “Ha! I know that girl,” exclaimed Billy, point-</p><p>ing at Miss Taylor. “I ran across her at the Gatun </p><p>Lodes Sunday.” </p><p> “You must be wrong,” replied Jimmy, “the news-</p><p>paper La Cronica says she just arrived here from </p><p>Guatemala.” </p><p>CHAPTER XVII </p><p>KIDNAPED </p><p>CLOSED car awaited them. </p><p>The door opened as they ap- </p><p>proached. </p><p>“Step in, Jimmy,” said a </p><p>voice from within. </p><p> It was Ortega’s.</p><p> The two entered, and the machine glided</p><p> away. Where they were going neither</p><p> knew nor asked.</p><p>“What is this about Enrique, Don Emi- </p><p>lio?” inquired Jimmy anxiously. </p><p> Later in the afternoon Kaufman and several</p><p>reservist officers of the German army were quar- </p><p>tered at the club-house at Arraca. Kaufman was </p><p>talking. He said: </p><p> “Senor Morales has been ordered to call his</p><p>committee Sunday night for a final consultation. </p><p>After that we shall hear from General Peralta and </p><p>then strike. On the night of the designated day </p><p>Captain Karsch will seize the cable station at </p><p>Puerto Mono and cover Peralta’s landing with </p><p>machine guns. We shall take Cortina by surprise </p><p>under cover of darkness. Our U-boat will attend </p><p>to the Zanliorian navy.” </p><p> That evening Kaufman returned to Cortina to</p><p>meet Miss Pricz. After he left Arraca the following </p><p>telegram was sent to Cortina: </p><p>Look for package on Arraca train tonight. </p><p> The next day Mrs. Rebecca Isaacs of New York,</p><p>who said she was searching for a lost uncle, visited </p><p>the German legation. </p><p> Then came to the Europa, Segovia with news</p><p>that a State paper had been stolen from Luis </p><p>Valera’s office. He and Jimmy hastened to the </p><p>office. There evidence was adduced proving that </p><p>Segovia and Miss Taylor had been the only two </p><p>persons in the room before the paper had been </p><p>missed. </p><p> Suspicion was fastened on Miss Taylor, which</p><p>Segovia resented. While at the conference Senor</p><p>Ortega received the Arraca message. </p><p> An unsigned message also was received by Sefior</p><p>Ortega the following day. It stated that there </p><p>was a secret wireless plant at the German legation, </p><p>and one at Arraca also. </p><p> While standing in front of a renting-agency in</p><p>the Calle Grande, Mrs. Isaacs saw Miss Taylor </p><p>drive by in an automobile. She signaled the driver </p><p>to stop and then advanced to the running- </p><p>board of the car. She and Miss Taylor talked for </p><p>several minutes. </p><p> After a call from Jimmy at the American legation,</p><p>Lane announced that Billy had resigned. </p><p> Jimmy and Billy were at the hotel when a messen-</p><p>ger arrived with the news that Enrique had been </p><p>injured in an encounter and desired to see Jimmy. </p><p> “We’ll go,” declared Jimmy. “Come on, Billy.”</p><p>And the two slipped into the street where a car </p><p>awaited them. </p><p> He was not quite certain that he had in-</p><p>terpreted the summons aright. The su- </p><p>perintendent laughed reassuringly. </p><p> “Not a word of truth in it, Jixnmy. An</p><p>excuse to get you out. Enrique is by this </p><p>time on the roof of the Valdera warehouse </p><p>in the rear of the German legation. The </p><p>party-wall extends four feet above the roof, </p><p>an excellent screen for him.” He held out </p><p>his hand to Billy. “Good evening, Mr. </p><p>Smith. How are you, sir?” </p><p> He retained the boy’s hand a shade</p><p>longer than the occasion seemed to require. </p><p>Billy sensed the reason. </p><p> “If it’s not just steady, sir, it’s not</p><p>90 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>nerves. It’s excitement,” he said apolo- </p><p>getically. “I’m a little tuned up, that’s all.” </p><p>Ortega released his hand, smiling to </p><p>himself. </p><p> “You’ll do,” he remarked. He went on,</p><p>very seriously now. “I want to say briefly </p><p>that this enterprise you are engaging in is </p><p>attended with a danger I won’t attempt to </p><p>minimize. If you fail Kaufman will in- </p><p>voke all the power of his Government to </p><p>have you punished, unless he takes the law </p><p>in his own hands and shoots you down in </p><p>your tracks. He is a resolute, violent man, </p><p>and he would kill you, I believe, without the </p><p>slightest hesitation.” </p><p> “I wouldn’t blame him,” said Jimmy</p><p>coolly. “I would do it if any one tried to </p><p>get away with me.” </p><p> “If he isn’t good we’ll spank him,” put</p><p>in Billy gleefully. </p><p> Don Emilio, mightily pleased, noted that</p><p>the pair was not even considering the pos- </p><p>sibility of failure. </p><p> “We are stopping. Where are we?”</p><p>queried Jimmy. </p><p> “A patrol-box. I am going to telephone.</p><p>Just a moment, boys.” </p><p> Ortega stepped out. Jimmy took a look</p><p>around from the door, but he could not </p><p>determine in what part of the city they were. </p><p>The superintendent came back. He gave a </p><p>direction to the driver, and the machine </p><p>darted off. Soon it was going at express </p><p>speed. There was none to forbid, for the </p><p>body of the law sat inside and ruled. </p><p>Ortega spoke. </p><p> “Herr Kaufman’s limousine has left its</p><p>garage in the Calle Rosario with lights out. </p><p>Three minutes ago. The minister is in it. </p><p>He took the Avenida Corona. That means </p><p>that he will come out on the Santa Marta </p><p>Road, travel south, turn east over the </p><p>Arroyo Rebelde, and so into the Avenida </p><p>Alejanrino.” </p><p> “And then?” Jimmy shot the question at</p><p>him.</p><p> “One of three things must happen after</p><p>Kaufman enters the house. Otto Stoll, </p><p>the chauffeur, will turn back over the bridge </p><p>and drive around for a fixed time; or he will </p><p>go east on the avenue in the same purpose; </p><p>or he will wait in front of the house until </p><p>Kaufman comes out. I don’t think he </p><p>will do the second. He will probably do </p><p>the first. Yet he may do the third. It is </p><p>late, it is dark, and there are no houses </p><p>near.” </p><p> “And if he does the first or the second?”</p><p>interrogated Jimmy. </p><p> “He will be stopped. A drunken man</p><p>will stagger into his path. There will be </p><p>trouble—a fight. Both will be arrested </p><p>and locked up for the night, and you will </p><p>get possession of the car. But if Otto </p><p>waits at the house it is not so simple. A </p><p>commotion will bring Kaufman out.” </p><p> Billy caught him up.</p><p> “And there’s where I’ll come in. You</p><p>take care of Otto, and I’ll meet Kaufman </p><p>with a story to account for my being at the </p><p>wheel. He doesn’t know me.” </p><p> Ortega lifted the curtain at his side and</p><p>peered out. A street-lamp flashed by, and </p><p>they were again in the dark. </p><p> “This is the Avenida Bella Vista,” he</p><p>informed them. “It is just south of the </p><p>Avenida Alejandrino, and is built up only </p><p>a short distance. We have passed the last </p><p>light. We shall come presently to an open </p><p>field—ah, we have reached it!” </p><p> The car slowed down. It turned off to</p><p>the right, bumped along a few yards, and </p><p>came to a stand. </p><p> “We will get out here,” said Ortega.</p><p> The car had brought up midway of an</p><p>unpaved, weed-choked street that formed </p><p>a connecting-link between the two avenues. </p><p>Trees lined it, but there were no buildings. </p><p>Ortega addressed a few words to his driver, </p><p>after which, with a low “Come” to the boys, </p><p>he struck off diagonally across the field to </p><p>hisjeft. Jimmy and Billy followed. Billy </p><p>held the box of cigars clutched to him. </p><p>THEY came at length to the grove </p><p>of conifers that fronted Morales’ </p><p>house on the south side of the avenue. </p><p>As they plunged into it a man stepped out </p><p>from the shelter of a tree. Jimmy’s hand </p><p>went to his pistol, but he saw that Ortega </p><p>was not disconcerted by the apparition. </p><p>He advanced to the man and held a short </p><p>conference with him. At its close the man </p><p>slipped away into the darkness. Ortega </p><p>returned. </p><p> “It is all right,” he said. “We have ar-</p><p>rived in time.” </p><p> “I say, Don Emilio,” submitted Jimmy,</p><p>“suppose those others come—the rest of </p><p>‘the five’? We can’t wait in front of the </p><p>house for Kaufman if they do.” </p><p> “Move to this side, and say nothing,”</p><p>Ortega replied. “My men will take care </p><p>of the other cars. But I’ve really no hope </p><p>For The Flag	91</p><p>of such good fortune. Herr Kaufman </p><p>doesn’t want a debating society on his hands </p><p>tonight. He will tell Morales what to do, </p><p>and Morales will pass the word along.” He </p><p>added: “Miss Taylor went out early in </p><p>the evening, and has not returned. She </p><p>was walking.” </p><p> “What do you think of it?” Jimmy asked</p><p>him. </p><p> “I’m not thinking. I shall have a report</p><p>on her later. She was followed. ” </p><p> They were quiet after this, standing well</p><p>back among the trees, their ears strained </p><p>to catch what sound the night might bring </p><p>from the west. The bell of La Caridad </p><p>beat distantly on the still air. Twelve o’- </p><p>clock. A while longer they stood. </p><p> “Ola!"</p><p> It was Ortega calling attention to a shape</p><p>looming in the street. It came nearer, </p><p>purring gently, and stopped directly across </p><p>from them. A smaller shape detached </p><p>itself from the larger and moved toward the </p><p>house. They could hear the soft tapping </p><p>of leather on stone accented with a curious </p><p>regularity—tip-tap, tip-tap. The house- </p><p>door opened, and a man’s figure was re- </p><p>vealed in the faint light of the hall. Then </p><p>the door closed. </p><p> A bur-r-r came from the machine. It</p><p>moved off, described a half-circle, and </p><p>went west. </p><p> ‘•'Quick!” hissed Ortega to the boys.</p><p> He raced through the trees, running in</p><p>a divergent line from the street. When he </p><p>was out of the grove he waved high above </p><p>his head an electric-torch three times. </p><p>But he did not check his steps, and they </p><p>went on till they came to the intersecting </p><p>by-way. Their car was already there in </p><p>response to Ortega’s signal. They tumbled </p><p>into it, and sat panting for breath. </p><p> “What are we waiting for?” gasped</p><p>Jimmy as the machine throbbed under them </p><p>but did not stir. </p><p> “To give the others time. We don’t</p><p>want to come up until they have taken</p><p>Otto away.” </p><p> For five minutes by Ortega’s watch they</p><p>stayed where they were. Then— </p><p> “Vayase!” he barked at the man in front.</p><p> It was at the east end of the bridge that</p><p>they came upon the limousine. A man </p><p>saluted as they drew up. Ortega ex- </p><p>changed a few hurried words with him, and </p><p>they got out into the road. </p><p> “Stoll kicked up a row, but they quieted</p><p>him,” said Ortega grimly. “Can you man- </p><p>age this machine of Kaufman’s?” he asked </p><p>of Billy. </p><p> “Sure. I can drive it in my sleep.”</p><p>“Try it out—over the bridge and turn. </p><p>You haven’t many minutes to spare, it may </p><p>be.” </p><p> Billy jumped into the driver’s seat.</p><p>“’Ware there!” he cried to the man in the </p><p>road. </p><p> He switched on the head-lights for the</p><p>bridge, crossed it, and tore into the night. </p><p> “Jimmy,” said Ortega gravely, “it all</p><p>rests with you now.” </p><p> “Right you are, Don Emilio,” Jimmy re-</p><p>joined cheerfully. “Don’t worry. You’ll </p><p>hear from me before day. Where shall </p><p>Billy leave the car?” </p><p> “Some one will be waiting here for it.</p><p>Don’t let Mr. Smith delay. I shall want </p><p>to know how you got along.” </p><p> Billy was coming back. He shut off</p><p>his lights after crossing the bridge, and came </p><p>to a stop. </p><p> “Runs smooth as silk,” he remarked.</p><p>“I haven’t forgotten the cigars, Jimmy. </p><p>They’re on the seat with me.” He sniggered </p><p>mischievously. “I hope our guest will </p><p>like the brand.” </p><p> The policeman standing near muttered</p><p>something to himself. Cigars! They were </p><p>thinking of in a time like this, these Ameri- </p><p>cans! </p><p> “You must go,” said Ortega. “Good</p><p>luck, my friends. I will stay here till you </p><p>pass. Should anything happen that you </p><p>can’t control fire one shot. I will come, </p><p>no matter what the cost.” </p><p> He wrung their hands. Jimmy got in,</p><p>and Billy let the car slide easily away. </p><p>He made a turn when he came to Morales’ </p><p>house, and came up to the walk headed for </p><p>the bridge. A dim fight showed over the </p><p>door; otherwise the place was dark for all </p><p>they could see. At least fifteen minutes </p><p>had passed since Kaufman entered the </p><p>house. He might not issue from it for half </p><p>an hour—an hour—longer even. It was </p><p>this uncertainty, the delayed action, that </p><p>bore heavily on the two. One thing, </p><p>however, seemed assured. There were to </p><p>be no other visitors this night. </p><p> They talked in hushed tones, Jimmy de-</p><p>tailing to Billy the procedure he had deter- </p><p>mined on. Then he pushed the door open </p><p>noiselessly, and squatted on the rear seat </p><p>next to the walk like a frog ready to leap. </p><p>92 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>From the heart of the city after a time </p><p>came the sentinel call of the great church- </p><p>bell. One stroke. </p><p> “Is that one o’clock or half-past twelve?</p><p>It seems a year,” whispered Billy. </p><p> “The half-after,” Jimmy answered.</p><p> They fell silent again. Jimmy stretched</p><p>himself out on the seat to ease his stiffened </p><p>legs. The minutes passed. Again the </p><p>clock boomed. </p><p> “Tsitl” Billy gave a warning sound.</p><p> The house-door was opening.</p><p> Jimmy cautiously drew himself up to his</p><p>former crouching posture, every nerve taut </p><p>as a fiddle-string. The door closed, and </p><p>the limping-tap of leather on stone followed. </p><p>Kaufman was coming to his car. He was </p><p>muttering to himself in German, angrily </p><p>it seemed. Something had gone wrong </p><p>with him. </p><p> His short, paunchy form was at the car</p><p>now. His foot was on the running-board. </p><p>His head came in at the door, then his shoul- </p><p>ders, stooped to clear the lintel. His eyes </p><p>were directed to the supposed Otto sitting </p><p>at the wheel. He was in the act of giving </p><p>him a command when one hundred and </p><p>fifty pounds of solid beef and bone crashed </p><p>down on his neck and flattened him to the </p><p>floor. At the precise instant the car </p><p>started off, the door swinging wide, and the </p><p>Imperial German envoy’s feet kicking the </p><p>air outside. </p><p> “Easy as two and two,” crowed Billy</p><p>softly. </p><p>JIMMY snapped on the ceiling- </p><p>light. He had one minute in which </p><p>to do the work he meditated. </p><p>Kaufman’s wind was knocked out of him, </p><p>but he would be getting it back, and the </p><p>trouble would begin. Jimmy felt for one of </p><p>the German’s hands, found it, jerked it </p><p>rudely up over his spine, and slipped it into </p><p>the noose of a stout cord he had laid out </p><p>carefully on the seat in advance. He found </p><p>the other hand and bound if securely to</p><p>the first. </p><p> “Hey, what’s the matter?” he yelped at</p><p>Billy, and snapped off the light. </p><p> The car had stopped at the bridge. Billy</p><p>spoke to some one in the street. His voice </p><p>was coolly urgent. </p><p> “Shut that door, please. We’ve got a</p><p>sick man inside.” </p><p> The Imperial Minister was shoved un-</p><p>gently on his nose to the farthest limit of </p><p>the floor, and the door closed against his </p><p>protesting feet. Kaufman bellowed in in- </p><p>articulate rage, crazed with the misad- </p><p>venture that had befallen him. </p><p> They passed the cane huts that fringed</p><p>the city, and took up the Santa Marta </p><p>Road. Jimmy switched on the ceiling- </p><p>light again. He bent over Kaufman and </p><p>exerting all his strength raised him, and </p><p>plumped him into the seat-corner. This </p><p>accomplished he ran his hand over his cap- </p><p>tive’s person, and when it came away there </p><p>was a neat hammerless in it. The man </p><p>kicked at him. His heavy-lidded eyes </p><p>shot out venomous sparks. Spittle slimed </p><p>his beard. A great guttural oath broke </p><p>from his snarling lips. </p><p> “What did he say?” Jimmy asked Billy.</p><p>“I’d hate to tell you,” grinned the </p><p>boy. </p><p> He spoke to Kaufman in his own tongue.</p><p>A duel of words followed, and suddenly </p><p>ended. Kaufman had regained in a degree </p><p>his self-control and he had found his En- </p><p>glish. He delivered it at Jimmy. </p><p> “You shall answer for this, you scoundrel!</p><p>Both of you. And bitterly. My person </p><p>is sacred. I represent his Imperial Majesty, </p><p>the Kaiser, at this capital.” </p><p> “I wish,” said Jimmy evenly, “you were</p><p>in actuality that infamous man. Fortunate- </p><p>ly for yourself you are not.” </p><p> “I’ve told him he’s a prisoner of war,”</p><p>offered Billy; “that he has conspired against </p><p>the Government of the United States; and </p><p>that until we have dug up all the deviltry </p><p>he has set agoing he won’t see his happy</p><p>home again.” </p><p>“Bah!” spat out Kaufman. “The city </p><p>will be aroused tomorrow. You will be </p><p>apprehended, punished. I shall see to that. </p><p>You—release my hands! I command you!” </p><p>Jimmy gave him a cold smile. </p><p> “You don’t seem to take us seriously,</p><p>Herr Kaufman. You will do so later. </p><p>That is all I have to say to you now.” </p><p> He settled himself in his corner with the</p><p>minister’s own pistol resting lazily in his </p><p>hand, and ignored the flow of threats di- </p><p>rected at him. They ceased shortly, and </p><p>only the hum of the big machine devouring </p><p>the miles disturbed the silence. </p><p> The dipping down of the car told Jimmy</p><p>that they had come to the ravine on the </p><p>other side of which lay the farm. Billy </p><p>put the car across the shallow stream with </p><p>due care, and swung through the ruined </p><p>For The Flag	93</p><p>gateway. Jimmy looked at the time. It </p><p>was a few minutes of half-past one. </p><p> “Give them the horn,” he bade Billy.</p><p>“They will know what it means.” </p><p> Billy complied, and when the car swept</p><p>out from the trees on to the plateau before </p><p>the house the headlights threw into relief </p><p>the little group waiting for them at the door. </p><p>Walter Brewer stood in advance of his </p><p>daughter, his thin form drawn up erect and </p><p>alert. Back of Winifred, to one side, the </p><p>huge frame of the negro Sam was lined </p><p>against the gray front of the building. </p><p>Jimmy jumped down from the car. Billy </p><p>followed. </p><p> “Here we are, sir,” Jimmy said to Brewer.</p><p>“This is my friend and fellow-American, </p><p>Mr.-” </p><p> “Better not!” cautioned Billy.</p><p> “Mr. Blank,” finished Jimmy.</p><p> Brewer understood. He came forward,</p><p>and peered into the automobile. </p><p> “You have him? Ah—yes—I see.”</p><p>“Will you descend, Herr Kaufman?” </p><p>inquired Jimmy pleasantly. </p><p> An oath was the response. Kaufman did</p><p>not move. Jimmy’s face set sternly. </p><p> “There is a lady with us, Kaufman,” he</p><p>said. “I will advise you—this once only— </p><p>to guard speech in her presence.” </p><p> “Sam, I want you,” called Brewer, and</p><p>when the negro, running, was come to him, </p><p>he said: “Bring this man in. You know </p><p>where to place him.” </p><p> He led the way to the door. Here the</p><p>boys paused, and came to a salute. Over </p><p>the entrance was draped the starry banner </p><p>of their country. Billy passed in with </p><p>Brewer, but Jimmy detained Winifred. </p><p> “This is splendid of you!” he exclaimed,</p><p>pointing to the flag. “I had not thought </p><p>of it. It is the one thing needed to con- </p><p>vince this brute German that in entering </p><p>here he has Americans to deal with.”</p><p> Her dark eyes were raised to the silken</p><p>folds. </p><p> “I brought it from home,” she murmured.</p><p>“But it was father who placed it there. </p><p>I wish you could know what this change </p><p>in him means to me.” </p><p> She went in rather hurriedly.</p><p> Jimmy heard Sam’s voice raised persua-</p><p>sively to the solitary occupant of the car, </p><p>and he tarried for an instant. </p><p> “Dey ain’t no use er bringin’ trubbel on</p><p>yerss’f, mister. ’Tain’t fur yer got ter go. </p><p>Jes’ a step er two. De queschun ’tween </p><p>you an’ me is, is yer gwine ter walk it or is I </p><p>got ter tote yer? Hit’s one er tuther, an’ </p><p>I ain’t partickler which.” </p><p> What Kaufman’s reply was Jimmy could</p><p>not catch; but he saw Sam reach into the </p><p>car. Kaufman came forth in his grasp, </p><p>and was headed for the house under forced </p><p>draft, as a sailor would have termed it. </p><p> Jimmy grinned to himself, and passed in.</p><p>CHAPTER XVIH </p><p>WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CITY </p><p>THERE were strange happenings in </p><p>Cortina on this same night. In the </p><p>early hours of the evening— at forty min- </p><p>utes after eight, to be exact—Miss Mary </p><p>Taylor slipped secretly out of the house in </p><p>the Avenue Alejandrino, and walked rapid- </p><p>ly in the direction of the Calle Central. </p><p>She was supposed to be writing letters in </p><p>her room; she had in fact, given out that </p><p>she would be so engaged for at least two </p><p>hours. </p><p> If her absence was discovered mean-</p><p>while she would account for it in some off- </p><p>hand way—a little stroll in the near neigh- </p><p>borhood to rest her after her labors with </p><p>her pen. Dona Natalia, simple soul, took </p><p>her for an eccentric anyway, and Don </p><p>Manuel knew her for a self-reliant person </p><p>amply able to look out for herself in dark </p><p>or day. </p><p> Miss Taylor had good reason for her</p><p>secrecy this night. Mrs. Isaacs had sup- </p><p>plied her with the reason and after weighing </p><p>it to a nicety, she was convinced that it was </p><p>sound and valid. They must confer to- </p><p>gether without delay. She walked on </p><p>engrossed with her thoughts, and gave only </p><p>an unafraid glance to the shuffling mestizo </p><p>she overtook on her way along the avenue. </p><p>The man’s gait quickened the least bit </p><p>when she passed him. When she reached </p><p>the Calle Central he was but fifty feet be- </p><p>hind her. He lit a cigaret with an erratic </p><p>flourish of the match, and continued at a </p><p>much slower pace. </p><p> Miss Taylor turned south on the Calle</p><p>Central. A man loitering across the street </p><p>had seen the brandished match, and loafed </p><p>along toward the south. The supposi- </p><p>titious half-breed retraced his steps up the </p><p>avenue. It was his beat for the night. </p><p> Miss Taylor pursued her way and her</p><p>thoughts. She was casting over again her </p><p>94 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>interview with Mrs. Isaacs that afternoon. </p><p>She was, in final review, summing up each </p><p>word, each look of the little woman. They </p><p>were, she decided, in harmony throughout, </p><p>and crowning all was one indisputable fact </p><p>certified to by Morales when, on his arrival </p><p>home before dinner, he had given her an </p><p>account of Mrs. Isaacs’ call on him in the </p><p>morning. Yes, beyond doubt, it was wise </p><p>to keep this rendezvous. </p><p> She began questioning the street names</p><p>at the corners, for she was drawing near to </p><p>the Calle Dolores. She came to it with the </p><p>next block, followed it east until opposite </p><p>the park, found the number she had been </p><p>given and, as instructed, tapped lightly on </p><p>the door. Mrs. Isaacs herself responded </p><p>to the knock. </p><p> A moment afterward the man loitered</p><p>along. He made a swift examination of </p><p>the premises at No. 140, and lounged over </p><p>to the park. He glanced about, and moved </p><p>a bench from one of the paths into the deep </p><p>shadows of a clump of shrubbery. There </p><p>were but a few persons passing through the </p><p>park. The number grew less as time went </p><p>by, and finally the place was abandoned </p><p>of all save the concealed watcher on the </p><p>bench. </p><p> The night was warm and still, and the</p><p>man yawned wearily more than once. La </p><p>Caridad struck ten, then the half-hour. </p><p>The house gave no outward sign of life. </p><p>The man caught himself nodding now and </p><p>then, and straightened up; but he nodded </p><p>again and again, and at length his head </p><p>fell forward on his breast and stayed there. </p><p> At 10:50 the door of No. 140 opened, and</p><p>an insignificant little figure stepped out. </p><p>The door was shut noiselessly. It could be </p><p>opened only from the inner side unless one </p><p>was provided with a latch-key. Mrs. </p><p>Isaacs flitted off in the dark toward the </p><p>Calle Central where she hoped to find a cab. </p><p> Eleven o’clock from the cathedral bell</p><p>dinged its way into the consciousness of the </p><p>man on the park-bench. He roused guilti- </p><p>ly. He had slept for twenty minutes. </p><p>What had happened in the meantime? </p><p>He was in for a grilling at the central office</p><p>if the woman he had followed had slipped him. </p><p> As he looked he saw that the thin strip</p><p>of light he had noted below the drawn </p><p>window-shades was gone. And so was the </p><p>woman, it was probable, unless—another </p><p>thought—she was spending the night there. </p><p>He crossed over to the house. The street </p><p>was deserted, and he resolved on a bold </p><p>expedient. He advanced to the door and </p><p>rang the bell. He could hear it shrilling </p><p>somewhere in the rear. It went unan- </p><p>swered. He tried the door softly, and rang </p><p>again—three times at half-minute inter- </p><p>vals. There was no response. The man </p><p>cursed at himself. </p><p> “They sleep well, these people,” he mut-</p><p>tered. “Either she is gone or she remains </p><p>till morning.” He reflected a moment. </p><p>“Two women! There would have been </p><p>leave-takings. Always there is that. And </p><p>I would have heard. I was but nodding. </p><p>She rests here for the night. It is a cer- </p><p>tainty. I will wait and see. Twenty </p><p>minutes only. Pah! And two women! </p><p>My skin is saved.” </p><p> He hugged this comforting assurance</p><p>to himself, and returned to his vigil on the </p><p>bench resolved to stick it out till morning, </p><p>and note who should come forth from this </p><p>devil’s hutch constructed solely to keep an </p><p>honest man from bed. </p><p> Inside the house Miss Mary Taylor lay</p><p>stretched out on a couch in the living-room </p><p>sunk in a soundless sleep consequent on a </p><p>glass of claret she had swallowed when </p><p>making ready to take her departure. The </p><p>wine was to have fortified her against her </p><p>walk home. Mrs. Isaacs, in sisterly com- </p><p>radeship, had drunk of it with her, though </p><p>without untoward results it appeared. </p><p> The bosom of Miss Taylor’s dress gaped</p><p>open in unseemly fashion. A small pearl </p><p>grip pistol lay on the floor beside the couch. </p><p>A jeweled bracelet-watch encircled her </p><p>wrist, and a ring of value her finger. One </p><p>might have imagined that a pillaging-hand </p><p>had been busy with the young woman’s toi- </p><p>let, and yet, strangely enough, had spared </p><p>an obvious loot. </p><p>ON THE party-wall between the </p><p>Valdera warehouse and the Ger-</p><p>man legation was a broken weather- </p><p>beaten soap-box. Some one had carelessly </p><p>thrown it up on the wall at a forgotten </p><p>period and there, a worthless derelict, it </p><p>had persisted ever since. Enrique Segovia </p><p>hailed the box as a boon. Its coverless top </p><p>faced him, and through a rent in the bottom </p><p>he could command the legation roof, his </p><p>head sheltered as by a hunter’s blind. </p><p> Not fifteen yards distant was the flag-</p><p>pole. Five yards farther on the breast- </p><p>high parapet was outlined to his eye. The </p><p>For The Flag </p><p>95 </p><p>flagpole rose thirty feet above the roof </p><p>well over the surrounding buildings, and </p><p>was supported by guy-rods from midway </p><p>its length. </p><p> It was a long, soul-harrowing wait</p><p>Segovia had to endure, for it was not until </p><p>the quarter-hour after twelve that any </p><p>move was made within the enemy’s terrain. </p><p>He had been sorely tempted to go over and </p><p>cut down the pole out of hand, but decided- </p><p>against it. They might find other means of </p><p>raising the antenna, and his work would go </p><p>for nothing—he would not have another </p><p>chance at the wireless. They would see to </p><p>that. </p><p> But now at last his patience was rewarded.</p><p>The scuttle opened, and two men appeared. </p><p>They spoke in German, not loud, yet with </p><p>no great suppression of voice. It was </p><p>plain that fear of eavesdroppers did not </p><p>disturb them. One of them walked to the </p><p>parapet and peered into the street. The </p><p>other came toward the party-wall. Segovia </p><p>guessed, from his square-cut figure, that </p><p>it was Gustave Landeker, for he knew the </p><p>legation attaches by sight. </p><p> He crouched and held his breath, feeling</p><p>for the rubber-covered handle of the hatchet </p><p>in his belt. But Landeker, or whoever it </p><p>was, gave a perfunctory survey of the ware- </p><p>house-roof, and went back. The other </p><p>man had returned to the flagstaff. </p><p> Segovia was up again viewing them</p><p>through his box. He saw them lift a </p><p>board off what seemed to him a long wide </p><p>slit in the roof; he saw them loosen the guy- </p><p>rods and unstep the pole as they would a </p><p>mast and lower it through the opening; </p><p>and after ten minutes more or less he saw </p><p>the pole rise, the men lay hold of it, and </p><p>grunting with the effort, replace it in its </p><p>socket; for now the pole was topped with </p><p>a fan-shaped collection of wires upheld by </p><p>an insulator. </p><p> The legation would be calling the camp</p><p>at Arraca presently, and it was not hard to </p><p>guess the news they would send. To pre- </p><p>vent this was the task set for Segovia, and </p><p>he realized that only by unexampled good </p><p>fortune could he accomplish it. Here were</p><p>two sturdy men, armed no doubt. Either </p><p>one was his match in strength. Either one, </p><p>he was persuaded, would go to any length </p><p>to defeat his purpose. If he should leap </p><p>the wall they would be upon him before he </p><p>could advance a yard. And then! It </p><p>would be a silent, straining struggle in </p><p>which he would be worsted—unless he </p><p>plied the murderous weapon at his side. </p><p> It was a sickening thought, and Segovia</p><p>shrank from it. And yet delay spelled </p><p>failure. He imagined—so wrought up was </p><p>his fancy—that he could hear through the </p><p>open hatch the spark-balls crackling in the </p><p>cellar far below. He was about to risk all </p><p>and vault the wall, trusting to his felt-shod </p><p>feet to land him silently, when he saw one </p><p>of the Germans go to the scuttle and pre- </p><p>pare to descend through it. He waited </p><p>tensely. </p><p> With but a single man to deal with his</p><p>chances of success would be enhanced a </p><p>hundred-fold. The man descended. The </p><p>other idled about, humming a snatch from </p><p>an opera. Segovia recognized it—from </p><p>Tannhauser, the “Pilgrims’ Chorus.” How </p><p>perfectly secure the fellow felt! </p><p> The man was approaching the party-</p><p>wall. Segovia instantly conceived a plan </p><p>of action. He marked in his mind the spot </p><p>at which the man was likely to pull up, </p><p>squatted low and backed away, paused a </p><p>vital moment to gather his energies, then </p><p>hurled himself at the barrier and over it. </p><p>His hope was to catapult into the other and </p><p>bowl him off his feet, or, if not that, so to </p><p>disconcert him that he could not take an </p><p>immediate offensive. </p><p> It was a miss on both counts. Segovia</p><p>botched the jump. His toe caught on the </p><p>top course of bricks, and he tumbled in a </p><p>heap on the opposing roof. Before he </p><p>could recover himself a pistol-butt ham- </p><p>mered on his head. A quiver ran through </p><p>his limbs, and he was whisked away out of </p><p>his senses. </p><p> He came to himself in a lighted back-room</p><p>of the legation building. Some one was </p><p>trickling raw brandy down his throat from </p><p>a flask. He choked and coughed and </p><p>opened his eyes. He was stretched out on </p><p>the floor with a chair cushion under his</p><p>head. The man bending over him raised </p><p>up. An ironical smile curved his lips. </p><p>He spoke in Spanish, but with a pronounced </p><p>accent. </p><p> “Ah, you recognize me, I see, senor.”</p><p> “Gottfried Neiderlein,” Segovia mum-</p><p>bled. </p><p> “Your devoted servant, Lieutenant. Don</p><p>Enrique Segovia. Let me congratulate </p><p>you on your recovery. Gustave was a </p><p>little afraid that the medicine he adminis- </p><p>tered was too potent.” He paused, but </p><p>96 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>his unpleasant smile persisted. “Well,” </p><p>he continued, “we still go on, Senor Lieu- </p><p>tenant.” </p><p> He strode to the door, and opened it.</p><p>The hum of a dynamo charging the con- </p><p>densers of the wireless in the cellar stole </p><p>into the room. Segovia clenched his teeth </p><p>to stifle a groan. He had failed miserably </p><p>and completely. The man returned to </p><p>him. </p><p> “There is water in the corner,” he said.</p><p>“You may wish to use it. Shall I help you </p><p>up, Senor Lieutenant?” </p><p> “No,” answered Segovia shortly. “And</p><p>for your information I will say that I no </p><p>longer have a claim to the title you give me. </p><p>I have resigned my commission in the </p><p>army.” </p><p> “Oho! This act of yours, then, is that of</p><p>a simple citizen. No one to blame but you. </p><p>TJn bum chistel” </p><p>SEGOVIA vouchsafed no reply. </p><p>He drew upon will-power and com- </p><p>pelled himself to a sitting posture. </p><p>From this he clambered painfully to his feet. </p><p>His head was like a whirligig on his shoul- </p><p>ders, and he staggered to a chair and </p><p>dropped into it. The German placed the </p><p>flask on a table near him. </p><p> “I will leave this with you,” he said.</p><p>“I would advise a stiff drink now. You </p><p>will be the better for it. These windows, </p><p>you will observe, are barred. The door I </p><p>will lock. His excellency will decide what </p><p>further is to be done with you.” </p><p> Segovia consulted his watch. It was one</p><p>o’clock. He prayed that Jimmy had not </p><p>failed as he had done. </p><p> “Herr Kaufman is not in the legation?”</p><p>he asked. </p><p> The other gave him a quick glance.</p><p> “He is here,” he replied.</p><p> Segovia’s heart sank, but he spoke with</p><p>forced indifference.</p><p> “Then say to him that unless he comes</p><p>very shortly to his decision he will find it </p><p>taken from him.” </p><p> “Ha! You threaten?”</p><p> “I counsel. My friends, good Herr</p><p>Neiderlein, are not all dead.” </p><p> “Bah! You have invaded the legation.</p><p>His excellency will know how to require </p><p>satisfaction. Meanwhile your friends can </p><p>whistle on the doorstep.” </p><p> Neiderlein marched out, and the key</p><p>rasped in the lock after him. Acting on the </p><p>man’s advise Segovia reached for the brandy </p><p>flask and drank from it direct, slowly and </p><p>sparingly. It put life into him, and he got </p><p>up and took stock of himself. He had been </p><p>relieved, of course, of his hatchet and pistol. </p><p>But otherwise he was not disabled—his </p><p>bones were sound. He went over to the </p><p>wash-stand in the comer, and surveyed </p><p>himself in the mirror suspended above it. </p><p> He turned from the picture in disgust.</p><p>His face was grimed with the dirt of die roof, </p><p>and streaked with blood from a gash over </p><p>one eye; and his head behind the right ear </p><p>was wofully bruised. It was the mark of </p><p>Gustave Landeker’s vehement attention to </p><p>him. </p><p> Segovia washed the grime from his face,</p><p>and used some of the brandy as a lotion for </p><p>his wounds. After this he resumed his </p><p>chair and lighted a cigaret. Half an hour </p><p>went by. Neiderlein unlocked the door, </p><p>and looked in. Segovia fancied there was </p><p>an air of uneasiness about him. Neither </p><p>spoke, and the German, after an irresolute </p><p>pause, went away. </p><p> Segovia knitted-his brows. Had Neid-</p><p>erlein lied about Kaufman? Had Jimmy </p><p>succeeded in as great a degree as he him- </p><p>self had failed? Ah, then the legation </p><p>would have something to wire Arraca that </p><p>was news indeed! He was jubilant with </p><p>the thought. He forgot his own failure, </p><p>his own unease of body, and reveled in </p><p>the growing assurance of his friend’s tri- </p><p>umph. Singularly enough not once did </p><p>the image of Mary Taylor present itself, </p><p>except in the merest shadowy outline—</p><p>an inconclusive background figure in a </p><p>stirring canvas. </p><p> It was striking two when Neiderlein again</p><p>appeared in the door. Segovia was con- </p><p>vinced that he was correct in his deduction </p><p>concerning Kaufman. The man was plain- </p><p>ly worried. He entered, and stood re- </p><p>garding his captive with a lowering face. </p><p> “You have come with a message for me</p><p>from his imperial excellency?” questioned </p><p>Segovia mockingly. </p><p> Neiderlein strode over to him.</p><p> “Where is he?” he demanded.</p><p> Segovia raised his eyes in surprise.</p><p> “Where is who?”</p><p> “Herr Kaufman.”</p><p> “Why, has he gone? I understood you</p><p>to say that he was here in the legation.” </p><p> Neiderlein scowled at him menacingly.</p><p> “It doesn’t matter what you understood.</p><p>For The Flag </p><p>99 </p><p>Ortega will be glad to see that car again. </p><p>Mr. Brewer, this is Mr.-” </p><p> “Leave it off!” cut in the boy wrinkling</p><p>his nose. “Just plain Billy Smith, sir— </p><p>Billy to my friends. Miss Brewer hasn’t </p><p>called me so yet, but I’m hopeful.” </p><p> Jimmy glanced at Winifred. Her eyes</p><p>were dancing. It was a new phase of her </p><p>to him, and he could have hugged Billy for </p><p>bringing it forth. And he heard from </p><p>Brewer a foreign sound. The man was </p><p>laughing! Not loud, but in a stifled sort </p><p>of way as though he was fearful of letting </p><p>the unaccustomed emotion have free play. </p><p> “I will do it for her, Billy—for us both,”</p><p>Brewer said. “And we shall hope to see </p><p>you back soon.” </p><p> “It’s that what bothers me,” replied the</p><p>boy. “How am I going to get back? If I </p><p>hire a machine it will be like trailing an </p><p>anise bag ’cross country for the hounds </p><p>to follow; and to walk is a pretty stiff stroll </p><p>for a chap out of training.” </p><p> “You are not coming back, not right</p><p>away,” Jimmy told him. “You are to stay </p><p>in town and pick up news. There’ll be </p><p>doings today if I’m not mistaken.” </p><p> “We could send Sam in for him after</p><p>dark,” suggested Brewer. “Billy could </p><p>walk out on the Santa Marta Road and </p><p>meet him. I’d go myself, but I don’t </p><p>drive.” </p><p> Winifred had turned thoughtful. She</p><p>was debating a point that had suddenly </p><p>presented itself. </p><p> “I think,” she said slowly, “it would be a</p><p>wise thing to do if you both went back. </p><p>I think that Mr. Perry ought to be seen </p><p>around town tomorrow. It would throw </p><p>them off the track, perhaps, though I’m </p><p>not sure. I am afraid they will have a clue </p><p>to Herr Kaufman’s whereabouts.” </p><p> Jimmy directed a startled look at her.</p><p>“A clue!” he exclaimed. “The tiling was </p><p>done absolutely without a hitch. What</p><p>clue could he have left?” </p><p> “It isn’t that,” Winifred said. “Nothing</p><p>positive. It’s a clue by inference. It did </p><p>not occur to me until Mr. Smith—until </p><p>Billy—explained why he came tonight </p><p>instead of Mr. Segovia. Tell me, is this </p><p>Miss Taylor tall, with close-cut yellow hair, </p><p>and eyes like—like tourmalines—some- </p><p>times—and again like-” </p><p>“Like Prussian blue,” interpolated Billy. </p><p>“Yes, yes!” Jimmy made an eager step </p><p>forward. “You have seen her? Where?” </p><p> “Here. It was yesterday, after you had</p><p>gone. She drove in with another woman. </p><p>She expressed surprise at finding the place </p><p>occupied. She said she’d been told it was a </p><p>quaint old house, and she desired to see it.” </p><p>Jimmy dashed his fist into his palm. </p><p>Here indeed was a discovery. </p><p> “I met her as I was going out,” he cried.</p><p>“She simply wanted to learn what brought </p><p>me here.” </p><p> “Well, she didn’t learn,” gave out</p><p>Brewer. “We didn’t ask her in. I let her </p><p>see that she wasn’t welcome.” </p><p> It was the last thing he should have done,</p><p>decided Jimmy; but he did not voice it. </p><p>Winifred was speaking to him. </p><p> “I did not think anything of it at the</p><p>time. I put her visit down to idle curiosity. </p><p>And even now I don’t just understand what </p><p>brought her. You are a stranger in </p><p>Cortina-” </p><p> “Spying is the woman’s business,” inter-</p><p>rupted Jimmy. “And I’m a friend of </p><p>Enrique. It was enough for her. She </p><p>wasn’t overlooking any bets. And I was </p><p>cracking her up to you only that morning. </p><p>Heavenly powers!” </p><p> He laughed ruefully.</p><p> The least little glimmer of complacency</p><p>brightened the girl’s eyes; but it was </p><p>instantly quenched. </p><p> “OF COURSE you couldn’t know,”</p><p> she said. “I was rather pleased</p><p> with her. She has an engaging</p><p>manner.” </p><p> “Part of her equipment,” snorted Jimmy.</p><p> Billy spoke.</p><p> “Miss Brewer is dead right, Jimmy.</p><p>You must go with me. Sister Mary will </p><p>begin to gossip as soon as she learns Kauf- </p><p>man has turned up missing. Say, it would </p><p>be a joke to go into Morales’ bank and get a </p><p>bill changed. Gosh! That would set ’em </p><p>back a peg or two!” </p><p> Jimmy looked dubiously at Winifred.</p><p> “I reckon it’s the thing to do, but it</p><p>leaves you short-handed here. You must </p><p>be dead for sleep. And you, Mr. Brewer. </p><p>1 don’t fancy the thought-” </p><p> “We slept in the afternoon,” put in</p><p>Brewer briskly. “And anyway, Sam and </p><p>I can relieve each other at Kaufman’s door. </p><p>Winny may go to bed when she likes.” </p><p>Jimmy hesitated still. He was frowning </p><p>at his swift-succeeding thoughts. </p><p> “Tonight won’t matter, I suppose,” he</p><p>98 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “On what?”</p><p> “On developments.”</p><p> Kaufman glowered at him from under his</p><p>bushy brows. He knew what was implied. </p><p> “You have done this thing at the in-</p><p>stance of the Zanhorian Government. </p><p>You are in its pay.” </p><p> “Wrong,” Jimmy answered. “I did it</p><p>on my individual responsibility. I am not </p><p>in the pay of any Government. I am a </p><p>private American citizen. It came to my </p><p>knowledge that you were making mischief </p><p>for America. I decided to put a spoke in </p><p>your wheel. I’ve done it. Whatever the </p><p>consequence I am willing to assume it. </p><p>And I will repeat, Mr. Minister, what my </p><p>young friend said to you in the car: you will </p><p>remain here until the plot you have hatched </p><p>against my country is uncovered. After </p><p>that-” </p><p> “You will pay a price for this,” thrust in</p><p>Kaufman wrathfully. “You will all pay! </p><p>And it will not be reckoned in gold. Ver- </p><p>damml Amerikander schwdn!" </p><p> He clutched a chair with a hairy hand,</p><p>gave it a twirl, and sat down with his back </p><p>deliberately turned to them. Jimmy </p><p>grinned at Brewer. </p><p> “The gentleman’s pleasant way of bid-</p><p>ding us goodnight,” he remarked. “Let </p><p>us go.” </p><p> They left the German sitting as he was,</p><p>and closed the door on him. Brewer shot </p><p>to a bolt on it. </p><p> “I put it there,” he said. “And this, too,</p><p>is my work. We shall want to know what </p><p>goes on in there.” He indicated a slit </p><p>sawed in the door. A slide was arranged </p><p>to cover it at will. </p><p> “Agood idea—bangup,” declared Jimmy,</p><p>and he could see the man warm to the praise. </p><p>“Sam, here is a little something I promised </p><p>you.” A yellow coin was pressed into the </p><p>negro’s great paw. “Suppose Sam takes the </p><p>first watch until we can decide on a sched-</p><p>ule,” he suggested to Brewer. “It’s </p><p>hardly necessary, perhaps, but it is just as </p><p>well to let Kaufman know that we intend </p><p>to keep an eye on him from the start.” </p><p>“Exactly,” agreed Brewer. “Sam, fetch </p><p>a chair. And mind you don’t go to sleep. </p><p>If that person gets away it’s a hanging </p><p>matter for all of us. Do you understand?” </p><p>“I does, Boss,” Sam replied with an </p><p>earnestness that denoted a literal interpre- </p><p>tation of the portentous words. </p><p> Jimmy chuckled to himself as they went</p><p> up the hall to the living-room, into which</p><p>Billy and Winifred disappeared. Brewer </p><p>was certainly blossoming out into another </p><p>man. Jimmy was glad for Brewer’s sake, </p><p>for Winifred’s sake, and—yes—for his own </p><p>sake. It was hard lines to be condemned </p><p>to contempt for the father of the girl he felt </p><p>so strongly drawn to. He was genuinely </p><p>rejoiced to see this change in Brewer. And </p><p>the leaven that had worked it was the most </p><p>inspiriting aspect of the case. It had lifted </p><p>worse men to redeeming heights of honor </p><p>and repute. </p><p>HBILLY was inspecting the guns </p><p>Ortega had sent out. He had intro- </p><p>duced himself to Winifred in his </p><p>own proper name, and explained why it </p><p>was he had taken Segovia’s place in the car. </p><p>His light-hearted way of projecting events </p><p>on the screen of his personal preoption of </p><p>results was irresistible, and Winifred smiled </p><p>despite the anxiety that rested on her in </p><p>the knowledge of the grave step to which </p><p>they all were committed. </p><p> Billy seemed to regard it simply as a</p><p>harum-scarum adventure that would make </p><p>good reading in a magazine. Or it might </p><p>have been that he was making little of the </p><p>danger in an effort to comfort her. Women, </p><p>in Billy’s well-matured opinion, were </p><p>creatures of small courage; otherwise why </p><p>should they take fright at a mouse, or a </p><p>hundred harmless creeping tilings he could </p><p>name? </p><p> “Of course,” he was saying, “they will</p><p>set up an awful holler at the legation when </p><p>they find old Doctor Kaufman is missing </p><p>from their midst; but what can they do? </p><p>Who is going to tell them where he is? </p><p>Echo answers—‘Who-o-o’?” </p><p> Winifred laughed.</p><p> “Suppose she answers ‘Here’?”</p><p> Billy patted the Mauser he was holding.</p><p> “Why, then, we may have a use for this.</p><p>But don’t you worry, Miss Brewer. Echo </p><p>isn’t Irish. She’ll answer according to rule. </p><p>Hist—” as Jimmy and Brewer entered—• </p><p>“Here comes the leader of the Black Hand. </p><p>Neat little blow-pipes these, Jimmy,” he </p><p>rattled on. “I’ve a bet with Miss Brewer </p><p>that, give me an arm rest and the wind right, </p><p>I	can hit a church at fifty feet three times</p><p>out of ten. Want to come in on the </p><p>money?” </p><p> “You’d better be hitting the road home,</p><p>young fellow,” Jimmy retorted. “Senor </p><p>For The Flag </p><p>99 </p><p>Ortega will be glad to see that car again. </p><p>Mr. Brewer, this is Mr.-” </p><p> “Leave it off!” cut in the boy wrinkling</p><p>his nose. “Just plain Billy Smith, sir— </p><p>Billy to my friends. Miss Brewer hasn’t </p><p>called me so yet, but I’m hopeful.” </p><p> Jimmy glanced at Winifred. Her eyes</p><p>were dancing. It was a new phase of her </p><p>to him, and he could have hugged Billy for </p><p>bringing it forth. And he heard from </p><p>Brewer a foreign sound. The man was </p><p>laughing! Not loud, but in a stifled sort </p><p>of way as though he was fearful of letting </p><p>the unaccustomed emotion have free play. </p><p> “I will do it for her, Billy—for us both,”</p><p>Brewer said. “And we shall hope to see </p><p>you back soon.” </p><p> “It’s that what bothers me,” replied the</p><p>boy. “How am I going to get back? If I </p><p>hire a machine it will be like trailing an </p><p>anise bag ’cross country for the hounds </p><p>to follow; and to walk is a pretty stiff stroll </p><p>for a chap out of training.” </p><p> “You are not coming back, not right</p><p>away,” Jimmy told him. “You are to stay </p><p>in town and pick up news. There’ll be </p><p>doings today if I’m not mistaken.” </p><p> “We could send Sam in for him after</p><p>dark,” suggested Brewer. “Billy could </p><p>walk out on the Santa Marta Road and </p><p>meet him. I’d go myself, but I don’t </p><p>drive.” </p><p> Winifred had turned thoughtful. She</p><p>was debating a point that had suddenly </p><p>presented itself. </p><p> “I think,” she said slowly, “it would be a</p><p>wise thing to do if you both went back. </p><p>I think that Mr. Perry ought to be seen </p><p>around town tomorrow. It would throw </p><p>them off the track, perhaps, though I’m </p><p>not sure. I am afraid they will have a clue </p><p>to Herr Kaufman’s whereabouts.” </p><p> Jimmy directed a startled look at her.</p><p>“A clue!” he exclaimed. “The tiling was </p><p>done absolutely without a hitch.

He was frowning </p><p>at his swift-succeeding thoughts. </p><p> “Tonight won’t matter, I suppose,” he</p><p>100 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>conceded. “It’s the day that worries me. </p><p>If the Taylor woman does suspect us we </p><p>will have those Germans out here for a </p><p>rescue.” </p><p> “We’ve got to risk it,” declared Billy.</p><p>“The longer we can keep ’em guessing the </p><p>better.” </p><p> “Yes,” approved Winifred. “And as</p><p>father has said, Sam will meet you; only I </p><p>think it will be better if it is at noon. He </p><p>can go to the post-office, and from there to </p><p>the Santa Marta Road and pick you up.” </p><p>Jimmy shook his head. </p><p> “Sam must stay. He is worth two</p><p>ordinary men. And Kaufman is afraid of </p><p>him. This man Diego who works about the </p><p>place, can he drive your car?” </p><p> “Tio Diego!” Winifred smiled. “You</p><p>couldn’t coax him into the machine. He </p><p>believes it is a contrivance of the evil one. </p><p>But the matter is easily arranged. I will </p><p>come for you.” </p><p> “You!” This did not appeal to Jimmy.</p><p>He eyed Brewer. “If there should be </p><p>trouble in town-” </p><p> Brewer interposed.</p><p> “Winifred is not afraid. She’s not that</p><p>kind. And you’d better be going. It will </p><p>be getting light in another two hours.” </p><p>Brewer’s manner was authoritative. </p><p>Jimmy bowed to it. Winifred’s eyes rested </p><p>on her father with a little flash of pride in </p><p>which doubt yet had part; for the miracle </p><p>of his transformation was a thing so new </p><p>to her that she feared to accept it wholly </p><p>lest it pass and leave her in greater depths </p><p>than before. </p><p> Billy was already at the door impatient</p><p>to be away. </p><p> “Come on, Midas, Jr.,” he called. “It’s</p><p>nearly two. We’re wasting time.” </p><p> Brewer saw them off.</p><p> “Don’t be uneasy about us,” he said to</p><p>Jimmy. “We will keep our end up.” </p><p> “By Jove, sir, I’m sure of it,” Jimmy</p><p>rejoined, and impulsively held out his hand </p><p>to him. </p><p> When they had crossed the ravine, and</p><p>were burning up the road to town Billy </p><p>sundered the silence that reigned between </p><p>them. He giggled as he spoke. </p><p> “And I was trying to stiffen her spine—</p><p>that girl! Thought she was the scary kind. </p><p>Oh, gee!” </p><p> “You’ve a lot to learn, Smith,” said</p><p>Jimmy shortly. </p><p> “With a teacher like that? You bet!”</p><p> The laugh was still on the boy’s lips when</p><p>the car rose up under them, and went wild </p><p>for a perilous moment. Billy cut off the </p><p>gas, and brought it to a grinding halt. </p><p>Jimmy was pitched forward against the </p><p>windshield. And the singular thing was </p><p>that the car itself pitched and rocked in a </p><p>curious gentle rhythm. The pit of Jimmy’s </p><p>stomach fell in, and a sickening nausea fol- </p><p>lowed. Then as suddenly the movement </p><p>ceased. </p><p> “Good Lord, what was it?” he gasped.</p><p> Automatically he pulled out his watch.</p><p>The hands pointed to three minutes after </p><p>two. </p><p> “A quake,” Billy answered. He was</p><p>feeling sick himself. “We’ll wait a minute. </p><p>There may be another. They come usually </p><p>in pairs.” </p><p> There was another, though it was not so</p><p>severe as the first. But Billy waited for a </p><p>time after it had passed. He wished to </p><p>make sure that the disturbance was entirely </p><p>over. </p><p> “It’s the third I’ve known since I’ve</p><p>been out here, and I don’t like them,” he </p><p>volunteered in a strained voice. “They </p><p>say it’s old Borazo yawning—that big </p><p>mountain back there. Nothing serious, </p><p>they claim; but I don’t know. One of </p><p>these days he may yawn too long, and </p><p>then—I guess we can go on now.” </p><p> “Hold up!” Jimmy spoke sharply.</p><p>“Perhaps we’d better go back to the house. </p><p>The quake may have damaged it.” </p><p> “That old stone barracks! It’s been</p><p>standing half a century. Old Borazo </p><p>would have to do more than yawn to bowl </p><p>it down. In the city they haven’t even </p><p>turned over in bed for this baby shock. </p><p>They are used to ’em.” </p><p> Billy pressed the starter, and they took</p><p>up the road again. Jimmy had nothing </p><p>to say until they had left the country </p><p>behind, and crossed the bridge at the </p><p>Arroyo Rebelde. A tropic earth tremor </p><p>is not a tongue-loosener for the outlander till </p><p>he is thoroughly over his fright. </p><p>CHAPTER XX </p><p>IN THE NIGHT HOURS </p><p>' I 'HEIR headlights picked up a man at </p><p>the farther side of the bridge. He </p><p>raised his hand in a signal to them. </p><p> “It’s the chap Ortega said he’d have</p><p>For The Flag </p><p>IOI </p><p>waiting for us, I reckon,” Jimmy remarked. </p><p> Billy slowed to a stop. The man came</p><p>to them. His eyes lifted as he saw that </p><p>there were two persons in the car, but he </p><p>offered no comment. </p><p> “From the senor superintendent,” he said</p><p>in Spanish. “With your permission, gen- </p><p>tlemen, I will drive.” </p><p> “Ask him if they felt the earthquake</p><p>here,” Jimmy requested of Billy. “I can’t </p><p>find the words for it.” </p><p> The man shrugged in reply to the ques-</p><p>tion. </p><p> “As one stretches himself in his sleep,</p><p>senor, no more.” </p><p> “You see! Borazo’s yawn,” Billy re-</p><p>minded Jimmy. “The natives think noth- </p><p>ing of it.” </p><p> They came to Morales’ house, gliding</p><p>softly by with lights out. But lights </p><p>showed in the house. They were astir </p><p>there at this unseemly hour of the night. </p><p>Billy whispered a conjecture. </p><p> “Perhaps the legation has been tele-</p><p>phoning. Kaufman would have gone there </p><p>from Morales’ for news from Arraca. They </p><p>want to know what keeps him.” </p><p> “It may be that Mrs. Morales is worse,”</p><p>suggested Jimmy ironically. “Too bad we </p><p>can’t leave our cards.” </p><p> They swung into the Calle Central,</p><p>proceeded north two blocks, and drew up </p><p>at Ortega’s private office door. </p><p> “Rap four times,” instructed their con-</p><p>ductor when they had descended. </p><p> With this he drove away.</p><p> Ortega opened to them. If he was sur-</p><p>prised at Jimmy’s return to town his face </p><p>did not show it. When they were inside </p><p>and seated he looked at Jimmy. </p><p> “Well?” was all he said.</p><p> “Quite well,” Jimmy grinned at him.</p><p>“He’s under lock and key.” </p><p> “Quiet as a lamb, if not so eatable,” put</p><p>in Billy. </p><p> Jimmy gave his reason for returning.</p><p>Ortega approved it. </p><p> “Miss Brewer was right. It was well</p><p>thought of,” he said. “Brewer himself— </p><p>will he hold out? I know, as you are aware, </p><p>his history.” </p><p> Billy was all ears at this. Jimmy</p><p>noted it. </p><p> “Yes,” he answered briefly. “Have you</p><p>heard from Enrique?” </p><p>“No. I am a little uneasy about him.” </p><p>Ortegd glanced at a clock on his desk. </p><p>“They raised the wireless two hours ago.” </p><p> “Um. You know that, sir?”</p><p> “Yes. I watched with a night glass from</p><p>the roof.” </p><p> “Mrs. Isaacs!” snapped Jimmy. “It’s</p><p>what she did—used a glass. But pshawl </p><p>I’m off on that again. Mr. Lane says she’s </p><p>a harmless little creature. She called on </p><p>him-” </p><p> He left off. Some one was knocking at</p><p>the door, insistently, and without pause. </p><p>“Segovia!” cried Billy. </p><p> Don Emilio’s hand was on the knob,</p><p>opening the door. It was Segovia. He </p><p>stood alert and listening on the step for </p><p>a moment. Then he entered and threw </p><p>himself into the first chair. His clothing </p><p>was torn. The gash over his eye had </p><p>recently bled afresh, and his face was </p><p>stained from it. He breathed in gulping </p><p>gasps. </p><p> “By Jove, from your looks you’ve had</p><p>an experience, old man!” exclaimed Jimmy. </p><p>“Here, swallow this.” </p><p> Ortega had produced a bottle and de-</p><p>canted a glass of wine. Segovia drained it </p><p>greedily. </p><p> “Get your wind before you try to talk,”</p><p>Ortega bade him, and went into an adjoining </p><p>room. </p><p> But Segovia did not obey him.</p><p>“Kaufman?” he panted at Jimmy. </p><p>“You—got—him?” </p><p> “Easy as falling down stairs. Billy</p><p>Smith here drove.” </p><p> Segovia nodded at Billy.</p><p> “Good!” he wheezed.</p><p> Ortega came in with a washbasin and</p><p>towel. He set the basin on the desk. </p><p> “Wash up and you’ll feel better, Don</p><p>Enrique,” he advised. </p><p> Enrique got up. He bathed his face and</p><p>hands, brushed off his clothes, and returned </p><p>to his seat. </p><p> “I’m right again,” he avowed. “Got</p><p>my wind. It was a run, that. Landeker </p><p>chased me. I expected a shot in the back </p><p>any minute; but I guess he was afraid of </p><p>the row it would make. He gave up, and </p><p>I came on.” </p><p> “Suppose you begin with the roof,”</p><p>submitted Ortega quietly. “What took </p><p>place up there?” </p><p> Srgovia made an apologetic gesture.</p><p>“Oh, yes, of course. I’m ahead of my </p><p>story.” </p><p> He related the occurrences at the legation.</p><p>102 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> His audience gave him a hushed atten-</p><p>tion, but when he arrived at the point where </p><p>Neiderlein drew his pistol on him Billy </p><p>broke in excitedly. </p><p>“Gee!” he ejaculated. “Did he shoot?” </p><p>Even Ortega laughed, and Billy grinned </p><p>as he realized the “bull” he had perpetrated. </p><p> “It was at that instant the quake came,”</p><p>said Segovia. “You can imagine what </p><p>happened, Don Emilio; Neiderlein is new </p><p>to the country. I struck at his arm. It </p><p>sent the weapon flying, and we were at each </p><p>other’s throat. But his fright gave me the </p><p>advantage. I got him down to his knees— </p><p>and to his back—and I battered his head </p><p>on the floor. I took the pistol, went out, </p><p>and locked him in.” </p><p> “Well done,” said Ortega. “And then?”</p><p> Segovia continued—</p><p> “I found my hatchet on a stand outside</p><p>the door, together with my pistol. I knew </p><p>what to do then. The cellar stairs were </p><p>close by. I ran to them. The wireless </p><p>operator was coming up. He, too, was </p><p>frightened, but not so that he had lost his </p><p>wits. When he saw me he seemed at once </p><p>to understand what had passed. He </p><p>charged at me. </p><p> “I hurled Neiderlein’s gun at him. It</p><p>took him full in the chest. He lost his </p><p>balance—there was no rail to hang to— </p><p>and he went over backward down the stairs. </p><p>It was a nasty fall, and he didn’t move </p><p>afterward. I thought he was dead, but </p><p>I couldn’t stop to find out. I remembered </p><p>Landeker up on the roof. He’d be coming </p><p>down perhaps. </p><p>“WELL, I found on the operator’s </p><p>table duplicates of the messages </p><p>he’d been sending and receiving; </p><p>Neiderlein load the originals, I suppose. I </p><p>gathered them up and stuffed them in my </p><p>pocket. Then I went at his condensers </p><p>with my hatchet—at his key and spark- </p><p>balls. I smashed everything in sight. </p><p>And, in some way I can’t explain, I cut the </p><p>electric light circuit. Anyway, everything </p><p>went dark.” </p><p> “Gosh!” exclaimed Billy breathlessly.</p><p> He was sitting on the extreme edge of his</p><p>chair, carried out of himself by the recital. </p><p>Segovia went on. </p><p> “I had matches, and I struck one. It</p><p>showed me the stairs, and I made for them. </p><p>I wanted to get out of that place. I had </p><p>one foot on the steps when I felt the other </p><p>gripped by the man on the ground. He had </p><p>come to. We had it out, fast and furious. </p><p>He was hurt; I could tell by his groans. I </p><p>managed to break loose from him at last, </p><p>and climbed the stairs. It was ticklish </p><p>business in the dark. When I got up </p><p>I didn’t know where I was, and I wanted to </p><p>find the street door. I struck another </p><p>match; the door was straight ahead. And </p><p>so was Landeker. He was groping his way </p><p>to the cellar. I blew out the match, but </p><p>he had seen me, of course.” </p><p> “The deuce,” fumed Jimmy, as Segovia</p><p>paused to light a cigaret. “You can do </p><p>that later. Get on.” </p><p> Ortega said nothing. He waited pa-</p><p>tiently. Segovia inhaled zestfully. </p><p> “The first I’ve had in an hour,” he men-</p><p>tioned, and proceeded with his story. </p><p>“There is not much more to tell. Landeker </p><p>would have taken a shot at me, I’m sure, </p><p>but he was afraid that some one was behind </p><p>me and he would hit him. He called out </p><p>in German, and Neiderlein set up a cry </p><p>from the room. I could hear Landeker </p><p>coming, and dropped to my knees. I was </p><p>lucky. I caught his legs and jerked them </p><p>from under him, and I got a stiff kick in the </p><p>stomach as he went over. It pretty nearly </p><p>did for me, but I was up before he was, and </p><p>found the door. Fortunately it wasn’t </p><p>locked, and I was in the street with a fair </p><p>start of Landeker.” </p><p> “And you came here direct?” inquired</p><p>Ortega gently. </p><p> “Not so. I knew enough for that. I ran</p><p>north to the Calle Cristina, east a block, </p><p>south three, and west here. I lost Landeker </p><p>after the second turn.” </p><p> “That was well,” praised the superin-</p><p>tendent.</p><p> “By George, Enrique,” exploded Jimmy,</p><p>“ours was tame as a Sunday-school picnic </p><p>beside your performance. You’re an honor </p><p>to the old Tech.” </p><p> Segovia looked pleased, but he said:</p><p>“I’m not so sure of that. You see, they </p><p>had their say back and forth with Arraca </p><p>before I got my work in. That’s the mis- </p><p>chief of it. They sent off that Washington </p><p>dispatch, of course, and I have a notion </p><p>Neiderlein let them know he feared for </p><p>Kaufman’s safety. But here is the stuff.” </p><p>He drew from his pocket a sheaf of papers, </p><p>smoothed out the rumpled sheets on his </p><p>knee, and passed them to Ortega at the </p><p>desk, saying— </p><p>m </p><p>For The Flag </p><p>103 </p><p> “German, but we can find some-</p><p>body—” </p><p> “Right here!” cried Jimmy elatedly.</p><p>“Billy, do your stunt.” </p><p> Billy studied the sheets a moment, and</p><p>looked up with a bored air. </p><p> “In code. It might as well be Choctaw</p><p>for all I can make of it.” </p><p> Segovia stared blankly at Jimmy.</p><p> “An honor to old Poly—oh, yes, I am!”</p><p>he jeered bitterly. “I’ve raised the devil, </p><p>and that’s all.” </p><p> “You wrecked the plant. They won’t</p><p>be talking back and forth in a hurry,” </p><p>consoled Jimmy. “That’s a lot at this </p><p>stage of the game.” </p><p> Ortega smiled in his quiet way.</p><p> “You have done a good night’s work, all</p><p>of you, my friends. We can guess what </p><p>these messages say in a general way. Or </p><p>if we can’t, it is not a vital matter. The </p><p>thing is, we’ve got the key to the situation </p><p>in Herr Kaufman, and we’ve stopped the </p><p>conversations with the lumber camp. Now </p><p>we will get some sleep against what may </p><p>happen when day comes. I’ve a car waiting </p><p>for you in the yard, Don Enrique. You </p><p>can dEop Jimmy at his hotel, and Mr. </p><p>Smith-” </p><p> “Billy, sir,” put in the boy.</p><p> “And Billy-”</p><p> “Billy stays with me tonight,” spoke up</p><p>Jimmy. “And it’s only a step or two to </p><p>the hotel. We’ll walk it. Enrique is all </p><p>in. Pack him home. Good night, old </p><p>chap. See you later—somewhere.” </p><p> He gripped Enrique’s hand, and hustled</p><p>him to the door despite his protests. </p><p>Ortega had touched a button, and a man </p><p>stood ready to pilot the worn-out young </p><p>Zanhorian to the car. </p><p> “Well, aren’t you going?” asked Ortega</p><p>quizzically of the two who remained. “It </p><p>is three o’clock.” </p><p> “I just wanted to say, sir, that Morales’</p><p>house was lighted up when we passed,” </p><p>replied Jimmy. “I was about to mention </p><p>it when Enrique came in. Do you think </p><p>the legation has been talking to Morales?” </p><p>“Very likely. But there is another thing </p><p>that is worrying him. Miss Taylor has not </p><p>returned, or she had not at the last report, </p><p>an hour ago.” </p><p> “The boys stared at him.</p><p> “That’s funny,” observed Jimmy who,</p><p>of course, meant exactly the opposite. </p><p> Don Emilio shrugged.</p><p> “Excessively so,” he commented dryly.</p><p> They were leaving when Jimmy be-</p><p>thought himself of another question. </p><p> “If I am overcurious stop me. But I</p><p>would like to know, sir, if the detectaphone </p><p>was of any help. Did they use the dining- </p><p>room?” </p><p> “Yes. But their talk was low. My man</p><p>could catch only snatches of it. They </p><p>intend to rescind American concessions </p><p>in the republic for one thing, and to make </p><p>the abrogation general if they succeed in </p><p>their dream of creating a United States of </p><p>Central America. That’s of interest to </p><p>you. Other points deal with the methods </p><p>of the revolution which, by the way, waits </p><p>only on a word from Peralta. And we were </p><p>right about the card you saw in the bank. </p><p>It was Kaufman’s call for a meeting on </p><p>Sunday night—‘the committee’ he termed </p><p>it.” </p><p> “But the names of the committee.</p><p>Weren’t they mentioned?” </p><p> Ortega shook his head.</p><p> “They go by numbers, it appears. Only</p><p>one name was spoken. A woman’s—a </p><p>‘Miss Prietz.’ Herr Kaufman was exercised </p><p>about her. She had failed him in some </p><p>way—what way the detectaphone missed— </p><p>and much, it seems, depended on her.” </p><p> “Another woman!” exclaimed Jimmy.</p><p> The superintendent met this with his</p><p>cryptic smile. </p><p> “A woman may have more names than</p><p>one.” </p><p> “Miss Taylor?”</p><p> “Quien sabe? Good night. I shall sleep</p><p>here.” </p><p>MR. RICARDO GOMEZ himself </p><p>took Jimmy up in the lift to his </p><p>room. He had inquired solicitously </p><p>about Segovia, and now he said: </p><p> “It is a night of retardation of the sleep,</p><p>Caballeros. You are not single in your </p><p>deferment. The madame of your country </p><p>—New York—her also is arrived muy tarde. </p><p>Oho!” t </p><p> “You mean Mrs. Isaacs?” Jimmy re-</p><p>garded him curiously. </p><p> “Si. Es la una—one o’clock—her is</p><p>came.” </p><p> Billy exchanged a glance with Jimmy,</p><p>but to Mr. Gomez’ disappointment neither </p><p>remarked on the information. It was not </p><p>until they were in the room that they spoke. </p><p> “What do you think of that?” asked Billy.</p><p>104 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “To the deuce with Mrs. Isaacs!” snapped</p><p>Jimmy crossly. “I’ve quit guessing about </p><p>her. Shut up, and get to bed. I’m dead </p><p>tired.” </p><p>ENRIQUE SEGOVIA meanwhile </p><p>was adding to his adventures of </p><p>the night. His way home led </p><p>through the Calle Dolores. As the car </p><p>came abreast of the park the driver uttered </p><p>a queer exclamation, and threw out his </p><p>clutch. </p><p> “What is it?” demanded Segovia sleepily.</p><p> “Mateo, of the force, and a woman.</p><p>There is trouble.” </p><p> Mateo’s watch had been rewarded. He</p><p>had “saved his skin,” or at least he was so </p><p>persuaded. The woman had come forth </p><p>from the house. The heave of the earth- </p><p>shock had penetrated to her deadened con- </p><p>sciousness, and brought to her the first </p><p>stirrings of awakened life. Slowly, through </p><p>the mental fog in which she was lost, she </p><p>had made her way to thought, then to </p><p>leaden action in which minutes crawled </p><p>onward to an hour. And when at last she </p><p>was out of the place of her imprisonment </p><p>she had stood looking about her bewilder- </p><p>edly, endeavoring to get her bearings. </p><p> Her will to do returned, and she started</p><p>down the street in the direction of the </p><p>Calle Central. She reeled weakly— </p><p>drunkenly, Mateo thought—and he had </p><p>hastened over to her from the park. He </p><p>had offered, cunningly, to aid her, to see </p><p>her to whatever place she was in mind to go. </p><p>The woman had waved him off; had, in </p><p>fact, flourished a revolver at him. </p><p> It was this sight, as he peered from the</p><p>machine, that caught Segovia’s eye. He </p><p>got out, and ran forward to the pair. A cry </p><p>broke from him. </p><p> “Miss Taylor—Mary! My God!”</p><p> “Enrique!”</p><p> Miss Taylor thrust the pistol in her waist,</p><p>and let herself droop toward him. She was, </p><p>indeed, sick and shaken; and yet her</p><p>clouded faculties responded to the im- </p><p>perious demand she made upon them. </p><p>She moaned piteously. </p><p> “Take me home. Oh, take me home!”</p><p> “Yes, yes, at once,” Segovia assured her.</p><p>“But what has happened to you? Why </p><p>are you wandering on the streets—at this </p><p>hour—in this part of the city? And the </p><p>man—he would not have harmed you. He </p><p>is a police officer.” </p><p> Miss Taylor drooped pronouncedly on</p><p>his arm. </p><p> “Take me home, Enrique,” she pleaded.</p><p>“I am dreadfully ill. I will tell you as we </p><p>go. Take me home!” </p><p> Mateo had fallen back to the car.</p><p>He was in low, rapid colloquy with the </p><p>driver. As Segovia came up Mateo touched </p><p>his hat to him. </p><p> “She came out of 140, senor,” he said, and</p><p>walked away. </p><p> Segovia helped his charge into the car.</p><p>She sank upon the cushions with a long </p><p>sobbing sigh. </p><p> “To the Senor Morales’ house in the</p><p>Avenida Alejandrino,” Segovia directed. </p><p>He turned to his companion. Her head </p><p>had fallen to one side. “She’s fainted!” </p><p>he cried out. “Drive like the devil, man!” </p><p>He chafed the girl’s hot, dry hands, but </p><p>with no response from her. His senses </p><p>were in a whirl. This staggering event </p><p>bursting from out the curtain of the night </p><p>on him had scattered his wits. He could </p><p>not think collectively. He could only </p><p>wonder in a dazed way what it all meant. </p><p> They were nearing Morales’ house. He</p><p>called Mary’s name, softly urgent. Her </p><p>eyes opened. She pressed the hand holding </p><p>hers. He bent down to her. </p><p> “I am better,” she murmured.</p><p> “Thank God! You have given me a</p><p>horrible fright.” </p><p> They were at the house, stopping. She</p><p>sat up with unexpected energy. </p><p> “Stay at home until I send for you to-</p><p>morrow,” she breathed in his ear. “I will </p><p>tell you then. I am not able—tonight— </p><p>to go through with it.” </p><p> “Of course not,” he soothed. “To-</p><p>morrow—or never. It rests with you. I </p><p>do not ask a word.” </p><p> She gave him a strange look, and of a</p><p>sudden a fugitive kiss brushed his cheek. </p><p> “You are a dear boy—a dear boy,” she</p><p>said with a catch in her voice. “No! I </p><p>can get out alone. I am much better. </p><p>Don’t wait. Go! I wish it.” </p><p> She stepped down unaided from the car.</p><p>Some one was opening the door of the </p><p>house. </p><p> “Vayal” she bade the driver, and went</p><p>slowly up the walk to the beckoning door. </p><p> Enrique, athrill with the kiss she had</p><p>bestowed on him, yet found his lips me- </p><p>chanically repeating the words of Mateo </p><p>as he drove away from Dolores Street— </p><p>“She came out of 140, senor.” They had </p><p>glanced off his mind at the time, but they </p><p>came back now knocking for admittance. </p><p>“She came out of 140.” </p><p> Why, that was Brewer’s late residence.</p><p>Had a new tenant been found for it in this </p><p>short space? If so, who? Who, in three </p><p>days, could have established" such a claim </p><p>on Mary that she should spend long hours </p><p>in the house—for of course she had gone </p><p>there early—and then be brutally turned </p><p>forth in the dead of night to find her way </p><p>home alone and ill? Who? </p><p> A thought presented itself to Enrique that</p><p>made the blood surge like liquid fire in his </p><p>veins; that caused his nails to bite into </p><p>his palms until the very pain of it cleared </p><p>his vision. No, not that! Mary was </p><p>above suspicion. It would all be made plain </p><p>to him in the morning. Something so far </p><p>out of the ordinary that it could not be </p><p>guessed had influenced her. Some- </p><p>thing. . . . </p><p> “Oh, my God!” he cried in his heart.</p><p>“And I must wait!” </p><p> Not until he was at home and in bed did</p><p>it occur to Enrique, amid the dark jumble </p><p>of his reflections, that here was no secret </p><p>he could hold as his own. Two other men </p><p>shared it with him, and tomorrow Don </p><p>Emilio would make a third. What could </p><p>he say, if questioned by him? Request him </p><p>to wait until he had heard from Mary? </p><p> Enrique did not sleep as he had thought</p><p>to do when he bade good night to them all </p><p>at police headquarters less than an hour </p><p>gone. </p><p>CHAPTER XXI </p><p>HUE AND CRY </p><p>OVER the seas and under the seas on </p><p>the morning of Friday the sixth day </p><p>of April flashed the news that the Congress </p><p>of the United States of America had for- </p><p>mally declared the existence of a state of war </p><p>with the Imperial German Government. </p><p>On land, to the farthermost settled regions, </p><p>the word was sent. Telegraph offices, </p><p>hummed with it. On the broad waters </p><p>ship after ship caught the winged tidings </p><p>and relayed it on. </p><p> The white yacht Sea Bird caught it from</p><p>a Belize boat talking to a sister ship plow- </p><p>ing eastward by the Rosalind Bank. The </p><p>secret German submersible, lurking like a </p><p>poisonous creature of the deep off Matina </p><p>Cay, caught it from an Elders &amp; Pinsch </p><p>freighter out of Puerto Mono querying a </p><p>Orleans mail steamer headed for Colon; </p><p>ana from this last the U. S. gunboat </p><p>Lincoln, crawling up the coast under orders, </p><p>avidly drank in the news. </p><p> She was too far east of Matina Cay for</p><p>the U's limited radio to listen in, but the </p><p>powerful plant at the Arraca lumber camp </p><p>overheard, and passed it and the gunboat’s </p><p>position to the submarine. There was a </p><p>licking of chops aboard, and a disciplined </p><p>bustle of preparation. This was Lieuten- </p><p>ant Kumpel’s mission—to hinder in Peral- </p><p>ta’s behalf any interference from seaward. </p><p>Now, with this long-expected news, the </p><p>way was made plain for him. </p><p> In the camp there was also the bustle of</p><p>preparation for immediate action. Stir- </p><p>ring advices had been received during the </p><p>night. First had come from Cortina the </p><p>transcript of the Washington dispatch. </p><p>This was relayed to the U and to the Sea </p><p>Bird. Word was returned that General </p><p>Peralta would sail instantly for Puerto </p><p>Mono. It was a five-hundred-mile run, </p><p>but the yacht was fast; it would make port </p><p>in the early morning of Saturday. The </p><p>message was transmitted to the legation. </p><p>In the meantime intelligence had come from </p><p>Neiderlein of Segovia’s attempt on the </p><p>wireless and, later, Neiderlein’s anxiety for </p><p>Kaufman. </p><p> Colonel Heinrich Ludolf, in command at</p><p>the camp, did not mention Neiderlein’s </p><p>fears to the Sea Bird. He deemed it pre- </p><p>mature; for at first he did not attach any </p><p>great importance to it—Herr Kaufman had </p><p>his reasons for absenting himself. Never- </p><p>theless he flashed back an imperative in- </p><p>junction to the secretary— </p><p>Find him, and report. </p><p> It was this message that had sent Neider-</p><p>lein in on his last visit to Segovia with </p><p>drawn pistol. And this message was the </p><p>last, as events proved, that the camp got </p><p>through to the legation. There was no</p><p>response to repeated calls after this. Col- </p><p>onel Ludolf understood that something </p><p>calamitous had befallen at the other end, </p><p>and now alarm for Herr Kaufman’s safety </p><p>fell upon him. Yet he refrained from </p><p>communicating with the yacht. </p><p> The thought in his mind was too incredi-</p><p>ble to be seriously entertained. And even </p><p>could this incredible thing have happened </p><p>io6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the imperial envoy would wish, he knew, the </p><p>coup to be carried out. To stop it now </p><p>would create doubt and suspicion in Pej^ </p><p>ta’s followers. It might, in truth, result </p><p>in an irretrievable fiasco. So he let the </p><p>yacht come on. </p><p> But as the hours passed without further</p><p>word from the legation what at first had </p><p>seemed unthinkable took on the guise of </p><p>probability, and finally conviction. Ludolf </p><p>summoned to him Sub-Lieutenant Karl </p><p>Hecht, told him of the purloined dispatch, </p><p>of the change in Peralta’s plans, and of </p><p>Neiderlein’s misgivings concerning Kauf- </p><p>man. He added: </p><p> “It is possible that his excellency has</p><p>been abducted. I base it on obvious rea- </p><p>sons—it would confound the supporters </p><p>of the revolution. Very well, we will </p><p>nullify it. You are to go to Cortina on the </p><p>morning train. Pick four men to accom- </p><p>pany you. Learn from Herr Neiderlein </p><p>what has been done. He will have made </p><p>demands on the Zanhorian Government; </p><p>but the Government will know nothing— </p><p>of course. So, if the whereabouts of his </p><p>excellency has not been discovered, dis- </p><p>cover it. Find him. Stop at nothing. </p><p>Herr Kaufman must be back when I enter </p><p>the city tomorrow. He is the Kaiser’s </p><p>deputy.” </p><p>IN CORTINA a late edition of </p><p>La Cronica came out with the news </p><p>from Washington in twelve-point </p><p>type to make the most of brevity. As </p><p>the action of Congress had been discounted </p><p>in advance by the President’s message it </p><p>caused but small excitement. It was dis- </p><p>cussed mildly at breakfast-tables and in </p><p>business offices, and then dismissed. Peo- </p><p>ple went about their affairs in the usual </p><p>leisurely way. On the surface life in Cor- </p><p>tina was rippled only by the stones of in- </p><p>dividual desires cast into the tranquil </p><p>waters; the events of the night were as a </p><p>sealed book to the commonalty. </p><p> But in officialdom it was different. Mat-</p><p>ters of import occupied it—quietly, cooly, </p><p>yet none the less intensely. President </p><p>Hurango sat in secret council in the rose </p><p>room of the executive mansion with his</p><p>secretary of state, his secretary of war, and </p><p>the State superintendent of police. Present </p><p>by request was the American minister. </p><p>In the president’s hands was definite in- </p><p>formation of the revolutionary movement— </p><p>the arranged day for Peralta’s landing, the </p><p>strength of his immediate personnel, and </p><p>the aid he counted on in the Province of </p><p>Puerto Mono, and in the Provinces of </p><p>Boaca, Espero and Cortina. </p><p> Furthermore, President Hurango even</p><p>had in his possession on this day, written </p><p>down in General Peralta’s own scrawling </p><p>script, the names of the chief revolutionists </p><p>in the state, with the posts promised them </p><p>under the new Government. It was an </p><p>invaluable paper most unexpectedly de- </p><p>livered to him. Indeed, it was the prime </p><p>reason for the meeting. Secret service </p><p>agents were on their way to the provinces </p><p>to make arrests. </p><p> In the capital arrests would not be made</p><p>until late in the day. This delay was for </p><p>the purpose of allowing the report of Herr </p><p>Kaufman’s disappearance to seep privily </p><p>into the ears of the conspirators. To first </p><p>dismay them, disorganize and sow distrust </p><p>among them, would the more readily bring </p><p>confession when they were taken into </p><p>custody. Then would be the time to re- </p><p>turn Herr Kaufman. Meanwhile all ave- </p><p>nues of exit from the city were guarded. </p><p> That the desired intelligence was already</p><p>in process of dissemination was indicated </p><p>by a report to the council from the assistant </p><p>secretary of state over the president’s pri- </p><p>vate telephone, to wit: Herr Neiderlein had </p><p>called at the department with the opening </p><p>of the doors to demand the whereabouts </p><p>of the German minister; also to demand </p><p>an explanation of the forcible detention </p><p>overnight of one Otto Stoll, driver of the </p><p>minister’s car, and only just released by </p><p>the police. Herr Neiderlein’s initial de- </p><p>mand, the assistant secretary had reported, </p><p>was received with amazed concern, but with </p><p>a protest against the aspersion cast upon the </p><p>Government; and to his following demand </p><p>assurances of an immediate investigation </p><p>had been given, and redress if warranted. </p><p>' In brief, Spanish diplomacy had returned </p><p>Herr Neiderlein to his legation as empty- </p><p>handed as he had left it, but with unabated</p><p>suspicion in his heart. And it rankled the </p><p>more because he knew the secretary was </p><p>laughing in his sleeve at him for not daring </p><p>to voice a third demand—punishment of </p><p>the man who had invaded the legation the </p><p>night before. </p><p> While these events were in progress</p><p>Jimmy Perry opened heavy eyes upon the </p><p>day. He yawned and blinked and then in </p><p>answer to the insistent call of his subliminal </p><p>self, sat up suddenly wide awake. He </p><p>fished his watch from under his pillow and </p><p>looked at the time. The result was a vig- </p><p>orous pummeling of Billy Smith into re- </p><p>luctant consciousness. </p><p> “Hey, you grandson of the seven sleepers,</p><p>it’s after nine,” he cried. ‘-‘Shake a leg </p><p>there! We’ve got to get out on the street </p><p>and learn the news. And Miss Brewer will </p><p>be here at twelve.” </p><p> Billy responded querulously.</p><p> “I was just dreaming we’d dyed old pop-</p><p>per Kaufman’s whiskers green, and set a </p><p>goat loose on ’em. You’ve spoiled the fun.” </p><p>They dressed, and started down for </p><p>breakfast. In the corridor they paused </p><p>and stared. Mrs. Isaacs’ door stood open, </p><p>and there was not a vestige in the room of </p><p>occupancy. They crossed over and looked </p><p>in; there were no personal belongings any- </p><p>where. Everything was in order for the </p><p>next comer. </p><p> “Not even a hairpin left,” said Billy.</p><p>“She’s found her uncle and gone.” </p><p> They questioned a criada who was making</p><p>up an adjoining room. She only knew that </p><p>the office had sent up word that No. 249 </p><p>was vacated. </p><p> “I’m going to find out where she has</p><p>gone,” declared Jimmy. “She’s given me </p><p>the creeps the last two days, that woman. </p><p>I want to know for sure that I’ll see no </p><p>more of her.” </p><p> The clerk on duty was not the polyglot</p><p>Mr. Gomez. He spoke but the language </p><p>of his fathers. Billy interviewed him, and </p><p>learned that Mrs. Isaacs had left on the </p><p>7130 Puerto Mono train. </p><p> “I hope she doesn’t miss the boat,” ex-</p><p>claimed Jimmy. </p><p> “Huh. There are a dozen stops between</p><p>here and there,” Billy reminded him. </p><p>“Cheer up. Maybe she’ll be coming back.” </p><p>It was half-after ten when they came out </p><p>from breakfast. They decided on a pro- </p><p>gram. Jimmy thought it advisable that </p><p>he keep away from the American Legation </p><p>at this juncture, but Billy could go without </p><p>exciting comment. He was to ascertain</p><p>from Mr. Lane what developments, if any, </p><p>had occurred in that quarter, and then </p><p>proceed via the Calle Cristina to the Santa </p><p>Marta Road. Meantime Jimmy, acting </p><p>on Billy’s suggestion at the farm, was to </p><p>visit -the Banco Nacional and show him- </p><p>self to Morales. </p><p> Billy went on his mission. Jimmy waited</p><p>a wi|le, then sauntered over to the post- </p><p>office, ^ocght §pme cards for which he had </p><p>no use, and lounged along the Calle Grande </p><p>to the bank. If secret eyes were on him, </p><p>he presented the appearance of one without </p><p>a care in the world. </p><p> He strolled into the bank, and spoke to</p><p>the teller he had met through Segovia on </p><p>his first visit to the place. The man </p><p>changed the bill Jimmy tendered, and ex- </p><p>pressed a burning desire to be of further </p><p>service. Jimmy inquired casually after </p><p>Senor Morales. Perhaps, if he was not </p><p>engaged. He came to an abrupt pause. </p><p>Morales’ car was at the door, and Morales </p><p>was entering the bank. He was late this </p><p>day. Jimmy’s glance took swift appraisal </p><p>of him. He discovered, he thought, signs </p><p>of disquiet in his manner. His thick lips </p><p>were compressed, his beady eyes roved from </p><p>point to point. They fell on Jimmy as </p><p>he stepped forward to greet him, and the </p><p>man stopped dead, a baffled expression on </p><p>his face—the expression of one who has </p><p>accepted a proposition as logically sound </p><p>only to find it in the same breath logically </p><p>refuted. </p><p> “She has told him,” Jimmy said to him-</p><p>self. To Morales he said blandly: </p><p> “How do you do, senor? I came in to</p><p>change a note.” </p><p> “Ah, yes. Delighted to see you, Mr.</p><p>Perry.” Morales stuck out his hand with a </p><p>great show of friendliness. “Some one—er </p><p>—I heard you were leaving town. I am </p><p>glad I was misinformed.” </p><p> “I am leaving shortly,” Jimmy said.</p><p>“Got to go home and help lick the </p><p>Germans.” He mischievously put an en- </p><p>trapping question. “Mrs. Morales—she is </p><p>well?” </p><p> “Yes—er—no, no. I am alarmed for</p><p>her health, quite upset about it. And it</p><p>has deprived me of the pleasure of enter- </p><p>taining you at dinner. I fear now-” </p><p> “Pray don’t concern yourself for that,”</p><p>Jimmy entreated him. “Mrs. Morales’ </p><p>health is the thing we have to deplore. I </p><p>was in hopes that she was recovered. It </p><p>is needless to ask if Miss Taylor is well. </p><p>She is the picture of health.” </p><p>The banker did not have himself entirely </p><p>in hand on this morning. His brows in- </p><p>voluntarily contracted. He sought to </p><p>counteract it with a voluminous smile. </p><p>“Miss Taylor will die of old age—unless </p><p>io8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>she meets with an accident,” he asserted. </p><p>“Is there anything I can do for you.*Mr. </p><p>Perry? You have onlyvto Cbmmand </p><p>me.” </p><p> They were standing precisely at the spot</p><p>where they had met. Morales made no </p><p>move toward his private office. Jimmy was </p><p>not the welcome guest of a former day, and </p><p>he chuckled inwardly as he noted it. </p><p> “You are kind, senor, but there is nothing</p><p>I could ask of you,” he answered. “Oh, </p><p>yes, there is,” he supplemented quickly, </p><p>under a devil’s impulse: “just mention to </p><p>Miss Taylor that you saw me, will you </p><p>please? And that I sent her my most de- </p><p>voted regards.” </p><p> Morales’ little eyes gave him a needle-</p><p>like glance. It was instantly hidden in an </p><p>urbane inclination of his head. </p><p> “You will come again, I trust, Mr. Perry,</p><p>before you leave the city,” he murmured. </p><p> “Oh, most certainly, senor. I should</p><p>grieve to think that we were not to meet </p><p>again.” \ </p><p> He returned the other’s bow, and went</p><p>out into the street. </p><p> “Now what the deuce made me send</p><p>that word to the Taylor woman?” he ques- </p><p>tioned of himself irately. “I gave my </p><p>hand away, and the old fox caught on to it.” </p><p>QS3 IT WAS eleven o’clock. He had </p><p>an hour to kill. He thought of </p><p>dropping in on Ortega; if there was </p><p>news to be learned that was the fountain- </p><p>head. But he dismissed the notion. It </p><p>was not in his r61e to be seen hobnobbing </p><p>with the police. It occurred to him as he </p><p>strolled down the west side of the plaza </p><p>that he had come to town on a fool’s errand. </p><p>If Mary Taylor had imparted her sus- </p><p>picions to Morales, it was only a question </p><p>of hours when an investigation would be </p><p>instituted; and his utterly maladroit re- </p><p>mark to the banker would hasten it. He </p><p>would have better stayed at the hacienda </p><p>and made ready for whatever came. </p><p> Jimmy was suddenly rooted to the pave-</p><p>ment in frightened surprise. Winifred </p><p>Brewer in an automobile was coming </p><p>toward him — stopping — speaking low- </p><p>voiced and hurriedly. It was not in their </p><p>plan. Something had happened! </p><p> “Get in,” she said. “Where is Billy?”</p><p> “At the legation. What-”</p><p> “Get in,” she bade him curtly. “We</p><p>have no time to lose. They have been out </p><p>to the farm—two men. They will be going </p><p>back with other men.” </p><p> He was in beside her. But instead of</p><p>speeding away she drove slowly up the </p><p>Calle Central and into the Calle Grande </p><p>eastward. They might have been riding </p><p>for pleasure to all seeming. </p><p> “We mustn’t look as if we are disturbed.</p><p>Talk, laugh—anything.” </p><p> She smiled as she said it.</p><p> “Where are you going?” he smiled back</p><p>at her. </p><p> “To get Billy. We shall need him. Oh,</p><p>if we have luck, and don’t have to wait!” </p><p> Things that neither of them could after-</p><p>ward recall they chattered gaily about </p><p>until they turned into the Calle Commercio. </p><p>The luck for which Winifred had prayed </p><p>was with them. Billy was coming out of </p><p>the door as they approached the legation. </p><p>He saw them and paused, his mouth drop- </p><p>ping open, his nose twitching spasmodically. </p><p> “Don’t ask questions. Jump in. Look</p><p>pleased,” Jimmy enjoined on him as they </p><p>drove up. </p><p> They went on easily up the street to-</p><p>ward the Calle Cristina. It took them past </p><p>the German legation. It was a bit of bra- </p><p>vado on Winifred’s part. She could have </p><p>chosen another way; but she was curious </p><p>to see if there was any stir at the mission. </p><p>Nothing, however, was apparent as they </p><p>passed. </p><p> “Those chaps back there are sporting</p><p>Kaiser Hogitall’s rag today just as if every-</p><p>thing was hunky with them,” advanced </p><p>Billy from the haze of his bewilderment. </p><p> He could not think of anything else to</p><p>say, and he was forbidden a question. </p><p> His remark drew no reply. Winifred</p><p>was turning into the cross street. She </p><p>pressed the accelerator, and the car re- </p><p>sponded with quickened life. Soon they </p><p>were on the Santa Marta Road. Winifred </p><p>opened the throttle degree by degree until </p><p>they were roaring south at forty miles an </p><p>hour. The girl’s hands were steady on the </p><p>wheel. She “felt” the road like a veteran </p><p>pacemaker. </p><p> “Now tell us!” exploded Jimmy. “ ‘They’</p><p>came. Who?” </p><p> Billy clutched the forward seat and</p><p>leaned over to hear. </p><p> “Two Germans. From the legation.</p><p>One’s name was Landeker. Herr Kauf- </p><p>man called him by it. The other had his </p><p>arm in a sling.” </p><p>For The Flag </p><p>109 </p><p> “Kaufman—they got to him?” Jimmy</p><p>shouted his alarm. </p><p> “Wait,” Winifred answered. “They</p><p>came in a car.” She glanced at her wrist- </p><p>watch. “It was an hour ago. Father met </p><p>them at the door. Sam was with him. </p><p>They were in a furious mood—the Germans </p><p>—and demanded the instant production of </p><p>the minister. They knew, they said, that </p><p>he was there. Father—oh, he was fine— </p><p>pretended astonishment, indignation. He </p><p>gave them no satisfaction. They attempt- </p><p>ed to force an entrance, and father drew his </p><p>revolver. He said he would shoot the </p><p>first man who came a step farther—and </p><p>they knew he would do it! Sam stood with </p><p>his white teeth bared, grinning at them like </p><p>a wolf, and with one of those big pistols in </p><p>his hand. </p><p> “It stopped them. Then one of them</p><p>started running around the house, and by </p><p>a hap took the east side. He cried out </p><p>Herr Kaufman’s name, kept crying it at </p><p>every step, with words we could not under- </p><p>stand—German. We heard Herr Kaufman </p><p>answer from his window—‘Herr Landeker;’ </p><p>and there was more German. But Sam </p><p>put an end to it. He had run back through </p><p>the hall when Landeker started, and he </p><p>caught him under the window. </p><p> “What Sam said or did I don’t know;</p><p>but he came around the house with Lan- </p><p>deker in his hold. Father motioned the </p><p>man with the sling to get into his car, and </p><p>Sam shoved the other in. And father and </p><p>Sam covered them with their pistols until </p><p>they were out of sight. Then I decided to </p><p>come on at once and find you. I waited </p><p>only until I was sure I wouldn’t overtake </p><p>those two on the road.” </p><p> “I didn’t think it would come so soon,”</p><p>Jimmy frowned. “I thought it would be </p><p>in the night.” </p><p> “Where were you during the time, Miss</p><p>Winifred?” Billy asked. </p><p> “With father,” she said simply.</p><p> “Of course,” said Jimmy as simply.</p><p> She glanced at him, and away again at the</p><p>ribbon of road before them. They were </p><p>eating it up. Soon they would reach the </p><p>ravine. </p><p> “Too bad we couldn’t get word to Ortega</p><p>about this; maybe he would send us help,” </p><p>commented Billy. </p><p> “The Government can’t mix in it. You</p><p>ought to know that,” retorted Jimmy. </p><p> “Any news at the legation?”</p><p> Billy gave a snort of disgust.</p><p> whisper. His eminency hadn’t</p><p>shown up yet, and if Whittaker knew </p><p>anything he wouldn’t spill it. He was sore </p><p>at me for playing sick instead of telling </p><p>him that I’d resigned. I had a frightful </p><p>time screwing five dollars out of him on an </p><p>I. O. U. He’s so darned tight he’ll pop and </p><p>blow away one of these days.” </p><p> Winifred laughed. It did Jimmy good</p><p>to hear her. She was disturbed but not dis- </p><p>mayed by the event of the morning. Brew- </p><p>er was right. She was not afraid. She </p><p>was not that kind. He told her of Enrique’s </p><p>raid on the secret wireless. </p><p> “Ah, that was splendid!” she acclaimed.</p><p>“Single-handed against three. He is </p><p>brave.” </p><p> They were at the pitch of the ravine, and</p><p>she eased the car down. </p><p> “I say,” broke out Billy, who had been</p><p>scanning the sky to the west. “There’s </p><p>nasty weather making over yonder. Black </p><p>as coal. Ever see it rain in this country, </p><p>Jimmy—a cloud-burst?” </p><p> “I’ve only been here since Monday,”</p><p>Jimmy recalled to him. </p><p> “Huh. You’ve got something coming to</p><p>you then. It can rain hard enough to </p><p>drown a mule in one place, and two miles </p><p>away they are eating dust. And it’s all </p><p>over in half an hour.” </p><p> They splashed through the rivulet at the</p><p>bottom of the gorge, and went up the other </p><p>side. Two minutes later they were at the </p><p>farmhouse door. Brewer was there to meet</p><p>them. He stabbed a question at Jimmy. </p><p> “Is war declared?”</p><p> “By an overwhelming majority of both</p><p>houses.” </p><p> Brewer looked up at the flag over the</p><p>door. A nebulous smile touched his face. </p><p> “We will raise it from the house-top,”</p><p>he said. “Let them come and haul it </p><p>down.” </p><p>CHAPTER XXII </p><p>DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES </p><p>ON THIS same afternoon of April sixth, </p><p>El Terror, the flag and only fighting </p><p>ship of the Zanhorian navy, lay drowsing </p><p>at anchor behind the breakwater in the </p><p>harbor of Puerto Mono. It had drowsed </p><p>there weeks without end, except for a semi- </p><p>occasional sally into the farther waters for </p><p>frugal gun-practise. </p><p>no </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Admiral Miguel Terrozas was ashore.</p><p>He spent, indeed, most of his tim^tshore, </p><p>having nothing to do when afloat but listen </p><p>to his rusty anchor-chain grinding in its </p><p>hawse-hole. Ashore there were matters </p><p>to talk about, matters that of late had been </p><p>whispered to him in secret corners by cer- </p><p>tain persons, and to which he had lent an </p><p>attentive ear; for he perceived advantage to </p><p>his personal renown and fortune in these </p><p>confidences. </p><p> But on this afternoon Admiral Terrozas</p><p>was receiving light in his darkened under- </p><p>standing, and the source of it, and the man- </p><p>ner of it, whelmed him in astonishment and </p><p>a waxing fear. He was seated in the port- </p><p>warden’s office overlooking the harbor. </p><p>His companion was a woman—a dark, lit- </p><p>tle woman in gray, with a quiet voice and a </p><p>quiet way that somehow conveyed the </p><p>effect of a vast authority speaking through </p><p>her. </p><p> Admiral Terrozas was made to see that</p><p>his personal fortunes lay on the upper side </p><p>of the shelf instead of being suspended by a </p><p>hair from the lower side. He was made to </p><p>see that a long and powerful arm was ready </p><p>to stretch down from afar to Zanhoria and </p><p>knock mutinous heads together until the </p><p>Isthmus should resound with it. </p><p> He was made to see the vision of an event-</p><p>ual United States of Central America found- </p><p>ed not in strife but in the concord of mutual </p><p>interests and aspirations and, incidentally, </p><p>with a defensive navy that a brilliant sailor </p><p>would have profit and pleasure in com- </p><p>manding. And, finally, Admiral Terrozas </p><p>was made to see that to go out and intercept </p><p>Peralta on his approach to the coast would </p><p>be a very excellent way to avoid the adobe </p><p>wall that waited in Cortina for the enemies </p><p>of the republic.	•</p><p> In fine, Admiral Terrozas had been made</p><p>to see in sharp relief which side his political </p><p>bread was buttered on. When he left the </p><p>port-warden’s office he went immediately </p><p>aboard his ship, and in half an hour was </p><p>steaming for the open sea. The Sea Bird </p><p>probably would lay a devious course for </p><p>Puerto Mono, out of the regular lane of </p><p>traffic; also, she might put in at a point</p><p>above or below the port. </p><p> The admiral would patrol the coast in the</p><p>hope that good fortune would place the </p><p>yacht in his way, whether on this day, or </p><p>the morrow, or the day after. And as </p><p>chance, or Providence, would have it he </p><p>laid his course south by east at first when </p><p>with equal reason he might have laid it </p><p>north by west. </p><p> Mrs. Isaacs, meanwhile, after watching</p><p>El Terror clear the harbor, entertained her- </p><p>self at dinner in a retired cafe by the water- </p><p>front, and prolonged the meal to the ex- </p><p>treme limit of gentility, for she had a wait </p><p>of three hours to endure before her return </p><p>train left for the capital. </p><p>STEAMING up the coast as El </p><p>Terror steamed down it came the </p><p>gunboat Lincoln. She was off Pun- </p><p>ta Gorda, and inshore in the territorial </p><p>waters of Zanhoria. Less than four hours </p><p>lay between her and Puerto Mono. She </p><p>would drop anchor at ten if all went well. </p><p>One bell in the second dog-watch had struck. </p><p>The sea was bland as a moorland pond. </p><p> “Submarine on the starboard beam, sir.</p><p>Just emerging. Distance about four thou- </p><p>sand yards,” called the lookout. On the </p><p>heels of this came another call: “Steamer on </p><p>the port bow, sir, rounding the point. A </p><p>gunboat.” </p><p> The Lincoln was agasp with astonish-</p><p>ment. A submarine in these waters! Un- </p><p>less—it might be—an American boat. </p><p> A four-inch explosive shell screaming</p><p>through the Lincoln’s rigging settled the </p><p>question. It burst a hundred yards away. </p><p>The general alarm and torpedo defense </p><p>bells rang out. Men jumped to their </p><p>stations. The range-finders sent in their </p><p>curt orders, and the forward guns spoke. </p><p> The U worked in nearer, shelling as she</p><p>came, but without a hit. It was not afraid </p><p>of this old slow-footed tub with guns no </p><p>greater than its own. It could run circles </p><p>around her. And this other old tub poking </p><p>out from the point—blundering in where </p><p>she had no business—would make off when </p><p>she saw what was up. Terrozas knew </p><p>where his interests lay.</p><p> Great spouts of water rose about the</p><p>Lincoln from the falling shells, and around </p><p>the U. Each was getting the range, and </p><p>it was nip and tuck as to which would score </p><p>the first hit. If the Lincoln, it would be </p><p>all over with the enemy; if the U, it depend- </p><p>ed on where the shot struck. </p><p> Then from the boiling sea about the sub-</p><p>marine a white streak darted forth with </p><p>tremendous velocity. It circled a little </p><p>to allow for the pitiful speed of the gunboat; </p><p>but the submarine had not taken into </p><p>For The Flag </p><p>iii </p><p>account the gunboat’s zigzag, and with a </p><p>venomous zip the torpedo whizzed by </p><p>twenty yards ahead of the mark. </p><p> The Lincoln’s wireless was signaling the</p><p>other gunboat. The quarter-deck had </p><p>made her out, but could not understand her </p><p>tactics. She had sheered off on a course </p><p>that would bring her well to the north of </p><p>the submarine. These were neutral waters; </p><p>was the Zanhorian going to make no pro- </p><p>test? </p><p> Terrozas kept his silent course. The U</p><p>thought it understood him—he was simply </p><p>going to quit the scene, and let his friends </p><p>finish their work unhindered. His action </p><p>could bear no other interpretation. But </p><p>the old fool was taking a stupid risk. He </p><p>might get a stray shot in his vitals from the </p><p>American. </p><p> A shell from the U found the Lincoln at</p><p>last. It plumped into her engine-room, </p><p>killing two men, but did not explode. It </p><p>smashed in the intermediate cylinder-head, </p><p>however, and the boat lay crippled on the </p><p>water. But her guns still spoke, and the </p><p>submarine kept her distance. A shot had </p><p>grazed its conning-tower and carried a man </p><p>along with it. </p><p> And then something happened, and it was</p><p>a miracle—no less. </p><p> El Terror was off the beam of the U now.</p><p>The latter was preparing to launch a second </p><p>torpedo—with long odds in its favor this </p><p>time—when the Zanhorian gunboat let </p><p>loose its entire starboard battery of three- </p><p>pounders at the German. And it was a </p><p>hit—that was the miracle of it—a hit the </p><p>first time by a gun-crew that scarccly </p><p>knew the smell of powder! The submarine </p><p>rolled over and went down, with only a </p><p>floating patch of stinking oil to mark where </p><p>she had been. </p><p> Terrozas left the few men yet alive</p><p>struggling in the water, and wore around to </p><p>go to the Lincoln's aid. He had proved that </p><p>he knew which side his bread was buttered </p><p>on; and, besides, dead Germans tell no tales. </p><p>CHAPTER XXIII</p><p>UNVEILED </p><p>T^NRIQUE stayed at home on Friday, </p><p>' as he had promised, for the message </p><p>that was to come from Mary. He was up </p><p>at ten o’clock, and after a breakfast he had </p><p>no relish for, and a listless half-hour with </p><p>the mor: ing paper, he dawdled about the </p><p>house in miserable suspense. </p><p> Don Luis Valera had gone away very</p><p>early, the old butler informed Enrique, in </p><p>answer to a note brought by a messenger </p><p>who would deliver it into no hands other </p><p>than the secretary’s own. Enrique won- </p><p>dered a little what such an imperative sum- </p><p>mons foretold. Was the German legation </p><p>making trouble? Well, let Don Luis at- </p><p>tend to it; he had done his part, and had a </p><p>broken head to show for it. </p><p> Since the quarrel with his uncle Enrique</p><p>had exchanged with him only the perfunc- </p><p>tory civilities demanded in the presence of </p><p>the servants. They had dined together the </p><p>night before in cold silence. Enrique had </p><p>not mentioned his purposed attack on the </p><p>wireless. If he failed, it would only be </p><p>what Don Luis would have expected of him; </p><p>and if he succeeded Don Luis would have </p><p>small praise for him. He had called him a </p><p>fool—let him remain in that belief. </p><p> The boy did not know that his uncle,</p><p>apprized by Ortega of the dangerous task </p><p>he had set for him, had lain awake listening </p><p>for his home-coming, nor could he know </p><p>that before leaving the house that morning </p><p>Don Luis had softly looked in on him as he </p><p>slept to reassure himself of his safety. He </p><p>moped about from room to room, counting </p><p>the time and chewing the cud of bitter re- </p><p>flection. His uncle—Jimmy—Ortega—were </p><p>all in league against Mary. They per- </p><p>sisted in reading her falsely, in manufactur- </p><p>ing a character for her that was as far from </p><p>truth as hell from heaven. </p><p> But as he recurred to the incident in the</p><p>Calle Dolores he was compelled to acknowl- </p><p>edge that it looked equivocal. It was part </p><p>of an event to which, as yet, he did not hold </p><p>the key. Mary had promised to supply it; </p><p>but the day was wearing on, and there was </p><p>no word from her. And it was a thing that </p><p>demanded explanation. A woman could</p><p>not hold silence in the face of the extraordi- </p><p>nary situation in which she was found by the </p><p>man who loved her. She would hasten to </p><p>give a reason that should be at once sound </p><p>and satisfactory. Why did Mary delay? </p><p> Enrique’s forehead gathered into heavy</p><p>furrows. He had told Mary that he would </p><p>not ask an explanation. Would she rest on </p><p>this? But no, of her own accord she had </p><p>said she would send for him. He was to </p><p>stay at home until he heard. Well, he was </p><p>staying, and he did not hear. Why? It </p><p>112 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>was two o’clock. Surely she must*mow the </p><p>agony of his waiting. </p><p> He tried in a dozen ways to ease the pass-</p><p>age of the hours, to create for himself an </p><p>atmosphere of unconcern, of assured confi- </p><p>dence in his ultimate deliverance from the </p><p>suspense in which he was prisoned. All his </p><p>devices failed—nothing mattered but this </p><p>primal passion that was devouring him. At </p><p>last he could endure the ache of it no </p><p>longer. It was striking three. Six hours </p><p>he had waited in a torture of expectancy. </p><p>He would put an end to it. </p><p> He went to the telephone in the library,</p><p>and called up Morales’ house. They were </p><p>an eternity in answering, but at length a </p><p>woman’s palpitant voice came to him on the </p><p>wire. It was not Mary’s; it was the Senora </p><p>Morales’ perhaps, or a maid’s. </p><p> “I would like to speak, please, with Miss</p><p>Taylor,” he requested. “Say it is Senor </p><p>Segovia.” </p><p> There was a pause. Then the voice re-</p><p>plied— </p><p> “Miss Taylor is not here, senor.”</p><p> “She has gone out?”</p><p> “Yes, senor.”</p><p> “When?”</p><p> “Hours ago—ten o’clock, or a little be-</p><p>fore it may have been.” </p><p>“May I ask when you expect her back?” </p><p>“I can not say. I do not know, senor.” </p><p>Enrique hung up the receiver. He sat </p><p>for a long time gazing at the instrument as </p><p>though it might, if it would, give answer to </p><p>the questions that battered at his mind. </p><p> “She told me to wait—and she kissed me</p><p>—she kissed me,” he repeated over and </p><p>over in a dull monotone. </p><p> He got up and walked the floor, walked it</p><p>back and forth, from side to side, with </p><p>dragging feet. And it was on him, in this </p><p>endless chain of steps, that Don Luis en-</p><p>tered, home for a brief hour in a day that </p><p>would merge into another before he would </p><p>see repose. He took in the young man’s </p><p>neglige attire, and his drawn face. </p><p> “You have not been out today?” he asked.</p><p> “No, sir,” Enrique answered briefly.</p><p> He had left off his walk.</p><p> “You were hurt last night, Senor Ortega</p><p>tells me. Are you in pain?” </p><p> “A bruise only. It does not inconveni-</p><p>ence me.” </p><p> Don Luis looked at him straightly, his</p><p>eyes cynical and coldly disapproving. He </p><p>said slowly: </p><p> “The man Mateo has been disciplined.</p><p>He slept at his post. He did not see the </p><p>other woman who left the house. Possibly </p><p>Miss Taylor mentioned her to yoil?” </p><p> It was Don Luis’ way of introducing a</p><p>subject he intended to dispose of finally. </p><p>But to Segovia it came as a ray of light </p><p>athwart the gloom that filled him. It was a </p><p>woman Mary had gone to see! His faith in </p><p>her was born again. He returned his </p><p>uncle’s gaze, scornfully defiant. </p><p> “So they set a watch on her, and it</p><p>failed! Why, sir, this is notable news. </p><p>Two women meet for a purpose of their </p><p>own. What the purpose, one would think </p><p>was strictly their affair. But it seems not. </p><p>A watch is set on them. They are dogged </p><p>by a sneaking spy. One goes away unseen, </p><p>and the other, whom I chanced to meet, is </p><p>ill and I escort her home. A mystery, </p><p>truly!” </p><p>i|j|gp DON LUIS studied him an intense </p><p>|Wi moment. Hevvasconsideringwhether </p><p>m,^sm he should say the thing that was in </p><p>his mind. He decided to defer it for the </p><p>present. The boy was in the grip of an </p><p>infatuation that was blinding him even to </p><p>his honor, it might be. He would open his </p><p>eyes first. </p><p> “You have not answered me,” he said.</p><p>“But it does not matter. Miss Taylor did </p><p>not mention the woman to you. She did </p><p>not tell you what happened to her in that </p><p>house, engaged solely for the purpose of</p><p>receiving her on that night. She had ex- </p><p>cellent reasons for not doing so. She </p><p>wished to keep her hold on you, and to tell </p><p>you would have destroyed it perhaps. </p><p>There is no counting on what a man will </p><p>do in your evil case.” </p><p> “Sir!” Enrique’s face flushed darkly.</p><p>He made a- threatening step toward his </p><p>uncle, and checked himself. “You take ad- </p><p>vantage, your Excellency, of my obligations </p><p>to you.” </p><p> “You still have faith in this woman after</p><p>what you saw last night—after what Mateo </p><p>saw, and the man in the car with you?” </p><p> Don Luis thwacked him with the inter-</p><p>rogatory as with a stick. Enrique flinched </p><p>under it. </p><p> “Until I have a better reason to forego</p><p>it,” he returned sullenly. </p><p> “Let us begin, then.” The secretary</p><p>handed him a slip of paper. “Read it. It </p><p>is the reply to a question asked by the </p><p>For The Flag </p><p>ii3 </p><p>American minister of the North American </p><p>Gazelle. It would have been unnecessary </p><p>to ask it today, with what we know.” </p><p> The cablegram fluttered from Enrique’s</p><p>hand to the floor. He made no attempt to </p><p>recover it, but stood staring at it, benumbed </p><p>and voiceless. It read: </p><p>Unknown to us. We have no traveling contributors. </p><p> Don Luis was merciless.</p><p>“Well, do you still believe?” hedemanded. </p><p>“Are you the one sage in a rabble of fools?” </p><p>Enrique did not reply to him. He turned </p><p>to the window, and he stood there gazing </p><p>unseeingly into the street. </p><p> “A Judas kiss!” he cried from his riven</p><p>soul.“It was a Judas kiss she gave me.” </p><p>His uncle watched him a space, and spoke </p><p>again. </p><p> “Her real name is Ella Prietz. She is of</p><p>the German Intelligence Office. A spy! </p><p>But she was outwitted at the last, and it </p><p>was you who found her, defeated and dis- </p><p>comfited, and coddled her to her home! </p><p>Enrique, tell me: did she cajole from you </p><p>our secret plans? Not that it matters now, </p><p>but-” </p><p> Enrique wheeled about. His eyes were</p><p>blazing. </p><p> “I am a fool, but not a traitor, Senor Don</p><p>Luis Maria Santiago de Valera!” </p><p> The older man’s expression softened.</p><p>“Yes, that I could not believe,” he mur- </p><p>mured. And to Enrique, his tone gentle </p><p>and persuasive: “Sit down, my boy. I will </p><p>tell you what has passed since the early </p><p>hours of the day. Zanhoria has abandoned </p><p>her neutrality. The call to action has come. </p><p>But first I will say that the president is </p><p>highly pleased with your performance at the </p><p>German legation. He has a captain’s com- </p><p>mission for you. And I-” </p><p> Enrique made a violently impatient ges-</p><p>ture. </p><p> “Where is she now?” he rasped. “Did</p><p>they let her get away?” </p><p> “She is in Senor Ortega’s charge. She was</p><p>arrested as she was taking the Arraca train </p><p>at two o’clock. She was at the legation </p><p>until then.” </p><p> “Ha! It is plain. Neiderlein was send-</p><p>ing her to the camp to warn them of Kauf- </p><p>man’s disappearance.” </p><p> “Much more than that,” said Don Luis</p><p>gravely. “In the house in Dolores Street </p><p>she was inveigled into giving information </p><p>of General Peralta’s plans. She believed </p><p>8 </p><p>she was talking to a confederate spy; but </p><p>there was one thing she held back. It was </p><p>Peralta’s written list of the conspirators, </p><p>and intended only for Herr Kaufman’s eye. </p><p>That was taken from her with other papers. </p><p>A glass of wine—and it was done. All the </p><p>papers were in Mr. Lane’s hands in half an </p><p>hour afterward.” </p><p> “I understand now.” Enrique’s face re-</p><p>flected the mocking thoughts that besieged </p><p>him. “But this other woman; who is she, </p><p>where did she come from?” </p><p> Senor Valera smiled faintly. It indexed</p><p>his complacency with the turn of events. </p><p> “She is known as a Mrs. Rebecca Isaacs</p><p>of New York. She is in reality a United </p><p>States Secret Service agent, and she was sent </p><p>to Jamaica to run down the rumor of Pe- </p><p>ralta’s proposed coup. Women succeed </p><p>better than men in these things oftentimes. </p><p>Mrs. Isaacs established the truth of the </p><p>rumor, and she went further: she gained her </p><p>way into Peralta’s confidence. How, one </p><p>can only imagine—but her German is </p><p>fluent, and her Spanish, and her plainness </p><p>disarms any thought of feminine intrigue. </p><p> “At all events she learned many things</p><p>and among them that this Miss Prietz was </p><p>the bearer of an important document to </p><p>Herr Kaufman. Mrs. Isaacs managed to </p><p>get a strong letter from Peralta to Morales, </p><p>and she came on to Cortina with the pre- </p><p>text of helping to forward the uprising. </p><p>She called immediately at the German lega- </p><p>tion as a confidential agent of Peralta; and </p><p>it was she who conveyed the stolen dispatch</p><p>from Morales to Herr Kaufman yesterday </p><p>morning. Morales asked her to be his mes- </p><p>senger.” </p><p> Enrique looked his astonishment.</p><p> “She played into their hands?”</p><p> “My dear boy, she knew Morales would</p><p>tell Miss Prietz. It strengthened the posi- </p><p>tion Mrs. Isaacs was planning to assume </p><p>with the woman. And Herr Kaufman </p><p>would have had from Morales a precis of </p><p>the note in any event.” He added: “All </p><p>of the conspirators will be arrested within </p><p>the hour.” </p><p> “Jimmy Perry can let Kaufman go now,”</p><p>remarked Enrique in a heavy voice. </p><p> He was thinking of what Jimmy would</p><p>say when he should be acquainted with </p><p>these facts. </p><p> “We shall send word word to him to-</p><p>night,” said Don Luis. “Perhaps you will </p><p>be the one to go.” </p><p>ii4 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “No! I—I would rather not,” protested</p><p>the young man vehemently. “Send some </p><p>one else. I must decline. I have some- </p><p>thing that will engage me here in Cortina.” </p><p>His uncle did not combat him, for he fan- </p><p>cied he understood his objection. </p><p> “Oh, as you choose, my boy,” he agreed</p><p>good-humoredly. “Senor Ortega can find </p><p>another messenger.” </p><p> Enrique made him a preoccupied gesture.</p><p>His gaze was remote—absorbed, black and </p><p>deadly. Don Luis saw only that his nephew </p><p>was cured of his passion, and he went out </p><p>well contented with the interview. </p><p>CHAPTER XXIV </p><p>A SEMI-UNDERSTANDING </p><p>THEY were busy at the hacienda. The </p><p>Germans might return at any time. </p><p>Tia Matilde, in the outdoor kitchen, was </p><p>boiling eggs and a great ham in anticipa- </p><p>tion of a possible siege that would preclude </p><p>the use of the stove. </p><p> Tio Diego was getting a short ladder from</p><p>the stable to be set up in the house under </p><p>the skylight. He was going about this </p><p>business with many a shake of his gray poll </p><p>in fearful speculation on what these extraor- </p><p>dinary events in which he was enmeshed </p><p>portended. </p><p> In the dining-room Winifred was setting</p><p>out a lunch, and marshaling her stores of </p><p>tinned goods in the pantry ready to hand. </p><p>Sam was helping her, with a watchful eye </p><p>on the open slide of Herr Kaufman’s door </p><p>across the hall. Jimmy was in there, having </p><p>been summoned by the prisoner for a parley. </p><p> Brewer and Billy had gone to the woods</p><p>in search of a sapling that would answer </p><p>for a flagstaff. Brewer was curiously bent </p><p>on this project. Before the boys’ return </p><p>from Cortina he had hunted up some iron </p><p>braces to secure the pole to the coaming </p><p>of the skylight. The house was tiled, and </p><p>the coaming offered the only vantage-point </p><p>for his purpose. A ladder from the inside </p><p>would give safe access to it. The two </p><p>were coming back now.</p><p> “We will have to hurry, sir,” Billy was</p><p>saying. “Those clouds over there are get- </p><p>ting a gait on.” </p><p> “It won’t take us long,” Brewer answered.</p><p>“Ten minutes will do.” </p><p> “But the halyards. It will take time to</p><p>rig the pole.” </p><p> “We won’t need halyards. We are going</p><p>to nail our colors to the mast.” </p><p> Billy glanced at him. The look in the</p><p>man’s face sent a tingle up his spine. </p><p> “I see,” he said softly.</p><p> They did not speak again until they were</p><p>in the house. </p><p> “If we had a pair of glasses we might pick</p><p>out something up there,” suggested Billy </p><p>when they had taken the flag down from </p><p>over the front door, and were preparing </p><p>to mount the ladder. We might get a good </p><p>look up the Santa Marta road.” </p><p> “We might,” agreed Brewer.</p><p> He stepped into his room and returned</p><p>with a binocular field-glass. The hall was </p><p>high-studded, and the ladder did not reach </p><p>the ceiling by three feet. It was an ancient </p><p>and shaky affair. Diego steadied it, and </p><p>from the top rung they were able to draw </p><p>themselves up by the skylight casing on to </p><p>the roof. Diego passed the pole to them, </p><p>and they fell to at their work. </p><p> Jimmy came out from his talk with Kauf-</p><p>man. He spied Winifred in the dining- </p><p>room, and stopped at the door. She was </p><p>fetching something from the pantry to the </p><p>table. With an eager gesture she bade him </p><p>enter. </p><p> “What did he have to say?” she queried.</p><p>Jimmy glanced around. Kaufman’s eyes </p><p>were at the slide. He was listening. Jimmy </p><p>calmly closed the door on him. </p><p> “He said a lot of things,” he replied. “I</p><p>reckon you wouldn’t care to hear some of </p><p>them. They were not exactly drawing- </p><p>room remarks.” </p><p> The girl placed the dish she held on a</p><p>tray on which were other dishes. She called </p><p>Sam from the pantry. </p><p> “Take it in to Herr Kaufman,” she</p><p>directed. She added austerely— </p><p> “If he shrugs at it bring it immediately</p><p>away, as you did this morning.” </p><p> Sam grinned knowingly and departed</p><p>with the tray. Jimmy’s blue eyes glinted. </p><p> “Kaufman was unmannerly about it this</p><p>morning?” he asked. </p><p> She nodded.</p><p> “But tell me what he said. Why did he</p><p>send for you?” </p><p> “Boiled down, it was to demand his in-</p><p>stant release under penalty of violence </p><p>from the legation staff.” </p><p> “He meant that we would be attacked?”</p><p>“Yes. War to the knife. You know— </p><p>‘blood and iron.’ That sort of thing.” </p><p>For The Flag	115</p><p> “You smile. You don’t take it seri-</p><p>ously,” she taxed him. </p><p> “Yes, I do; but one might as well smile</p><p>as cry. And it’s not so disfiguring to the </p><p>features.” </p><p> She smiled herself now.</p><p> “Well, what did you say to him?”</p><p>“Nothing much. I reminded him that </p><p>as he had set the example of violating the </p><p>neutrahty laws we felt at liberty to follow </p><p>in his distinguished footsteps. And I inti- </p><p>mated that we were very well prepared to </p><p>extend a warm. reception to any of his </p><p>friends who might consider it advisable to </p><p>come for him.” </p><p> “Is that all?” as he paused.</p><p> “The sum of it. Kaufman made a com-</p><p>ment in German when I was leaving. I </p><p>don’t know German, so I decided to accept </p><p>it as the expression of a profound interest </p><p>in my hereafter, and bowed myself </p><p>away.” </p><p> A small laugh escaped Winifred—his</p><p>manner was so entirely at variance with the </p><p>gravity of the situation. </p><p> “I like you that way,” he put forth</p><p>quickly. “May I say it? It makes me </p><p>feel that we are getting to be friends, not </p><p>just companions in a cause.” </p><p> The smile left her face. Her dark eyes</p><p>regarded him with a melancholy that moved </p><p>him to a great compassion, for he guessed </p><p>the origin. </p><p> “I think I answered that the other day,”</p><p>she said, her voice low. “Won’t you please </p><p>let it rest that way?” </p><p> But he was not content to do this until</p><p>he was assured that her objections were not </p><p>based on grounds other than those he </p><p>guessed. He discovered an urge in him to </p><p>put the issue to the test. </p><p> “YOU are not fair to me,” he told</p><p>her in warm protest. “I am not </p><p>-JLkj lightly asking for your friendship. </p><p>And at this time, when—when things may </p><p>happen—I wouldn’t intrude the question</p><p>if it did not mean a great deal to me.” </p><p> He reddened with the avowal, and went</p><p>on, blundering sadly in his confusion. </p><p> “I—I haven’t had much to do with girls</p><p>only in a sort of passing way—at college— </p><p>places like that—just funning with them. </p><p>Perhaps I’m not the kind to win a girl’s </p><p>friendship, though I haven’t thought about </p><p>that—not till now. You see, I’ve been </p><p>busy with other things a lot—in father’s </p><p>office for one thing, getting the hang of the </p><p>business, and-” </p><p> “Oh, don’t go on. Don’t.” Winifred</p><p>stopped him with a little outfiinging of her </p><p>hands. “It is not that—not you. Any </p><p>girl would want you for a friend. Only I— </p><p>I must deny myself your friendship. I can </p><p>not reach up to it. I—I am not worthy </p><p>of it.” </p><p> She bowed her head, standing before him</p><p>in humble abasement. His heart con- </p><p>tracted with the pity of it. </p><p> “I will not believe that,” he disputed</p><p>fiercely. “No one can make me believe </p><p>it, and least of all yourself. Some circum- </p><p>stance, some condition you were powerless </p><p>to prevent has been forced on you. I do </p><p>not ask what it is; I do not care what it is; </p><p>and whatever it is it could not affect my </p><p>regard for you. A man knows when he </p><p>stands in the presence of goodness, and </p><p>I know it now. Some one is coming! Will </p><p>you take me as your very faithful friend— </p><p>Winifred?” </p><p> His eyes were insistent upon her. In</p><p>answer—slowly, falteringly—her hand rose </p><p>from her side and went out to his. And </p><p>yet she did not wholly yield. She cried </p><p>out: </p><p> “Ah, you make me! How can I refuse?</p><p>But it is only until we are done here with </p><p>what we have to do—only until then. After- </p><p>ward, it must end.” </p><p> It was Sam coming back from Kaufman</p><p>that Jimmy had heard. The interruption </p><p>did not irk him. He was well satisfied to </p><p>let his reply to Winifred wait; for, in truth, </p><p>there was no reply ready to his tongue.</p><p>It was only a semi-understanding he had </p><p>achieved, but it was something. “After- </p><p>ward!” It was yet to come, and hope lives </p><p>in the tomorrow. </p><p> Sam’s white teeth showed in the ebon</p><p>setting of his face as he entered the dining- </p><p>room. The tray was not in evidence. </p><p> “Mister Coughem ain’t so rambunctious</p><p>’bout his vittels dis time, Miss Winny,” he </p><p>announced. </p><p> “Oh, he has changed his mind since morn-</p><p>ing, has he, Sam?” </p><p> “Yes’m. I reckon he beginnin’ ter feel</p><p>kinder sharp-set ’long ’bout now. But he </p><p>play off fusttlat he ain’t got no int’res’ in </p><p>w’at I’se a-bringin’ him. I make, des as </p><p>you tol’ me, fer de do’. He say: ‘Hey, </p><p>whar you gwine wif dat tray?’ Dey ain’t </p><p>ezactly de words he say, but dat’s w’at dey </p><p>Ii6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>specify. I say: Tse gwine ter tote it whar </p><p>it come fum, an’ dey ain’t a nudder tray </p><p>a-comin’ in yere arter dis. I’se done got </p><p>nuff ter do ’sides triflin’ time erway run- </p><p>nin’ in an’ outer yere on a fool bizness.’ </p><p>“Wif dat, he make a motion fer me ter </p><p>set de tray down. I done did it, an’ I waits </p><p>eroun’ a spell twell I see he ain’t gwine ter </p><p>turn up his nose at w’at you fixed fer him, </p><p>Miss Winny. But he don’t have nuffin’ </p><p>mo’ ter say, ’cept in dat outerlandish lingo </p><p>he make talk wif ter himse’f; an’ so I come </p><p>erway an’ leave him whar he is.” </p><p> The room, while Sam was speaking, had</p><p>taken on a strange livid hue. Jimmy went </p><p>to a window and looked out. The storm </p><p>Billy had prophesied was about to break. </p><p>Gusts of scorching air blew in on him. In </p><p>the yard old Tia Matilde was hurriedly </p><p>stripping a clothes-line of certain household </p><p>linens she had washed in the early hours of </p><p>the day. A blinding flash of lightning sent </p><p>Jimmy staggering back from the window. </p><p> “I’m not fond of fireworks,” he said with</p><p>a forced smile. “Not that kind. And </p><p>coming on top of that quake last night it </p><p>makes me skittish. Hadn’t we better see </p><p>to the windows on the west?” </p><p> “Yes. Close these in here, please. I</p><p>will look after the others. Sam, go out and </p><p>dose the shutters on this side.” </p><p> Winifred sped away, and Sam hastened</p><p>off on his mission. Jimmy saw to the win- </p><p>dows in the dining-room, and went out </p><p>into the hall. Tio Diego was steadying </p><p>the ladder for Billy, who was scrambling </p><p>down without any nice regard to his foot- </p><p>ing. He was panicky, and confessed it. </p><p> “That last flash! Gosh, I could feel it</p><p>to my boots,” he gulped. “You don’t smell </p><p>any brimstone about me, do you?” </p><p> “Father! Why doesn’t he come down?</p><p>It is raining great sheets in the valley. We </p><p>will get it in another minute.” </p><p> It was Winifred. She had run out of</p><p>the last west room, and was anxiously ques- </p><p>tioning Billy. </p><p> “He stopped to have another look with</p><p>the glass. You can see the road for miles </p><p>up there. We’d furled the flag—be whipped </p><p>to pieces if we hadn’t—when that flash </p><p>came. I didn’t wait to say good-by. But </p><p>Mr. Brewer just stood there looking up the </p><p>road like a boy watching for the circus. </p><p>Say, Miss Winifred, your father is a cool </p><p>hand all right. The kind to have.” </p><p> In the crepuscular light bred by the</p><p>onrushing tempest Jimmy could not see </p><p>the cross-fire of emotions pictured in the </p><p>girl’s face; but he could fancy how they </p><p>battled there—pride and pain, and with </p><p>victory aloof from either. Could Brewer </p><p>ever give back that which he had taken </p><p>from her? </p><p> The man was coming in from the roof,</p><p>the binocular swung from a strap about his </p><p>neck. He paused on the upper rounds of </p><p>the ladder to lower the wings of the sky- </p><p>light, and barely in time. A flying wave of </p><p>water dashed in on him, and sprayed those </p><p>below. Brewer was drenched to the skin; </p><p>but he finished his work. Then he came </p><p>down. </p><p>THE storm swooped bellowing about </p><p>the rock-built house. The rain </p><p>drove by in solid walls, and the </p><p>darkness of night was in the hall. Diego </p><p>crossed himself, and muttered what he </p><p>could remember of his prayers. None of </p><p>them gave a thought to Kaufman in his </p><p>solitary confinement a few feet away. </p><p>Brewer shouted above the turmoil to Sam: </p><p>“Light the lamp. Let us see what we </p><p>are about here.” </p><p> But Jimmy was already at the lamp, and</p><p>presently the enfolding gloom was relieved. </p><p>Winifred’s hand lay upon her father’s arm, </p><p>and she was urging him to his room. </p><p> “You must change your clothes,” she</p><p>said, putting her mouth close to his ear to </p><p>make him hear. “You will take cold.” </p><p> Her solicitude, warm and pressing, was</p><p>new to him. His pale face flushed under </p><p>it and, with a sort of timidness that brought </p><p>a kindred flush to his daughter’s cheek, he </p><p>laid his hand on hers and kept it there. </p><p>He bent his head to her.</p><p> “I am all right,” he told her. “It won’t</p><p>hurt me to wait, and I’ve something to say </p><p>when I can.” </p><p> He unslung the glasses and dropped them</p><p>in a chair. </p><p> They stood, all of them silently listening</p><p>to the uproar without. After a little the </p><p>first fury of it abated. It grew lighter. </p><p>The thunder rolled away into the distance. </p><p>The wind fell. The rain came down no </p><p>longer in bucketfuls but in measured lenity. </p><p>In half an hour the sun would be smiling on </p><p>the water-swept earth. </p><p> “I wanted to tell you,” Brewer said when</p><p>at last he could make himself heard in an </p><p>ordinary tone, “that my glass discovered </p><p>an open car coming from Cortina. It was </p><p>filled with men.” </p><p> “The Germans!” ejaculated Jimmy.</p><p>“How far off was it?” </p><p> “I should say about three miles. They</p><p>may not be the Germans, but we won’t be </p><p>caught napping at any rate. We are ready </p><p>for them.” </p><p> “They’ll have a merry time getting over</p><p>here,” derided Billy. “The ravine is a rag- </p><p>ing river by this. We are not getting the </p><p>full force of this rain; it started in the low- </p><p>land. It will be hours before they can </p><p>cross, if they haven’t turned back. What </p><p>do you say, Tio? This isn’t the first time </p><p>you’ve seen a cloudburst here.” </p><p> He addressed the old man in Spanish.</p><p>They talked at some length, and Jimmy </p><p>noticed that Billy was frowning and his </p><p>nose twitching fitfully. He cut Tio Diego </p><p>off with a curt gesture and spoke to </p><p>Brewer. </p><p> “He says there’s a foot-bridge down the</p><p>ravine about a mile, where it turns south. </p><p>It’s rocky there, and high and narrow. </p><p>That’s what piles the water up so when </p><p>it rains. The Indians built the bridge years </p><p>ago, Diego says. It was pretty shaky the </p><p>last time he saw it, but you could get </p><p>across.” </p><p> “If they know about it,” Jimmy inter-</p><p>jected. “Perhaps they don’t.” </p><p> “I think,” said Brewer quietly, “we had</p><p>better go on the supposition that they do </p><p>know about it. Anyway, they are likely </p><p>to explore the ravine before giving up.” </p><p> “In this rain?” objected Jimmy.</p><p> Billy jeered at him.</p><p> “Rain? A German isn’t afraid of water</p><p>on the outside of him; it’s on the inside he </p><p>kicks at.” </p><p> “But the car. What will they do with</p><p>it?” </p><p> “Run it in the bushes off the road until</p><p>they are ready to go back.”</p><p> Brewer smiled in a set, stem way.</p><p>“Perhaps,” he remarked, “they won’t go </p><p>back. At least, not with Kaufman. Sam, </p><p>go around the house and close every shut- </p><p>ter. We won’t have time for it if they try </p><p>to rush us. And we’d better have lunch </p><p>right away, Winny. I’ll be with you in </p><p>five minutes.” </p><p> He drew his arm from the girl’s hold on</p><p>it, very gently, and went into his room. </p><p> “My heavenly home!” exclaimed Billy</p><p>as the door shut. “If I was an insurance </p><p>agent I’d hate to have popper Kaufman </p><p>for a risk. Not if he started to cut up with </p><p>Mr. Brewer about.” </p><p> He did not laugh. He was in sober ear-</p><p>nest. Jimmy’s eyes sought Winifred’s, but </p><p>there was a faraway look in hers that did </p><p>not take him in. She murmured some- </p><p>thing about seeing Tia Matilde, and slipped </p><p>away down the hall. </p><p>TO BE CONCLUDED </p><p>ME AND “Muley” Bowles and </p><p>“Chuck” Warner are putting </p><p>a saddle on a colt in the Cross </p><p>J corral, when “Telescope” Tol- </p><p>liver enters the precincts of said ranch, and </p><p>we gets our first glimpse of Archibald Ames. </p><p> Archibald occupies a seat on the buck-</p><p>board with Telescope, and they soon comes </p><p>over and climbs on top of the corral fence. </p><p>Archibald’s name fits him—in a way. The </p><p>length of his first name indicates his girth </p><p>and his last name his height. He’s one of </p><p>them persons who you’d never invite to set </p><p>down, ’cause he don’t seem to require no </p><p>such posture. </p><p> It takes him quite a long time to nego-</p><p>tiate the top-pole of the corral, and when he </p><p>does get up there he has to balance—his </p><p>feet won’t reach the next pole. He’s wear- </p><p>ing them dinky little pants, with the seat </p><p>of a shoplifter and the knees of Lord </p><p>Fauntleroy. His calves perspire in shiny </p><p>leggings, and for a hat he wears a libel on </p><p>the name of Stetson. </p><p> Muley gives him a passing glance, yanks</p><p>up another notch on the cinch, and grunts— </p><p>“What’ll we do with it?” </p><p> “Love it to death or render it out,” grunts</p><p>Chuck. “Looks to me like one of them </p><p>playthings for kids that yuh can’t tip over </p><p>and make it stay down. Let’s give this </p><p>colt a chance to breathe, while we peers a </p><p>little closer at this attraction.” </p><p> We ambles over and looks up at the</p><p>critter’s soles. </p><p> “Mister Ames,” orates Telescope, “I’m</p><p>obliged to make yuh used to Muley Bowles. </p><p>He’s the sylph-like critter in woolly chaps. </p><p>That one with the sad, horse-faced features </p><p>is Chuck Warner, the anti-George Wash- </p><p>ington of Yaller Rock County, and the </p><p>other person down there is Henry Peck. </p><p>They’re all harmless. </p><p> “Bunch, this is Mister Archibald Ames,</p><p>who is to be with us for a spell.” </p><p> “I’m pleased to meet yuh,” smiles Archie.</p><p> “You ought to be,” agrees Muley. “It</p><p>ain’t often that we shows this much interest </p><p>in a stranger. What seems to bring yuh</p><p>hither?” </p><p> “I brung him,” states Telescope. “Mis-</p><p>ter Ames is looking for local color. Sabe?” </p><p> “What’s he done, and is he wanted by</p><p>Federal, State or county?” asks Chuck, </p><p>serious-like, wiggling his ears. </p><p> Chuck can wiggle his ears just like a</p><p>mule. </p><p> “Done what?” grunts Telescope. “Chuck,</p><p>you boob, don’t yuh know what local </p><p>color is?” </p><p> “I’ll bite,” grins Chuck. “Go ahead and</p><p>spring it, Telescope.” </p><p> Telescope clears his throat, rolls a cigaret</p><p>and glares at Chuck, who glares right back, </p><p>and wiggles his ears. </p><p> “Look at them ears!” applauds Archi-</p><p>bald. “I’d love to get a close-up of them.” </p><p> “Mister,” reproves Chuck, “it ain’t</p><p>seemly that a stranger should set on top </p><p>of a corral and make remarks about the </p><p>physical failings of a native son. Keep on </p><p>at the pace you’ve started, and that spell </p><p>that Telescope spoke about can be spelled </p><p>in four letters: g-o-n-e. Sabe?” </p><p>18 </p><p>Dough or Dynamite	'	119</p><p> “You got a lot to say about it, now ain’t</p><p>yuh?” reproves Telescope. “You ain’t </p><p>nothing around here but a forty-dollar </p><p>puncher. You got a lot of chance to tell </p><p>visitors where to head in. Come on, Mister </p><p>Ames, and we’ll go up and see the man </p><p>what owns this ranch, and ain’t no more </p><p>sense than to pay forty dollars to a runt </p><p>like that.” </p><p> They climbs down and goes up to the</p><p>ranch-house. </p><p> “Haw! Haw! Haw!” whoops Muley,</p><p>shaking every ounce of his two hundred and </p><p>forty pounds of bone and lard. “Haw! Haw! </p><p>‘ Come on, Mister Ames, and we go up to </p><p>see the man’—haw, haw, haw! You will </p><p>tell folks where to head in at, will yuh?” </p><p>Muley is a poet. There might ’a’ been </p><p>as good rhymers as him once upon a time, </p><p>but they’re all dead and departed. Muley </p><p>is the he-buzzard of the flock right now. He </p><p>hangs on to the side of the corral and wipes </p><p>the tears out of his eyes. </p><p> “Gosh!” he snorts. “Telescope sure</p><p>showed his breeding, Chuck. Yuh could </p><p>tell he’s been well raised. Sticks his chin </p><p>up in the air, like a grouse with a goiter, </p><p>and proclaims: ‘Come on with me, Mister </p><p>Ames.’ Haw! Haw! Haw!” </p><p> “Some day I’m going to reach up and</p><p>hang my fist on his jaw,” proclaims Chuck. </p><p> “You better catch him in bed or carry a</p><p>ladder with yuh,” says I. “You got ambi- </p><p>tion, Chuck, but your height ain’t noways </p><p>adequate.” </p><p> A little later old man Whittaker, who</p><p>owns the Cross J outfit,rcomes out with </p><p>Archibald, and them two goes back to town </p><p>in the buckboard. Telescope comes down to </p><p>the bunk-house and sets down in our </p><p>midst. </p><p> Chuck gives him a mean look, and goes</p><p>on playing solitaire. Telescope admires </p><p>himself in our cracked shaving-mirror. </p><p> “Better fix your features in your mind,</p><p>Telescope, ’cause you’re sure going to need </p><p>a pattern after Chuck gets through with </p><p>yuh,” laughs Muley. </p><p> “That banty little ear-wiggler!” snorts</p><p>Telescope. “I got a feeling that I ain’t </p><p>going to punch cows much longer.” </p><p> “Dead men punch no cows,” states</p><p>Chuck. “Your perceptions are getting </p><p>clearer.” </p><p> “Where do yuh feel bad, Telescope?” I</p><p>asks. “Tell papa where it hurts.” </p><p> “Aw -1” Telescope turns from the</p><p>mirror and glares at us. “I’m glad I’m </p><p>going to get away from you half-wits.” </p><p>“Has the old man been kicking on yuh </p><p>wasting so much time over at the Bowers </p><p>ranch, holding hands with Miss Amy, or </p><p>has that tumble-bug yuh had down to the </p><p>corral been whispering sweet nothings in </p><p>your ear?” asks Chuck. </p><p>“YOU leave Miss Bowers’ name </p><p>out of itl” snaps Telescope. “Mis- </p><p>ter Ames is a moving-picture man, </p><p>and I may cease punching the festive cow </p><p>to play hero parts for him. Me and him </p><p>have had quite some conversation regarding </p><p>same, and he assures me that I’ve got the </p><p>physique and features for a lead.” </p><p> “You got the physique and features for a</p><p>funeral if yuh don’t quit wearing my red </p><p>tie,” says I. “That’s right—throw it on </p><p>the floor. If yuh wants to make a hit </p><p>with folks, why don’t yuh buy some clothes </p><p>of your own?” </p><p> “Tell us all about it, little one,” begs Muley,</p><p>resting his fat chin on hi5 hands, and squint- </p><p>ing at Telescope. </p><p> “Sing us a song of a locoed man,</p><p> Who got stuck on your face and shape—</p><p> A form that was built by accident,</p><p> And the face of a jungle ape.</p><p> Sing us a song of a keeper bold,</p><p> Who went sound asleep one day,</p><p> A keeper who’s going to show up soon,</p><p> And lead little Archie away.”</p><p> “I’ll tell yuh nothing!” yelps Telescope.</p><p>“You fellers are just plumb ignorant.” </p><p>“Ain’t it true?” nods Chuck. “I’d take </p><p>a job, too, if I was begged.” </p><p> “You!” snorts Telescope. “Haw, haw,</p><p>haw! Mister Ames told me that if he wanted </p><p>something for the public to laugh at he’d </p><p>sure hire you. No, Chuckie. This is a </p><p>moving picture—not a sideshow.” </p><p> “Here’s the idea,” continues Telescope.</p><p>“Mister Ames wants something real. He </p><p>wants real punchers and-” </p><p> “Ninety-eight cents in Chicago,” nods</p><p>Chuck. “I seen in a mail-order catalog </p><p>where yuh could get good ones for-” </p><p> “He wants a real hold-up,” states Tele-</p><p>scope. “He wants a stage held up, and he </p><p>don’t want no fake. Sabe? Somehow he’s </p><p>got the idea that I could do it artistic- </p><p>like.” </p><p> “Your experience will help yuh out,”</p><p>nods Chuck. “There was a hold-up over </p><p>in Mexican Canon once, and the feller-” </p><p>120 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Sufficient, Chuck!” snorts Muley, and</p><p>Chuck winks at me. </p><p> “Well, of course it wasn’t done by one</p><p>man,” murmurs Chuck. “One of the posse </p><p>shot the horns off a animile and made a </p><p>muley. Correct me if I appear to be wrong.” </p><p>“You stand corrected,” states Muley. </p><p>“Desist from historical romance, or I’ll re- </p><p>member one Summer afternoon down in </p><p>Cottonwood, when a certain man went into </p><p>a bank, and-” </p><p> “I accepts the correction,” admits Chuck,</p><p>playing a red queen on a red king, and Tele- </p><p>scope continues: </p><p> “You fellers keep this under your hats.</p><p>Sabe? Along about Wednesday afternoon </p><p>I’m going to hold up the stage from Pipe- </p><p>rock. Of course after it’s over I’ll return </p><p>everything, and all the while this picture </p><p>will be taken. He wants to advertise it </p><p>as a real hold-up, and she will be all that.” </p><p>“Going south, as she drags out of Hell </p><p>Gate Crossing,” orates Chuck. </p><p> “That’s the designated place,” grins Tele-</p><p>scope. “You must ’a’ been studying the </p><p>situation, Chuck.” </p><p> “Suppose somebody takes a shot at yuh?”</p><p>I suggests. “Art Miller ain’t no suckling </p><p>infant, and if there’s a shipment from the </p><p>Golden Cross aboard there might be a </p><p>guard.” </p><p> “Yuh never can tell about them ship-</p><p>ments,” agrees Chuck. “I’ve tried several </p><p>times to find out.” </p><p> “No wonder yuh know a good place,”</p><p>laughs Telescope. “Never mind, there </p><p>ain’t going to be no shooting. I’ll have ’em </p><p>buffaloed. My shells will all be blanks. </p><p>If I makes good in this I cinches a job with </p><p>Archibald Ames, and it’s good-by to the </p><p>Cross J. No more will Mister Tolliver ride </p><p>the hills and smell of burnt hair and corrals. </p><p>Poor, eh? I’ll be eating breakfast in bed </p><p>while Chuck Warner is out chopping holes </p><p>in the ice so the doggies can drink.” </p><p> “A little more such talk and yuh won’t</p><p>have to be a actor to get breakfast in bed,” </p><p>states Chuck. “Keep it up, and you’ll </p><p>have all your meals in bed. If you wants </p><p>to hear me say what I think about you being </p><p>a actor you got to come outside. I got too </p><p>much respect for the bunk-house to express </p><p>myself here.” </p><p> This day being Monday, we has to put</p><p>up with that kind of conversation until </p><p>Tuesday afternooon, when Chuck opines </p><p>that he’s going up to Piperock. Chuck </p><p>can’t stand prosperity, and Tuesday is pay- </p><p>day. He’s a roulette fiend, and he runs into </p><p>bad luck every time he bucks a wheel in </p><p>Paradise, so he wearies his bronc with </p><p>monthly trips to Piperock. Once he won </p><p>eight dollars up there. It cost him forty </p><p>but he never figured that side of the </p><p>ledger. </p><p> Anyway we wishes him many happy re-</p><p>turns of the day, and he lopes away. As </p><p>he forks his bronc he grins at Telescope, and </p><p>says: </p><p> “To be a good actor, yuh got to imagine</p><p>you’re the party you’re imitating. Just </p><p>think you’re ‘Slippery’ Silverton, Telescope. </p><p>He’s a good pattern to go by. Sabe?” </p><p>Slippery sure ain’t no imitation. He’s </p><p>had the Montana officers buffaloed for so </p><p>long that they think he’s more than one </p><p>man. The accumulated rewards for him </p><p>look like the weekly clean-up at the U. S. </p><p>mint. </p><p> Me and Muley wishes to see the pro-</p><p>ceedings, so we rides down to Paradise </p><p>the next day with Telescope, and has con- </p><p>verse with Archibald Ames. He squints </p><p>at the sky and shakes his head. </p><p> “I doubt it,” says he. “Too cloudy.</p><p>Yuh can’t get snappy stuff in atmosphere </p><p>like this, and there can’t be no retake. </p><p>We’ll let her go until tomorrow. I may </p><p>set up after a while and get some character </p><p>stuff. Lots of local color aroimd here. </p><p>Good characters, and the background is </p><p>great. Know what I mean?” </p><p> “Perfectly,” says I. “Sheep-herders and</p><p>so forth.” </p><p> Telescope opines that old man Bowers’</p><p>ranch is calling him, so a little later on he</p><p>rides away. Me and Muley horns into a </p><p>poker game, and about an hour later Archi- </p><p>bald Ames invades the place and leans </p><p>against the bar. Mike Pelly leaves the </p><p>table to serve him, but Archie ain’t dry. </p><p>He asks a question— </p><p> “Can vou tell me where I can get some</p><p>raw beef?” </p><p> He turns to us, and we sees the most</p><p>wonderful black eye yuh ever seen. </p><p> “Holy henhawks!” I snorts. “What yuh</p><p>been doing?” </p><p> “I’ll tell yuh,” snorts “Doughgod” Smith,</p><p>from the doorway. “He’s been exhibiting </p><p>his danged ignorance. He opines to get a </p><p>picture of a shepherd and he picked me!” </p><p>“Doughgod ain’t no shepherd,” I explains </p><p>to Archie. </p><p>Dough or Dynamite	121</p><p> “This is a -of a time to tell me,”</p><p>wails Archie, and he goes across the street </p><p>to a restaurant. </p><p> The next we sees of him he’s taking a</p><p>picture of a rackful of broncs and then he </p><p>goes over and photygrafts a greaser kid and </p><p>a dog. </p><p> ME AND Muley donates as much</p><p>as we can to Mike’s game, and then </p><p>quits. We wanders down to Art </p><p>Miller’s barn, and sets down in the sun. </p><p>We haven’t been there long, when we sees </p><p>the stage drive up to the depot. They </p><p>dumps some stuff off, and then drives down </p><p>to the bam. Beside Art is old man War- </p><p>ner’s son Chuck, and when he sees us he </p><p>grins all over his homely face. Art sees us, </p><p>and they both whoops. </p><p> “Awful funny,” says Muley. “Haw,</p><p>haw!” </p><p> “Any time yuh don’t think it was yuh</p><p>got another think coming,” whoops Chuck, </p><p>hanging on to a front wheel. “Haw! Haw! </p><p>Haw! Left the danged fool up a—haw, </p><p>haw, haw—tree!” </p><p> Art leans against one of his wheelers, and</p><p>the tears runs out of his eyes. </p><p> “Some—haw, haw, haw—picture!” gar-</p><p>gles Art. “I ain’t laughed so much in my </p><p>whole life!” </p><p> Him and Chuck looks at each other, and</p><p>busts out laughing again. </p><p> “What seems to be tickling yuh?” asks</p><p>Muley. “Is it a secret?” </p><p> “Oh, glory!” gasps Chuck. “Listen, you</p><p>fellers. That’s going to be some picture. </p><p>Telescope held up that stage, but nobody </p><p>will ever see that picture. Haw! Haw! </p><p>Haw! We drives out of the crossing, and </p><p>he stops us, just like a regular bandit. Of </p><p>course we know he’s got blanks in his gun, </p><p>but we elevates our hands to make the play </p><p>good. He’s got a sack over his head, so </p><p>yuh can’t see his face, and I got a false mus- </p><p>tache on so he won’t know me. I made it </p><p>myself. </p><p> “Well, we kicks the express box off, and</p><p>sudden-like goes for our guns. He must </p><p>’a’ been dreaming to let us get the drop </p><p>thataway. We makes him throw his gun </p><p>in the river. Haw! Haw! Haw! </p><p> “Then we makes him put the box back</p><p>on the stage,” whoops Art. “After he gets </p><p>that done we makes him walk down to the </p><p>river, and get a big rock. Then we marches </p><p>him back and makes him put it on the empty </p><p>boot. He made ten trips after boulders. </p><p>Then we makes him dance a while, crawl </p><p>all the way around the outfit on his hands </p><p>and knees, and to finish up we made him </p><p>climb up an old cottonwood snag, and he’s </p><p>there when we drives out of sight, with our </p><p>thumbs at our noses at him. Haw! Haw!” </p><p>“Wait ’till I see Telescope,” promises </p><p>Chuck, weak-like. </p><p> “Haw!” says Muley. “He’d admire to</p><p>hear it, Chuck. He was here until a while </p><p>ago, and went over to Bowers’.” </p><p> “Here? Telescope?” squeaks Chuck.</p><p>“Uh-huh,” says I. “It was too cloudy, </p><p>so we postponed taking that picture.” </p><p> Art and Chuck looks foolish-like at each</p><p>other and then at us. </p><p> “Well!” says Chuck “I don’t sabe this.”</p><p>“That’s the trouble with you, Chuck,” </p><p>opines Muley. “Art don’t have much sabe </p><p>either. I reckon you fellers had about ten </p><p>thousand easy dollars crawling around your </p><p>stage on its hands and knees, and jus, to </p><p>show your contempt for it yuh rode away </p><p>with your thumbs at your nose and your </p><p>fingers wiggling at it.” </p><p> “Sus-slippery Silverton!” stutters Chuck.</p><p>“That sure was Slippery! Ain’t we the </p><p>dangdest fools on earth!” </p><p> “By a majority of two,” agrees Muley.</p><p>“Telescope will be delighted.” </p><p> “My -!” gasps Art. “Slippery Sil-</p><p>verton! I think that box had a shipment </p><p>from the Golden Cross. What a chance I </p><p>took!” </p><p> “All the way from Piperock,” says I, but</p><p>I don’t think Chuck got it—he was beyond </p><p>words. </p><p> Me and Muley went up and had a drink,</p><p>and Muley laughs so hard that he forgot </p><p>to pay for it. We meets Art a little later </p><p>on but there ain’t much fun joshing him </p><p>about it. </p><p> “It’s on Chuck,” says he. “He explains</p><p>the joke to me, and as she’s pulled off as </p><p>per schedule I thinks it’s all right.” </p><p> “But it spoils things for Telescope,” says</p><p>I. “You knowing about it spoils the hold- </p><p>up. It might look like a fake. Sabe?” </p><p>“That’s right,” agrees Art. “Telescope </p><p>is a friend of mine and—I got it! I’ll make </p><p>out that I don’t feel good, and I’ll ask </p><p>‘Ricky’ Henderson to drive for me. He </p><p>wants to come down anyway.” </p><p> “That’s fine,” says Muley. “Telescope</p><p>will make it right with you, and we won’t </p><p>tell him about today.” </p><p>122 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> That night we don’t have neither Tele-</p><p>scope or Chuck with us. Telescope is just </p><p>riding away as we come in, and we don’t </p><p>have a chance to talk with him, and Chuck </p><p>don’t come home, ’cause he’s too danged </p><p>ashamed to face Telescope. </p><p> The next morning the old man sends me</p><p>and Muley over to the Triangle to get some </p><p>cows that Johnny Myers brought out of the </p><p>Sleeping Crick Hills with some of his, and </p><p>we misses the picture-taking. We travels </p><p>as fast as we can, but the stage has gone </p><p>past when we hits the main road on our </p><p>way back. There ain’t nobody at the Hell </p><p>Gate crossing, so we pilgrims on to the </p><p>ranch. </p><p> About an hour later Telescope comes in,</p><p>and a little later Chuck drifts home. </p><p> “There seems to be a Jonah on this job,”</p><p>states Telescope. </p><p> “What yuh limping about, Telescope?”</p><p>asks Chuck. </p><p> “Hurt my knee. Reckon it’s a good</p><p>thing the stage didn’t come down today, </p><p>’cause I’d ’a’ been a cripple in that pic- </p><p>ture. Slipped on a rock.” </p><p> “Stage didn’t come down?” I asks, and</p><p>Telescope shakes his head. </p><p> “Nope. Me and Mister Ames was there</p><p>for two hours after the time, but she don’t </p><p>show up.” </p><p> “Didn’t come down?” wonders Chuck,</p><p>aloud. “Didn’t go to Paradise?” </p><p> “She sure didn’t. Hadn’t been there</p><p>when I left.” </p><p> Chuck looks foolish-like, and gets busy</p><p>reading an old magazine. I notices that </p><p>he’s got it upside down, but his lips are </p><p>moving, so I reckon it don’t matter. He’s </p><p>restless, and don’t sleep well that night. </p><p> The next morning, right after breakfast,</p><p>up rides Bill McFee, our unworthy sheriff; </p><p>Ricky Henderson, Art Miller and A1 Mc- </p><p>Guire, who manages the ground work of the</p><p>Golden Cross. Telescope limps over to </p><p>greet them, and they seems a heap inter- </p><p>ested in Telescope’s walk. </p><p> “What do yuh think, Ricky?” asks</p><p>McFee. </p><p> “I’d hate to swear to it, Bill, but he</p><p>limped.” </p><p> “I arrests yuh in the name of the law for</p><p>robbing the Piperock stage yesterday, Tele- </p><p>scope,” states Bill. </p><p> Telescope looks foolish-like at Bill, and</p><p>then laughs. </p><p> “Yesterday, Bill? Why, it never-”</p><p> “The description covers yuh,” states Bill.</p><p>“I got your pardner, who calls himself Archi- </p><p>bald Ames, in jail. -He’s already admitted </p><p>the intent to rob it, but says if you robbed </p><p>it he don’t know nothing about it. Said </p><p>he was late meeting yuh, so he don’t know </p><p>what yuh might ’a’ done.” </p><p> “Whoever done it got seven thousand in</p><p>that box,” states McGuire. </p><p> “Seven thousand!” wonders Telescope.</p><p>“I thought the clean-up was brought down </p><p>yesterday.” </p><p> “Some folks did,” grins McGuire. “We</p><p>figured to double-cross some wise folks.” </p><p> I hears a deep breath, and Chuck sets</p><p>down hard on the step. Old man Whitta- </p><p>ker comes out, and they has to chaw the </p><p>whole thing over again. </p><p> “Well,” says the old man, “I don’t think</p><p>that Telescope done it, but under the cir- </p><p>cumstances I reckon he’ll have to go to </p><p>jail.” </p><p> “At least yuh can have breakfast in bed,”</p><p>consoles Muley, and then he recites: </p><p> “A man in jail don’t have no cares;</p><p> The flight of time don’t bother him,</p><p> There ain’t no place for him to go,</p><p> The passing hours lightly skim.</p><p> The judge may say, ‘A year or two,</p><p> In places where they don’t need clocks,’</p><p>But you should care—when you get loose, </p><p>You’ve seven thousand in that box.” </p><p> “Muley, when I get loose I’m going to</p><p>cut your rhymer square in two,” proclaims </p><p>Telescope, and just then the old man leads </p><p>Telescope’s bronc up, and he rides away </p><p>with the posse. </p><p>WE’RE sad. Doggone, it sure is </p><p>a sad sight to see our compatriot </p><p>in the hands of the law. We </p><p>smokes a while, and then I turns to Chuck— </p><p>“Where is that seven thousand, Chuck?” </p><p>He looks, queer-like, at me for a moment, </p><p>and shakes his head. </p><p> “Danged if I know, Hen.”</p><p> “You had it, didn’t yuh?”</p><p> “Nope. Listen; I held up that stage</p><p>before it got to the ford. Sabe? I was </p><p>going to chase Ricky away and drive it </p><p>myself. Figured I’d have some fun with </p><p>Telescope. Sabe? Well, I scared-out </p><p>of Ricky. He ain’t got no nerves anyway, </p><p>and-” </p><p> “Wait!” yelps Muley. “Do you mean to</p><p>set there and tell us that you scared Ricky </p><p>so bad that he didn’t know your physique </p><p>Dough or Dynamite </p><p>123 </p><p>from Telescope’s? How about the limp?” </p><p>“Don’t rush me!” snaps Chuck. “Tele- </p><p>scope was so cocky about that picture stuff </p><p>that I figured to have some fun. Did yuh </p><p>ever walk on stilts? Well, I did when I </p><p>was a kid. I made me a pair that just </p><p>filled my boots, and pulled a flour sack over </p><p>my head. Limp? </p><p> “Of course I’d limp. I danged near fell</p><p>on my face when I yelled for him to stop. </p><p>I made him get out and walk back up the </p><p>road, and told him if he stopped I’d per- </p><p>forate him. I took the box off the seat, </p><p>which I figured was that shipment, and looks </p><p>her over. On it in big letters she proclaims </p><p>to be dynamite. I lays that box back on </p><p>the seat, gets my stilt tangled in a wheel, </p><p>and fell plumb off the grade. </p><p> “Well, the team ran away, that’s all I</p><p>know. I figured that Ricky would stop </p><p>’em—they wasn’t running fast.” </p><p> “What kind of a looking .box?” asks</p><p>Muley. </p><p> “Wooden box with two ends and four</p><p>sides. Regular dynamite box.” </p><p> “Well described,” applauds Muley. “All</p><p>we got to find is a wooden box, with two </p><p>ends and four sides.” </p><p> Art Miller comes back in about an hour</p><p>for some things of Telescope’s, and we talks </p><p>it over with him. </p><p> “Must ’a’ been Telescope or the party</p><p>what held her up that other time,” says </p><p>he. “The feller that me and Chuck fussed </p><p>around with didn’t have no limp.” </p><p> “Maybe the exercise that you and Chuck</p><p>gave him made him stiff and sore,” I suggests, </p><p>and Art grins. “Maybe. Funny thing </p><p>about that hold-up. After that feller helps </p><p>himself he must ’a’ scared that team, ’cause </p><p>they runs away and scatters things all the </p><p>way up to ‘Mighty’ Jones’ place, where they </p><p>smashes a front wheel on a stump and stops. </p><p> “Ricky says there was a box of dynamite</p><p>from the Golden Cross, the same of which </p><p>he holds careful in the seat. He said that</p><p>he was meek when held up, ’cause he was </p><p>afraid that feller might shoot into that box. </p><p>That box is a goner, and it’s a wonder it </p><p>didn’t blow that outfit to thunder—unless </p><p>that’s the treasure-box.” </p><p> Art pilgrims back towards town, and we</p><p>all starts for the corral. </p><p> “Where yuh going?” asks Muley.</p><p> “After some dynamite dough,” says all</p><p>three of us together. </p><p> We rides up and down that road from</p><p>the ford to Mighty’s place, but we don’t </p><p>find nothing. We stops at the old Soda </p><p>Springs trail, which shows fresh tracks. </p><p>By mutual consent we turns up the trail. </p><p>About half a mile up the crick we discovers </p><p>a camp. </p><p> We recognizes old “Frenchy” Timmons</p><p>as the party humped over the fire, tossing </p><p>flapjacks, so we rides up and greets him. </p><p>He’s got a couple of moth-eaten burros </p><p>nosing around his little tent. Frenchy is </p><p>so crooked that he’s suspicious of himself. </p><p>He’s one of them kind of prospectors what </p><p>goes around with the feeling that every man </p><p>what speaks kindly to him is laying to beat </p><p>him out of the next strike he makes. He </p><p>looks up through a decade of whiskers and </p><p>grunts a greeting. </p><p> “How’s your stock of location notices</p><p>holding out, Frenchy?” asks Muley. “For </p><p>a man with only two burros you can make </p><p>more ‘discoveries’ than any sourdough I </p><p>ever seen.” </p><p> “Yah-h-h-h!” gurgles Frenchy, way back</p><p>in the whiskers. “I find heem sometame, </p><p>Mooley.” </p><p> “You dang well know yuh—yuh sure</p><p>have, Frenchy. Look!” </p><p> Muley points behind Frenchy, and there</p><p>one end sticking out of the brush, is a </p><p>wooden box, and the word “DYNAMITE” </p><p>fairly yelps at us in big letters. </p><p> Frenchy turns to see what we’re looking</p><p>at, and the son-of-a-gun reaches for his </p><p>six-shooter. He was years too late. Me </p><p>and Chuck have him covered before he</p><p>can touch his gun, and he stands there like </p><p>a lamb, while Muley balances that box in </p><p>front of him on the saddle-horn. </p><p> “Next time yuh better find out who owns</p><p>things before yuh picks ’em up for yourself,” </p><p>advises Chuck. “Throw that gun over in </p><p>the brush! That’s the stuff. Now keep </p><p>your mouth shut! Sabe?” </p><p> Frenchy didn’t say a word, but we can</p><p>see that he’s a heap annoyed. We strings </p><p>out down the trail, and when we’re about </p><p>two hundred yards from the camp, conies </p><p>a splintering noise, and the report of a </p><p>big rifle. Me and Chuck throws our broncs </p><p>off the trail and gets down. We can hear </p><p>Muley complaining about tilings, and we </p><p>asks him why he feels so cross. </p><p> “Danged old pelican!” he wails. “That</p><p>bullet cut the comer off our box!” </p><p> “You still got it, ain’t yuh?” I asks.</p><p> “Uh-huh, I got her, Hen, but she almost</p><p>124	Adventure</p><p>met her Waterloo on a rock. Reckon it </p><p>loosened all the nails. Shall we go back </p><p>and smoke up that old coot?” </p><p> “Next Christmas,” replies Chuck. “That</p><p>old coot has got a Sharps .45-70, and the </p><p>Warners don’t care for that style of death. </p><p>He’s crazy, Muley, and we’d put ourselves </p><p>in his class if we went back.” </p><p> We lifts that box back on Muley’s sad-</p><p>dle, and went on. </p><p> We hits the road, and makes good time</p><p>for a mile or two, when we meets Mighty </p><p>Jones. He stops and we exchanges pleasan- </p><p>tries. We comments on the weather, the </p><p>crops—which theer ain’t none—and the </p><p>general wear and tear on the human race. </p><p>Muley switches the position of that box, </p><p>and the next second we’re covered by </p><p>Mighty Jones. I starts to grin, but when </p><p>I sees that Mighty is in earnest I irons my </p><p>face out flat again. </p><p>* “Hands up!” he snaps, and Muley lets that </p><p>box slip. She hits the ground and rolls </p><p>over. I glances at Mighty, and he’s got </p><p>the look on his face of a man who has seen </p><p>all there is in life, but ain’t reacjy to go </p><p>blind. </p><p> “My -1” he gasps, whirls his bronc</p><p>around and gallops off down the road like a </p><p>crazy man, holding on to his hat with one </p><p>hand and fanning his bronc with the other. </p><p> We watches him fade away in the dust,</p><p>and puts our hands down. </p><p> “Of all the locoed actions on earth that’s</p><p>the sharp end of the limit,” proclaims </p><p>Muley, sliding off his bronc. </p><p> That last shock was almost too much for</p><p>that box, ’cause when Muley essays to lift </p><p>her she sort ’a’ opened on one end. </p><p>MULEY HOLDS his position for a </p><p>moment, straightens up and gets on </p><p>his bronc without taking his eyes </p><p>off the box. He spurs his bronc, easy-like, </p><p>until he’s a few feet away from that box, </p><p>and then he imitates Mighty Jones. </p><p> Me and Chuck puffs away on our cigarets</p><p>and watches Muley depart. </p><p> “I’ll likely get scared, too, but I’m taking</p><p>a chance,” states Chuck, and walks over to </p><p>the box. </p><p> He sighs deep-like, and takes off his hat.</p><p> “Henry Peck, there must be a Supreme</p><p>Being what watches over fools and cow- </p><p>punchers. This box is full of eighty per </p><p>cent, dynamite. Come and take a look.” </p><p> “Your word is as good as gold, Chuck.</p><p>That stuff must have a good disposition to </p><p>stand all that grief. Let’s go home before </p><p>something happens to irritate it.” </p><p> We finds Muley at the ford, but he ain’t</p><p>got much to say. He asks Chuck if he saw </p><p>what was in that box, and Chuck said that </p><p>he did. </p><p> “Wonderful!” exclaims Muley. “It stood</p><p>rough handling but I never thought a face </p><p>like yours could look upon eighty per cent, </p><p>dynamite and not explode it. That’s why </p><p>I went away so rapid.” </p><p> The old man is home when we gets there,</p><p>and he announces that Telescope and Archi- </p><p>bald Ames are still in jail. </p><p> “What does Archibald have to say about</p><p>it?” I asks. </p><p> “That fat four-flusher!” yelps the old</p><p>man. “He says that Telescope might ’a’ </p><p>done it. Of course this Ames feller don’t </p><p>fit the description, but he might at least— </p><p> “I’m going down to see Telescope,” an-</p><p>nounces Muley. </p><p> "He lies down there in durance vile</p><p> Behind the bolts and locks,</p><p> With prison staring in liis face</p><p> ’Cause we can’t find that box,</p><p> That held a little bunch of gold,</p><p> Which was labeled dynamite.</p><p> Will we let our pal wear striped clothes?”</p><p> “Not by a gol-danged sight!” I finishes,</p><p>being somewhat of a poet myself. </p><p> Muley shakes my hand and invites me to</p><p>join the Perverted Order of Paradise Poets, </p><p>of which he’s the only living member. </p><p> “Don’t tell too much down there, Muley,”</p><p>advises Chuck. “If you rims off at the </p><p>mouth I might get eased into jail, and that </p><p>would cut down the number of detectives </p><p>on the case. Sabe?” </p><p> “Fear not,” says Muley. “I go but to</p><p>bring cheer to the needy. I will be back </p><p>anon.” </p><p> About three hours later Doughgod Smith</p><p>rides in, and we walks out to where him </p><p>and the old man are greeting each other. </p><p> “If this keeps on, Whittaker, you’re going</p><p>to be short of men,” states Doughgod. </p><p> “Huh!” grunts the old man. “One man</p><p>don’t make no difference this time of year. </p><p>Three punchers is enough to set around and </p><p>play cards, and eat up good grub.” </p><p> “You only got two left now,” says Dough-</p><p>god. “Muley’s in jail, too.” </p><p> “Muley!” snorts the old man. “What’s</p><p>he in for?” </p><p>Dough or Dynamite </p><p>125 </p><p> “Stealing dynamite from Mighty Jones.”</p><p>Chuck had started to set down on his </p><p>heels, but when Doughgod’s information </p><p>hits his ears he sprawls flat on his back and </p><p>blinks at the sky. I starts to lean on a </p><p>buckboard wheel that is ten feet away, and </p><p>I ends up on my back with my feet over </p><p>the tongue. </p><p> “Mighty spoke of some folks being ac-</p><p>cessory to the fact, too,” states Doughgod, </p><p>offhand-like. </p><p> “Stealing dynamite!” yelps the old man.</p><p>“Where, when and what for?” </p><p> “I don’t know. Mighty comes to town</p><p>and acts like a man what has had delirious </p><p>delight scared out of him. He anchors to </p><p>Felly’s bar until he’s gained normal again, </p><p>and then he speaks knowingly of powder- </p><p>thieves. Mighty’s half-loco, and what ain’t </p><p>loco is absent-mindness, but just the same </p><p>he has Muley arrested, and he hints of more </p><p>arrests as soon as certain persons hit town. </p><p>I seen Muley, and he said if I came this way </p><p>to have Chuck and Hen come to see him.” </p><p>“That’s right,” agrees the old man. </p><p>“We’ll all go down.” </p><p> “Not me,” says I. “I got rheumatic</p><p>pains in my knees. Notice how I fell over </p><p>that buckboard handle? I ain’t myself </p><p>today, and I simply couldn’t stand it to </p><p>ride.” </p><p> “Neither could I,” says Chuck. “I’m</p><p>sore all over. Let’s wait until tomorrow. </p><p>Muley will be there just the same.” </p><p> “We’ll go in the buckboard,” says the</p><p>old man. “In a case like this I’d go if I </p><p>had to walk.” </p><p> “I’d admire to walk,” says Chuck, but</p><p>the old man goes after the team, and me </p><p>and Chuck helps each other limp to the </p><p>bunk-house. </p><p> “Shake hands with a murderer, Henry,”</p><p>says Chuck, offering his hand. “I’ve killed </p><p>the old man and crippled Doughgod for life </p><p>—in my mind. You and me will spend the </p><p>evening and night in the Paradise jail, </p><p>Henry Clay Peck.”</p><p> “Can’t yuh think of nothing cheerful to</p><p>sing?” I asks. “If we’re in jail we never </p><p>will find that box. Think!” </p><p> “Think-!” yelps Chuck, going to the</p><p>door. “I’m going to enjoy the untainted </p><p>air as long as I can.” </p><p> I rustles out my war-sack and puts on</p><p>clean clothes. It’s liable to be some time </p><p>before I gets a chance to change again. </p><p>Chuck comes back after a while and sets </p><p>down on the bunk, disconsolate-like, and </p><p>plays “Just Before the Battle, Mother” on </p><p>his mouth-organ. Pretty soon the old man </p><p>yells to us. </p><p> We walks out, slow-like, and I climbs,</p><p>painfully, into the seat with the old man. </p><p>Chuck holds the team by the bits until </p><p>we’re all set. Then he lets loose and hops </p><p>aboard as we goes past. We whirls out of </p><p>the yard and hits the road on the run. Sud- </p><p>den-like that equipage does a high dive on </p><p>one side, and yours truly stands on his head </p><p>in a mesquite bush. </p><p> When I gets through making a cactus</p><p>pincushion of my cranium, I riseth up and </p><p>looks around. </p><p> Down the road about fifty yards sets the</p><p>old man, gazing off down the road, and cuss- </p><p>ing at a piece of line he’s still got in one </p><p>hand. I hears a groan across the road, and </p><p>Chuck’s head sticks up out of the brush. </p><p> The old man gets up out of the road and</p><p>painfully dusts off the seat of his pants. He </p><p>plods up to us and looks us over. </p><p> “By cripes!” he snorts. “I ain’t sus-</p><p>picious of nobody on earth. I’m a man </p><p>among men, and I don’t suspicion nobody, </p><p>but if that wasn’t foul play I’ll eat the whole </p><p>ranch. Now, I’ll haul you hombres to town </p><p>in a lumber wagon.” </p><p> He plods on to the house, while I extracts</p><p>cactus spines and cuss words from my car- </p><p>cass. Chuck limps over and rubs his hip. </p><p> “Light on a rock?” I asks, and he feels of</p><p>his hip some more. </p><p> He reaches into his hip pocket, takes out</p><p>an object and tosses it on the ground. </p><p> “Lit right on the darned thing!” he</p><p>groans. </p><p> It’s the nut off a front wheel of that</p><p>buckboard. I kicks it off into the brush, </p><p>and rolls a smoke. </p><p> “Well,” says he, after a while, “you</p><p>can give me credit for blocking the wheels </p><p>of progress for a minute, can’t yuh? I’ll </p><p>likely have to stand up all the way to town.” </p><p> “We’ll get plenty of time to rest,” says I.</p><p>WE GOT to Paradise, but it wasn’t </p><p>no pleasure-ride, and the first per- </p><p>son we see is Mighty Jones. </p><p> Mighty seems to have drowned his feel-</p><p>ings, and he’s spending his afternoon trying </p><p>to hold up the hitch-rack. The old man </p><p>goes in the saloon, but me and Chuck goes </p><p>over to have a interview with our enemy. </p><p>He nods at us like an owl. </p><p>126 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Tut-tut-tried to bub-blow me up,” he</p><p>stutters. “Tha’s mean thing to-to-to do.” </p><p>“Tell us all about it, old-timer,” says </p><p>Chuck, helping the old boy let loose of the </p><p>rack, and leading him over to the side- </p><p>walk. “What’s all this dynamite stuff I’m </p><p>hearing about?” </p><p> Mighty gets very deliberate in his lan-</p><p>guage: </p><p> “Eighty pershent. Tha’s good powder.</p><p>Sabe? Good powder but too ener-zhetic. </p><p>Know what I mean? Mine’s eighty per </p><p>shent. Stage rims away and schtops at </p><p>my place. I find box of shixty per shent. </p><p>Sabe? Eighty too dangeroush to pack, so I </p><p>exchanges. Sabe. Same price. Eighty </p><p>per shent. too easy on trigger. Know what </p><p>I mean? Lissen; shomebody mus’ ’a’ stole </p><p>that eighty from the stage, and I can’ fin’ </p><p>mine. Sabe?” </p><p> “Think!” yelps Chuck. “Think where</p><p>yuh put it, Mighty!” </p><p> Mighty bobs his head and screws up his</p><p>face: </p><p> “I know. Tha’s the box Muley tried to</p><p>assassinate me with.” </p><p> “That was eighty per cent.!” yells Chuck.</p><p>“Do yuh get that? It was eighty per cent.!” </p><p>“Zas so? Fool to drop eighty per shent. </p><p>Awful careless.” </p><p> “Where did you put that box you took</p><p>off the stage?” I asks, pronouncing every </p><p>word distinct and separate. </p><p> Mighty is so danged absent-minded that</p><p>yuh got to make him remember. </p><p> “You took it out of the stage, and then</p><p>what did you do with it?” </p><p> “Somebody must ’a’ stole—whoa! I</p><p>know! In the woodshed. I thought I put </p><p>it in the barn. Ain’ that the limit? Mus’ </p><p>go and turn poor old Muley loosh. Yes, </p><p>sir. He never stole nothing.” </p><p> "That’s right,” applauds Chuck. “Go</p><p>right over and tell the sheriff to turn him</p><p>loose.” </p><p> “I got to shee Ricky firsht,” states the</p><p>old pelican, wise as a barn owl. “Mus’ </p><p>shee if Ricky wants to hold him for stealing </p><p>that eighty per shent. Mighty Jones is </p><p>law-abiding pershon. Know what I mean?” </p><p>We watches Mighty weave down the </p><p>street, and Chuck grins all over his face— </p><p>“We’ll find Telescope’s and Muley’s </p><p>broncs, and we’ll go up to Mighty Jones’ </p><p>woodshed and rescue that money.” </p><p> We finds both broncs in Pelly’s barn, so</p><p>we saddles up and fares forth. We don’t </p><p>fare far until we meets Bill McFee. We </p><p>stops and asks Bill if there’s anything new. </p><p> “Nope,” says he. “I reckon we got ’em</p><p>in jail.” </p><p> “So?” says Chuck. “Bill, how would</p><p>you like to take a ride with us and bring </p><p>back that seven thousand?” </p><p> Bill grins like it was a good joke:</p><p>“Uh-huh. I’d admire that. What’s the </p><p>joke?” </p><p> “Ain’t no joke, Sheriff,” says I. “You</p><p>go with us and bring the gold back. Is that </p><p>satisfactory?” </p><p> “I’d admire to know a little more.”</p><p>“Not at all necessary,” says Chuck. </p><p>“Election is only three months away, and </p><p>the credit ain’t going to hurt yuh none, Bill.” </p><p>“That’s sensible,” agrees Bill. “I’m with </p><p>yuh.” </p><p> Bill attempts to find out things, but we</p><p>don’t talk much, and it’s dark when we </p><p>climbs off at Mighty’s place. We hikes </p><p>right over to the woodshed. Bill lights a </p><p>match and looks inside, drops the match </p><p>and don’t stop running for a hundred yards. </p><p>Me and Chuck gallops with him for a ways, </p><p>sort of sympathetic-like. </p><p> “Bobcats!” whistles Bill. “Shed’s full</p><p>of ’em!” </p><p> Yuh never can tell what kind of a pet a</p><p>nut like Mighty is liable to have, so we ain’t </p><p>surprised a lot. </p><p> “I ain’t afraid of no cat what ever lived,”</p><p>states Chuck. “I’m going to get that box </p><p>in spite of anything.” </p><p> We pilgrims up close again, with our guns</p><p>ready. Chuck finds an old newspaper, </p><p>which he lights, and we peeks around the </p><p>corner of the door, and looks right into the </p><p>shiny eyes of two big cats. Three guns </p><p>goes off at the same time, and three men </p><p>went away. There ain’t a sound from the </p><p>shed, so we sneaks back. </p><p> “That’s good shooting,” applauds Bill.</p><p>“Two shots killed ’em both, ’cause I shot </p><p>in the ground.” </p><p> “Sure was,” I agrees, “I did, too.”</p><p>“Wonderful!” agrees Chuck. “They must </p><p>’a’ jumped high, ’cause mine went through </p><p>the roof.” </p><p>Chuck tosses in that burning paper. </p><p>Them cats are still there but don’t move. </p><p> “Rugs!” snorts Chuck. “Mighty is sort</p><p>of a taxidermist, and he put them eyes in </p><p>himself. They sure look natural.” </p><p> We found that box. Chuck makes a</p><p>presentation speech to the minion of the </p><p>Dough or Dynamite </p><p>127 </p><p>law, who recites a few appropriate words in </p><p>return. Bill takes the box on his saddle- </p><p>horn, and we goes back to Paradise. </p><p> We gets McGuire and all the rest of Para-</p><p>dise’s population to see the grand opening. </p><p>We assembles in Pelly’s saloon and Mike </p><p>furnishes the hammer. </p><p> “Gents,” states Bill, “this ain’t a com-</p><p>plete exoneration of Telescope and Ames, </p><p>but I reckon it clears ’em a plenty. The </p><p>law recovers said stolen property, but I’ll </p><p>let Mister Warner and Mister Peck tell the </p><p>story. I can hunt lost things but I can’t </p><p>tell a interesting story like some folks.” </p><p>“You better superintend this, McGuire,” </p><p>he continues. “It’s a lot of wealth to look </p><p>upon.” </p><p> He tears the top boards off, and Paradise</p><p>gazes a plenty. </p><p> Me and Chuck takes one gaze, and slips</p><p>loose. We meets at the door, ambles around </p><p>the comer and forks our broncs. I follers </p><p>Chuck’s lead, and about a mile from town </p><p>we stops and looks back. </p><p> “Henry,” says he, sad-like, “who do you</p><p>suppose put them rocks m that box?” </p><p>“If I knew I’d be a murderer,” says I, </p><p>and then it strikes me funny. “Box of </p><p>scab-rock guarded by two mounted bob- </p><p>cats! Haw! Haw! Haw! Mister McFee, </p><p>we hereby puts in your care and cus- </p><p>tody one box, the value of same being prob- </p><p>lematical. You being a duly elected officer </p><p>of the law, and, we having faith in your </p><p>integrity and sense of duty, turneth over </p><p>said box to be dealt with as yuh see fit,” </p><p>says I, quoting Chuck’s woodshed speech. </p><p> “Value being problematical takes the</p><p>curse off anyway, Hen,” says he. </p><p> It’s about midnight when we arrives at</p><p>the Cross J. The old man is in the bunk- </p><p>house, and he looks us over, sad-like. </p><p> “What are you fellers trying to do?” he</p><p>asks. “The sheriff sure is one sore person. </p><p>Says he can prove that one or both of you </p><p>was mixed up in that robbery.” </p><p> “Aw -!” snorts Chuck. “I thought</p><p>it was the right box.” </p><p> “It was. McGuire identified it. The</p><p>question is this: you knowed where the box </p><p>was—where are the contents? That’s what </p><p>Paradise wants to know.” </p><p>“Paradise ain’t got nothing on us, eh, </p><p>Chuck?” says I. “If they wanted to know </p><p>any worse than we do they’d all be sick.” </p><p>Me and Chuck talks it all over and decides </p><p>that the longer we’re out of jail the more </p><p>they’ll have against us when we do get in, </p><p>so we decide to give ourself up before we’re </p><p>liable to capital punishment. </p><p>THE next morning we rides away </p><p>to be locked up in self-defense. Just </p><p>outside of Paradise we overtakes an </p><p>Injun. He’s jogging along on a glass-eyed </p><p>pinto, and he grins when he sees Chuck. </p><p>Chuck stands in with all the aborigines. </p><p>“Hello, Tenas Charley,” grins the buck. </p><p>“Hello, Hiawatha,” grins Chuck. “Where </p><p>you go so early?” </p><p> “You sabe Doc Milliken?”</p><p> “You bet. Why you wantum?”</p><p> “Givum letter. Me got letter. White</p><p>man hurtum leg. No walk. Me go to Doc </p><p>Milliken. Sabe?” </p><p> He fusses around in his blanket and pro-</p><p>duces a piece of paper. Chuck takes the </p><p>paper and reads the few words. He hands </p><p>me the letter and grins. It reads like this: </p><p>Hurt my leg. Follow the Injun to me. </p><p> There ain’t no name signed.</p><p> “Heap scared,” informs the Injun.</p><p>“Hurtum leg on tree.” </p><p> “Where you camp?” asks Chuck, and we</p><p>gets informed that it’s on Little Beaver </p><p>Crick. Chuck gives him back the letter, </p><p>and swings around. “So long, Setting </p><p>Bull,” says he, and the Injun grins and bobs </p><p>off down the road. </p><p> “Now where?” I asks, and Chuck grins.</p><p>“Slippery Silverton!” he whoops. “If it</p><p>was anybody around here they’d ’a’ signed </p><p>their name. He’s hived up with that Injun, </p><p>and we’re going to land him, Henry. Maybe </p><p>he's got the gold, too.” </p><p> It didn’t take us long to find that camp.</p><p>We advances on foot. There’s a white man </p><p>setting on the sunny side of that teepee, and </p><p>he’s in blissful ignorance until me and Chuck </p><p>lands on his shoulders like two playful bears. </p><p>He gets energetic, but Chuck taps him on </p><p>the head with his gun, and we hog-ties him </p><p>proper. When he opens his eyes Chuck </p><p>grins at him an’ says— </p><p> “Hello, Slippery.”</p><p> He don’t say a word.</p><p> “Don’t talk,” advises Chuck. “Yuh</p><p>might wear out your teeth.” </p><p> The feller looks at us, foolish-like, so we</p><p>hoists him up on Chuck’s bronc, and Chuck </p><p>rides behind him. Once he opened his </p><p>mouth and spoke one line: </p><p> “You fellers are an hour late.”</p><p>128 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> That’s all he said. I reckon Chuck hit</p><p>him pretty hard. </p><p> We pilgrims right into Paradise, and up to</p><p>Pelly’s saloon. There ain’t a soul in sight, </p><p>but we observes signs of life down where we </p><p>holds our court. We takes our captive </p><p>down there, cuts the ropes off his legs and </p><p>takes him inside. </p><p> The place is crowded and Telescope is on</p><p>the stand. We gets in just in time to hear </p><p>the judge ask Telescope if he can think of </p><p>any earthly reason why he shouldn’t be </p><p>held for the next term of court. </p><p> “A lot of reason, Judge!” yells Chuck,</p><p>pushing our prisoner up to the front. </p><p>“Here’s the main reason. Gents, I makes </p><p>yuh used to Slippery Silverton!” </p><p> “Silverton-!” I hears McGuire yelp.</p><p>“That’s the owner of the Golden Cross mine, </p><p>Mister Warde.” And then he horns his </p><p>way over to our prisoner and snorts— </p><p>“What does this all mean?” </p><p> “I don’t know,” says the feller. “I-</p><p>I must ’a’ got hurt. Unless I’m mistaken </p><p>I came part-way from the mine with Joe </p><p>Allerton. We had that gold shipment. We </p><p>sent out two decoy boxes on account of </p><p>so many robberies. We rode across the </p><p>hills. Joe figured on just making that train. </p><p>He went to Helena. I wanted a pair of </p><p>moccasins, and Joe left me at that Indian </p><p>teepee. The owner wasn’t there, so I </p><p>waited. That’s all, I guess. Somebody </p><p>jumped on to me and—here I am.” </p><p> “The—the gold didn’t come down yes-</p><p>terday?” gasps McGuire, and Warde shakes </p><p>his head, painful-like. “No. Just a box </p><p>of rocks.” </p><p> Just then in comes Doc Milliken.</p><p> “Say!” he yells. “Will one of you strong</p><p>men come and help me set a man’s leg? </p><p>Mighty Jones cut a tree the wrong way and </p><p>it lit on him. Lucky he was found by an </p><p>Injun, who came for help. He was able to </p><p>send a note but fainted before he could sign</p><p>his name. All I want is somebody to hold </p><p>him down. He’s so absent-minded that </p><p>he’s liable to run away. He says to tell </p><p>Ricky Henderson that his box of dynamite </p><p>is either in the hay-loft or under his </p><p>cabin floor. He can’t remember which.” </p><p>Art Miller is standing close to Chuck, and </p><p>Chuck grabs him by the arm and whispers— </p><p>“What does a new wheel for your stage </p><p>cost, Art?” </p><p> “About eight dollars, Chuck—why?”</p><p> “Here’s ten. Don’t ask me.”</p><p> While there is plenty of talk me and</p><p>Chuck backs out and rides out of town. </p><p>We’re in the bunk-house when Telescope </p><p>and Muley and the old man comes home. </p><p>Telescope and Muley comes in and looks </p><p>us over, solemn-like. Pretty soon Muley </p><p>climbs up on the bunk and recites, with ap- </p><p>propriate gestures and feeling: </p><p> “Let me sing yuh a song of four danged fools,</p><p> Four punchers whose brains are nix,</p><p> Who done some things they ought not to do,</p><p> And got in a-of a fix.</p><p> One was stuck on himself and wanted to be</p><p> Admired at ten cents a throw.</p><p> Another wore stilts so he’d look like a man,</p><p> When he went out after the dough.</p><p> Three of the fools fooled with dynamite,</p><p> One beat up an innocent man.</p><p> The price of a wheel was all that it cost.</p><p> You may beat it—I don’t think yuh can.”</p><p> “Beautiful,” says I. “You’ve got a</p><p>soul, Muley. There’s still that box of dy- </p><p>namite of Mighty’s to account for.” </p><p> “He picked it up on his way home,” says</p><p>Muley. “That’s settled.” </p><p> “Did Archibald Ames get his local color?”</p><p>I asks, and Telescope shakes his head. </p><p>“Archibald Ames didn’t wait for nothing. </p><p>He even hired somebody to drive him to </p><p>Silver Bend. I asked him what he wanted </p><p>me to do, and he told me to go to a place </p><p>where they don’t cut holes in the ice. </p><p> “You’ll miss them meals in bed,” sympa-</p><p>thizes Chuck, wiggling his ears, and ducks </p><p>outdoors just in time. </p><p> A boot-jack splintered on the door be-</p><p>hind him. </p><p> “Well, it ended all right anyway,” grunts</p><p>Muley. “How’d yuh say yuh hurt that </p><p>leg, Telescope?” </p><p> Telescope peeks out of the door, and then</p><p>limps back to me and Muley. • </p><p> “I didn’t go to Bowers’ that first day the</p><p>stage was robbed,” he whispers. “Don’t </p><p>breathe it to a soul. I wouldn’t have Chuck </p><p>hear it for a million.” </p><p> We holds up our right hands.</p><p> “Well,” says he, “that cottonwood snag</p><p>they made me climb didn’t have no bark </p><p>on it, and when I started down I slid too </p><p>fast. Sabe?” </p><p> “Chuck was right!” I snorts. “He sure</p><p>told the truth that time.” </p><p> Telescope hops to his feet and grabs me</p><p>by the arms. </p><p> “What do yuh mean, Hen? What did</p><p>Chuck say?” </p><p> “He said it sure was slippery,” says I.</p><p> Author of "The Christman'' and “The Idol of ‘It’.'’</p><p>IN THE district of the Upper Ituri </p><p>where the ground begins to rise in </p><p>rhythmic waves as if summoning cour- </p><p>age for the mighty heave of the </p><p>Mountains of the Moon, are patches of </p><p>grass land, brown freckles on the green </p><p>face of the forest whose lips are the mouth </p><p>of the sun-kissed Congo. </p><p> In one of these glades at the time of the</p><p>stirring of life from the noon siesta, the </p><p>stagnant air was rippled as slightly as a </p><p>leaf impinging on the placid waters of a </p><p>lake by the breathing of a white man who </p><p>sprawled at the foot of a great tree, his bare </p><p>head glowing like a pumpkin against the </p><p>fungoid bark. A scarlet-and-emerald lizard </p><p>darted from the grass, paused by the butt </p><p>of a rifle propped against the trunk, and </p><p>flashed away at the quirk of the outstretched </p><p>arm. A water-buck appeared like a warm </p><p>shadow twenty paces distant, snuffed deli- </p><p>cately and vanished. The yellow pall of </p><p>heat beyond the blue shadows shimmered. </p><p> As the dank silence was scratched by the</p><p>shriek of a parrot, rose from the grass two </p><p>faint sounds resembling the softest gurgles </p><p>from a water-bottle. </p><p> The white man slept on, one gaitered leg</p><p>thrown across the other. Within three </p><p>feet of them the stems of the rank grass </p><p>were parted slowly, revealing the glimmer </p><p>of eyes. Again came the liquid noises. </p><p>The eyes developed into the frame of a small </p><p>brown face, woolly-headed, having a squat </p><p>nose which seemed to snuff the air. Stealth- </p><p>ily followed as small a body, wrinkled and </p><p>bony, holding in a claw-like hand a tiny bow </p><p>9 </p><p>and arrow. Two more raptorial beings </p><p>glided in his wake. </p><p> As the sleeper stirred and emitted a</p><p>choked sigh, the three were frozen into </p><p>immobility But when the steady breath- </p><p>ing recommenced the patient creep began </p><p>again, suspiciously; continued until the </p><p>leader peered inquisitively into the pallid </p><p>face half-hidden by the red beard and hair. </p><p> The great frame twitched and the eyes</p><p>opened. Then as swiftly as the dart of </p><p>the lizard the rifle disappeared into the</p><p>long grass. Something—perhaps the blue- </p><p>ness of the eyes—stayed the fingers on the </p><p>bowstrings as the white man heaved on to </p><p>his elbow and stared at the two bronze </p><p>figures poised to shoot or to flee. </p><p> “Say,” he remarked quickly but amiably,</p><p>“I am pleased to see you!” </p><p> The smile or the voice distracted the</p><p>savages. One hopped a pace; but the </p><p>leader held his ground. </p><p> “I suppose,” continued the white man</p><p>smiling, “that if I take my eyes off you, </p><p>you’ll consider it necessary to stick me </p><p>with one of those ridiculous arrows? And </p><p>I notice that my rifle’s gone. Presumably </p><p>there are others of you. Possibly many; </p><p>behind me probably.” </p><p> He ceased to speak. The bowstring of</p><p>the younger savage tautened. </p><p> “Very good, my son,” pursued the white</p><p>man hastily, “as my melodious accents </p><p>seem to please you I will continue— </p><p>although I fail to see anything particularly </p><p>humorous in the situation.” He smiled </p><p>largely. “Habari gani? Kusema Kiswahili? </p><p>129 </p><p>130 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Nothing doing, eh? Now I suppose that </p><p>if I attempt to pantomime my most ele- </p><p>mental need you’ll surely misconstrue my </p><p>intentions? Presumably the primitive life </p><p>conduces to as cynical a view of other </p><p>people’s motives as does civilization? Is </p><p>that so?” </p><p> The steady smile deepened, but the eyes</p><p>did not quaver. </p><p> “However, we’d better introduce our-</p><p>selves. I’m Professor John P. O’Gorman </p><p>of the American Museum of Natural His- </p><p>tory, very much—obviously—at your ser- </p><p>vice! And you, I presume, are the original </p><p>pigmy, n’est ce pas? Sir! I am most de- </p><p>lighted to have made your acquaintance— </p><p>having traveled some five thousand miles </p><p>for that express purpose. Certainly you </p><p>are most interesting. I wonder whether </p><p>you would mind standing up? No? Ah </p><p>well, from this elevation I should hazard </p><p>a guess that you are not more than three- </p><p>feet-six—at most—and I’m six-three! </p><p> “Quite a Gulliver, eh? You haven’t read</p><p>Swift? Evidently your educational system </p><p>is as defective as the American! Ah, you </p><p>don’t appreciate the joke? Well, no mat- </p><p>ter! But by the way this smile is getting </p><p>rather worn and my shoulder’s devilish </p><p>stiff. Now I wonder-” </p><p> Cautiously he began to move his arm.</p><p>Instantly came a water-bottle cluck and </p><p>the fingers tautened. </p><p> “Dear me,” observed Professor O’Gor-</p><p>man, “this is the longest lecture I’ve ever </p><p>given—and such attentive students I’ve </p><p>surely never had! But what in hell am I </p><p>to do? Yes, yes, I will resume! Now— </p><p>er—I wonder whether it would interest you </p><p>to know that your skulls appear to be sub- </p><p>brachycephalic? More interesting than you </p><p>appear to suspect. Unfortunately I haven’t </p><p>got my instruments with me. However— </p><p>I wish you wouldn’t fiddle with that bow- </p><p>string! It gets on my nerves. </p><p> “Yet I rather doubt whether the fire-</p><p>hardened point of that ridiculous arrow </p><p>would penetrate this cloth. Very inter- </p><p>esting point. No, I didn’t intend to pun.</p><p>I’m not feeling like that just now. I’ve got </p><p>that disagreeable sensation popularly—and </p><p>most descriptively—known as pins and </p><p>needles in my elbow—and my shoulder </p><p>aches abominably. Now I wonder what </p><p>gesture would convoy William J. Bryan to </p><p>your bright, young intellects?” </p><p> He raised his right hand toward his</p><p>mouth. Phttl An arrow quivered in his </p><p>coat above his heart. He remained motion- </p><p>less, never relaxing the intent gaze nor the </p><p>fixed smile. </p><p> “That, gentlemen,” he said in a quiet</p><p>voice, “is distinctly an overt act!” </p><p> Very slowly he moved the arrested hand,</p><p>plucked out the arrow and snapped it </p><p>between two fingers. The two heads </p><p>quirked in a bird-like movement as he cast </p><p>the pieces on the ground. Professor O’Gor- </p><p>man saw indecision. In one action he sat </p><p>up, bunching his knees. The savages </p><p>hopped backward; and stopped to watch </p><p>as he tore open his shirt, exposing a bare </p><p>white chest. He grinned widely. Again </p><p>came the rapid clucks. </p><p> “You forget that I always carry my note-</p><p>book in that pocket—although I’ll admit </p><p>that your-arrow does penetrate!” said </p><p>the professor and held out his hand. </p><p> They made no attempt to shake, but</p><p>evidently understood the amicable sig- </p><p>nificance of the gesture. </p><p> “Good! Now we’ll try again!”</p><p> He motioned to his mouth, masticating</p><p>imaginary food. They put up their bows </p><p>and timidly, suspiciously, clucked at him. </p><p> “No savee!-the Tower of Babel!”</p><p> They chattered and pointed across the</p><p>glade and at their mouths. </p><p> “Good. I get you. Very hospitable!”</p><p>ppT“l AS HE rose the two little men </p><p>I	hopped to one side nervously and</p><p>I—-'stared up at the giant as if para-</p><p>lyzed by the realization of his height. </p><p> “I hope you don’t live far away,” re-</p><p>marked the professor, “as I’m - tired. </p><p>And I wonder whether you’ll think me </p><p>impolite if I ask what you’ve done with </p><p>my rifle? Ah, you devil!” as he caught a </p><p>glimmer of eyes in the long grass and the </p><p>blue gleam of the barrel. </p><p> The pigmy leader who, erect, looked like</p><p>a hairless ape, clucked violently, pointing. </p><p>“All right, my son, lead on!” </p><p> The professor nodded vigorously; but</p><p>the savage gabbled and hopped behind him. </p><p>The professor hesitated; then strode on in </p><p>the direction indicated. </p><p> “- it!” he grumbled, as the pigmies</p><p>trotted behind him across the glade like </p><p>children herding a red ox, “this is the first </p><p>time I’ve ever been driven!” </p><p> But in the forest the professor was not so</p><p>fresh; progress was laborious. Once he </p><p>John O’Damn </p><p>131 </p><p>stopped and thought that he had lost his </p><p>escort—until a soft cluck drew his eyes </p><p>to a brown face and a pipe-stem of an arm </p><p>in the riot of greens, pointing the way. </p><p> “Oh, damn!” gasped the professor as he</p><p>slid into green slime to his knees, “this </p><p>stinks like H2SO4!” </p><p> The professor plunged on, panting and</p><p>sweating, scrambling from gnarled root to </p><p>root across acres of bog, wading through </p><p>swamp and crashing through undergrowth. </p><p>The relaxation from the strain of grinning </p><p>and talking for his life had cooled the </p><p>enthusiasm evoked by the meeting with </p><p>any being who merited the description— </p><p>however remote—of genus homo after thirty- </p><p>six hours in a hot dank prison whose walls </p><p>were green and clinging. He began to </p><p>realize the gravity of his plight; and his </p><p>temper began to fray. He swore feebly </p><p>but venomously. </p><p> At last when the irritation of fatigue</p><p>appeared intolerable, he suddenly became </p><p>conscious of twenty pairs of eyes regarding </p><p>him from the tangled screen of creepers. </p><p>He stopped. Skinny arms and legs rustled </p><p>the leaves. They swarmed down and </p><p>clustered ’round him, a quaint band of </p><p>dusky beings scarce up to his middle. </p><p> “Good afternoon, gentlemen!” said the</p><p>professor, recovering his sang-froid with an </p><p>effort. </p><p> The sound of his voice evoked a gust of</p><p>dental chatter like a puff of wind among </p><p>Autumn leaves. A wizened being whom </p><p>with difficulty he recognized as the leader </p><p>of his captors, so much alike were they, </p><p>strutted in front of him pointing ahead. </p><p>The professor obeyed, expecting to come </p><p>upon a clearing or opening in the forest </p><p>in which the village would be located. But </p><p>twenty paces away he was halted abruptly </p><p>by the sight of a strange being, head and </p><p>shoulders above the little people, whose </p><p>body gleamed pallidly in the half light of </p><p>the forest, a being showered to the hips in </p><p>amber hair. </p><p> “Pithecanthropus!” murmured the pro-</p><p>fessor eagerly. “Impossible—but-”</p><p> A slender arm was upraised as she</p><p>clutched a tendril; one leg was poised for </p><p>flight, the foot upon a branch with a </p><p>prehensile grip. She peered in Eve-like </p><p>curiosity at the red-bearded giant. The </p><p>evidence of his senses bewildered the pro- </p><p>fessor—yet the presence of a lady brought </p><p>reaction—he took off his helmet. </p><p> Amid a gale of clucks the girl appeared</p><p>to glide upward, disappearing in the wall </p><p>of green. Amazedly he stared at the </p><p>circle of little men, each with a bow strung </p><p>menacingly. Quickened by the need of </p><p>conciliatory action he held out his hand. </p><p>The gesture was successful. The wizened </p><p>elder loosened his bowstring and shot </p><p>upward into the tree, clucking violently. </p><p> “Now what the devil can this amazing</p><p>person be?” grumbled the professor as </p><p>footsore, black with sweat and slime he </p><p>sank on to a gnarled root. </p><p> For a few moments there sounded the</p><p>rustle of leaves and a faint purling as of a </p><p>brook over stones. Then came a scuttling </p><p>among the little men peeking at him as </p><p>from the wall of green emerged the girl </p><p>advancing upon a fallen log like an acrobat, </p><p>her hair spread out like an amber peacock </p><p>tail, each tress borne by one of the little </p><p>people who strutted in a crescent behind </p><p>her. </p><p> Fearful of offending again, the professor</p><p>sat with the helmet upon his knee. At five </p><p>paces from him the cortege halted. Her </p><p>flesh, he saw, had a strange waxiness like </p><p>green ivory; the abundant hair was of a </p><p>very fine texture; the small oval face with </p><p>wild blue eyes was poised upon a well-pro- </p><p>portioned body—seeming like a tower of </p><p>chalcedony above the dark bronze escort. </p><p> While his mind fought with a flail of</p><p>questions he rose slowly and said very </p><p>gently— </p><p> “Good evening, madame!”</p><p> She continued to stare silently, her small</p><p>lips parted like an astonished child. </p><p> “Er—you speak English?”</p><p> She did not blink.</p><p> “H’m. Vous ties Francaise? Non?</p><p>Well—Sprechen Sie Deutsch? H’m. Ilabla </p><p>Espanol? No? Nothing doing, eh?” </p><p>Pointing at him she uttered several labial </p><p>syllables. A chill of horror affected the </p><p>professor as he realized that she could speak </p><p>no language save this—simian lingo. But </p><p>how 011 earth had she gotten here? These </p><p>people must have stolen her. She was </p><p>evidently Aryan—and brought up by these </p><p>monkeys. Away from all civilized environ- </p><p>ment! Terrible! But . . . The pro- </p><p>fessor’s scientific mind and training over- </p><p>came sentiment. He ejaculated— </p><p> “Really the most interesting case I’ve</p><p>ever heard of!” </p><p> She smiled—a white smile, not a grin,</p><p>132 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>exposing small, white teeth—and darting </p><p>forward, the escort attached seeming to jerk </p><p>forward like puppets on a wire, ludicrously, </p><p>she pulled the professor’s beard. </p><p> “Amazing!” ejaculated the professor,</p><p>acutely interested. </p><p> He smiled at her. She laughed silently</p><p>like a vastly tickled child. </p><p> She clapped her hands and chattered.</p><p> “-it, I wish you would not do that!”</p><p>exclaimed the professor. “It offends— </p><p>one’s sense of what a lady should do!” </p><p>Again she laughed soundlessly and paused </p><p>expectantly. The professor stared. She </p><p>drummed her small feet impatiently, chat- </p><p>tered, and suddenly pulled his beard again. </p><p> “Dear me,” remarked the professor,</p><p>“what is it that you wish me to do? At </p><p>any rate,” smiling, “you seem determined </p><p>to get my goat!” </p><p> As the professor guffawed she clapped her</p><p>hands delightedly and began to dance. </p><p> “Ho! Ho! Ho!” roared the professor,</p><p>hands on knees, tickled by the conclusion </p><p>that she connected the pulling of his beard </p><p>with the control of his laughter; a guffaw </p><p>which startled her into a peal of clear </p><p>laughter. </p><p> “He! He! He!” she squealed, capering</p><p>madly in front of him, apparently intoxi- </p><p>cated by her own vocal expression while her </p><p>escort rustled about by her jerking tresses, </p><p>solemnly regarded this strange rite. </p><p> The reaction from this paroxysm left him</p><p>weak. He sank back on to the root. The </p><p>sudden solemnity sobered the girl. She </p><p>gaped as he motioned to his mouth; and </p><p>turning swiftly, wrenching her hair from </p><p>her absurd courtiers, beckoned and led him </p><p>to a fire smoldering at the foot of a great </p><p>tree. As he stood gazing ’round for their </p><p>village or camp she thrust a blackened </p><p>calabash pot into his hands. After pecking </p><p>at the glutinous mess with a forefinger he </p><p>recognized the faint sweety taste as wild</p><p>cassava which he bolted, greedily regarded </p><p>by the little people with as absorbing </p><p>an interest as a launch of New Yorkers </p><p>watching the excavation of a drain-pipe. </p><p> The food produced an intense desire to</p><p>sleep. But the girl who had squatted to </p><p>regard him fascinatedly, rose eagerly. </p><p> “Oh, damn!” exclaimed the professor</p><p>irritably as she plucked his beard, smiling </p><p>with childish anticipation. “Nothing doing! </p><p>Savee? I want to sleep! Sleep!” </p><p> But having gotten the correct reaction</p><p>from the beard-baiting she began to clap </p><p>delightedly. He gestured violently and </p><p>posed his head upon his hand. The girl </p><p>regarded him inquisitively as if demanding </p><p>whether this were a new game. Then </p><p>comprehending, began to swarm up a tree. </p><p>The professor was nonplussed; but as he </p><p>stared upward he observed what appeared </p><p>to be giant nests amid the branches. </p><p> “Oh, my God!” he groaned. “Now I’ve</p><p>got to be a bird!” </p><p> With the aid of her prehensile toes she</p><p>led the band with simian ease; but for </p><p>the professor with his bulk and heavy boots </p><p>the way was as hard as the path of righteous- </p><p>ness. Exhausted and panting, he crawled </p><p>into a shelter formed of branches interlaced </p><p>across horizontal boughs, and sprawling </p><p>in a corner sank instantly to sleep amid a </p><p>crowd of chattering women and children. </p><p> From a ridiculous dream in which he was</p><p>in a hospital being tickled by nurses he </p><p>became semiconscious. A real poke in the </p><p>ribs elicited an “Ow!” and brought him wide </p><p>awake to find that he was packed like a </p><p>codfish in a tin of sardines between moist </p><p>limbs and bodies. </p><p> A vivid realization of his environment—</p><p>and the stench—impelled him to dash out </p><p>of the hut, only quelled by the recollection </p><p>that he could not fly. Now and again </p><p>above the rhythmic breathing and the drip </p><p>of the forest which sounded like eternal </p><p>weeping came the dismal hoot of an owl. </p><p>The professor groaned, swallowed a mouth- </p><p>ful of fetid acrid heat, and lapsed into the </p><p>slumber of the exhausted. </p><p>II </p><p>6JKS8I THE strain of thirty-six hours’ wan- </p><p>dering in the jungle, although it had </p><p>not killed scientific interest in his </p><p>amazing discovery, had clouded the pro- </p><p>fessor’s mind until the elemental needs of </p><p>food and sleep had been satisfied. </p><p> But when he awoke to find himself alone</p><p>in the green light of dawn he realized fully </p><p>the gravity of his plight. These little </p><p>people were undoubtedly the wild pigmy </p><p>of the forest, seldom seen or even glimpsed </p><p>by whites or negroes, a primitive shy folk </p><p>who even in bartering with their com- </p><p>paratively tame brethren of the forest </p><p>fringe, would only consent to leave skins </p><p>at a tree in the darkness and return the </p><p>following night to collect the sweet potatoes, </p><p>John O’Damn	133</p><p>or copper wire, or other produce left for </p><p>them. They were nomads; neither culti- </p><p>vating nor fighting; living mostly on edible </p><p>roots and game in the deepest recesses of </p><p>the Congo forests. </p><p> The professor’s camp was two hundred</p><p>miles from the nearest Belgian outpost; </p><p>and he was—he had no idea how far from </p><p>his camp. What chance had he of being </p><p>rescued? As he stared despondently at </p><p>the glow of sunrise leaf-patterned on the </p><p>forest roof he could hear them chattering. </p><p>He listened, mechanically noting four </p><p>distinct clicks—a labial, kissing sound; </p><p>dental, as a monkey chatters; palatal, as </p><p>a carter encourages his horse; and a lingual, </p><p>a gurgling klop-klop of a water-bottle; so </p><p>he concluded that their language consisted </p><p>of combinations of these four clicks. </p><p> “Interesting,” he mused; but how the</p><p>devil was he to communicate with them, </p><p>to ask aid, to offer a reward? He knew a </p><p>little Kiswahili, the lingua franca of middle </p><p>Africa; but they, no word. As he jotted </p><p>down notes he became aware of a looseness </p><p>in the waist. His belt had gone! Hence </p><p>the ridiculous dream of nurses tickling! </p><p>The devils had the cartridges as well as </p><p>the rifle! However, there was nothing to </p><p>be done but to make the best of the situa- </p><p>tion by studying the conditions. What a </p><p>splendid monograph he would be able to </p><p>write—if ever he got free! </p><p> As he continued to scribble the girl swung</p><p>from a bough into the communal nest. </p><p>Squatting on her haunches she smiled at </p><p>him. He smiled. She chattered, and </p><p>stretching out her hand, pulled at his </p><p>beard. </p><p> “Good morning then,” said he, “as evi-</p><p>dently that’s what you want, eh?” </p><p> She laughed, a loud peal of delight.</p><p>“Imitative,” continued the professor. </p><p>“Probably you’ve never laughed aloud in </p><p>your life until you heard me. Savages </p><p>never do. However, you seem to enjoy </p><p>it thoroughly. Satisfying a repressed </p><p>instinct. She gesticulated delightedly. </p><p>Splendid! Now for the first thing suppose </p><p>we begin a lesson? Your imitative faculty </p><p>should help you some. Food! Food! </p><p>Food!” he repeated, pointing to liis open</p><p>mouth. “Get that?” </p><p> But she chattered and pointed below.</p><p>“No; not yet. I want you to say it, my </p><p>dear. Listen—foo-d! Foo-d!” </p><p> As he leaned toward her mouthing the</p><p>word, she goggled and perked her head on </p><p>one side like an inquisitive sparrow. After </p><p>he had performed about twenty times she </p><p>pursed her lips. </p><p> “Fool!” she said, blowing it at him.</p><p> “Not bad!” said the professor. “Now</p><p>again—foo-ddd!” </p><p> But she persisted in counting it as a new</p><p>game, blowing at him and giggling. The </p><p>professor considered and pointed to his </p><p>mouth and below. Immediately she swung </p><p>out of the nest with the effortless ease of a </p><p>monkey. He clambered after her, watched </p><p>by a dozen- faces. Below were the ashes </p><p>of a fire. The girl proffered him a lot of </p><p>the cold or tepid cassava. </p><p> “Oh, damn!” ejaculated the professor</p><p>with an image of breakfast food before him. </p><p> The girl laughed delightedly.</p><p> “H’m,” said he, sticking a finger in the</p><p>mess. “-of a joke, isn’t it?” </p><p> While he ate—not much—he regarded</p><p>the crowd of men and women. They </p><p>found him a most absorbing object. The </p><p>women wore no ornaments of any kind, </p><p>not even the usual tribal cicatrices; the </p><p>woolly hair was unkempt. On even the </p><p>stoutest of them the ribs showed plainly </p><p>in contrast to the white girl who although </p><p>lean was well fleshed. </p><p> Evidently, mused the professor, heredi-</p><p>tary powers of digestion and resistance—or </p><p>perhaps she gets the pickings. </p><p> Overcome by a longing to know the exact</p><p>conformation of the skull, he advanced to a </p><p>young pigmy, judging from her breast. </p><p>With a squeak she fled. Instantly the </p><p>white girl chattered angrily, provoking </p><p>much clucking among the tribe which was </p><p>finished by the girl seizing the child and </p><p>dragging her up to the professor.</p><p> She protested volubly. He hesitated,</p><p>fearing to rouse their ire, but concluding </p><p>that the girl had the power of a chief and </p><p>guessing at their conception of his in- </p><p>tentions, decided that it would be best to </p><p>disabuse their minds. So while the girl </p><p>held the terrified child he ran expert </p><p>fingers over the skull, estimating shrewdly </p><p>the dimensions and formation. </p><p> Then just to show that there was no</p><p>favoritism he turned his attention to the </p><p>white girl. She stood as still as a rock as </p><p>his fingers fumbled beneath her hair. </p><p>Gravely extracting his memo-book he made </p><p>notes. The little folk watched the magic </p><p>ritual in complete silence. </p><p>134 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Thanks very much,” he said, bowing</p><p>solemnly. </p><p> The girl laughed, seemingly eager for</p><p>the slighest excuse to exercise her newly </p><p>found vocal accomplishments, and he </p><p>noticed that save for the head man, who </p><p>had grinned, no facial contortion re- </p><p>sembling mirth ever disturbed the pigmies’ </p><p>features—tending to the conclusion that a </p><p>sense of humor only developed in ratio to </p><p>the intellectual development. </p><p> The compliance of the lady suggested that</p><p>he might be able to enlist her aid in recov- </p><p>ering his rifle and cartridges. He patted </p><p>her arm to emphasize approval, and pointed </p><p>to his waist and peered around. The girl </p><p>watched him attentively, chattered and </p><p>began to make a hoarse screaming noise. </p><p> Puzzled the professor again pantomimed</p><p>the missing belt, which elicited once more </p><p>the bellowing as the girl pointed at him </p><p>and to the forest. The noise suggested </p><p>a bad imitation of a cow lowing. </p><p> “But a cow—here!” murmured the pro-</p><p>fessor. </p><p> She laughed delightedly, gestured at the</p><p>stolid folk still gazing and then walked awaj' </p><p>beckoning. Immediately the professor </p><p>moved, the whole tribe followed him. The </p><p>sight of one little man bearing a smoldering </p><p>stick and of women loaded with babes and </p><p>calabashes gave him an idea. They were </p><p>on the march! </p><p>WHERE were they going? Prob- </p><p>ably deeper into the forest, making </p><p>escape more improbable than ever. </p><p>As the professor halted the tribe stopped in </p><p>his wake. The wizened little captor mate- </p><p>rialized, pointing a pipe-stem arm. Two </p><p>yards away the girl, waist deep in under- </p><p>growth, beckoned. The sun was merely </p><p>an incandescent glow through the roof of </p><p>the forest. The professor could not take </p><p>his bearings and had he been able to see </p><p>he was not sure in what direction he had </p><p>wandered from the camp. Perforce he </p><p>must obey. </p><p> As he plunged on the tribe melted away</p><p>except for the girl leading him. But they </p><p>were there; now and again he could catch </p><p>a glimpse of a tiny brown leg or arm, a </p><p>head, and hear the click-click of a conversa- </p><p>tion in the dense green. </p><p> To the professor the struggle was almost</p><p>insupportable; but the little folk slid </p><p>through the jungle as snakes glide through </p><p>grass. Occasionally the professor was com- </p><p>pelled to rest, panting and exhausted. </p><p>Sometimes the harsh screams of a flock of </p><p>parrots broke the eternal dripping of the </p><p>forest and the perpetual rustle of the </p><p>myriad life. </p><p> And they stuck to the “cursed” forest;</p><p>forest all the time. Once when an open </p><p>glade was sighted through the cavernous </p><p>gloom the professor jibbed and pointed </p><p>earnestly to the blinding spread of sunlight. </p><p>But the girl chattered and beckoned </p><p>straight ahead; and a dozen thin arms </p><p>protruded through the green walls. Always </p><p>was he conscious of those eyes watching, </p><p>ever driving him. </p><p> Sometimes the girl would squat on the</p><p>limb of a tree and watch him patiently. </p><p>When the exasperated professor cursed </p><p>aloud she would laugh delightedly—and </p><p>the professor swore anew! Twice when </p><p>he failed to curse she approached and </p><p>pulled his beard and “he! he’d!” with </p><p>delight at the torrent of oaths with which </p><p>the professor reacted. </p><p> As they were traversing a piece of com-</p><p>paratively dry going she suddenly leaped </p><p>a clear six feet to the right. He stopped. </p><p>The girl chattered at him excitedly. At </p><p>first the professor could see nothing; then </p><p>a mass of brilliant green leaves and dark </p><p>shadows moved. He saw the coils of a </p><p>snake. The professor moved quickly. </p><p> The farther he went the more anxious</p><p>grew the professor. They might be off </p><p>on a week’s march for all he knew. He </p><p>couldn’t do it; no white man could. </p><p> At last at 10:25 by his repeater the</p><p>professor mutinied. He sank down on a </p><p>root and refused to budge. He made </p><p>signs of sleep. The whole tribe, only </p><p>fragments of it visible, discussed the </p><p>situation energetically. But the professor</p><p>didn’t care. He slept. </p><p> When he awakened from a short doze he</p><p>found the girl squatting a few feet from </p><p>him as motionless as a sphinx. No sign </p><p>of the little folk could he see; but he had </p><p>learned enough to know that they were </p><p>not far off. Immediately she saw that he </p><p>was awake she approached and pulled his </p><p>beard. </p><p> The professor had thought this was</p><p>funny at first, but now he was tired and </p><p>irritable. He scowled and spoke no word. </p><p>She seemed surprised, and she made a move </p><p>to repeat the action; but the professor </p><p>John O’Damn </p><p>135 </p><p>snarled fiercely, showing his teeth like a </p><p>red-muzzled Irish terrier. She appeared </p><p>to understand the menace and desisted. </p><p>Then after a pause she pointed to her head. </p><p>The professor stared. She reached and </p><p>taking his hand put it in her hair. For a </p><p>moment he left it there, puzzled to know </p><p>what she could mean. He laughed. She </p><p>wanted to have her bumps read again. </p><p>The tickling sensation was pleasing. </p><p> He scratched her head. She whined.</p><p>As soon as he ceased she chattered at him, </p><p>but he shook his head. Smiling she </p><p>plucked his beard. This time the pro- </p><p>fessor felt better-tempered. </p><p> “All right, my dear,” said he, “you can</p><p>get the reaction this time as it’s up to me </p><p>to make you my friend if ever I’m to get </p><p>out of this—and if you like I’ll take you too. </p><p>Would you like to?” </p><p> She laughed in delight and danced about.</p><p>“You’re a base flatterer, you know!” he </p><p>continued humoring her. “I never guessed </p><p>that I had such a charming voice before. </p><p>As' a matter of fact, it’s the music of your </p><p>own kind that pleases you. I wonder who </p><p>the devil your people were? How old are </p><p>you? Not more than fifteen I should think </p><p>by your development—allowing for the </p><p>tropics.” </p><p> She glided close to him and put down her</p><p>head. </p><p> “Well, I’m -!” said he. “I know</p><p>dogs love to have their ears scratched, but </p><p>never a human! D’you know you’d be </p><p>rather a beauty if you had a wash and got </p><p>dolled up a bit. What I can’t get is how </p><p>on earth you’ve gotten your color? You </p><p>certainly have the most extraordinary pig- </p><p>mentation. Say now, wouldn’t you like </p><p>better to come with me and get the benefits </p><p>of civilization? Eh? If I can get out of this </p><p>I guess I can get you with me, and it isn’t </p><p>the thing to let a white stay with these </p><p>friends of yours. What do you think?” </p><p>He stopped scratching and held her </p><p>face up. </p><p> “What do you think?”</p><p> She smiled delightedly and put her head</p><p>down to be scratched again. </p><p> “No, no! Look here!”</p><p> He held up her head and pointed to</p><p>himself, to her and the vague distance. </p><p>She stared, puzzled for a moment; and </p><p>then arose, evidently prepared to resume </p><p>the journey. </p><p> “No, no!” exclaimed the professor vigor-</p><p>ously. “You don’t get me. Come here!” </p><p>he beckoned. </p><p> Obediently she came and sat beside him.</p><p> “That’s it. Now let’s try another lesson.</p><p> Watch me! Foo-dd!”</p><p> “F-oool!” she blew at him ready for the</p><p> game again.</p><p> “Oh, damn!” said the professor.</p><p> “Oh, damn!” she echoed back at him.</p><p> The professor nearly fell off the root.</p><p> He stared. She seemed impressed with the</p><p> effect.</p><p> “Oh, damn!” she repeated distinctly.</p><p> With an effort he repressed the impulse</p><p> to laugh, aware Jjiat for some subconscious</p><p> reason she had gotten the impulse to</p><p> mimic.</p><p> “Foodd!” he said solemnly.</p><p> She repeated the word clearly—</p><p> “Foodd!”</p><p> “Good!” he ejaculated in triumph.</p><p> “Goodd!” she mimicked.</p><p> “Fine,” said the professor. “Now—”</p><p> tapping his chest—“John!”</p><p> “ ’Onn!”</p><p> “No good. Listen—Jo-hn!”</p><p> “ ’Onn!” she repeated.</p><p> “Oh, damn!” swore the professor dis-</p><p> appointedly. “Jo-hn/’</p><p> “John—oh, damn!” exclaimed she.</p><p> “Oh! Splendid!” shouted the professor.</p><p> “John, oh, damn!” she repeated joyfully.</p><p> Peal after peal of laughter startled the</p><p> little folk and fifty pairs of eyes watched</p><p> from the clouds of green this strange magic</p><p> of the white folk.</p><p>Ill </p><p> THAT afternoon the professor de-</p><p> cided that the better plan was to</p><p> delay their march as much as pos-</p><p> sible. Accordingly he resolutely refused</p><p> to move. They chattered and clucked,</p><p> but to no purpose; the professor had</p><p> mutinied. For some reason that he could</p><p> not fathom they finally elected to camp</p><p> on the ground, swiftly making shelters of</p><p> boughs and grass.</p><p> Desperately he kept on with the lessons</p><p> in English. Whether from a natural or</p><p> hereditary aptitude she picked up words</p><p> with surprising celerity. Many she got</p><p> muddled; misconnecting the sounds with</p><p> the objects. Try as he would he could not</p><p> dissociate the name John with “Oh damn”</p><p> so that she continued to touch him on the</p><p>136 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> chest with much delight saying, “John 0</p><p> Damn,” followed by a peal of laughter.</p><p> All through the heat of the day grimly</p><p>the professor played the wonderful new </p><p>game. Besides the interest in teaching </p><p>her and getting a little inside this strange </p><p>anomaly of a mind, there lay the principal </p><p>chance of escape. </p><p> One morning in the midst of a lesson she</p><p>put her hands on his chest and began to </p><p>pick at the fastening of his shirt. The </p><p>professor almost blushed! He held her </p><p>hand, wondering what on earth she was </p><p>after. She chattered at him expostu- </p><p>latingly, saying: </p><p> “Good! Good! John oh damn!”</p><p> Then she pointed to her own breast, to</p><p>his chest and at the little people. </p><p> For a while he could not imagine what</p><p>she could mean. Finally out of curiosity </p><p>he unbuttoned the shirt and dropped his </p><p>hands to see what she would do. With a </p><p>quaint gesture like a monkey opening a bag </p><p>of nuts she pulled the shirt apart. The </p><p>exposure of his bare chest startled a litter </p><p>of clicks. A finger touching his flesh and </p><p>her own acquainted him that she was </p><p>pleased to observe that they were both of </p><p>approximately the same color. </p><p> By the end of a week she had gotten the</p><p>sense of fully a score of words into her head; </p><p>and with such a vocabulary much may be </p><p>done. They were all words of simple and </p><p>concrete objects; verbs were limited to </p><p>“go,” “come,” “stop,” “sleep.” Each at- </p><p>tempt to invite her to escape with him </p><p>was doubtful; for the most he could attain </p><p>was to suggest more than one white man, </p><p>the vague distance, and that she would </p><p>go with him. She had assented eagerly </p><p>laughing, but whether she had understood or </p><p>not he could not determine, only could he' </p><p>await an opportunity. </p><p> Evidently the savages had thoroughly</p><p>established the identity of race or godhood, </p><p>whichever it was, between the two, for now </p><p>a separate shelter was erected for each of </p><p>them and his primitive behests were</p><p>obeyed without question except—the return </p><p>of his rifle and cartridges. For even gods </p><p>were not to be trusted in their estimation. </p><p> On one day the tribe did not make any</p><p>attempt to persuade him to march and </p><p>were very excited. The girl in explanation </p><p>made the cow-like noise again, which was </p><p>explained later by the bellowing of an </p><p>elephant. </p><p> “Come! Come!” said the professor.</p><p> “Come!” echoed the girl.</p><p> She led him through the jungle to a</p><p>swamp where an elephant, hamstrung by </p><p>the little people, lay wallowing and trum- </p><p>peting in death agony with half a dozen </p><p>tiny arrows in the soft of the joints. </p><p> The professor demanded his rifle. But</p><p>the girl replied that the beast would </p><p>“sleep.” When the elephant did “sleep” </p><p>the little folk were soon crawling over and </p><p>in the vast carcass like ants over a chunk </p><p>of meat. They camped immediately and </p><p>forthwith gorged themselves to repletion— </p><p>to sleep, to wake, to eat again. The pro- </p><p>fessor was in despair; yet he was weak and </p><p>thin and the meat food was strengthening. </p><p>He noticed that the girl ate moderately— </p><p>instinctively apparently. </p><p> On the fourth day, amid much chatter,</p><p>they began to move. Although the greater </p><p>part of the carcass remained they made no </p><p>attempt to carry any away with them, </p><p>perhaps knowing no method, as did more </p><p>civilized tribes, of preserving meat; but </p><p>they did remove the tusks. This made </p><p>the professor think hard. He decided </p><p>that hope of escape lay in the fact </p><p>that as ivory is of value all over Africa </p><p>that even these peoples would desire to </p><p>realize something upon it and would con- </p><p>sequently approach nearer to a more civil- </p><p>ized tribe to barter for wire or implements. </p><p> In the dank cavern of the jungle all ways</p><p>were the same to the professor, so that he </p><p>could not surmise whether they had </p><p>changed their direction or not. However, </p><p>in desperate hope he no longer tried to </p><p>delay progress, but marched as long and </p><p>as hard as he could. On the third day they </p><p>came to an open glade about a mile across </p><p>and halted. A terrific discussion broke out.</p><p>Evidently like apes they feared to leave the </p><p>trees, for they waited on the fringe until </p><p>scouts had returned from the long grass </p><p>and the tops of high trees. </p><p> Then came another commotion. The</p><p>girl refused to enter the open, chattered, </p><p>violently gestured. The professor was </p><p>puzzled at her fear until she pointed to the </p><p>blazing sun and at her body. </p><p> “Ot!” she said persistently. “Ot! Ot!”</p><p>using her English vocabulary. </p><p> Then the professor understood why she</p><p>had retained her color, acquiring the greeny </p><p>pallor in the stewing atmosphere of the </p><p>jungle. But this refusal to leave the </p><p>John O’Damn </p><p>137 </p><p>shelter might mean a serious bar to their </p><p>escape, he reflected. </p><p> “Good—good!” said he, patting her.</p><p>And taking off his coat he put it upon her. </p><p>She made no resistance. By her smiles </p><p>and “oh, damns” she seemed to consider </p><p>it a great joke and without further ado </p><p>capered on ahead into the sunshine, </p><p>laughing. </p><p> Evidently she decided that the coat was</p><p>“good medicine,” for on entering the forest </p><p>on the other side she made no attempt </p><p>to return it. The professor acquiesced, </p><p>saying, “Good! good!” and she laughed, </p><p>crying, “Oh, damn! John oh damn!” </p><p>delightedly. </p><p> But the glimpse of the sun had informed</p><p>the professor that they were going north— </p><p>which meant toward the Boma Masindi </p><p>trail from Uganda. </p><p>THAT evening there was much </p><p>excitement in the tribe which the </p><p>professor mistakenly translated as </p><p>being near to an alien people. They camped </p><p>high in a tree, which indicated that some </p><p>danger was apprehended. For the first </p><p>time since he had lost it the professor saw </p><p>his rifle—being dragged into a nest on an </p><p>opposite bough. He drew the girl’s atten- </p><p>tion, energetically making the most of their </p><p>vocabulary. To his surprise she assented, </p><p>saying— </p><p> “Come—John oh damn!”</p><p> She chattered across the tree which</p><p>resulted in two pigmies bringing the </p><p>rifle. </p><p> Eagerly he opened the breech—to find</p><p>that somehow they had contrived to work </p><p>the ejector, for the cartridge had gone; </p><p>and upon examination he discovered the </p><p>barrel to be full of slime. He managed </p><p>to clear it after a fashion, but the rifling </p><p>was rusted from breech to muzzle. How- </p><p>ever, the professor attempted to conjure </p><p>some cartridges. Cursing, the professor </p><p>went to bed. </p><p> At the hour of the monkey he was</p><p>awakened by the girl. He sat up abruptly </p><p>at her “no good—oh damns.” The moon </p><p>was full and high. Around in the tree the </p><p>little folk were clicking away as softly as a </p><p>Spring shower upon a roof. Then his ear </p><p>caught a peculiar sound—a distinct drum- </p><p>ming as of native tom-toms. </p><p> A village must be near, he thought</p><p>joyfully. But the girl kept whispering: </p><p> “No good, oh damn! No good, oh</p><p>damn!” </p><p> She pushed a cartridge into his hand</p><p>as she tugged at his shirt sleeve. He </p><p>crawled to the edge of the nest platform </p><p>noticing that her eyes registered extreme </p><p>terror as she pointed downward. </p><p> A glimpse in a patch of spattered moon-</p><p>light made him catch his breath—a gorilla </p><p>half-erect was pounding its hands on the </p><p>enormous hairy chest. </p><p> As the brute vanished into the blue</p><p>shadows another appeared moving side- </p><p>ways like a gigantic crab—and another. </p><p> Now the professor comprehended why</p><p>they had restored the rifle. Evidently not </p><p>understanding how to use it they desired </p><p>him to defend them. But one cartridgel </p><p>He held up the cartridge, saying, “No </p><p>good—five!” and lifted both hands, for as </p><p>he had learned the little folk could only </p><p>count to four, five: two hands upraised </p><p>conveyed plurality generally. </p><p> The girl brought him two more.</p><p> “Oh, damn!” he whispered.</p><p> “Oh, damn!” she murmured encour-</p><p>agingly. </p><p> Hastily he attempted to ram home a</p><p>cartridge; but try as he would to manipu- </p><p>late the ejector the cartridge would not </p><p>enter the rusted breech. He scraped at it </p><p>in the gloom with a penknife. The car- </p><p>tridge jammed half-way and would neither </p><p>go in nor come out. He peered below again. </p><p> The gorillas were still around the tree.</p><p>They were cornered. There was nothing </p><p>to do but wait and trust that the brutes </p><p>would not be moved to attack.</p><p> As the girl lay beside him along the great</p><p>bough she pointed down and at herself, </p><p>whispering: </p><p> “Me! Me!”</p><p> The professor pondered and imagined</p><p>that she meant that these brutes were her </p><p>parents. </p><p> “No good,” he murmured, “your biology’s</p><p>all wrong, my dear!” </p><p> “Yes, yes,” she insisted, pointing at the</p><p>great apes below, at the pigmies and then </p><p>at her breasts, muttering persistently: </p><p>“Me! Me!” </p><p> The professor grasped the fact tl iut she</p><p>knew that she had been stolen from her </p><p>people by gorillas as the orang-outang </p><p>steal native children in Borneo; and prob- </p><p>ably, he surmised, rescued by the little folk. </p><p> The rhythmic thrum of the beasts</p><p>138 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>continued to the rustle and squelch of the </p><p>undergrowth. The green pallor of the </p><p>moonlight above was warming to the glow </p><p>of dawn. Save for an occasional click as </p><p>soft as rain-patter the pigmies were </p><p>silent. </p><p> Peering as far over the branch as he</p><p>dared the professor strained to see more </p><p>of this strange rite of the great apes. Only </p><p>as they passed in the spattered patch of </p><p>moonlight could he catch a glimpse of each </p><p>performer whose terrible teeth were bared </p><p>in a snarl of ecstasy, the hairy paws pound- </p><p>ing rhythmically upon the mighty chests. </p><p>As far as the processor could determine </p><p>they were moving, shuffling sideways, </p><p>in the most primitive dance in the world, </p><p>’round and ’round the tree as if it were a </p><p>maypole. </p><p> Just as he was wondering whether the</p><p>beasts were given to this social amusement </p><p>when the mood took them or whether, as </p><p>with all savage tribes, the moon was the </p><p>instigator, there came a squawk, the crack </p><p>of a branch breaking and the rustling of </p><p>leaves in the passage of a heavy body </p><p>falling to the accompaniment of a terrified— </p><p> “Eh! Eh! Eh!”</p><p> Instantly the rhythm of the great apes</p><p>ceased. There was a momentary silence. </p><p>Then one of them seemed to bark a com- </p><p>mand, answered by grunts of rage from all </p><p>sides. A hail of chatter broke out among </p><p>the pigmies; the girl dragged at the pro- </p><p>fessor’s shirt, hissing: </p><p> “No good! Oh damn! No good—oh</p><p>damn!” mixed with excited monosyllables. </p><p> He heard the phtt of arrows and much</p><p>rustling of undergrowth from which arose </p><p>savage grunts. Then immediately beneath </p><p>him appeared a dim face with small, vicious </p><p>eyes, black holes of nostrils and a cavern </p><p>of a mouth set with wolf’s teeth. Clicking </p><p>violently the girl tugged at his shirt anew; </p><p>but the professor, realizing that he could </p><p>not compete with a gorilla in speed at the </p><p>top of a tree, clutched the bough with his </p><p>legs as -he swung the useless rifle by the </p><p>muzzle at a hairy squat body propelled</p><p>upward with the ease and swiftness of an </p><p>elevator. </p><p> The rifle-butt crashed on the shoulder</p><p>muscles beside the conical head and as </p><p>swift as the riposte of a skilled duellist </p><p>a paw shot out, plucked the weapon from </p><p>the professor’s grasp, and holding by his </p><p>prehensile feet, the great beast buckled </p><p>the rifle in half as easily as a child would </p><p>bend a reed. </p><p> A clutch at the professor’s boot toe</p><p>hastened his movements. As he turned </p><p>he saw the slim leg of the girl disappear into </p><p>the foliage above him; but as he stood up on </p><p>the bough in a desperate attempt to follow </p><p>her, his boots slipped. He grabbed at a </p><p>small branch which tore away in his hand, </p><p>was conscious of the gorilla yawning be- </p><p>neath him and clutching wildly—fell. </p><p>WHEN he grew conscious again </p><p>he was aware of some one tugging </p><p>at his arms. He began to kick and </p><p>struggle, imagining that he was in the hands </p><p>of the gorilla. Then a familiar “Oh damn! </p><p>No good! Oh damn!” reassured him. </p><p> He was lying half-submerged in a morass</p><p>beneath the great tree from which the girl </p><p>was trying to drag him. The sun was </p><p>incandescent through the patterned roof. </p><p>He lumbered heavily out of the slough, </p><p>covered in green slime from head to foot— </p><p>but slime which had broken his fall and </p><p>saved his bones. Around him was the </p><p>gentle rustle and drip of the jungle. </p><p> “Good!” said he, sitting on a root, “but</p><p>what’s happened?” </p><p> He peered about. Near at hand was</p><p>the elephant tusk sticking upright in the </p><p>swamp; but there was no sign of the </p><p>pigmies nor the apes. He sighed and </p><p>wiped some more slime out of his eyes. </p><p>Bending forward she pulled his green beard </p><p>and laughed delightedly as he smiled. </p><p> “Good for you,” he commented, “but</p><p>where are your friends? Friends—where—• </p><p>no good—here,” he translated with appro- </p><p>priate gestures. </p><p> “Good!” said she. “Go—go—go!” And</p><p>pointing to the forest mimicked with both</p><p>hands and -feet suggesting climbing and </p><p>running. </p><p> “Yes, yes! I get you!” assented the</p><p>professor, “but-” </p><p> He made faces, beat upon his chest and</p><p>grunted fiercely. She clapped her hands </p><p>delightedly and pointed in the direction </p><p>which the tribe had taken. t </p><p>“I see. The gorillas have followed the </p><p>tribe, eh? Lucky for us—or rather me. </p><p>Good, brave girl! You stuck to me! Good! ’ ’ </p><p>She appeared to comprehend for she </p><p>laughed pleasedly. </p><p> “But what are we going to do? You—”</p><p>gesturing—“me—many me—” tapping his </p><p>John O’Damn </p><p>139 </p><p>chest and holding up two hands—“go— </p><p>find—huh?” </p><p> Again she clapped delightedly.</p><p> “Splendid! Come along!”</p><p> He arose eagerly. But he dared not go</p><p>without his hat or some covering. She </p><p>understood after a while and mounting the </p><p>tree with effortless ease, fetched his helmet </p><p>from the nest. </p><p> “Good! Go! Go!”</p><p> But she started off toward the recesses</p><p>of the forest. Immediately the professor </p><p>sat down, saying, “No—no—no!” vigorous- </p><p>ly. Back she came and pulled his beard. </p><p> “Oh, Lord!” groaned the professor exas-</p><p>peratedly. </p><p> “Oh, Lord!” she mimicked, and danced</p><p>about laughing. </p><p> “Come on!” he exclaimed, starting up</p><p>once more. But as he turned one way </p><p>she went off on the pigmy trail again. The </p><p>professor stopped and considered. The </p><p>situation seemed more hopeless than ever. </p><p>Apparently she did not understand; or if </p><p>she did, did not wish to assist him to leave </p><p>her tribe. Natural, after all, he reflected. </p><p>He thought of exploring on his own, </p><p>leaving her to follow or not as she wished; </p><p>but—in what direction was he to go? </p><p>If he could find an open glade he might </p><p>be able to work out some idea of direction. </p><p> The girl had halted, watching, as if</p><p>waiting for him to follow when—the report </p><p>of a rifle startled him. He listened in- </p><p>tently, fearful that his ears or his imagina- </p><p>tion had misled him, for a rifle meant either </p><p>a white man or at least a semi-civilized </p><p>native. Again came a report close at hand. </p><p> With a wave of the hand and a shouted,</p><p>“Come on!” the professor plunged forward </p><p>slipping and scrambling toward the sound </p><p>quite regardless mirabile diclu of whether </p><p>the girl was following or not, crazy at the </p><p>call of environment which that shot </p><p>symbolized.</p><p> Fifty yards beyond he was wading in</p><p>swamp to his waist toward the silver of </p><p>sunlight upon open water. Just as he </p><p>hesitated again another shot rang out, </p><p>directing the professor’s attention to a </p><p>canoe beyond the trees in which, like the </p><p>gleam of the sun upon a house window, </p><p>was a white helmet, sending him floundering </p><p>on regardless of crocodiles or any beast or </p><p>lady, yelling hoarsely. </p><p> The uncouth noises had attracted the</p><p>occupants of the canoe. The paddlers </p><p>stopped. The blessed figure in the helmet </p><p>turned ’round to stare. The canoe began </p><p>to approach the shadows of the over- </p><p>hanging forest. The professor ceased to </p><p>yell; climbed into the handiest tree and </p><p>waited. Not until the canoe was within </p><p>hailing distance did the professor think </p><p>of the girl. He peered around. She was </p><p>close to him, but high up in a tree staring </p><p>open-mouthed at the strange vision of the </p><p>canoe. The professor laughed with relief </p><p>and waved a hand to her, crying: </p><p> “Good! Good! Come! Come!”</p><p> But she did not seem to hear him. She</p><p>stared—stared. </p><p> “Qui est Id?” came a voice from the bright</p><p>sunlight. </p><p> “Oh, God, me!” yelled the professor in</p><p>his tremendous relief and recovering his </p><p>sense of reality added—“Amcricain1” </p><p> “Norn dc DieuI” echoed the voice over the</p><p>still water. </p><p> The canoe shot forward more swiftly</p><p>under the branches into the swamp grass. </p><p>A small, black-bearded man in the helmet </p><p>gazed curiously at the gaunt figure of the </p><p>red-headed giant with a green beard and </p><p>slimed clothes. As the paddlers poled </p><p>their way the two white men exchanged </p><p>explanations. The little man was an </p><p>Italian in the Belgian Congo service upon </p><p>a shooting-trip upon the Semliki River. </p><p>He had heard by runner of the loss of an </p><p>American professor very distinguished, etc., </p><p>and bade him welcome and congratulations. </p><p> “But,” said the professor as the canoe</p><p>was forced through the grass beneath him, </p><p>“I demand a thousand pardons, but I have </p><p>here—what would you call him—an extra- </p><p>ordinary phenomenon—a lady white who </p><p>has been brought up among these—your </p><p>pigmies—very charming—and whom I </p><p>wish to bring with me. She is, I assure you, </p><p>the most interesting case I have ever </p><p>encountered in my life.” </p><p> “Enchanted!” assented the Italian.</p><p>“Come! Good!” began the professor, </p><p>hanging on to a branch as he looked up </p><p>toward the girl. But she was not there. </p><p> Then in the spattered sunlight beneath</p><p>the forest roof he saw her cloud of amber </p><p>hair upon the khaki coat, and one slim leg </p><p>which blended with the green of the forest </p><p>leaves as it vanished in the distance. </p><p> “Oh, damn—she’s returning to the tribe,”</p><p>exclaimed the professor, and added: “Yet—we </p><p>are only creatures of environment after all!” </p><p>q6&lt;/ GORDON MCCREAGH </p><p> Author of “An Officer and a Gentleman,” "Safe and Sane” etc.</p><p>JIMMIE BELLEW put his feet up </p><p>on the bookcase, knocked the ashes </p><p>out of his pipe into an elaborate </p><p>silver rowing-trophy, and relaxed in </p><p>lazy contentment. </p><p> “Hand along the humidor, Walt,” he</p><p>requested. </p><p> His friend bestirred himself sufficiently</p><p>to reach with the tips of his fingers a </p><p>cunningly mounted skull with a brown </p><p>porcelain lid and give it a shove which </p><p>sent it plowing its way through an assorted </p><p>litter of pencils and note-books and little </p><p>wicked knives on the table to stop right </p><p>on the edge by the other’s elbow. </p><p> “Ha! Phenomenal judgment, as usual!”</p><p>commented Jimmie, and proceeded to fill </p><p>his pipe from the grisly relic. </p><p> The room was small and correspondingly</p><p>cozy, with the battered furnishings and </p><p>grotesque adaptations of natural objects </p><p>to the needs of student life which are so </p><p>dear to the heart of youth engaged in the </p><p>pursuit of knowledge. The walls were </p><p>hung with the usual varied assortment of </p><p>pennants and boxing-gloves and photo- </p><p>graphs of athletic teams. The typical den </p><p>of a young man whose thoughts were con- </p><p>cerned more with the strenuous outdoors </p><p>than with the honorable pursuit of medicine. </p><p> Jimmie blew two smoke rings, endeav-</p><p>ored to throw the stub of his match </p><p>through them, and then suddenly sat bolt </p><p>upright. </p><p> “Yep,” he said with finality. “I’m</p><p>going to take a crack at it, and I think I’ll </p><p>get away with it, Walt.” </p><p> Walter Jamieson smiled with the supe-</p><p>rior condescension of the man who has been </p><p>through the thing and knows. </p><p> “You’ll flunk,” he said with conviction.</p><p>“That physical test is a'scorcher.” </p><p> The younger man’s face flushed just a</p><p>trifle. Alert-eyed, hawk-nosed, hawk- </p><p>faced generally, with a hard lean body to</p><p>match, he certainly did not look as though </p><p>any physical examination in the world </p><p>should hold terrors for him. But the test </p><p>they spoke of was the much-deliberated </p><p>designing of an over-careful Government </p><p>to weed out all but the most perfect speci- </p><p>mens of manhood in the country. Jimmie </p><p>defended himself eagerly. </p><p> “Flunk, me eye! Barring that sinus</p><p>operation I had I’m as fit as any man alive. </p><p>I’ll pass everything else with a whoop; </p><p>and you’ve told me yourself when you’ve </p><p>taken me up that I have all the earmarks </p><p>of a good flyer.” </p><p> “Ocular and muscular balance entirely,</p><p>my boy. You know darn well that for a </p><p>couple of months after your operation you </p><p>walked like a souse, and you used to get </p><p>seasick and all that. Your canals are all </p><p>wrong, man, and that cold, scientific re- </p><p>volving-chair thing will get you in a minute. </p><p>It got ‘Bud’ Blakelock; they said he’d </p><p>never be able to carry out a night bombing </p><p>raid where he couldn’t use his eyes; and </p><p>Bud has been doing stunt stuff for </p><p>years.” </p><p> Jimmie leaned forward and lowered his</p><p>voice with instinctive caution. </p><p> “It got Bud Blakelock, Walt, because</p><p>he hadn’t spent three years in a medical </p><p>college. But it won’t get me. I’ve been </p><p>140 </p><p>Sense of Balance </p><p>141 </p><p>boning up on the flow of the lymph in the </p><p>auricular canals and I know all the normal </p><p>reactions by heart. I can fake that stuff </p><p>as easy as winking.” </p><p> The older man looked at him through</p><p>half-closed eyes. </p><p> “Why not get a test from one of the</p><p>faculty? Your trouble was two years ago; </p><p>maybe you’re quite all right now.” </p><p> Jimmie fell silent. He knew that that</p><p>was just what he ought to have done long </p><p>ago; but like many a consumptive or heart </p><p>patient he was afraid to face the truth. </p><p>When he spoke it was in a low monotone, </p><p>looking away from his friend. </p><p> “You see—it’s this way, Walt. I want</p><p>to do my bit, and I want to do it flying. </p><p>And—I guess I’ll fake the chair test.” </p><p>Jamieson read the youngster’s thoughts </p><p>like a book. He smiled grimly. </p><p> “And you ‘want to do it flying,’ hm?</p><p>Well, it has been known that a man may </p><p>develop such a very keen sense of muscular </p><p>balance as to overcome the ear defect; </p><p>but there’s more in this flying game than </p><p>just the mechanics of it. Nerve, my boy, </p><p>nerve! Or, rather, nerves, I should say. </p><p> “There’s the psychological aspect of the</p><p>thing. You may get away with the </p><p>physical exam, but you’ll know when </p><p>you’re up in the air that you lack that </p><p>certain requirement, and that knowledge </p><p>will break down your confidence. Without </p><p>confidence some day your nerve will go; </p><p>then you’ll make the high dive.” </p><p> “Rats!” said Jimmie with the omniscience</p><p>of youth. </p><p> Jamieson smiled still, less grimly but with</p><p>a pinch of determination about the lips. </p><p>“Quite made up your mind?” </p><p> “Yep, quite. Going to pull all the strings</p><p>I	can to bag a commission. Shoot in my</p><p>application tomorrow.” </p><p> “Well, then,” the smile was faintly re-</p><p>nunciative. “I’m coming in with you.” </p><p>“You?” </p><p> “Yes, I—I think sometimes that I need</p><p>something to give me a jolt to help me cut </p><p>out this stuff. It don’t fit in with flying.” </p><p>He indicated with a lift of his eyebrow the </p><p>tall tumbler which stood at his elbow. </p><p> Jimmie jumped up with a glad exclama-</p><p>tion. </p><p> “Good for you! I hated to say it, Walt,</p><p>old scout, but I’ve been thinking that way </p><p>for quite a while myself. Gee, I’m awfully </p><p>glad! Why, with your experience they’ll </p><p>make you a gold-lined lootnant right away.” </p><p>“Mm-m, maybe. Hope so anyway. </p><p>Maybe when you get through with your </p><p>ground stuff I’ll have you for flight instruc- </p><p>tion; how’d that be?” </p><p> “Bully!” Jimmie enthused. “Let’s go up</p><p>together tomorrow.” </p><p>JIMMIE BELLEW was dead right </p><p>in both of his forecasts. His friend </p><p>Jamieson, an experienced aviator, </p><p>was called for examination with the least </p><p>delay possible, and the next news that was </p><p>heard of him was that he had been ap- </p><p>pointed to a second lieutenancy in the </p><p>Army Signal Corps. Jimmy himself, after </p><p>a period of waiting during which exhaustive </p><p>inquiries were made into his mental and </p><p>moral fitness for that most exacting service, </p><p>finally received notice one day to present </p><p>himself at headquarters forthwith for the </p><p>prescribed physical examination. </p><p> As his friend had warned him, it was a</p><p>scorcher. Five hours of exhaustive search </p><p>by skilled scientists for the least possible </p><p>traces of unsuspected defects which might </p><p>some day result in disaster. As Jimmie had </p><p>said, however, he passed everything else </p><p>with a whoop. Five-feet ten of hard, wiry </p><p>athlete, there was no reason why not. </p><p> Came then finally those delicate ear tests,</p><p>the cold, merciless probing of scientific </p><p>machinery for a possible clogging of the </p><p>lymph flow in the semi-circular canals of </p><p>the inner ear which act as the spirit-levels </p><p>of the body. Jimmy was the least bit </p><p>nervous; but confident withal. His un-</p><p>bounded confidence of youth had not been </p><p>broken down—yet. </p><p> Hearing, of course, was perfect. Jimmy</p><p>had no fear on that score; he could hear </p><p>a whisper at twenty feet without diffi- </p><p>culty, and he knew all the tricks of the </p><p>examiners about pretending to hold a watch </p><p>somewhere behind his head. But that </p><p>deadly revolving chair, that inexorable con- </p><p>trivance which had blasted the hopes of so </p><p>many aspirants to the great game. . . </p><p>Jimmie took his seat with a half-smile of </p><p>alert readiness. A sergeant grasped the </p><p>lever and spun him rapidly. </p><p> “Enough!” called the examining surgeon</p><p>suddenly, and looked into Jimmie’s face </p><p>with a watch in his hand. </p><p> Jimmy knew that his eyes ought to roll</p><p>wildly for about five seconds. He rolled </p><p>accordingly, while the surgeon ticked off </p><p>142 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the time and made a note of the result in </p><p>his record sheet. </p><p> “All right! Again now.”</p><p> This time the whirl was a longer one.</p><p> “Right! Stop! Now, what do you see?</p><p>Point to it.” </p><p> What Jimmy saw in front of him hap-</p><p>pened to be the bald high forehead of an </p><p>eminent scientist. He knew that a normal </p><p>person would point a foot or so to one side </p><p>of it. Without hesitation he did so. </p><p> “Hm, remarkably quick reaction,” mut-</p><p>tered the surgeon, arid made a favorable </p><p>note to that effect. A short respite fol- </p><p>lowed, and then Jimmie was told to sit </p><p>forward with his head bent over his knees. </p><p>The chair was then spun in sharp jerks once </p><p>to every two seconds for about twenty </p><p>revolutions. </p><p> “Now straighten up!” ordered the sur-</p><p>geon sharply. </p><p> Jimmie straightened up, and instantly</p><p>heaved himself over, tugging at one arm </p><p>of the chair as though to right a falling </p><p>aeroplane. </p><p> “Hm, you’ll do,” the examiner smiled.</p><p>“That’s all, you can dress now.” </p><p> Jimmie grinned covertly to himself and fled.</p><p> Yes, dead right was Jimmie Bellew. He</p><p>had faked that stuff and got away with it— </p><p>so far. </p><p>T~JM IN DUE course presently Jimmie </p><p>Ifixjl was notified that he had been ac- </p><p>rU-u\i cep(_e(i as a candidate for a com- </p><p>mission in the Army Signal Corps and was </p><p>ordered to present himself again at head- </p><p>quarters, where the signing of various </p><p>documents and the taking of sundry oaths </p><p>awaited him. From there he was sent away </p><p>to the great ground school at Newport </p><p>News, a full-blown member of the United </p><p>States Aeronautic Service. </p><p> At the ground school he learned all about</p><p>stream lines and aspect ratios and angles </p><p>of incidence and lift-drift coefficients, and </p><p>the mysterious names of cloud formations </p><p>with their approximate heights; and he </p><p>washed acres of aeroplane wings with </p><p>gasoline, and was initiated into the art of </p><p>twanging brace wires like a banjo to see </p><p>whether they were tight enough; and there- </p><p>after he graduated through the successive </p><p>stages of third, second, and finally first </p><p>mechanician, and was eventually promoted </p><p>to “grass-hopping” in a low-powered ma- </p><p>chine. </p><p> All these things Jimmie, with the benefit</p><p>of his previous instruction under his friend </p><p>Jamieson, learned with unusual rapidity; </p><p>and with the further benefit of thpse </p><p>favorable notes on his report-sheet about </p><p>the quickness of his nerve reactions he </p><p>began to be looked upon as a very prom- </p><p>ising subject. He was picked out from </p><p>among the many who were condemned for </p><p>some failing or other to ground work for </p><p>all time and posted for air instruction. </p><p>Yes, Jimmie Bellew was marked down for </p><p>a flyer—and only Jimmie knew about the </p><p>clogged lymph in his left ear which had so </p><p>much to do with his sense of balance. </p><p> In due course again Jimmie found himself</p><p>commissioned as a second lieutenant and </p><p>hustled off to Mineola for advanced in- </p><p>struction. There, in keeping with his lucky </p><p>streak, he found his friend Jamieson, now </p><p>a first lieutenant, and—unprecedented luck </p><p>—he managed to come under him for </p><p>tuition. </p><p> Those were good days for Jimmie. Long,</p><p>filled-up days of hard work and teeming </p><p>interest and earnest endeavor. Anybody </p><p>would have considered himself lucky to </p><p>have the personal interest of an expe- </p><p>rienced flyer like Walter Jamieson, and </p><p>Jimmie progressed rapidly from mere pas- </p><p>senger observation to being allowed to </p><p>handle the dual Deperdussin control him- </p><p>self and to make wide, easy banks and long </p><p>glides with a watchful hand of his teacher </p><p>on the other wheel to check up the in- </p><p>variable beginner’s mistake of over-control. </p><p> He began to get the “feel of the air,”</p><p>that sensation of the supporting planes </p><p>having a tangible grip on something which </p><p>is so markedly distinguishable from the </p><p>emptiness of a side slip. He had the natural</p><p>gifts of quickness of thought and presence </p><p>of mind which go to make a good flyer, </p><p>and presently he was promoted to “single </p><p>hops”; he was allowed to take a machine </p><p>up alone. He experienced the thrill of </p><p>controlling immense power at immense </p><p>heights, the wild exhilaration of speed. It </p><p>was the call of the bom bird-man. </p><p> Good days. But there was a tiny spot</p><p>in the clear sky of Jimmie’s contentment, </p><p>a little gray spot like a mote before the eye </p><p>which can be winked away but which is </p><p>presently there again a little blacker than </p><p>before. And Jimmie in his ebullient youth </p><p>began to realize that perhaps the man with </p><p>experience might know something after all. </p><p>Sense of Balance	143</p><p>Nerves, Jamieson had spoken of, the haunt- </p><p>ing knowledge of defect. Jimmie could </p><p>whoop along at a hundred miles an hour </p><p>and could make a sixty-degree bank; but </p><p>how much of that was pure muscular </p><p>sense of balance, he found himself wonder- </p><p>ing; and how much did he have to rely </p><p>on that swaying air bubble in the red arc </p><p>of the inclinometer attached to the dash- </p><p>board in front of his control wheel? </p><p> That was a mechanical spirit-level, and</p><p>it turned his thoughts inward to his own </p><p>spirit-levels inside his head. Bud Blakely </p><p>would never have been able to carry out </p><p>a night raid when he could see nothing, </p><p>they had said. To what extent, then, was </p><p>that defective ear of his affecting him; and </p><p>how much of his flying did he owe to his </p><p>eyesight? </p><p> A troublesome little speck, that, which</p><p>kept recurring with disquieting suddenness </p><p>apropos of nothing. </p><p> Jimmie thought he would try one day</p><p>to find out how long he could fly with his </p><p>eyes shut. That surely would prove some- </p><p>thing. He climbed to a good three- </p><p>thousand level to allow plenty of room for </p><p>recovery in case of accidents, and then </p><p>with his lean jaw clenched in determination </p><p>and his hawk brows drawn down in a fierce </p><p>frown he pinched his eyes shut hard. He </p><p>sat tense while the machine hurtled along </p><p>for nearly two minutes. The tight lips </p><p>began to spread in a smile; it was easy, he </p><p>said to himself. </p><p> Then a side puff struck him, and the</p><p>machine heeled over to the left. Instantly </p><p>he whirled the wheel over in the opposite </p><p>direction and instinctively he opened his </p><p>eyes. Immediately the great planes rocked </p><p>over to the right; he had badly over-con- </p><p>trolled in his anxiety. In a second he had </p><p>righted the machine again; but his heart </p><p>was in his mouth. When a man is three </p><p>thousand feet up in the air it takes very </p><p>little to make him taste his whole internal </p><p>system. </p><p> After a few minutes the hammering of</p><p>his pulse calmed down and he tried to </p><p>analyze the thing. He had felt the tilt </p><p>while his eyes were shut; that was all right. </p><p>But was his over-control due only to over-</p><p>anxiousness—or had he gaged the angle </p><p>of deflection all wrong? And would he </p><p>have righted the machine with his eyes </p><p>still shut? He thought yes. But then </p><p>again—maybe not. </p><p> That little speck was growing apace.</p><p>Later, reviewing the matter in the less </p><p>strenuous environments of terra firma, </p><p>Jimmie tried to persuade himself that the </p><p>thing was quite all right; not once or twice, </p><p>but many times he told himself so. The </p><p>thing lived with him. He spent quite a lot </p><p>of his spare time telling himself that nothing </p><p>had been wrong—but he hated to try the </p><p>experiment again. </p><p> That kind of thing is bad for the nerves</p><p>of men who are supposed not to have any </p><p>nerves. But it is surprisingly good for </p><p>cankerous specks. Under the stimulus of </p><p>suppression the dark growth throve amaz- </p><p>ingly and began to assume a horrifying </p><p>shape. Jimmie was something of a mental </p><p>analyst. He knew what was happening </p><p>to him; those three desultory years of </p><p>college had not been entirely wasted. </p><p> “That spook has got to be laid,” said</p><p>Jimmie firmly. </p><p> He hit upon a solution. On his next</p><p>instruction flight, he said to himself, he </p><p>would try the experiment again; under the </p><p>controlling hand of his teacher it would be </p><p>safe. The next time accordingly he did </p><p>try. He shut his eyes tight and waited for </p><p>the feel of whatever he might feel. For a </p><p>while there was nothing to do, and then </p><p>came one of the usual little dips which </p><p>needed correction. Jimmie’s analysis of </p><p>self had not gone quite deep enough; he </p><p>was still over-anxious and he made the </p><p>same old mistake. </p><p> He felt the instructor in the rear seat</p><p>with his greater leverage take the control </p><p>firmly out of his hands and right the </p><p>machine. For a star pupil this was a </p><p>disgrace; Jimmie felt very much ashamed. </p><p>But that vital question simply had to be </p><p>settled. Presently he experimented again. </p><p>This time the corrective force was applied </p><p>with a jerk of impatience. Jimmie burned </p><p>all over; but he set his teeth and deter- </p><p>mined to see the tiling through. </p><p> Whatever might have been his con-</p><p>clusions about himself, there was no mis- </p><p>taking the instructor’s attitude after that. </p><p>With angry bruskness he took the control </p><p>entirely away from his pupil, made a wide </p><p>bank, and came down without further ado </p><p>on to the flying-field. That lesson was </p><p>over—and Jimmie had learned nothingl </p><p>As soon as they had climbed out: </p><p> “What the deuce was the matter with</p><p>you?” snapped Jamieson crossly. “You </p><p>144 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>were flying like a —— fool beginner. I </p><p>have enough to do teaching the elementary </p><p>stuff to that kind.” </p><p> He seemed to be unreasonably irritable.</p><p>It reminded Jimmie uneasily of the old days </p><p>when his friend had looked a little too freely </p><p>on the tall yellow tumbler. And Jamieson’s </p><p>face was unnecessarily flushed too. Jimmie </p><p>wondered. </p><p> He would have liked to tell his friend all</p><p>about his experiment, to have made a full </p><p>confession of his trouble and asked for </p><p>advice; but the opportunity was not ripe </p><p>just then, he reflected; he would wait for a </p><p>more favorable one. But somehow that </p><p>opportunity kept postponing itself with </p><p>heart-breaking indefiniteness. </p><p> Lieutenant Jamieson, in common with all</p><p>the other instructors, was frantically busy, </p><p>for one thing, with the pressing need of </p><p>training as many men in one day as used </p><p>formerly to be handled in a month; and </p><p>for another, his irritation seemed to have </p><p>settled on him permanently now. When </p><p>Jimmie in desperation sought his friend </p><p>at his quarters in the hotel one evening </p><p>and made bold to mention the matter </p><p>Jamieson laughed self-consciously and </p><p>flushed and explained: </p><p> “It’s an awful strain on one’s vitality, old</p><p>man, to take up fifteen or twenty boobs </p><p>every day. But let’s not talk shop now.” </p><p> Which explained nothing. Or rather,</p><p>not enough. Jimmie wondered some more. </p><p> In the meanwhile the days sped on, and</p><p>Jimmie’s unlaid ghost walked at his heels. </p><p>But his confidence was still unshaken; he </p><p>felt sure that his mistakes had been due to </p><p>nothing more than over-anxiety; all he </p><p>needed was to prove it to himself. Till </p><p>suddenly there came the first big jolt </p><p>which shook him into a realization that the </p><p>man with experience not only might know </p><p>something, but that he is usually right. </p><p> Two of the huge new Sperry search-lights</p><p>were installed in the flying-field, and it was </p><p>rumored that the more advanced pupils </p><p>were to be given practise in night flying.</p><p>Then only did Jimmie know that Jamieson </p><p>had spoken deadly truth on that first day </p><p>in his den. His little subterfuge had be- </p><p>come a curse and had come home to roost. </p><p>With the knowledge hanging over him </p><p>that the little physical defect which had </p><p>looked so inconsequential at that time </p><p>remained still untested, his confidence, in </p><p>the pinch, had broken down! </p><p> Jimmie had run away and hidden himself</p><p>in his room to think over this new menace </p><p>when the full force of it struck him with all </p><p>its pitiless clearness. The speck had sud- </p><p>denly grown to maturity and taken a </p><p>definite and horrible form. It had a shape </p><p>and a name. It was Fear! </p><p> Second-Lieutenant James Bellew of the</p><p>Army Signal Corps was afraid! </p><p> The thing was unspeakable, infamous;</p><p>Jimmie fought it desperately; for long </p><p>terrible hours he tried to convince himself </p><p>that it was only a passing hysteria born </p><p>of cumulative brooding. But the thing </p><p>stood out before him, solid in its merciless </p><p>accusation. There was no dodging it. </p><p>Jimmie was afraid to take up a machine </p><p>in the dark! He flung his arms out over </p><p>the table and hid his face with shame. </p><p>A WEEK passed and Jimmie fought </p><p>with his fear, and with the greater </p><p>fear of having somebody discover </p><p>lis fear. A dozen times he made up his </p><p>mind to test himself out once and for all; </p><p>and a dozen times he went up and did not </p><p>dare to try the fearsome experiment. The </p><p>thing had got a hold of him. He would </p><p>confess everything to Jamieson, he deter- </p><p>mined, and then with his co-operation he </p><p>would decide the matter definitely on his </p><p>next instruction flight. </p><p> But no instruction flights were forth-</p><p>coming for Jimmie. Jamieson was too busy </p><p>with the less advanced pupils and with </p><p>experimental work on the night tests. </p><p>And he was so confoundedly morose these </p><p>days. No time could be wasted on a flier </p><p>who shaped so well as Jimmie did—by day. </p><p> Then lists were posted with the names</p><p>of officers who had been selected on account </p><p>of their good showing for promotion to </p><p>night practise. Jimmie’s was well up near </p><p>the top. 'He began to go about with a</p><p>hunted look and to evolve desperate plans </p><p>to postpone his turn until he should have </p><p>found out about himself. He felt half </p><p>inclined to go to Captain Wilson in charge </p><p>of the flying-school, complain of ear </p><p>trouble, and get himself reexamined. </p><p> That would be easy and plausible, and</p><p>he would then be automatically relieved </p><p>from flying-duty without anybody having </p><p>found out his shameful secret. But here </p><p>came in a curious anomaly. Jimmie wanted </p><p>to be a flyer; the great game called to him </p><p>irresistibly; and he had, besides, the pride </p><p>Sense of Balance </p><p>145 </p><p>that went with his lean-jawed type of face. </p><p>Surely was Jimmie caught between two </p><p>fires of his own making. </p><p> He haunted the night practises, praying</p><p>desperately for some unexpected oppor- </p><p>tunity to go up as a passenger. Many </p><p>passengers went up; but Jimmie’s luck </p><p>was running strong on the ebb now. Some- </p><p>how it never so fell out that he was called; </p><p>and junior officers are not encouraged to </p><p>be importunate when there are a host of </p><p>seniors who are anxious to experience a new </p><p>sensation. </p><p> Then one night when the immense search-</p><p>lights were stabbing through low-scudding </p><p>layers of cumulus clouds and flooding rain- </p><p>bow billows on to the next layer a thousand </p><p>feet above, Jimmie found himself standing </p><p>near Captain Wilson. The flying-school </p><p>chief turned to him. </p><p> “How about making a short jump for us,</p><p>Mister Bellew? We want to see if we </p><p>can pick a machine out from behind those </p><p>cloud patches. Imagine we’re being raided; </p><p>the conditions are ideal for a practise.” </p><p> Jimmie’s heart almost stopped beating.</p><p>The thing was upon him with appalling </p><p>suddenness. </p><p> “Why, er—yes, sir,” he managed to say.</p><p>“Certainly. Er—can I take up Twenty- </p><p>four?” </p><p> Twenty-four was his favorite machine—</p><p>and Twenty-four’s engine was out of com- </p><p>mission! Jimmy calculated that he would </p><p>be able to get away on the excuse and that </p><p>presently, tired of waiting, they would send </p><p>up somebody else. </p><p> “Sure,” said Captain Wilson.</p><p> Jimmie hurried off, elate; and then the</p><p>captain’s voice calling after him chilled him </p><p>to the marrow. </p><p> “Oh, wait a minute. I believe Twenty-</p><p>four is on the sick-list. You’ll have to take </p><p>one of the others.” </p><p> “Yes, sir,” Jimmie mumbled. “Just got</p><p>to get my helmet.” And he fled. </p><p> As it happened, they did get tired of</p><p>waiting. They would have had to wait </p><p>beyond the patience of any man, for </p><p>Jimmie was hiding in his room. Other fliers </p><p>were a-plenty. Somebody else went up. </p><p>Jimmie had got away with it—this time. </p><p> But that sort of dodging could not go</p><p>on indefinitely. Jimmie was one of the </p><p>young officers posted for night practise, and </p><p>as such it was his duty to be present on </p><p>the field during these experiments. Other </p><p>10 </p><p>occasions arose, and Jimmie’s frantic ex- </p><p>cuses began to draw wondering attention. </p><p>In that hazardous game there were always </p><p>keen observers ready to pick up the slightest </p><p>signs of wavering on the part of the less </p><p>experienced students. People began to look </p><p>sideways after Jimmie and whisper. </p><p> Jimmie’s hawk eyes snapped up these</p><p>covert glances in a second, and he burned </p><p>all ’round to the back of his neck as he </p><p>passed. Again the temptation came strong </p><p>over him to report in to the chief medico </p><p>for ear test. But Jimmie had come into </p><p>this game with the intention of fighting </p><p>for his country in the aviation service, </p><p>and unless he should prove to be physically </p><p>unfitted he was going so to fight. He was </p><p>deadly afraid and deadly ashamed; but he </p><p>gritted his teeth and hung on. </p><p> Jimmie roomed in the same hotel with</p><p>Jamieson. He passed the latter’s room </p><p>every day on his way to his own; but it was </p><p>not often now that he looked in on his </p><p>friend. For one thing, his own primary </p><p>impulse was to hide from everybody; and </p><p>for another, Walt was not at all companion- </p><p>able of an evening nowadays. </p><p> Today, however, Jamieson called him in.</p><p>The tone was both domineering and </p><p>derisive. Jimmie entered and shut the </p><p>door; perhaps this would be his long- </p><p>waited opportunity. Jamieson sat slumped </p><p>down in his chair with his feet stretched </p><p>far under the table; his khaki tunic was </p><p>carelessly open at the neck, and his cap lay </p><p>on the floor. He regarded Jimmie for a </p><p>long time with a dull eye while he kept </p><p>nodding his head with sententious wisdom.</p><p>Then his lip curled in a foolish caricature of </p><p>his old slow smile. </p><p> “So it’s come, huh?” he gibed. “What’d</p><p>I	tell you? ’S got you, hasn’t it? Scared!</p><p>That’s what they’re all saying. Afraid to </p><p>go up.” </p><p> Jimmie flung his head down on his arm</p><p>and groaned. He had hoped for under- </p><p>standing and sympathy from his friend. </p><p> Jamieson rambled on.</p><p> “Yeah, dead scared—my star pupil too.</p><p>After all I taught you—’fraid to go up.” </p><p> There was an emotional self-pity in the</p><p>tone that was almost maudlin. This wasn’t </p><p>like Walt Jamieson. Or rather, not like </p><p>what he ought to be. Jimmie looked up </p><p>quickly. His own misery was heavy </p><p>enough; but his concern for his friend </p><p>drowned out for the present all other </p><p>146 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>considerations. Jamieson sat looking at </p><p>him with foolish mournfulness. Jimmie </p><p>had seen that look before. </p><p> “Walt!” he burst out with genuine</p><p>solicitude. “You’re not—you haven’t been </p><p>touching the stuff again?” </p><p> Jamieson flushed. Jimmie’s suspicion</p><p>was enough to straighten him up in his </p><p>chair. He laughed shamefacedly. </p><p> “Well, hang it all, you know; it’s an</p><p>awful strain on the nervous system, taking </p><p>up so many beginners every day; I’m all </p><p>worn out, and I need some stimulant.” </p><p>Jimmie stood up and stared at him with </p><p>horrified eyes. </p><p> “But Walt, you—you can’t,” he whis-</p><p>pered tensely. </p><p> Jamieson was suddenly perfectly sober.</p><p>He passed his hand wearily over his eyes. </p><p>He couldn’t face his friend. </p><p> “Yes, I know,” he said, quietly looking</p><p>at the floor. “I’m going to cut it right out. </p><p>Let’s get together tomorrow and talk over </p><p>things about both of us. I’m dead tired.” </p><p>But tomorrow Jimmie was detailed to </p><p>some routine work which took him off the </p><p>flying-field; and the next day Jamieson was </p><p>furiously busy with a flood of instruction, </p><p>and was held late into the evening in a long </p><p>consultation about something concerning </p><p>the big search-lights. And on the third </p><p>day the list had come down to Jimmie’s </p><p>name for night practise. So Jimmie in- </p><p>continently reported himself sick; he did </p><p>not dare to think of that flight before he </p><p>should have settled things with his teacher. </p><p> Later, however, toward evening it was</p><p>rumored that night practise was all off on </p><p>account of some other more important </p><p>thing on hand; so Jimmie put a bold face </p><p>on it and presented himself at the flying- </p><p>field pretending that he had heard nothing </p><p>of the change of plan. </p><p>EflgS HE FOUND the night lit up like </p><p>the San Francisco Exposition. </p><p>Long, milky rays from half a dozen </p><p>search-lights stabbed far up into the sky</p><p>and cut the moonless blackness into a </p><p>kaleidoscope of geometrical figures. It </p><p>was just such another night as that recent </p><p>one when he had so ignominiously fled; </p><p>wide, shifting banks of cloud hurried over- </p><p>head at various levels. </p><p> “What’s the program?” he asked a</p><p>sergeant who stood near with a sheaf of </p><p>flight-report forms in his hand. </p><p> “Spotting experiment, sir. Imaginary</p><p>raid from here on Philadelphia. Lieutenant </p><p>Jamieson will go up and the lights will try </p><p>to pick him up at both ends; they’re just </p><p>trying out their current now.” </p><p> Jimmie watched the display, full of</p><p>gloomy thoughts. He would have given </p><p>his soul to go up with his friend on the </p><p>long trip, for there surely they would be </p><p>able to put his accursed problem to a test. </p><p>But it was too late to attempt to make ar- </p><p>rangements; everything would have been </p><p>scheduled long ago—and in any case, it </p><p>would probably be a one-man flight. </p><p> His surmise was correct. In a little</p><p>while he saw a fast Curtiss baby scout </p><p>wheeled out into the open and the mechan- </p><p>icians busy themselves about it. Soon the </p><p>captain of the flying-school arrived with </p><p>a group of senior officers. Captain Wilson </p><p>looked up into the sky with satisfaction. </p><p> “Splendid night for the experiment,”</p><p>he remarked. “Bit gusty, though. I fancy </p><p>we’ll be able to follow him for at least six </p><p>thousand, but I’ll bet they won’t pick him </p><p>up on the other side before he is right on </p><p>top of them. Hope he won’t keep us </p><p>waiting. Been rather a habit of his </p><p>lately.” </p><p> One of the officers stepped aside and spoke</p><p>to an orderly. Jimmie could follow the </p><p>man as he passed from one lit-up hangar </p><p>to another, looking in all the likely places </p><p>where a prospective pilot might be. He </p><p>was away a long time. Captain Wilson </p><p>began to show signs of impatience. </p><p> Suddenly a wild suspicion flashed into</p><p>Jimmie’s mind. Was it possible, he </p><p>thought. Surely not. But Jimmie wasted </p><p>no time in empty speculations; he stole </p><p>behind the hangars and commandeered the </p><p>first car which came to hand and raced</p><p>out to the hotel. It was only a short five </p><p>minutes. He rushed up-stairs and burst </p><p>into his friend’s room. </p><p> It was possible! It was a hopeless fact!</p><p>Lieutenant Jamieson sat there a picture of </p><p>dire retribution. His eyes burned blood- </p><p>shot with fever; a wet cloth encircled his </p><p>brows; and his face was propped haggard </p><p>between hands that trembled like an ague </p><p>patient’s. </p><p> “Walt!” whispered Jimmie hoarsely.</p><p>“They’re waiting! Don’t you know?” </p><p> The wretched man nodded wearily.</p><p>“Yes,” he croaked. “I know. But—I </p><p>can’t fly tonight! I—I had a fierce day </p><p>Sense of Balance </p><p>147 </p><p>today, and—they rung this in on me un- </p><p>expectedly—take advantage of the clouds; </p><p>but-” </p><p> “But Walt, they’ll—they’ll be here look-</p><p>ing for you in a minute, and—it’ll break </p><p>you, foreverk Take a hold on yourself.” </p><p> Jamieson shook his head in weary resig-</p><p>nation. </p><p> “Yes, I know,” he murmured again.</p><p>“But—impossible!” </p><p> Jimmie looked at him with horror. Any</p><p>second a man might arrive from the field. </p><p>And there would be no excuse for an offense </p><p>of that sort. The realization hit Jimmie </p><p>like a tangible thing; there was force </p><p>enough behind it to take his breath. It </p><p>was preposterous to contemplate. That </p><p>his friend should be irrevocably broken </p><p>under the inexorable law of the service— </p><p>his instructor, to whom he owed everything </p><p>he knew! It was almost a blasphemy. </p><p> Jimmie’s mind worked furiously. Sud-</p><p>denly he gasped, and his breath left him </p><p>entirely. For seconds he stood just as </p><p>he had been struck, a cold stone statue; </p><p>and then his deep eyes began to burn and </p><p>slowly his lips began to set. Then sud- </p><p>denly again he was electrified into swift, </p><p>purposeful action. </p><p> “Lock your door,” he hissed at Jamieson.</p><p>“And keep it locked.” And he rushed from </p><p>the room. </p><p> Captain Wilson was striding a short</p><p>impatient beat and fuming with aggravation </p><p>when an automobile dashed into the field </p><p>and drove close up to the waiting scout </p><p>machine before it stopped. A lithe figure </p><p>all muffled up in leather coat and helmet </p><p>and goggles jumped from it. It saluted </p><p>from the distance, called huskily: “Sorry </p><p>to have kept you waiting, sir,” and climbed </p><p>agilely into the pilot’s seat. </p><p> “All right, boys, I’m all set. Let her go.”</p><p> Everything had been ready to the last</p><p>little item for many minutes. A nimble </p><p>mechanician spun the propeller over. It</p><p>caught up the ignition with a roar, and the </p><p>light little machine sprang forward like an </p><p>impatient race-horse. </p><p> Captain Wilson whistled his amazement.</p><p> “Well, he certainly was in a deuce of a</p><p>hurry to make up for lost time. Bet he’s </p><p>grinning all over to think he’s avoided a </p><p>censure.” </p><p> But nobody could see the desperately</p><p>serious eyes behind those goggles and the </p><p>white knuckles which gripped ’round the </p><p> control wheel and the grim-clenched jaw</p><p>as the machine lifted from the ground and </p><p>circled to the left in a steep climb. Jimmie </p><p>knew nothing of any instructions which </p><p>might have been given for the procedure </p><p>of the flight. He knew only that he was </p><p>expected to rise to at least six thousand </p><p>feet and then to make for Philadelphia. </p><p>But he didn’t much care whether he carried </p><p>out the program correctly or not; his only </p><p>impulse was to get away from there, to </p><p>gain time while his friend might recover; </p><p>and his whole will was grimly centered on </p><p>accomplishment, somehow. </p><p> Long shafts of light stabbed at him as</p><p>he circled. They lit up-the surrounding </p><p>air like day, coming as a special blessing of </p><p>heaven to enable him to settle down and </p><p>pull himself together during the first few </p><p>minutes. When the first cloud came be- </p><p>tween he felt an instantaneous qualm and </p><p>sat tensely expectant while the machine </p><p>hurtled on. But even here was a certain </p><p>diffused radiance from the giant lights </p><p>below. It was providentially helpful. He </p><p>found himself making the old mistake of </p><p>over-control and he set his will to getting a </p><p>grip of himself and correcting that. </p><p> Presently a long pencil of light caught</p><p>him again and seemed to hang itself on to </p><p>the rushing machine; then another licked </p><p>across, and back again, and caught hold; </p><p>then more clouds. Then for an instant </p><p>a pale flash passed him and Jimmie could </p><p>follow the thin ray crisscrossing about, </p><p>feeling into the night like a ghostly white </p><p>finger; and then he was lost for good in </p><p>pale, formless starlight. </p><p> And still he flew at a very fair horizontal!</p><p>Jimmie’s teeth relaxed a little from his</p><p>bruised lower lip and he began to think </p><p>with less rigid effort. </p><p> Far to the southward he could see</p><p>through the flying clouds the beacon </p><p>light on the summit of the town-hall tower. </p><p>That was a fair mark for Philadelphia, and </p><p>he knew then where the flying-field was. </p><p>He headed the machine for it straight as </p><p>an arrow. A hundred and twenty-five </p><p>miles, his speed. If only he could hold her </p><p>level for about forty minutes more! </p><p>JIMMIE hummed along for several </p><p>minutes more at his high altitude </p><p>on an astonishingly level keel. But </p><p>the clouds bothered him. He put her nose: </p><p>down to it and slanted through long banks </p><p>148 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>of them like a shooting star. It was </p><p>darker down below, but less confusing. </p><p>Several more minutes sped behind, and </p><p>with them several miles. Jimmie began </p><p>to wonder why he found the controlling </p><p>so easy—just as though there was not a </p><p>single disturbing puff of wind. His mouth </p><p>relaxed almost into a smile. He began to </p><p>feel the old elation of power and speed. And </p><p>then, right in the middle of his triumph, </p><p>something happened. </p><p> Jimmie heard a thin shriek above the roar</p><p>of his engine, and instantly he felt the </p><p>machine keel over terrifyingly and begin to </p><p>slip. Frantically he tugged at the wheel, </p><p>all his resolutions about over-control thrown </p><p>to the winds. The machine answered </p><p>beautifully. Nothing had suddenly broken, </p><p>as had been Jimmie’s first blood-chilling </p><p>thought. But that sudden diabolical stroke </p><p>was only the beginning. After that every- </p><p>thing was either wildly over-controlled or </p><p>hopelessly under-controlled. </p><p> All that beautiful security of balance</p><p>which Jimmie had been congratulating </p><p>himself on had vanished as though be- </p><p>witched away from him. Something had </p><p>gone terribly wrong with the controls, but </p><p>there could be no stop for investigation. </p><p>For twenty frenzied minutes the machine </p><p>rolled and dipped and rocked like a leaf </p><p>through the terrifying blackness. Jimmie’s </p><p>every muscle was tense with the readiness </p><p>for instant action and the sweat rolled </p><p>from him with the exertion of it. How the </p><p>machine lived through it, he never knew. </p><p>It was a mercy of Providence that he was </p><p>kept too frantically busy to think. </p><p> When he finally managed to get the</p><p>crazy controls in hand again he found </p><p>himself sailing in a creamy glare of long </p><p>convergent rays coming from far ahead </p><p>and somewhat to the right. Mechanically </p><p>he pushed the depressing control, and when </p><p>he came to earth a few minutes later his </p><p>mind was still in a whirl. He was just </p><p>worn out, mentally and physically. </p><p> Officers crowded ’round him and shook</p><p>his hand, proffering congratulations which </p><p>were beyond his comprehension. How </p><p>should they know that he had accomplished</p><p>something which to him had been a fearful </p><p>ordeal? He found himself feeling irre- </p><p>sistibly tired and sleepy. He murmured </p><p>evasions and excuses by the thousand </p><p>and finally broke away and stumbled to a </p><p>car and eventually to a hotel. </p><p> He had slept for about three minutes</p><p>when he thought he woke up still dreaming. </p><p>His dream was that his friend Jamieson was </p><p>shaking him fervently by the hand and </p><p>mumbling a vague jumble of gratitude </p><p>and happiness and congratulations. One </p><p>sentence impinged clearly on his con- </p><p>sciousness. </p><p> “By golly, they all thought you were done</p><p>for when that squall hit the world.” </p><p> “Huh?” Jimmie sat up with sudden</p><p>wide-awake interest. “How’d you get here </p><p>so soon? ’D you fly through it too? Was </p><p>that thing that happened a squall?” </p><p>Jamieson took him hilariously by the two </p><p>shoulders. </p><p> “Fly? No siree. First train out. This</p><p>is tomorrow morning already, son. And, </p><p>‘squall’? Well, I should say! It was dam </p><p>nearly a typhoon.” </p><p> “Gosh!” marveled Jimmie. “God knows</p><p>how I ever steered her. I was too scared </p><p>to think. I just pulled everything in sight </p><p>by instinct.” </p><p> Jamieson threw back his head and crowed.</p><p>“Why, that’s just it, Jimmie my boy. </p><p>All this time you’ve been so darn scared </p><p>you’ve been cured! Your canals are per- </p><p>fect! Phenomenal! You could never have </p><p>done it on muscular balance alone. You’ve </p><p>flown a stunt, son! You’ll get all kinds of </p><p>credit out of it.” </p><p> “Me?” Jimmie started from his bed.</p><p>“Nobody knows me here personally—I was </p><p>all goggled up anyway; and if by any god’s </p><p>chance they don’t know you either, then— </p><p>say! Did they get you? In the hotel?” </p><p>“No, nobody knows a thing. Thanks to </p><p>you, old friend. You saved me from that. </p><p>And—Jimmie boy, I—I guess you saved </p><p>me from the other too. I saw a whole lot </p><p>last night. When you went off like that, </p><p>and I knew what it meant to you—and </p><p>when that storm came up and you were </p><p>in it while I lay there like a helpless swine,</p><p>I—well, I’m done with that stuff, Jimmie— </p><p>for keeps!” </p><p> “Then,” said Jimmie stoutly, “Lieu-</p><p>tenant Jamieson flew that machine here, </p><p>and Lieutenant Jamieson is going to fly it </p><p>back. I’ve already got more out of this </p><p>thing than all the credit in the world. I’ve </p><p>got confidence, Walt, old scout, confidence!” </p><p>His friend gripped his hand again, hard. </p><p>“And with confidence,” he said slowly, </p><p>“some day you’ll fight for your Uncle </p><p>Sam.” </p><p>Author of "Cassidy's Consolation Kick," “Peterson and Forseille,” etc. </p><p>THE road through Platt River </p><p>Flats is a trial to pedestrians, a </p><p>despair to wagon drivers, a tor- </p><p>ment to motorists. It is a </p><p>double rut of shifting sand winding through </p><p>a wilderness of dense “slashings,” heavy </p><p>growths of stunted trees and a riot of black- </p><p>berries in the undergrowths. Half con- </p><p>cealed under these growths is an abattis of </p><p>fallen cedar trees, and hemlock logs hurled </p><p>aside when the timber pirates looted </p><p>Michigan of its wealth of pine. </p><p> South of the bridge that spans the Platt</p><p>this road is a tunnel through dense growths; </p><p>the land is flat, and in places swampy. </p><p>North of the bridge the road bounces over </p><p>a series of short hills where blueberry </p><p>bushes mat the earth and the raspberry and </p><p>blackberry bushes and stunted trees strive </p><p>to hold the earth against the torrential rains </p><p>and the winds that beat upon that exposed </p><p>point jutting out into Lake Michigan. </p><p> Wherever the roots are torn away the</p><p>elements rip great holes in the sandy soil and </p><p>the winds pile up the great shifting dunes to </p><p>smother out other vegetation. </p><p> If one struggles through that trail he will,</p><p>presently, emerge upon high land and gaze </p><p>northward along the magnificent bluffs to the </p><p>majestic sweep of the lake. On clear days, </p><p>looking toward the Straits, he may see the </p><p>islands the “Indians called Manitous—the </p><p>Foxes, and a glistening, silent mountain of </p><p>white sand jutting out into the blue-green </p><p>of the lake; the point called Sleeping Bear. </p><p>From the hill tops he may look eastward </p><p>upon a string of gem-lakes set down between </p><p>great dunes. </p><p> But behind him he the Flats—once a</p><p>glorious country of majestic pines—now </p><p>ravished and left to desolation, save for the </p><p>scattered clearings where homesteaders </p><p>battle against the wilderness. </p><p> In that arena, surrounded on three sides</p><p>by orchard-crowned heights, bisected by </p><p>the short-lived river that serve's to empty </p><p>the dune-prisoned waters of Platt and Little </p><p>Platt into Lake Michigan the war of the </p><p>Lunds and the Barneses was fought. </p><p> Lund, head of the tribe, was named</p><p>John. He had come with his family of </p><p>boys and girls, from Sweden, whether by </p><p>choice or necessity none knows. The new </p><p>world, of which, perhaps they had expected </p><p>much, gave them little. John Lund had </p><p>been a fisherman and a fisherman, turned </p><p>farmer, seldom succeeds. </p><p> Perhaps there were high hopes, ambitions,</p><p>dreams, that ended in a homestead in the </p><p>wilderness. The tribe of Lund increased. </p><p>The Winters were long, the harvest season </p><p>short. Always the berry vines, the stub- </p><p>born undergrowths, the rank weeds out- </p><p>grew the corn and potatoes in the little </p><p>clearing. The rains washed the sandy </p><p>soil, the winds heaped sand over the </p><p>crops. </p><p> Mrs. Lund, having proved more produc-</p><p>tive than the soil, yielded at last and John </p><p>Lund was left with a swarm of boys and </p><p>girls who ran wild—human undergrowth </p><p>that thrived physically on berries and </p><p>149 </p><p>150 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>fish and game—and starved morally and </p><p>intellectually. </p><p> Later, to an adjoining homestead came</p><p>Henry Barnes and his three boys. They </p><p>were from the East, farmers seeking cheaper </p><p>land. Henry Barnes had theories and his </p><p>chief theory was fruit. His boys were </p><p>strong, had attended school and had profited </p><p>by their father’s education. To the Barnes </p><p>boys the new life in the wilderness was ad- </p><p>venture. The hunting, the fishing, the joy </p><p>of clearing the land and erecting the stout </p><p>cabin furnished them a prolonged vacation. </p><p> The beginning of the feud is shrouded in</p><p>mystery. At first the Barnes boys had </p><p>tried to be friendly and to include their </p><p>neighbors in their sports and work. Per- </p><p>haps the Lunds were envious. Whatever </p><p>the cause the Lunds proved suspicious, un- </p><p>neighborly and had sullenly rebuffed all </p><p>advances. The year after the Barnes </p><p>family came into the Flats they started to </p><p>erect a line fence between their homestead </p><p>and that of the Lunds and John Lund re- </p><p>sented the act. </p><p> Two or three times fences were torn down.</p><p>Barnes protested; the Lunds denied. The </p><p>boys joined in the quarrel and there was a </p><p>fight in the road. Afterward whenever a </p><p>Lund boy met one of the Barnes youths </p><p>there was a fight and, later, the fathers </p><p>took up the quarrels. Each time Barnes </p><p>had emerged victor from physical encoun- </p><p>ters with his neighbor. Lund, sullen, bit- </p><p>ter, planned to secure revenge. </p><p> One terror rules the Flats. Men who</p><p>fear nothing else show anxious, strained </p><p>faces when they see a curl of smoke over </p><p>the wooded desolation. In time of drought </p><p>there is little sleep and the whisper of one </p><p>word will bring homesteaders leaping from </p><p>their beds. The dread word is “Fire.” </p><p> It was this terror that John Lund in-</p><p>voked against his foe. </p><p>ONE NIGHT the Barnes family </p><p>slept in their cabin. The wind rose </p><p>to a gale that swept down from the </p><p>straits, roared between the Manitous, beat </p><p>upon the old Sleeping Bear and howling as</p><p>if with the voices of the long departed Mani- </p><p>tous, descended upon the Flats and raged </p><p>as if to tear loose the roots that held the </p><p>soil against its fury. </p><p> On that night fire sprang up in the Flats,</p><p>was fanned into fury by the gale and swept- </p><p>down from three points upon the clearing in </p><p>which the Barnes family slept. Billows </p><p>of flame leaped across the narrow plow- </p><p>ground, the potato vines withered and </p><p>burned, the pasture, dried by hot winds, </p><p>crackled a moment and was black. </p><p> Faggots of burning brush, wind blown,</p><p>rained down upon the cabin and, after a </p><p>fight Barnes and his boys fled and all night </p><p>they remained standing deep in the water </p><p>of the lake, strangled by smoke, scorched </p><p>by the flying embers. When the fire passed, </p><p>they crawled from the water, gazed upon </p><p>the smoking ruins of their house and crops— </p><p>and vowed vengeance. That day Henry </p><p>Barnes found where the three fires started. </p><p> During the Winter and Spring Barnes</p><p>and his boys grubbed and cleared, worked as </p><p>never before, and felt the pangs of hunger. </p><p>They cleared land the fire had left un- </p><p>touched, grubbed the roots of burned </p><p>bushes and saplings and, as they dragged </p><p>brush and chopped away the tough branches </p><p>of dead trees the father said, grimly— </p><p> “Throw it over on John Lund.”</p><p> By early Summer a barrier of brush and</p><p>bushes marked the boundary line. When </p><p>Summer and the drought came they piled </p><p>more brush and waited. In August a gale </p><p>blew from the south, fast, strong and to- </p><p>ward the Lund clearing. At midnight </p><p>fire started and before daybreak the Lunds </p><p>were homeless and their crops were ruined. </p><p> For more than twenty years the war</p><p>raged. Other homesteaders came into the </p><p>Flats, but few remained. Five times the </p><p>fires had swept over the Barnes place, </p><p>leaving desolation. Each time Barnes and </p><p>his sons set to work in grim silence, en- </p><p>larged their clearing, and after each attack </p><p>Henry grimly ordered his boys to “Throw </p><p>it over on John Lund.” Each time his </p><p>vengeance was heavier. He was patient </p><p>and could wait until fire was most effective. </p><p> With each attack the Lunds, shiftless</p><p>and indolent, became poorer. The Barnes </p><p>clearing increased, orchards grew and bore </p><p>fruit, the thickets were driven back until </p><p>the buildings were beyond reach of fire un- </p><p>less the entire Flats were swept. The riot </p><p>of weeds and berry bushes pressed closer </p><p>and closer upon the Lund cabin, making </p><p>revenge easier. </p><p> Twice, after the Barnes clearing became</p><p>almost safe, buildings on the place had been </p><p>fired in the night and each time Henry </p><p>Barnes and his boys waited and, when the </p><p>wind blew from the right direction, burned </p><p>Throw It Over On John Lund </p><p>the Lund homestead. The Lunds, beaten, </p><p>scattered. John died. The boys and girls </p><p>went away, working on the lake boats, and </p><p>only Jim remained. </p><p> Death claimed Henry Barnes, two of the</p><p>boys married and moved West, and on the </p><p>two homesteads lived Ben Barnes and </p><p>“Yim” Lund, hating each other. The </p><p>feud was not dead, but smoldering because </p><p>Ben lived up to the creed of his tribe—to </p><p>strike only in revenge and then strike </p><p>harder, and because “Yim” feared Ben— </p><p>feared him because he could not understand </p><p>a man who could wait four years for the </p><p>brush to grow in order that his revenge </p><p>might be the more terrible. </p><p> That was the status of the feud when I</p><p>came upon the scene, having built a shack </p><p>on the lake. Ben was my nearest neighbor </p><p>and we became friends. He was tall and </p><p>straight, his long hair was white and his </p><p>eyes were blue. He wore khaki clothes </p><p>and moccasins, in Summer he went through </p><p>the woods bareheaded and in Winter he </p><p>wore home-made fox-skin caps and gloves. </p><p>THE Summer was long and dry. </p><p>The thunder storms that brooded </p><p>on the horizon each day poured </p><p>their precious burdens into the lake or went </p><p>away growling, toward the straits and the </p><p>land parched. Berries withered on the </p><p>bushes, the Indians became lean and, after </p><p>a time, broke Summer camp and returned </p><p>to their reservation homes </p><p> The creeks and even the lakes dwindled</p><p>in size, leaves curled upon the trees, the </p><p>corn withered and grew yellow, the choke- </p><p>cherries shrivelled into black beads on the </p><p>trees and the evergreens became yellow. </p><p> Ben came to see me at longer and longer</p><p>intervals and remained only for brief calls. </p><p>He said nothing but there was a worried </p><p>frown on his forehead and, as he talked, his </p><p>eyes roved along the crests of the great, tree- </p><p>clad hills beyond which lie the Flats. </p><p> When I visited his place he was busily</p><p>engaged in mowing weeds, cutting down the </p><p>berry growths in fence corners with a </p><p>scythe and, as the corn was beginning to </p><p>form ears, he cut several rows around the </p><p>edges of the fields for ensilage.</p><p> It was his odd custom to sing a snatch</p><p>from some old song at the completion of </p><p>each chore, but for weeks he did not sing. </p><p> Late in August Ben stopped at the cot-</p><p>tage in the afternoon. He had been com- </p><p>pelled to go to town for supplies and was </p><p>hastening back when I hailed him. We had </p><p>been talking only a few moments when, </p><p>suddenly, he sprang to his feet and, sniffing </p><p>the air, he stood anxiously regarding the </p><p>crests of the hills to the northward. He </p><p>resumed his seat and the conversation but, </p><p>within a few moments, leaped to his feet. </p><p> “I smelled smoke,” he said. “Have you</p><p>been burning brush?” </p><p> “No,” I said. “It must be from the</p><p>kitchen fire. This thing is getting on your </p><p>nerves. Better forget it and stay to supper </p><p>—I caught three fine bass today.” </p><p> “I must be getting home,” he said, “I</p><p>don’t like to be away long when the wilder- </p><p>ness is so dry.” </p><p> As he spoke one of the town boys came</p><p>racing down the road in his automobile. </p><p> “Big fire up in the Flats” he yelled as he</p><p>stopped. “The lookout at Point Betsie tele- </p><p>phoned. He says the fire is this side of the </p><p>Platt and spreading rapidly.” </p><p> Ben who scorned automobiles and never</p><p>had ridden in one, sprang across the yard </p><p>and leaped into the machine. </p><p> “Get me as close as you can,” he ordered.</p><p>“Wait for me,” I called, grabbing a cap. </p><p>It was three miles from the cottage to the </p><p>crest of the range of hills, and as the little </p><p>machine reeled and lurched over the un- </p><p>even road Ben urged the boy to greater and </p><p>greater speed. We crested the ridge and </p><p>stopped, gazing over the wilderness. </p><p> A strong, gusty breeze was blowing from</p><p>the northwest, spreading a high haze of </p><p>smoke over the Flats, but presently a cur- </p><p>tain of lighter colored smoke seemed lifting </p><p>and falling on the tree-tops and, in places </p><p>flame shot upward through the thick pall. </p><p> As if resting upon the tree-tops was a dull</p><p>glare and, in the middle distance a huge </p><p>dead pine, rising over the lower trees, flamed </p><p>like a torch. The acrid smell of burning </p><p>wood and leaves came stronger and stronger </p><p>as the gusty wind moved the smoke curtain. </p><p> To the west the sun was setting, blood</p><p>red as seen through the deep smoke mist. </p><p> “She’s a terror,” said the boy, awed by</p><p>the grandeur. </p><p> “Go on, as far as we can,” Ben ordered.</p><p>The light machine ricketed over the hill, </p><p>past Long Lake and plunged down into the </p><p>tree tunnel. The air was clear here and </p><p>even the scent of the fire was missing, </p><p>although high above us, the spreading </p><p>smoke pall brought the darkness more </p><p>152 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>quickly. For two miles we rushed on- </p><p>ward. </p><p> The smoke was beginning to settle lower.</p><p>We could smell fire now. Ahead in the tun- </p><p>nel between the trees smoke poured as </p><p>through a chimney and presently the boy, </p><p>strangling and coughing, brought the ma- </p><p>chine to a halt. Ben leaped out. </p><p> “Go back,” he ordered. “I’m going on.”</p><p>“You mustn’t, Ben,” I said. “You </p><p>could not save the house now.” </p><p> “To - with the house,” said Ben.</p><p>“Lunds’ kids are in there.” </p><p> Without another word he plunged for-</p><p>ward into the tree tunnel, his head held </p><p>low, running rapidly with the easy, ground- </p><p>gaining gait of the woodsman. </p><p> The boy and I retreated to the hill and</p><p>watched as night fell, slowly giving ground </p><p>as the smoke became denser. Fire-lighters, </p><p>volunteers led by the rangers, were rushing </p><p>forward to battle with the flames. At </p><p>midnight a lurid half - light covered the </p><p>entire wilderness, but the breeze died and </p><p>then blew gently from the south. </p><p> Weary fire-fighters, returning for rest and</p><p>refreshment, reported that the rangers were </p><p>holding their own and that from the north </p><p>Empire had rushed rescuers, while from the </p><p>east Beulah and Honor citizens were bat- </p><p>tling to restrict the area. </p><p>ALL night the boy and I waited for </p><p>word from Ben and in the morning </p><p>we went forward to the fighting </p><p>lines. The fire still was raging, but was </p><p>hemmed in now on three sides and great </p><p>gaps in the forest showed where the axes </p><p>and the back fires had stopped the spread </p><p>of the flames. There was nothing to do but </p><p>wait until rain brought relief, or the fire </p><p>burned itself out and left miles of the wilder- </p><p>ness a blackened desolation. </p><p> In the afternoon the fire-fighters reached</p><p>the Lund clearing. House and barn were </p><p>smoldering ruins. Three-quarters of a </p><p>mile away Ben’s buildings stood, scarcely</p><p>touched. The fire had swept along both </p><p>sides of the clearing, doing little damage. </p><p>But, in the clearing not a trace of human </p><p>life could be found. Ben had not succeeded </p><p>in reaching his own home nor had the Lunds </p><p>escaped in that direction. </p><p> Exhausted and with hope almost aban-</p><p>doned I joined the anxious ones waiting at </p><p>the life-saving station on Point Betsie. </p><p>Late in the afternoon a message, telephoned </p><p>by a circuitous route around the burning </p><p>area, brought fresh hope. Traces had been </p><p>found of Ben and Lund. They had been </p><p>cut off from escape in direction of Ben’s </p><p>clearing and had made their way to the </p><p>Platt river. Clothing, cast aside in the </p><p>stream, indicated that they had reached </p><p>the water in safety. </p><p> Fire still raged on both sides of the short</p><p>river. Timber, heavier than that that lined </p><p>the stream further back was blazing. Wheth- </p><p>er Ben and the Lunds had attempted to </p><p>ascend the river to reach safety in Platt Lake, </p><p>three miles above, or had tried to descend to </p><p>Lake Michigan no one knew. Either way </p><p>they would be compelled to run the gant- </p><p>let of fire which, in places, arched tire </p><p>narrow river. </p><p> Searching parties in boats already were on</p><p>Platt Lake, seeking the fugitives. Five of </p><p>us, inspired by hope of rescue, launched one </p><p>of the old litc-boats and straining upon the </p><p>oars, drove it along the Lake Michigan </p><p>shore toward the mouth of the Platt. </p><p>Tall trees on shore burned like beacons, </p><p>here and there the fire still raged in thickets, </p><p>but the lighter underbrush had been burned </p><p>off and the fire was dying out. </p><p> Our eyes searched the beaches and the</p><p>dunes as we drove the boat forward just </p><p>outside the surf of the bars but no ^trace of </p><p>human life was discernible. Foxes, wild </p><p>with fear, ran down the sand and plunged </p><p>into the water, to draw back and whimper—• </p><p>caught between two terrors. Rabbits hud- </p><p>dled close to the quaking foxes as if seek- </p><p>ing companionship. Here and there por- </p><p>cupines waddled along near the water’s </p><p>edge in clumsy panic. </p><p> We rowed over the sandbar that guards</p><p>the mouth of the Platt and waited. Pres- </p><p>ently the breeze lifted the smoke curtain a</p><p>trifle and we pulled into the mouth of the </p><p>river and gazed into the mouth of a furnace. </p><p>The banks of the stream, piled with the </p><p>tangle of long-dead logs, glowed sullen red </p><p>and, a few feet above the surface of the </p><p>water, the smoke hung black and heavy. </p><p> It seemed that no living thing could run</p><p>that gantlet. Fifty yards into the river </p><p>we rowed and were driven back by heat </p><p>and smoke. At dusk we surrendered hope. </p><p> We were preparing to row back to the</p><p>life-saving station to await news from the </p><p>river’s mouth when there emerged from the </p><p>mouth of the furnace a strange figure—the </p><p>figure of a man, blackened, hairless, with </p><p>Throw It Over On John Lund </p><p>153 </p><p>tattered shreds of burned doth hanging </p><p>from his shoulders. </p><p> He was waist-deep in water when first</p><p>we saw him. Every few feet he stumbled, </p><p>fell, disappeared for an instant, emerged </p><p>and advanced. His progress was a series </p><p>of fallings forward. </p><p> “Ben,” we shouted and drove the boat</p><p>forward again. </p><p> He did not hear us but pitched forward,</p><p>struggled a moment and lay lialf-sub- </p><p>merged in a shallow. </p><p> A moment later we reached out eager</p><p>hands. Two of us leaped from the boat to </p><p>lift him from the water—and saw the cause </p><p>of his stumbling progress. He was towing </p><p>a rude raft by a towline made from the </p><p>vine of the wild grape. The raft was com- </p><p>posed of dead logs, tied together with vines </p><p>and, upon this raft were the bodies of “Yim” </p><p>Lund and his two children. Lund and the </p><p>younger boy were unconscious. The older </p><p>boy, half conscious, was lashed to the back </p><p>of the strange raft. </p><p> An hour later all four were in cots at the</p><p>life-saving station and trained hands were </p><p>dressing their burns and wounds. </p><p>BEN had reached the Lund clear- </p><p>ing to find his foes fighting hope- </p><p>lessly trying to save their home. </p><p>He had fought with them until the fire </p><p>reached the buildings and they found them- </p><p>selves cut off from Ben’s clearing. The </p><p>younger boy had fallen exhausted by the </p><p>heat and the exertion. </p><p> Carrying the unconscious boy Ben had</p><p>led the retreat to the river. Twice they </p><p>fought their way through the fire curtain </p><p>itself and finally threw themselves into </p><p>the water. </p><p> All night, standing and crouching in the</p><p>river, they fought for life, Ben and Lund </p><p>taking turns supporting the unconscious </p><p>boy. At daybreak the fire around them </p><p>grew less, but the smoke hung low and they </p><p>breathed at the surface of the river. Then </p><p>Ben started to make the raft by dragging</p><p>logs that had escaped the fire because they </p><p>were stranded at the water’s edge. They </p><p>planned to push the raft up-stream to Platt </p><p>Lake, but when it was finished found them- </p><p>selves too weak to propel it against the </p><p>current, so turned down-stream toward </p><p>Lake Michigan. </p><p> The unconscious boy and his exhausted</p><p>brother were placed upon the raft and the </p><p>two old enemies pushed and dragged the </p><p>raft down the swirling river between walls </p><p>of fire. Sparks and at times large pieces </p><p>of burning wood fell upon and around them, </p><p>sizzling in the water or searing their flesh. </p><p>They threw water upon the children and </p><p>Ben removed his coat, soaked it with water </p><p>and covered their faces. Twice burning </p><p>trees fell across the river and almost barred </p><p>the path. At noon they had passed the </p><p>worst of the fire. </p><p> In mid-afternoon they heard the roar of</p><p>Lake Michigan’s surf piling upon the bars </p><p>at the river’s mouth. Safety seemed at </p><p>hand, but Lund could go no further. In </p><p>vain Ben urged and threatened. Lund </p><p>fell in the water and could not rise. Ben </p><p>lifted him to save him from drowning. </p><p>For an hour they lay upon a little sandbar </p><p>in the river, waiting for Lund to regain </p><p>strength. Then Ben scented fresh danger. </p><p>The wind had changed and he knew that </p><p>the fire might come roaring back through </p><p>the dense cedar swamp that had been </p><p>scarcely touched. </p><p> He succeeded in reviving one of the boys</p><p>and together they rolled Lund upon the </p><p>raft and lashed him to it. His weight </p><p>submerged the raft until all its occupants </p><p>were in danger of being drowned. Ben had </p><p>solved this difficulty by lashing the older </p><p>boy to the rear of the raft so that his weight </p><p>would lift the forward end and hold the </p><p>heads of the others above the surface. </p><p> During the last mile Ben’s mind was not</p><p>clear. How many times he had struggled </p><p>to his feet, fallen forward and dragged the </p><p>raft a few yards he did not know. </p><p> Two days after we brought them to</p><p>Point Betsie station a heavy rain washed </p><p>the Flats clean and the breezes swept </p><p>away all save the scent of dead smoke. It </p><p>was a week before I saw Ben again. I</p><p>knew he and the Lunds were recovering. </p><p>One morning, as I prepared for fishing, Ben </p><p>came down the road. His hair was gone, </p><p>his face was disfigured with bandages and </p><p>plasters but his blue eyes were glad and </p><p>laughing. In his bandaged hands he </p><p>carricd a double-bitted ax. </p><p> “Come on over and help start a shack for</p><p>Yim Lund,” he said. </p><p> And as I looked at him in surprise he</p><p>laughed and said— </p><p> “Feud’s over.”</p><p>CHAPTER I </p><p>EL CAY DE LOS QUATROS HOMBRES </p><p> Like herrings cured in sun and wind</p><p> The four lie side by side,</p><p> Dry as a husk of coco-rind</p><p> Above the creaming tide.</p><p> Buccaneer Ballades.</p><p> kURTLER TOM” was the man who</p><p>discovered them and gave name </p><p>to the islet. He had beached his </p><p>sloop fn the leeward lagoon the </p><p>better to calk a leaking seam and found </p><p>them lying on the sand just above tide </p><p>reach, the desiccated rinds of what had </p><p>once been human beings, mummified, dis- </p><p>torted husks of shriveled skin and flesh and </p><p>bone, their bleaching skulls wisped with hair, </p><p>a few discolored rags flapping about the </p><p>pitiful remnants. </p><p> What tortures had forerun the giving up</p><p>of their ghosts on this arid shoal that thrust </p><p>itself above the blue Bermudan waters, </p><p>Tom could well imagine. There was- no </p><p>water on the cay, no shaide, no growth but </p><p>scanty herbage and brown palmetto scrub </p><p>that survived between the rains by some </p><p>miracle. He looked for identification traces </p><p>in the shreds of personal belongings and </p><p>found none. </p><p> “Dead of hunger and of thirst,” Tom</p><p>said to his Carib sailor. “What brought </p><p>them here? There is no wreckage.” </p><p> Then his foot kicked up an object buried</p><p>in the sand and wind-drift. He stooped </p><p>and picked it up. </p><p> It was a boarding-pistol of unusual design.</p><p>Forged of the same strip to which the trigger- </p><p>guard was attached and deep-set in the </p><p>wooden frame of the barrel was a heavy </p><p>blade, machete- shaped, sickle-curving, a </p><p>formidable weapon for close quarters after </p><p>the discharge of the pan-primed powder </p><p>and bullet, a thing designed by the genius </p><p>of deviltry. </p><p> Turtler Tom had seen this pattern before</p><p>though it was rare those days, the recent </p><p>invention of a buccaneer scourge of the </p><p>Caribbean. His moody eyes gleamed as</p><p>he hefted the cunningly balanced weapon </p><p>by its carved grip. </p><p> “Marooned, poor devils! Marooned by</p><p>Tong Tom’ Pugh!” he exclaimed. “One </p><p>of his bullies dropped it from his belt, </p><p>likely, and it got shuffled under the sand. </p><p>Come, Tampi, we’ll bury what’s left of ’em.” </p><p>Turtler Tom bore the news of his grisly </p><p>find with him back to Providence and to </p><p>Port Royal and all along his devious water </p><p>wanderings but the score of Long Tom </p><p>Pugh was a long one and los quatros hombres </p><p>lay beneath the weather-fluted sands on the </p><p>cay that bore their name as only epitaph, </p><p>unrecognized though doubtless not un- </p><p>mourned. </p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p>THE MERCY OF LONG TOM PUGH </p><p>THE chase had been a long one and Long </p><p>Tom Pugh raged like a thwarted devil. </p><p>From dawn until a scant half-hour of sun- </p><p>set Pugh’s schooner had trailed the other, </p><p>MAROONEFL </p><p>A COMPLETE </p><p>OVELETTE </p><p>ALLAN DUNK </p><p>Author of "The Sign of the Skull,” “The Bully," etc. </p><p>154 </p><p>The Marooner] </p><p>155 </p><p>both vessels tacking on long reaches with </p><p>canvas set until their tall masts bent like </p><p>whips and their lee rails were gutters of </p><p>foam. </p><p> Foot by foot Pugh’s Scourge had over-</p><p>hauled the fugitive until the weapon from </p><p>which Pugh got his name, the “Long Tom” </p><p>couched in the bows, had found first its </p><p>range and then its target, so that now the </p><p>trader lay wallowing in the choppy seas off </p><p>the tiny cay, hull riddled, foremast gone, </p><p>its decks a clutter of rope and canvas that </p><p>served as shrouds to live of its crew that the </p><p>last charge of partridge had dismembered </p><p>and disemboweled. Three men stood near </p><p>the stern, weary, blood-stained, helpless, </p><p>yet defiant, watching Pugh’s longboat </p><p>crowded with his bullies dance over the </p><p>water to take them off. </p><p> “A murrain on the luck!” said Pugh.</p><p>“A stinking shell-pedler! And I thought </p><p>it a gold-carrier from the Plate! And we </p><p>short of powder. But they’ll pay for it, the </p><p>dogs!” </p><p> He cupped his hands and bellowed across</p><p>the crisp waves. </p><p> “Bring ’em away and let her sink, blast</p><p>her. The wind’s ashift.” </p><p> The hair upon Pugh’s broad and naked</p><p>chest was black save where a streak of </p><p>white marked where a cutlas slash had </p><p>sliced his brisket, but the hair of his head and </p><p>of his long beard was dyed a rusty purple as </p><p>if it were stained with dried blood. His </p><p>fierce face, deep-tanned, deep-scored, was </p><p>split by a great, bony nose like the beak of </p><p>a macaw with nostrils that were narrow </p><p>slitted and twitched as he watched the </p><p>progress of his boat. One black eye had </p><p>Pugh and one of hazel and from both of </p><p>them the devil looked out as it leaned on </p><p>elbows across the sill of his brain, never </p><p>free from the fume of liquor and never </p><p>seemingly affected by it. </p><p> He was bare to his belt that was studded</p><p>with pistols tucked into a gaudy over-sash </p><p>and to which swung a hanger in a leather </p><p>scabbard. Wide pantaloons were thrust </p><p>into wider sea-boots of leather and he stood</p><p>with his legs wide apart and his furry hands </p><p>upon his hips. Almost alone of all his </p><p>crew of forty ruffians who overcrowded the </p><p>capacity of the Scourge, Pugh wore no </p><p>earrings. The lobe of one brown ear lopped </p><p>in twain where some desperate foe had tom </p><p>away the ornament. His teeth were natur- </p><p>ally divided and Pugh had filed them in the </p><p>manner of the Madagascar savages, the </p><p>better to characterize his evil countenance. </p><p> The sim dropped rapidly and the sinking</p><p>schooner swashed about in water that was </p><p>incarnadined with the sunset. Nine of </p><p>Pugh’s bullies were in the longboat, now </p><p>returning with the three prisoners, forty-odd </p><p>watched at the rail or made ready for the </p><p>tack to come, for the fickle day’s-end wind </p><p>was setting them down to the shoals that </p><p>outribbed from the cay. </p><p> The three men were set aboard, their arms</p><p>pinioned behind their backs and shoved aft </p><p>to where Pugh stood agrin. They were of </p><p>varying age and stature and one was bald </p><p>save for a fringe of hair. But there seemed </p><p>some link of related features common to all </p><p>of them and they looked Pugh fairly in the </p><p>face though the blood was running into the </p><p>eyes of one of them from a scalp-wound. </p><p> “So,” said Pugh. “Ye thought to out-</p><p>sail the Scourge in that coffm-box of </p><p>yours?” </p><p> The bald man answered.</p><p> “We could not fight. We had no wea-</p><p>pons to match yours.” </p><p> “Then ye would have fought, priest-face?</p><p>Eh? Ye would have fought with Pugh?” </p><p>“I’ll fight with ye now, an ye let one arm </p><p>free,” answered the other composedly. </p><p> Pugh’s face grew purple with a rush of</p><p>choleric blood. He whipped a pistol from </p><p>his belt and leveled it, the hammer slowly </p><p>cocking to the pull of his finger. Then he </p><p>lowered the weapon. </p><p> “Sink ye for a bragging fool,” he said.</p><p>“But I will not kill in cold blood. I must </p><p>remember my vow. I am a merciful man. </p><p>Yet ye crow well. What is your name?” </p><p>“We be three Graemes.” </p><p> Pugh glanced to where the yellow letter-</p><p>ing on the pitching stern of the wallowing </p><p>vessel showed the name Three Brothers and </p><p>nodded. </p><p> “Of Nassau? Turtlers?”</p><p> “Aye. Our port is Nassau but we are</p><p>Carolinans.” </p><p> “So? What know ye of the schooner</p><p>Belle Isle bound from the River Plate. </p><p>She should be hereabouts. Speak up.” </p><p>“Naught. Nor would I tell ye an’ I did.” </p><p>“Say ye so? Look ye, Graeme, I am a </p><p>merciful man. And ye are a fool to be </p><p>stubborn standing on the edge of trouble. </p><p>It is in my mind that ye are lying. So, I </p><p>give ye another chance. Tell me what ye </p><p>know of the Belle Isle and join my crew. </p><p>156 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>We can find room for all of ye and a full </p><p>share apiece if ye come willingly?” </p><p> Silence hung for a few seconds.</p><p> “No? Still stubborn? Then we but</p><p>waste time, brethren three. Into the boat </p><p>with them!” Pugh ordered as a stronger </p><p>gust set the Scourge to shivering where </p><p>she swung in the eye of the wind, uneasy </p><p>and restive, her keen bows pawing the </p><p>waves. “Give them the usual provender </p><p>and set them on the cay.” </p><p> For the first time something like anxiety</p><p>showed in the faces of the trio. </p><p> “Ye would not maroon us on yon cay?”</p><p>said the eldest Graeme. “’Tis waterless. </p><p>Man, ’twill be worse than murder. It </p><p>means-” </p><p> “A fig for what it means,” said Pugh.</p><p>“Ye will shortly find that out. And I am </p><p>a merciful man, Graeme. I am sending </p><p>meat and drink.” </p><p> The brothers exchanged glances. It</p><p>was as if they nodded acquiescense with </p><p>their eyes. The bald-headed one spoke. </p><p> “Theirmay God curse ye for a murderer</p><p>and a coward, Long Tom Pugh!” he said. </p><p>“May ye come at your end to linger till </p><p>your tongue grows to the roof of your mouth </p><p>and your belly shrivels. May your soul </p><p>shred out into the darkness and whine in </p><p>the winds for mercy.” </p><p> He suddenly shot out neck and head and</p><p>spat full in the buccaneer’s face. </p><p> Pugh turned livid and his eyes became</p><p>points of fire. He snatched the scarlet </p><p>bandanna from the head of one of liis </p><p>crew and wiped his face and beard, then </p><p>flung the gaudy silk overboard where the </p><p>wind snatched at it and whirled it far astern. </p><p> “Ye are a cunning knave, Graeme,” he</p><p>said and his voice held hate and breathed </p><p>it as an iron holds heat. “I would that I </p><p>had time to handle ye aright. Yet, before </p><p>ye die, ye will wish a hundred times that I</p><p>had shot ye as ye would have me do. Over </p><p>with them! Ye will find company ashore, </p><p>Graeme. Ask the four I left there a while </p><p>ago to play hosts to ye. ” </p><p> “And speed back,” he called to the quar-</p><p>termaster in the stem of the longboat. </p><p>“These are tricky waters. Ah, look at </p><p>that!” </p><p> The foundering schooner had taken her</p><p>last sudden plunge and disappeared, but </p><p>her maintop spar protruded from the water, </p><p>warning of a shoal toward which wind and </p><p>sea were slowly backing the Scourge. </p><p> “We’ll pick ye up outside!” roared Pugh.</p><p>“Let her come up! Pay off there! Star- </p><p>board tack!” </p><p> lie leaped to the wheel, active as a tiger</p><p>for all his bulk, and laid a guiding-hand to </p><p>the spokes to aid the helmsman. The </p><p>lithe schooner gathered way and hurled </p><p>herself ahead as she caught the wind in the </p><p>shallow hollows of her sails, close-hauled, </p><p>fighting free from the threatening reefs and </p><p>bars. The longboat sped to the shore, </p><p>tumbling out the three Graemes, hurling </p><p>after them two kegs, one of which fell short </p><p>and swashed about in the tide fringe till </p><p>two of them retrieved it. </p><p> The boat went racing back after the</p><p>Scourge as, clear of shoals, it once more </p><p>hung in the wind. The bullies clambered </p><p>aboard and left the longboat, riding to a </p><p>line, to lunge after the schooner like a leap- </p><p>ing dog after its master. Then the sun fell </p><p>below the horizon and darkness jumped up </p><p>from its ambush beyond the rim of the sea. </p><p> Presently a spark of light appeared on the</p><p>leeward side of the cay and grew to a crack- </p><p>ling radiance as the crisp palmetto fans </p><p>flared up. About the fire squatted the three </p><p>brothers, their faces grim in the ruddy glow </p><p>as they took counsel. </p><p> “I would not care so much, save for</p><p>Margaret,” said Will^Graeme, the youngest </p><p>of the three. “The babe was to come this </p><p>week. I had thought to be at home.” </p><p>And a spasm contracted his features. </p><p> “Take heart, lad,” said John Graeme, the</p><p>bald-headed. “We will win through. Aye, </p><p>and settle accounts with Long Tom Pugh.</p><p>The rains are not so far off. A month at </p><p>most. We can eke out. We will. Fret </p><p>not, Will, the child will be bom ere she be- </p><p>gins to worry over ye. But we must go </p><p>carefully. Just keep the life in us till the </p><p>rains come or we sight some ship. May- </p><p>hap we’ll get enough from the wreck to </p><p>build some sort of craft.” </p><p> “The current swings about the cay,”</p><p>said Alec Graeme. “There was no drift- </p><p>wood on the beach. And we were chased by </p><p>the Scourge far off the travel lanes. Ye </p><p>heard what Pugh said about company? </p><p>How he left four here? This is Quatros </p><p>Hombres Cay where Turtler Tom buried </p><p>them that Pugh marooned.” </p><p> “Yet we will win through,” said John</p><p>Graeme. “I’ll handle the rations. Alec, </p><p>see if the water-keg is full. We can do with- </p><p>out tonight.” </p><p>The Marooner </p><p>157 </p><p> “’Tis but a double anker,” grumbled</p><p>Alec Graeme as he rolled the keg closer to </p><p>the fire and John Graeme did the same with </p><p>the barrel of meat. “Now may the flesh </p><p>rot on his bones while he lives in anguish!” </p><p>cried Alec passionately. “This is no water </p><p>anker! ’Tk brandy! And the other bully </p><p>beef! The lying, grinning devil with his </p><p>talk of mercy! Brandy and salted meat </p><p>and the rains a month away!” </p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p>THE INN AT PORTO BELLO </p><p> Oh, sing me a song of a rover,</p><p> A tale of the Spanish Main,</p><p> Of a buccaneer living in clover,</p><p> And drink to the jolly refrain.</p><p> Ho, yo ho, as blade as a crow</p><p> Is the flag the bullies sail under;</p><p> To Long Tom Pugh and his rollicking crew</p><p> And the roar of his carronades’ thunder.</p><p> Ho, yo ho, for the swing of the surge,</p><p> Show me a schooner as swift as the Scourge.</p><p> Gallant and free are the men of the sea</p><p> Who sail under Long Tom, the Wonder!</p><p>THEY beat out the time of the tune with </p><p>their rummers and mugs on the </p><p>scarred tables while their crimson faces </p><p>loomed through the blue haze of the to- </p><p>bacco-smoky, low-ceilinged room like sun- </p><p>dogs through a mist. The song ended and </p><p>Pugh tossed a couple of gold pieces to the </p><p>singer who spun them with a flick of thumb </p><p>and finger and roared for more liquor. </p><p> There were twenty rowdy, blousy wenches,</p><p>muslecs most of them, bred of full whites </p><p>and quadroons, olive-skinned and flushed </p><p>with their portions of the tankards thrust </p><p>upon them by the pirates who shared them, </p><p>each woman with either arm about a buc- </p><p>caneer, ogling, cajoling for a dividend of the </p><p>freely spent, lightly gained gold. Present- </p><p>ly the wail of violins joined in a pulse-</p><p>quickening hornpipe. There was a scuffle </p><p>for partners, half-jovial, half-ugly, and a </p><p>score of couples thrust back chairs and </p><p>tables and swung and lurched upon the </p><p>sand-gritted floor. </p><p> Long Tom Pugh and his bullies were in</p><p>Porto Bello. There were no hovering </p><p>king’s ships to annoy and the town was </p><p>theirs, as long as their gold lasted. Pugh </p><p>did not dance. He sat apart with the </p><p>quartermaster of the Scourge and his matQ </p><p>and chief gunner, his evil face seamed in a </p><p>smile that split his henna-stained whiskers. </p><p> “I’m done,” said the quartermaster,</p><p>glowering at the dice he had just cast. </p><p>“I’m clean as a whistle, curse the bones. </p><p>There’s the devil’s own luck in them!” </p><p> “There should be,” answered Pugh as he</p><p>scooped in the stake. “They are shaped </p><p>from the thigh-bone of the man ‘Roaring’ </p><p>Raines left to guard his treasure-chest when </p><p>he buried it on Ransom Cay. Raines </p><p>buried it and I found it with the skeleton </p><p>of the poor devil he took ashore to do the </p><p>digging sprawled atop of the chest. Raines </p><p>didn’t figure on the shifting dunes. </p><p> “We got hold of a member of his crew</p><p>and persuaded him to tell which cay Raines </p><p>chose to leave the loot on. He told us </p><p>what he knew and luck did the rest. The </p><p>wind had blown the sand and there was the </p><p>hand of Raines’ grave-digger sticking up </p><p>like a sign-post, beckoning us to come and </p><p>get even with Roaring Dick. And my </p><p>bo’sun shaped me the dice. Try your own, </p><p>man. Come, you’ve a ring there I fancy. </p><p>I’ll stake a gold doubloon against it.” </p><p> The quartermaster hesitated, then drew</p><p>the ring from his finger. It was of crude </p><p>workmanship, fashioned, to form a snake of </p><p>gold with a flawed emerald set in the flat </p><p>of the head and two diamond chips for the </p><p>eyes. </p><p> “I’ll set it against five and no less,” he</p><p>said. </p><p> “Three and no more,” answered Pugh and</p><p>piled the stake. A minute later and he </p><p>stuck it on his own hairy digit. </p><p> The quartermaster smothered his re-</p><p>sentful oath in his tankard. </p><p> “Where did ye loot the ring?” asked</p><p>Pugh, twisting it about. “I do not recol- </p><p>lect seeing it in the sharing.” </p><p> “I got it from a wench,” lied the quarter-</p><p>master. </p><p> He had taken it from the finger of Will</p><p>Graeme when he had bound his arms be- </p><p>hind him. And in this, he, the chosen </p><p>representative of the crew in the division of </p><p>spoils, had cheated. But the lie passed. </p><p> “She gave it ye for your handsome face, I</p><p>suppose,” said Pugh and the others at the </p><p>table laughed, for the quartermaster’s face </p><p>was pox-pitted so that his features seemed </p><p>to have crumbled. </p><p>“A winner’s jests come easy,” he growled </p><p>and the look he gave Pugh was murderous. </p><p>The scrape of the fiddles and the shuffling </p><p>of feet ended and once more the sweating </p><p>158 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>servers scurried about replenishing the </p><p>empty mugs. A fight over a girl broke out </p><p>in a corner and the mustce ran squealing </p><p>from the grappling men. </p><p> “Bring ’em out in the open,” bawled</p><p>Pugh. </p><p> With all the blood-lust in them flaming</p><p>from the liquor they had swigged, a dozen </p><p>men hustled out the combatants to the open </p><p>space between the tables. </p><p> “Take away their knives,” ordered Pugh.</p><p>“I’ll lose no good men for the sake of a </p><p>worthless wench. A doubloon to the win- </p><p>ner!” </p><p> Left to themselves the two pirates,</p><p>roaring like bulls, rushed at each other </p><p>swinging arms like flails, locked, swayed </p><p>and fell together to the floor. One got </p><p>astride of the other and gripped his throat </p><p>while the under man’s knees played a tattoo </p><p>against his back and he squirmed like a seal. </p><p>The topmost lost his balance and they rolled </p><p>over and apart to scramble to their feet </p><p>amid the yells of their comrades. </p><p> There was no science to it and much</p><p>comedy, for one was squat and bow-legged </p><p>and the other lanky and gangling. But </p><p>the latter bashed the short one in the face </p><p>with a straight left so that his nose seemed </p><p>to split like a rotten pear and the blood </p><p>spurted. The squat man bellowed, grabbed </p><p>his long opponent about the buttocks and </p><p>sent him hurtling over his shoulder to </p><p>smash against the table-leg with his </p><p>head. </p><p> The unsound support splintered at the</p><p>impact and the table pitched forward with </p><p>all its contents while the room echoed with </p><p>ribald laughter. The lanky man lay stunned </p><p>and was hauled out by his feet to have a </p><p>tankard of ale dashed in his face as the vic- </p><p>tor advanced to Pugh for his doubloon. </p><p> A door had opened in the rear and a girl</p><p>came in whose appearance drew the swift </p><p>attention of those nearest to her, halting </p><p>their jesting and buffoonery to a silence </p><p>that rapidly spread so that she advanced in </p><p>a strained quietude to the center of the</p><p>sanded space where she stood for a moment </p><p>before she gave a nod to the fiddlers and </p><p>began to dance. </p><p> She danced like a reed in the wind,</p><p>swaying with infinite grace of posture, </p><p>her feet scarce leaving a circle less than </p><p>that of an ordinary platter. She was tall </p><p>and lissom, though full-busted and she </p><p>looked like a half-opened flower, fresh, un- </p><p>smirched with paint and holding an air of </p><p>aloofness that was eery. </p><p> Her dark gray eyes, almost violet at times</p><p>in the uncertain lights, seemed to gaze far </p><p>beyond the tavern walls, she danced as </p><p>one might dance at will on the sea-sands, </p><p>as a nymph might dance, strangely in- </p><p>congruous in that assembly of gross- </p><p>passioned men, unconscious of her sur- </p><p>roundings. Her golden hair was coiffed </p><p>in classic simplicity and her sable draperies </p><p>were at odd variance with the tawdry </p><p>gauds of the mustees who viewed her with </p><p>palpable disfavor yet shared the silent </p><p>concentration of the buccaneers. </p><p> The air the fiddlers played was soft and</p><p>low, a crooning rhythm that sounded like </p><p>the murmur of surf after a storm or a </p><p>breeze playing amid young birches. And, </p><p>as she danced, to the masterful, masterless </p><p>men about her, came visions of Spring </p><p>woods where hyacinths and primrose clus- </p><p>tered, of brooks winding amid lush sedges, </p><p>all set in the far-off days of their own </p><p>innocence. </p><p> The rhythm changed and she floated</p><p>’round the room, light as thistle-down or a </p><p>foam-bell, her eyes passing over the rough, </p><p>seamed faces with no hint that she regarded </p><p>them as indices of humanity, hypnotizing </p><p>them by the sheer beauty of her dance. </p><p>Then she snapped her fingers to the players </p><p>and they swung their bows to a wild </p><p>tarantelle. The violet eyes became black, </p><p>sudden roses flashed out on her cheeks, her </p><p>posturing became of the flesh rather than </p><p>the spirit, provocative, yet so infinitely </p><p>graceful that it still held the audience in </p><p>thrall though their heads swayed to </p><p>the increasing lilt and their pulses </p><p>pounded. </p><p> She was no longer a foam bell, but a</p><p>curling wave that leaped, upcurving, crest-</p><p>ing to the very feet and then swept back </p><p>in furious eddies that bewildered with their </p><p>whirl. </p><p> A fiddle-string snapped. She stopped,</p><p>ivory arms flung back, audacious, chal- </p><p>lenging, as a shower of coins fell upon the </p><p>floor and one of the pirates, snatching a </p><p>tambourine from his quondam consort, </p><p>gathered up the gold and humbly offered </p><p>it to her as she courtesied low before Long </p><p>Tom Pugh, whose eyes were ablaze and </p><p>whose beaked nose showed its ridge of bone </p><p>as the nostrils twitched and dilated and the </p><p>great chest lifted and fell. </p><p>The Marooner </p><p>159 </p><p>HE ROSE, sweeping the table aside </p><p>and, in one great stride, reached </p><p>and raised her, crushing her to him </p><p>while his bearded lips sought hers. Then </p><p>he drew back with an oath as she twisted </p><p>free and stood, less at bay than ready for </p><p>attack, a dagger she had drawn ■ from </p><p>between her breasts flashing in her hand, </p><p>her eyes holding Pugh’s while one of his </p><p>great paws fumbled at his beard where </p><p>blood was oozing its way through the mat </p><p>of hair just beneath the line of his chin. </p><p> All breaths were held, sensing the verge</p><p>of tragedy. But Pugh, still fumbling at his </p><p>beard, slowly retreated until his other hand, </p><p>back-stretched, f: It the edge of the table </p><p>he had pushed aside. His eves, no longer </p><p>blazing, but ablink, were fixed on those </p><p>of the dancer and, as he leaned against the </p><p>support, he shivered. </p><p> “She is a witch,” he muttered. “Look</p><p>at her eyes. They are not human! By </p><p>God, she missed my jugular by an inch! </p><p>She would have let the life out of me!” </p><p> And still the room hung on the scene,</p><p>marveling to see Pugh so strangely tamed </p><p>yet conscious of the weird power of the </p><p>woman. Pugh’s hand fetched up against </p><p>a rummer and tightened about it. He </p><p>lifted it and chained the raw cafia it con- </p><p>tained. As he set it down the dancer’s </p><p>gaze suddenly fastened on the ring he had </p><p>won from the quartermaster. </p><p> She seemed to stiffen in a sinuous pose,</p><p>while the arm that held the dagger glided </p><p>like a white-skinned snake, back in an </p><p>almost imperceptible movement that pre- </p><p>saged a lightning thrust. It came, but </p><p>only to sheath the knife between her </p><p>breasts once more, and she laughed. </p><p> “Know ye not ye must not touch me?”</p><p>she asked, and her voice, clear as a bell, </p><p>seemed to come from afar off like the sound </p><p>of a distant chime. “Ye must not touch </p><p>me, for I am Death,” she said. “I am </p><p>the White Death and this dress is the </p><p>shroud of Love.” Her eyes, absolutely </p><p>fearless, burned in their absolute belief </p><p>of what she spoke to Pugh’s brain and to </p><p>all in that still silent room. The light</p><p>in them was uncanny, as if the soul no longer </p><p>reigned behind them in its seat, they were </p><p>lambent with the high glaze of madness. </p><p>And they held Pugh as a snake charms a </p><p>bird. </p><p> “You are Death?” he muttered. She</p><p>nodded. </p><p> “But you need not fear me yet,” she said.</p><p>“I have not harmed you. Only warned </p><p>you. Did I not dance for you? And you </p><p>sought to take me. Know ye not that it is </p><p>Death who comes for you?” </p><p> She advanced her hand and the great</p><p>bulk of Pugh cowered. He crossed himself </p><p>and many of his men did likewise. </p><p> “Where got ye that coiling ring about</p><p>your finger?” she asked. </p><p> He took it off and offered it to her.</p><p> “Take it,” he said. “Take it and go.”</p><p>“There is blood on it,” she answered. </p><p>Pugh looked shudderingly at the circlet </p><p>and laid it on the table, not realizing it was </p><p>his own gore from the fingers that'had </p><p>pressed his neck that stained it. </p><p> “It is yours,” he said shortly. “Take it.”</p><p>“Nay, I have not yet earned it. Nor </p><p>have ye told me its history. Surely it has </p><p>a history? Mayhap it was a love-pledge </p><p>once upon a lime? Tell me. Then I </p><p>will sing for ve and so I shall have earned </p><p>it.” </p><p> “I know naught of it,” said Pugh. “I</p><p>won it but now from him.” </p><p> He nodded at the quartermaster and the</p><p>woman’s eyes scrutinized the pitted face </p><p>for an instant. </p><p> “Ye shall tell me presently,” she said,</p><p>and smiled. </p><p> And with her smile the dread that had</p><p>stiffened the face of the quartermaster </p><p>passed and he grinned at her with yellow </p><p>teeth. The witch had turned siren and his </p><p>vicious blood responded. </p><p> “I’ll spin the yam,” he said. ‘‘I am not</p><p>so timid as others.” And he glanced </p><p>sneeringly at Pugh who had sat down</p><p>and was shading his eyes with his hand. </p><p> “No?” she asked. “Then why do ye</p><p>make the holy symbol?” For the pirate’s </p><p>bundled fingers still touched his tunic above </p><p>his heart. “He who woos Death does not </p><p>always win. Yet Death is kind.” </p><p> She stepped back and commenced to</p><p>sing. </p><p> Where lies he now?</p><p>Lost love of mine; </p><p> His marble brow</p><p>Is creased with brine, </p><p> His lips caressed</p><p> Are chill and gray;</p><p> How warm they pressed</p><p> The other day.</p><p> His body swings</p><p> To shifting tide,</p><p> No twilight brings</p><p> Him to his bride.</p><p>i6o </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Yet do I know</p><p> Our tender vow</p><p> Shall ever bind,</p><p> As then, so now.</p><p> When fails my breath,</p><p>When life grows dim, </p><p> I’ll thank grim Death</p><p> For finding him.</p><p> It was a dirge that changed into a pajan</p><p>of joy. While she sang there v. as not a soul- </p><p>calloused sea-rover, not a hardened drab </p><p>but sighed to the memory or the lost hope </p><p>of love, tender, gallant and enduring, not </p><p>one but thrilled to the credence of the last </p><p>triumphant lines. In a spell they sat as </p><p>she took the ring and glided from the room, </p><p>the tambourine with its golden offerings </p><p>untouched. </p><p> Then Pugh shook off the mood that</p><p>compassed him. </p><p> “Go, bring her back,” he ordered.</p><p>“Fiend take me, but I’ll teach the jade. </p><p>I’ll take her, aye, and break her till she </p><p>sighs for death. Rot me, up and after her, </p><p>I say.” </p><p> No one moved till the quartermaster,</p><p>with a contemptuous look at Pugh, got up. </p><p> “I'll find her,” he said. “But I’ll not</p><p>promise to bring her back.” </p><p> Pugh started up, coughed and set a swift</p><p>hand to his mouth. The stab had pierced </p><p>through to his throat and his mouth had </p><p>filled with blood as his anger quickened </p><p>its flow. And the quartermaster, catching </p><p>up the tambourine as he went, vanished </p><p>into the night outside. </p><p> The tavern-keeper came hurrying with a</p><p>bowl of water and a pannikin of rough salt. </p><p>Pugh swallowed his own blood and waved </p><p>him aside. </p><p> “ ’Tis no hemorrhage, fool!” he said.</p><p>“Only a scratch. Unless,” he added, </p><p>half to himself, and his ruddy face paled,</p><p>“the, witch poisoned it.” </p><p> “Best let me fetch a leech,” said the</p><p>tavern-keeper. “Indeed I know little of </p><p>the wench, save she is a bit mad. She </p><p>comes from Nassau, some say. She has an </p><p>infant. She lost her man at sea and it </p><p>crazed her. But this is hearsay. She has </p><p>danced here and elsewhere and sings among </p><p>the sailors, seeking news of her man. Yet </p><p>she seems not to know her own name. </p><p>And she was ever harmless until now.” </p><p> “I have a leech of my own,” said Pugh.</p><p>“If the fool is sober? So, Folsom, here ye </p><p>are. Take a look at this slit the she-devil </p><p>put in me. Where is the quartermaster?” </p><p> “Gone after the witch,” said the dis-</p><p>credited medico, who had joined the out- </p><p>laws of the Scourge. </p><p> “May she slash his weasand agape,”</p><p>said Pugh. “We would be well rid of </p><p>both of them. What think ye of the </p><p>wound?”	-</p><p> “I think ’tis clean. Some ointment and a</p><p>stitch, maybe-” </p><p> “Then come off to the schooner. Lads,</p><p>we sail on the flood close after dawn. I </p><p>have news of a gold-ship. And,” he added </p><p>as he left the tavern with the leech, “if she </p><p>bewitches the quartermaster we’ll sail </p><p>without him, He is too solid with the men </p><p>now, for my liking.” </p><p> As they went down the beach the chorus</p><p>broke out again behind them, muffled by </p><p>the closing door: </p><p> Ho, yo ho, as black as a crow,</p><p> Is the flag we bullies sail under,</p><p> To Long Tom Pugh and his rollicking crew</p><p> And the roar of our carronades’ thunder.</p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>MARGARET GRAEME </p><p>TT IS hard to say if Margaret Graeme </p><p>was mad. Perhaps it was merely the </p><p>passing fever of a brain lit by the exaltation </p><p>of one great concentration of purpose, bred</p><p>of a mating love and hope—the finding of </p><p>her man. Will Graeme had promised to </p><p>be back for the birth of their son; no ordi- </p><p>nary circumstance would have held him. </p><p> Now he was two months overdue and</p><p>for six weeks she had been seeking news </p><p>of him, bending her will to the best ways </p><p>and means of cajoling sailormen, the use </p><p>of her beauty, of her voice and of her grace, </p><p>so used as to keep herself inviolate for Will. </p><p>So had grown in her a wondrous cunning </p><p>coupled to her gifts of dance and song that </p><p>had bubbled up within the sweet fountain </p><p>of her body in the happy days of love and </p><p>mating. </p><p> She had thought of the boucatiiers.</p><p>There were other perils of the deep, but </p><p>it was not yet the season of hurricanes, </p><p>and the Three Brothers was a stanch and </p><p>speedy craft, while Alec and John and Will </p><p>formed a trio of mariners who were innate </p><p>masters of the sea rather than doomed </p><p>to be its playthings. In her six weeks of </p><p>flitting from port to por-t she had heard </p><p>more than once of Quatros Hombres Cay </p><p>The Marooner </p><p>161 </p><p>and the way of Long Tom Pugh and others </p><p>of his calling. </p><p> Earlier pirates had been different, men</p><p>big in a crude way, moved by fits of cruelty </p><p>or generosity as the mood swayed them. </p><p>Sometimes they would kill, kill for the sheer </p><p>joy of blood-letting, drunk with the fight, </p><p>the reek of powder and the drive of blade </p><p>or point through elastic flesh and stubborn </p><p>bone. And again they would give some </p><p>gallant foe his ship after they had glutted </p><p>their fancies from the cargo, or send the </p><p>survivors adrift in an open boat to take their </p><p>chance of landing after having sworn them </p><p>not to inform. </p><p> But Pugh and his ilk took no chances.</p><p>They were marooners, leaving their victims </p><p>on desert cays to perish, destroying all </p><p>witnesses, yet styh'ng themselves merciful. </p><p> And Margaret’s grief-shocked brain had</p><p>determined that buccaneers had taken her </p><p>Will and his brothers. True, the Three </p><p>Brothers'' hull held nothing worth the rifling </p><p>but she had the heels of the trading fleet </p><p>and the pirates were apt at changing to a </p><p>faster or sounder vessel than their own. </p><p>On these lines Margaret had hidden her </p><p>identity, asking rather than leading up to </p><p>information, listening, piecing together, </p><p>charming her crews and selecting by her </p><p>woman’s wits the natural chiefs among </p><p>them. </p><p> Even the child came second. With her</p><p>on her wanderings went a coal-black West </p><p>Indian negress, a giantess in size and </p><p>strength, a child in loyalty and admiration </p><p>of her golden-haired mistress, who played </p><p>nurse to the infant and guardian to the </p><p>mother. </p><p> Margaret knew, when she left the tavern,</p><p>that the pox-pitted quartermaster would </p><p>follow her. It was the compelling urge </p><p>of her sex, grown to its utmost power in </p><p>the hothouse of her love, that called to </p><p>such rough spirits yet held their coarseness </p><p>in check by the purity of her own spirit’s </p><p>flame. She was a Circe and she bent men’s </p><p>passions and wills as one might weave </p><p>osiers to a basket. </p><p> As the quartermaster, the hot blood</p><p>flooding his brain to one mad desire that </p><p>was only tempered by a certain dread, </p><p>emerged, tambourine in hand, its golden </p><p>coins jingling slightly on the taut parch- </p><p>ment, out from the heated tavern into the </p><p>quiet night, he saw, between the interlacing </p><p>shadows of the palms upon the shell road, </p><p>11 </p><p>silver where the moon lustered it, the </p><p>figure of the dancer, vague, uncertain, </p><p>almost ghostly in the checkered light that </p><p>shifted with the play of the land wind in </p><p>the plumes of coco-palms. She had a </p><p>mantilla about her head, but he caught </p><p>the gleam of her eyes as she glanced his </p><p>way, and marked the play of her beckoning </p><p>hand. </p><p> Involuntarily he crossed himself, then</p><p>swore at his own weakness with a crude </p><p>sea-oath and followed her in his lurching </p><p>deck-gait. Followed, for she glided ahead </p><p>without ever looking back, on beyond the </p><p>clustering houses of the port, on to where </p><p>a path led through the sea-bush. She went </p><p>fast, and the quartermaster, his heart </p><p>pounding a devil’s jig against the cage of </p><p>his ribs, lunged after, striving in vain to </p><p>gain without breaking into a run, from </p><p>which the same latent, tugging fear at the </p><p>back of his inflamed brain prevented him. </p><p> They came into a scanty clearing where</p><p>a mud cabin stood and a little stream flowed </p><p>from the hills and spent itself in the sand. </p><p>An owl hooted and the quartermaster </p><p>checked his pace at the omen. It might </p><p>be the witch’s familiar. But he was a </p><p>slow-witted man, save in the practise of </p><p>his calling, and the strength of his body </p><p>and the triumph of a hundred personal </p><p>skirmishes had endowed him with a sturdy </p><p>belief in his own prowess that built up a </p><p>dogged courage born of the flesh rather </p><p>than the mind. Ilis purpose once set, he </p><p>would hold to it. And he followed. </p><p> Lights glowed suddenly in the two</p><p>visible windows of the little cabin and he </p><p>saw the door open as the woman reached </p><p>the threshold and, turning for the first time, </p><p>drew aside her mantilla, showed him the </p><p>witching oval of her face with its gleaming </p><p>eyes and, with the tiniest beckon of her </p><p>head, passed in.</p><p> There was but one room in the low-</p><p>roofed place. By the light of two brass </p><p>lamps burning whale-oil, he saw that it was </p><p>empty, saw too, that the only other door, </p><p>at the back, was barred on the inside. </p><p>There was little furniture. A low bed </p><p>stood behind a screen and, near the pillows </p><p>he saw what seemed a small bundle under- </p><p>neath the coverlet. </p><p> Who then had opened the door or lit the</p><p>lamps? He felt the hair rising at the nape </p><p>of his neck and the incipient goose-quills </p><p>lifting down his spine. His hands tapped </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the pistol butts in his belt and the handles </p><p>of his dirks and the swift wish came to him </p><p>that he had a silver witch-bullet in the </p><p>muzzle of one of the former. </p><p>ran BUT the woman had turned and, </p><p>I S»*\| radiantly alluring, pointed to a </p><p>lA . l rough chair in which he sat, even </p><p>while he felt little cold beads break out </p><p>upon his brow beneath his headkerchief. </p><p>A slight draft caused him to slightly turn </p><p>his head and roll his eyeballs toward the </p><p>door through which he had just entered. </p><p>It was slowly closing of its own volition. </p><p>The dancer was holding out a pewter mug </p><p>toward him. </p><p> “It is cana," she said. “I will pledge</p><p>you first.” </p><p> She sipped a little and swallowed it. He</p><p>could see the moisture of the liquor on her </p><p>crimson lips and he took the mug and </p><p>drained it. The ardent stuff fired him, </p><p>his eyes became bloodshot and he leaned </p><p>toward her, swaying a trifle like an amorous </p><p>bear. God, but she was beautiful! White </p><p>—and tender and sweet! But some tingling </p><p>touch of restraint still thralled him. </p><p> “What if I should take you, mistress?”</p><p>he uttered in a deep guttural. </p><p> She surveyed him unafraid with her</p><p>shining eyes. They held a hint of amuse- </p><p>ment. </p><p> “You would be dead long before the</p><p>dawn,” she said, and the utter conviction </p><p>of her voice hammered home to him the </p><p>feeling that she spoke sooth. </p><p> “Did I not tell you I was Death?” she</p><p>almost crooned. “I could kill you in a </p><p>hundred ways, so very easily. They say </p><p>I am a witch. You think so as you sit </p><p>there. Wouldst see my familiar? Look </p><p>at the window.” </p><p> Swiftly she lowered the wicks of the two</p><p>lamps till they barely showed. The moon- </p><p>light came in at one window and made a </p><p>wedge-path to where the quartermaster </p><p>sat. The path began some two feet from </p><p>the window where the shadow of the wall </p><p>below the sill ended. It was very white</p><p>and luminous, squared off by the woodwork </p><p>of the panes. </p><p> Slowly a blotch began to eclipse its</p><p>brightness. A drumming noise commenced </p><p>and quickened as the blotch enlarged </p><p>and the pulse of the mariner beat faster </p><p>until it seemed as if the sound were that </p><p>of the blood flowing through his own </p><p>veins. Then, suddenly, a face leered in </p><p>at the window. </p><p> The face of a demon, livid, emitting a</p><p>pale lambency that set off a great, grinning </p><p>mouth set with pointed tusks between </p><p>which lolled the tip of a lusting tongue, </p><p>staring eyeballs floating in white circles, </p><p>wide nostrils eagerly agape and crisp hair </p><p>that seemed alive with mysterious lights. </p><p>The skin was black, like that of a devil from </p><p>the pit, and it appeared fungused with the </p><p>phosphorescence of decay. It blotted out </p><p>the moonlight and shone by its own </p><p>radiance. </p><p> Santa Maria! This dancer was no</p><p>woman! She was a ghoul, a succubus! </p><p>The quartermaster snatched a pistol from </p><p>his belt and pulled trigger. By some </p><p>mischance the powder had fallen from the </p><p>pan and it missed fire. But his brain gave </p><p>no such ordinary explanation. The face </p><p>was still there. And, by the living God! </p><p>A snake was twining through the tresses! </p><p>He flung himself at the door that opened </p><p>outward. It was of solid hardwood and </p><p>it resisted his heavy thrust as if it had been </p><p>of iron. </p><p> Behind him the dancer laughed. He</p><p>turned, sweat clammy on him, at bay, </p><p>fumbling for a knife. The lamps were </p><p>turned up again, the face had gone. </p><p> “Sit down,” she said. “Since ye can not</p><p>go, sit down. I mean ye no harm.” </p><p> “No harm? Then why-”</p><p> “So ye should not harm yourself by</p><p>trying to harm me. Take more cana.” </p><p> She handed him a fresh measure and took</p><p>a pipe from a stand, filled it and handed </p><p>it to him with a paper spill that she had </p><p>lighted above the flame of her lamp. </p><p>Half-mechanically he drank the liquor and</p><p>accepted the pipe, sitting down once more. </p><p> “Are ye human or what?” he asked,</p><p>gaining false courage from the cana and </p><p>the homely elements of her hospitality. </p><p>“Or have ye tricked me? By the wounds </p><p>of God’s Son, that head cast a shadow on </p><p>the floor. ’Twas no spirit!” </p><p> He half rose.</p><p> “Wouldst try another pistol at it?” she</p><p>asked smiling. “Or will ye go outside and </p><p>seek it. The door is open now. Or closed, </p><p>as I will. But I am flesh and blood. </p><p>See.” </p><p> She took his rough hand in her smooth</p><p>one and set it on the warm satin of her </p><p>forearm. The beast in him leaped to the </p><p>The Marooner </p><p>163 </p><p>front. He sprang up, coarse mouth open, </p><p>eyes crimsoning, his clutching hands apart. </p><p> “Sit down,” she said, and her voice rang</p><p>like the crack of a trainer’s whip. “If ye </p><p>would win me ye must woo me. Sit down!” </p><p> His half-befuddled brain obeyed the</p><p>dominance of her will and he crouched </p><p>rather than sat, as an unwilling brute going </p><p>through a disliked performance. </p><p> She had said “if.” Would she come</p><p>willingly to him? Would she play an </p><p>obedient, eager beauty to his beast? If </p><p>only she would take her eyes off his. She </p><p>might be human, but those eyes were not. </p><p>They made him blink as they had made </p><p>Pugh blink. Yet she had preferred him </p><p>to Pugh. Why not? He was the better man </p><p>for all his ravaged face. Some day. . . . </p><p> “Ye are a brave man,” she was saying.</p><p>“Ye have done brave things and ye will </p><p>do braver, with my aid. Come, ye were </p><p>going to tell me about this ring.” </p><p> There may have been some subtle herb</p><p>steeped in the cana. The negress, voodoo- </p><p>worshiper, who had so ably backed her </p><p>mistress by her startling apparition, her </p><p>sooty face smeared with ma,tch-phosphorus, </p><p>fireflies in her wool, a harmless snake looped </p><p>in the kinks, knew many secrets. </p><p> It was not the first time she had raised</p><p>a devil to her mistress' conjuring, using </p><p>such simple but not necessarily transparent </p><p>means as in the present case when she had </p><p>lit the lamps and swung the door at sight </p><p>of Margaret’s approach backed by a sailor- </p><p>gaited man. Then, descending through </p><p>the cellar-trap, kept covered by a grass rug, </p><p>she had emerged by the outer hatch to play </p><p>her demoniac role and set a prop against </p><p>the entrance door as she and her mistress </p><p>had planned for such emergency. </p><p> And it was small wonder that, with the</p><p>setting, the suggestion and eery atmosphere </p><p>that environed Margaret, the quarter- </p><p>master, knowing nothing of the existence </p><p>of her sooty slave, had deemed the appari- </p><p>tion supernatural. </p><p> Perhaps Margaret Graeme’s stress of will</p><p>gave her hypnotic power. The quarter- </p><p>master gazed upon the dull emerald and </p><p>the twinkling eyes of the golden snake and </p><p>felt his own will melting into a desire to </p><p>serve. If she was Circe, he was Caliban. </p><p> He had meant to lie about the ring, to</p><p>spin some yarn redounding to his own </p><p>prowess, but his words came aside from </p><p>his own volition and he spoke the truth. </p><p> “There were three of them left, all</p><p>brothers,” he said. “We chased them all </p><p>day, thinking them a gold-ship from the </p><p>Plate, for there was one due in that neigh- </p><p>borhood. The schooner was fast. We </p><p>overhauled it at sunset and we sank it. </p><p>We killed all the crew, for’ard and amid- </p><p>ships, with a round of partridge. The </p><p>Three Brothers it was called. Their name </p><p>was Graeme.	/</p><p> “We brought them aboard in the long-</p><p>boat. I bound the youngest of them </p><p>and I took this ring from his finger as I </p><p>made it fast. One was bald and he mocked </p><p>Pugh, who sent us ashore with them. We </p><p>left them with a keg of salt-horse and an </p><p>anker of brandy. ‘Pugh’s provender,’ we </p><p>call it. They are dead now and you have </p><p>the ring.” </p><p> “Where did ye land them. Where?”</p><p>“Nay, I know not. I told ye we chased </p><p>them all day. We took no sun that noon. </p><p>Nor did I check our bearings in the log </p><p>for Pugh and I were at outs and I bunked </p><p>for’ard for a week before. And since. </p><p>Somewhere to the southeast of the Wind’ard </p><p>Isles.” </p><p>HE HAD told all he knew. In the </p><p>longboat he had not heard Pugh </p><p>mention the four men set ashore </p><p>at a time when he himself had been ashore </p><p>at Skull Cay, their own headquarters, </p><p>recovering from fever and a bad shot- </p><p>wound. Nor did Pugh himself know that </p><p>Turtler Tom had found the shriveled </p><p>men and styled the islet Quatros Hombres. </p><p> Margaret repressed a sigh. She was</p><p>balked of the pith of what she sought </p><p>even while she heard what caused her heart </p><p>to leap. For Will was still alive—she was </p><p>strangely confident of that. He had been </p><p>on a barren cay for eight weeks, nearly nine,</p><p>for the quartermaster had said Sunday, </p><p>and the babe was born on Thursday night. </p><p>Nine weeks with the food that was an ag- </p><p>gravation rather than sustaining, the rains </p><p>had not yet come though they were overdue, </p><p>but she was sure that her Will, her gallant, </p><p>strong, loving Will, would win through. </p><p>As her love had made her do wonders so </p><p>his would help him to a miraculous preserva- </p><p>tion. Then there were John, the canny, </p><p>and Alec, the capable. Oh, it was im- </p><p>possible to think of them perishing! </p><p> So now she bent her wits to locating</p><p>the cay. “Somewhere southeast of the </p><p>164 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Windward Islands” was like saying “some- </p><p>where in the haystack lies the needle. ” There </p><p>were hundreds of cays—no man yet knew </p><p>how many cays, since the charts were </p><p>acknowledged vague—humping themselves </p><p>above the waves, just awash, arid isles of </p><p>the ocean desert. </p><p> But Pugh knew. And Pugh must tell.</p><p>Pugh would be more difficult. He was not </p><p>as plastic as his quartermaster, quicker- </p><p>witted, more—due to his imagination—of </p><p>a beast when aroused. Margaret swiftly </p><p>made up her mind to ply the quarter- </p><p>master of all he knew of Pugh, his ren- </p><p>dezvous, his habits, his next intentions. </p><p>This she would take to the king’s ship—• </p><p>there was one expected soon at Providence, </p><p>and she would make her bargain. News </p><p>of how to capture Pugh in exchange for </p><p>information to be dragged from the pirate </p><p>as to the whereabouts of the cay on which </p><p>he had set the Graemes. She might go </p><p>farther and ask for passage on the king’s ship. </p><p> Yet this course—and she reasoned so</p><p>swiftly that the quartermaster knew naught </p><p>of her mental process—was uncertain. </p><p>Pugh might be killed in the fight. And </p><p>the Scourge had outsailed many a king’s </p><p>ship. She must have two strings to her </p><p>bow. The quartermaster was her surest </p><p>method. Later would come the ultimate </p><p>revenge if aught really happened to her Will. </p><p> While the shuttle of her mind shot</p><p>nimbly through the warp and woof of her </p><p>brain, weaving in bright strands of hope, </p><p>the land-wind swept down from the hills </p><p>in a sudden rush, bringing with it the swift </p><p>patter of rain. Her heart leaped. It was </p><p>a sign—a sign that before many hours the </p><p>season’s fall would be mercifully drenching </p><p>that scorched cay where Will fought off death. </p><p> She turned to the quartermaster.</p><p> “It is a pretty ring,” she said. “I am</p><p>sorry it has no stranger history or that we </p><p>do not know it. Thank you.” </p><p> “Thank me not. Thank Pugh, or,</p><p>rather, thank no one. You paid for it </p><p>with your dancing. God, it was like the </p><p>swaying of the seaweed in the lagoon pools</p><p>when the tide shifts and all the colored fish </p><p>swim in and out. And that last. It was </p><p>a flame! See, I forgot the gold they </p><p>gave ye.” </p><p> He took up the tambourine with its</p><p>jingling coins from the table. </p><p> “I need it not,” she said. “Take it.</p><p>Ye can use it.” </p><p> Open-mouthed, he goggled at her insist-</p><p>ence, then pouched the gold. </p><p> “Ye care not for money?” he said in-</p><p>credulously. </p><p> “Not for coins. They pass through a</p><p>thousand hands a hundred times a year. </p><p>They are counters in the game. I like </p><p>jewels. I love jewels!” </p><p> She sighed, and looked at him with</p><p>deliberate languishment. </p><p> “I have seen rare ones, aye, and owned</p><p>them,” he boasted. “I will get ye jewels </p><p>that have adorned princesses, jewels from </p><p>sacred shrines, jewels from the hilts of </p><p>chieftain’s swords. I will outweigh thee </p><p>with jewels. Why, look ye, once-” </p><p> “Go on,” she said. “Tell me of yourself,</p><p>brave man.” </p><p> There is no flattery so subtle as that of</p><p>Desdemona’s gift. All the world loves a </p><p>ready listener, and the quartermaster </p><p>talked until his own experience, his own </p><p>limited invention, and what he remembered </p><p>of the yams of others were combined in </p><p>his Ulyssean tale. Ever and anon the </p><p>wind would rise to a gale with spit and slap </p><p>of rain that passed unnoticed by the teller. </p><p>At last he paused and emptied the mug </p><p>she had kept replenished. </p><p> “I knew you for an adventurous man</p><p>and a brave one, Simon Hart,” she said, </p><p>for he had told her his name. “You have </p><p>told me your past. Give me your hand. </p><p>I will read ye the future.” </p><p> Then from his horny palm she conjured</p><p>a vision of success, tinged with suggestions </p><p>to her own end that so accorded with </p><p>Simon Hart’s self-estimation that it knit</p><p>his will to achieve these things. She read </p><p>and leavened his jealousy of Pugh, of any </p><p>master, she cajoled him and held out hints </p><p>of reward until he swore by all the gods of </p><p>sea and land that she was a marvel and that </p><p>he would prove her so. </p><p> “The men are with me,” he boasted.</p><p>“Pugh is puffed up with pride and has forgot </p><p>his fellowship. They are tired of seeing </p><p>him with the lion’s share and, with their </p><p>smaller measure, only harsh words. He </p><p>would forbid them the freedom of the cabin, </p><p>he would curb their shore liberty, he calls </p><p>no conferences, he gives only half an ear </p><p>to what I set before him. </p><p> “The wind blows my way now. And</p><p>when we have given him the black spot, </p><p>when he is deposed and I rule and reap a </p><p>harvest of the Caribbean, wilt come with </p><p>The Marooner </p><p>me to Skull Cay and queen it? I will build </p><p>you a house and bring you mustee slaves, </p><p>white slaves and black, and I will be the </p><p>chiefest of them. I will make Pugh your </p><p>servant. I will humble him as I will </p><p>elevate thee. Wilt come?” </p><p> “Come back to me soon and tell me ye</p><p>have done these tilings. We will reap the </p><p>harvest later. Prove to me you are a better </p><p>man than Pugh. Bring him to me or me </p><p>to him-” </p><p> “What want ye of Pugh?” he asked with</p><p>sudden suspicion. </p><p> “I hate him. He tried to kiss my lips.</p><p>He would have taken me by force. I could </p><p>have killed him but I would rather see you </p><p>break him and then give him to me. See, </p><p>the lamps are wan. The day breaks.” </p><p>Simon Hart leaped to his feet and looked </p><p>through the rain-streaked window at the </p><p>graying east. </p><p> “We sail on the flood,” he said. “Pugh</p><p>would go without me. Farewell!” </p><p> He would have embraced her roughly,</p><p>but she eluded him, and a hint'of struggling </p><p>rose stained the sky above the hills and </p><p>flushed the room. </p><p> “Farewell,” he cried again and left the</p><p>cabin, running heavily across the clearing. </p><p>Margaret watched him with eyes from </p><p>which the glaze of fever had lifted to show </p><p>exaltation struggling with weariness and </p><p>saw him plunge into the bush path with </p><p>a hasty wave to her. Then she turned </p><p>back into the cabin and leaned above the </p><p>small bundle on the bed behind the screen. </p><p> “Babe, babe,” she breathed softly.</p><p>“Your father, whom ye have never seen </p><p>and who has never seen your little straight </p><p>limbs and his own image in your eyes and </p><p>shape, is coming home again.” </p><p> And the pattering, saving rains told the</p><p>beads of her prayers. </p><p> When the great negress came softly in</p><p>she found Margaret Graeme asleep on her </p><p>knees beside the bed, continuing her grateful </p><p>petitions in her dreams.</p><p>CHAPTER V </p><p>FOX AND HOUNDS </p><p>'G'OR the third time the Scourge, with </p><p>mutiny mounting in the hearts of her </p><p>crew, headed up for Skull Cay, Pugh’s </p><p>rendezvous in the delta of the River Plate. </p><p>For the third time the chagrined lookout </p><p>in the top saw through his glass the </p><p>king’s ship in the offing, visible to him by </p><p>her higher spars and canvas. Behind them, </p><p>outdistanced for the time, more by luck </p><p>than speed, for the Scourge’s bottom was </p><p>fast gathering a drag of weed, Pugh knew </p><p>the Thetis, sloop-of-war, was following re- </p><p>lentlessly. </p><p> Somewhere below the sea rim her consort</p><p>was cruising. And they were all after the </p><p>Scourge. The hunt for Pugh was on, and </p><p>these three indomitable, untiring gaze- </p><p>hounds of the sea had viewed him and never </p><p>had one of them, or two, failed to loom on </p><p>the horizon at nightfall and again at dawn. </p><p> Once, after a gale that blotted sea and</p><p>sky, a frigate had shown so close to them </p><p>in the swift clearance that the bullies of </p><p>the Scourge could see from their deck the </p><p>yellow hull with its blue top-works and </p><p>the scarlet gun-ports that opened eagerly </p><p>to belch a broadside that came skipping </p><p>and scattering across the waves. Pugh </p><p>had run for it, outmetaled by this frigate </p><p>of the fourth-class but not outsaUed. </p><p>Then the sloop-of-war had appeared, head- </p><p>ing them off, and Pugh and his bullies </p><p>fought a smashing encounter. </p><p> The sloop had diem inshore and the</p><p>frigate was plowing along far astern, </p><p>so that there was nothing for Pugh to do </p><p>but run the gantlet of the sloop’s broadside </p><p>until he could forge ahead on his superior </p><p>speed. This the Scourge had finally accom- </p><p>plished, but not until showering round- </p><p>shot had taken toff of the crew and damaged </p><p>the gear so that Pugh had to fish his fore- </p><p>topmast. Five bullies went overboard to </p><p>the ground sharks, seven still tossed and </p><p>groaned in the stuffy cock-pit, their jagged </p><p>wounds attended by the leech with the </p><p>rough surgery of those times. </p><p> Their best suit of sails had been sadly</p><p>rent by the iron hail and they had been </p><p>given no time to patch, only to change </p><p>foresail and two of the jibs for extra canvas, </p><p>well worn and none too sound. Altogether </p><p>they were in evil case. Their bottom was </p><p>fouling rapidly so that already they could </p><p>note the difference of speed and answer to </p><p>the helm. Their water was low and </p><p>beginning to smell musty. Worst of all, </p><p>the powder was running short. </p><p> They had made but a brief stay at Porto</p><p>Bello on account of the tip given Pugh by </p><p>the tavern-keeper concerning the gold- </p><p>ship and they had been unable to buy </p><p>Adventure </p><p>munitions there. They had missed the </p><p>gold-ship, or the tip had been false, the </p><p>men were tired and lacked sleep, the grog </p><p>was none too plentiful and Simon Hart </p><p>assiduously encouraged the idea that it </p><p>was all the fault of Pugh, that the captain’s </p><p>luck had gone, that he had had his day and </p><p>that the passing of the “black spot” was in </p><p>order. Such whisperings went about with- </p><p>out any knowing who started them. </p><p> Pugh sensed the trouble, sensed too that</p><p>the quartermaster was the brewer and </p><p>cursed the day that he had taken among </p><p>his crew a man who knew navigation. So </p><p>far the common peril kept the snake of </p><p>rebellion coiled and only sleepily resentful. </p><p>Once out of it, Pugh determined that </p><p>Simon Hart must die, in such fashion that </p><p>the crew should not suspect Pugh of the </p><p>deed. And Hart read the wish and the will </p><p>in Pugh’s demeanor so that the two went </p><p>warily, watching each the other. </p><p> It was the continuous presence of one</p><p>or other of the king’s ships in the Plata </p><p>Gulf that gave Pugh greatest uneasiness. </p><p>True, he might, at nightfall, slip into one </p><p>of the many mouths of the Plate and work </p><p>his way through the labyrinth of creeks, </p><p>but it was vital to refit and careen and to </p><p>reach the stores and powder in the maga- </p><p>zines at Skull Cay, but it seemed evident </p><p>that the enemy knew of the existence and </p><p>location of that rendezvous. </p><p> Some one had blabbed, Pugh knew not</p><p>whom. There were moments when Simon </p><p>Hart wondered if the dancing witch had </p><p>played him false, but he could see no reason </p><p>for such vindictiveness toward himself </p><p>and her hate of Pugh he set down to a </p><p>woman’s whimsy, a flare-up that would die </p><p>as swiftly as it had flamed. Nor did it </p><p>curb his ultimate ambition to displace </p><p>Pugh and see himself as a master buccaneer, </p><p>a swaggering, colorful figure to be sung of </p><p>ashore and at sea. </p><p> Meanwhile they were in jeopardy. They</p><p>were closer to the land and to their haven </p><p>than the frigate, but the Scourge lay in a </p><p>belt of alternate calm and sudden, forceless </p><p>catspaws that sent the schooner surging </p><p>forward for a little footage, then died away </p><p>to leave her with slapping canvas and </p><p>jerking rigging as she pitched on the ground-</p><p>swell. But the frigate was coming in on a </p><p>full breeze. All her courses were set and </p><p>studdingsails had been spread in her cap- </p><p>tain’s eagerness to head off the chase. </p><p> On she came, lifting higher and higher</p><p>until they could see the gleam of her wet </p><p>side, its airy roll as it lifted, and the cream- </p><p>ing rush at her bows. And still the sharp </p><p>line of the wind, dark against the sluggish </p><p>shore waters, showed sharp and clear and </p><p>steady, two miles seaward of the Scourge. </p><p>Presently the frigate ran out of the breeze, </p><p>her studdingsails hung idle, course after </p><p>course wrinkled from their bellied fulness </p><p>and the crew began to take in some of the </p><p>useless kites. Under her own impetus she </p><p>glided into the calm belt that girdled the </p><p>schooner and lay there heaving to the </p><p>swell. </p><p> Pugh looked at the distant land and at</p><p>the haze that hid the crests of the range. </p><p>He looked at the sky that was a blue flame </p><p>and he looked at the sea about him, a sea </p><p>of greenish brass. He looked at liis crew </p><p>and at Simon Hart and gritted his teeth as </p><p>he walked his quarterdeck. </p><p> “May their souls crisp in hell!” he mut-</p><p>tered, and the oath included king’s men </p><p>and his own. </p><p> He was trapped. He had less than</p><p>thirty able men and presently boats would </p><p>drop over from the king’s ship, filled with </p><p>fighting men, two at least to his one, and </p><p>they would come swinging over the swell </p><p>with the bosun’s pipe of “boarders away” </p><p>still ringing in then ears. His men, if they </p><p>could be called his, would fight hard and </p><p>well, but there would be no spirit in them, </p><p>only the sullen, desperate courage of the </p><p>cornered pirate while the king’s men would </p><p>swarm over and through the nettings with </p><p>cheers. </p><p> He leveled his glass. Already tiny</p><p>figures were swarming at the davits of the </p><p>frigate. Pugh snapped the telescope shut. </p><p> “Lay aft here, all hands,” he roared.</p><p>“Men, we’re in a tight box. See to it they </p><p>don’t nail the lid down on us. The devil’s </p><p>own luck is in the weather, and, hear me all, </p><p>I’ll serve a mass to Satan an he’ll but send </p><p>us enough wind to slide by that frigate! </p><p>We’ve got to beat off their boarding-party.</p><p>So up double-nettings and fight like the </p><p>devil’s own. Gunner, I’ll lay Long Tom </p><p>myself. Double-shot your carronades. </p><p>Use partridge and canister. Lively, all of </p><p>ye, or ye’ll be squirming on hell’s griddles </p><p>in an hour.” </p><p> Pugh went forward and saw to the load-</p><p>ing of his long bow-chaser, one hand fondly </p><p>on the sleek metal skin of his barking </p><p>The Marooner </p><p>serpent while he hung over the breech, </p><p>watching the foremost boat from the </p><p>frigate as it came up on the long surges of </p><p>the ground-swells and hung on the crests </p><p>for a moment, the oars of the men dipping </p><p>in rhythmic man-of-war sweep, making the </p><p>four craft that had been dispatched against </p><p>them look like water beetles, straddling on </p><p>top of, rather than in, the water. </p><p> igi LITTLE specks of white light</p><p> S broke out from the weapons of the</p><p>fighters, soon the pirates could see </p><p>the gay colors of the uniforms, the figures </p><p>of the officers in the stern sheets, urging </p><p>their rowers on in the gallant race for the </p><p>honor of being first aboard the chase. </p><p>They could see the spurts of foam from the </p><p>quick, even catch of the ash blades, work- </p><p>ing with toy-like precision. The little </p><p>flotilla split apart, they were going to </p><p>attack on both sides. </p><p> The pirates worked like fiends, raising</p><p>a double-net above the rail, piling up their </p><p>ammunition, setting handy pike and double- </p><p>ax and pistol and musket. Many were </p><p>armed with Pugh’s special boarding pistols, </p><p>he himself carried a variety of small arms </p><p>in his belt and slung from a sash that ran </p><p>across his bare and matted chest. </p><p> Every man was nude to the waist, belts</p><p>were taut and kerchiefs wrapped tight </p><p>about their brows and each man’s face </p><p>was grim for the encounter. Swabs stood </p><p>beside the inhauls of the carronades and </p><p>buckets of water ready to cool the heated </p><p>metal. By the foremast they were taking </p><p>turns at a grindstone, edging their cutlases </p><p>afresh and the sparks shone orange in the </p><p>sun before they died. </p><p> And still Pugh waited, calculating the</p><p>range and the lift of the water before he fired. </p><p>He was the master-gunner of them all, and </p><p>their only hope lay in smashing at least one </p><p>boat, no easy mark as it raced on. The </p><p>leading cutter poised on the rounded </p><p>summit of a swell and Pugh, squinting </p><p>through the sight, dipped the glowing </p><p>linstock to the powdered touch-hole. The </p><p>Long-Tom roared and white smoke cauli- </p><p>flowered up from the muzzle in the still air. </p><p>Pugh, peering through the screen, saw the </p><p>shot souse into the sea beside the boat,</p><p>shearing off the blades of the port oars </p><p>and throwing the crew into temporary </p><p>confusion. </p><p> “Jump to it,-ye, jump!” he yelled,</p><p>lending his strength to the inhaul of the </p><p>gun, seizing the swab himself and plying it </p><p>dexterously. </p><p> The charge was set and rammed home</p><p>with almost incredible swiftness and Pugh’s </p><p>hawk eyes fiercely sighted the mark. The </p><p>missile plumped fairly into the cutter, </p><p>fragments flew and the sea was dotted </p><p>with the black forms of struggling men, </p><p>survivors of the deadly aim. </p><p> The second boat swung in to the rescue</p><p>and Pugh laughed. </p><p> “A taste of our metal they didn’t relish,”</p><p>he crowed. “We’ll try ’em again.” </p><p> But his next shot ricocheted harmlessly</p><p>past the target and a puff of white smoke </p><p>from the bows of the frigate, followed by a </p><p>hollow boom, sounded the recall. </p><p> “Done! They’re done, the snivelling</p><p>hounds!” cried Pugh. </p><p> “No, by God, the wind is coming!”</p><p>He had seen the flattened royals and sky- </p><p>sails on the distant frigate puff and fall to </p><p>puff again while a line of foam showed faint </p><p>at her bows. The boats had turned with </p><p>the men they had rescued from the wreck </p><p>of the cutter and were speeding back. </p><p>Twice more the Long-Tom roared without </p><p>a hit. </p><p> Seaward the sky had suddenly darkened,</p><p>wind pouring out of gathering clouds as </p><p>from a bellows, the swift riffle of it all about </p><p>the frigate now and reaching toward the </p><p>Scourge. The king’s men had to get </p><p>aboard, which equalized to some extent the </p><p>fact that the schooner was last to get the </p><p>breeze. A fine haze had veiled the sky </p><p>and tarnished the sun, a moan came out </p><p>of the source of the wind, a hurricane was </p><p>forward. It was not a Plate pampero, but </p><p>a true sea-gale. </p><p> “A black mass to thee, Satan!” shouted</p><p>Pugh. “We’ll beat ’em yet!” </p><p> The sudden unleashed gale grew in in-</p><p>tensity. Aboard the frigate they were </p><p>shortening sail as she rushed on toward the </p><p>Scourge. But now the schooner had caught </p><p>the breeze and was fleeing northward, the </p><p>wind abeam, the sweet lines of her entry </p><p>slicing the long rollers that had replaced </p><p>the heave of the swell. The heavier frigate </p><p>heeled, her bows deep to the catheads, her </p><p>masts abend. A faint sound, like a pistol </p><p>-shot, came to the Scourge and an unfurled </p><p>royal flew from the frigate like a bird. Yet </p><p>her superior canvas, while it held, smashed </p><p>her through the seas faster than the </p><p>168 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Scourge, which trailed a beard of weed </p><p>along her keel, and she held the windward </p><p>gage. </p><p> The frigate did not fire. The distance</p><p>was still extreme for her range and the </p><p>pitch and toss of chaser and chased made </p><p>targetry a waste of powder. But her </p><p>canvas held in the bolt-ropes, the lighter </p><p>sails having been furled before the full </p><p>fury of the gale broke, and she gained, little </p><p>by" little. A drenching area of rain from </p><p>an overswollen cloud passed between the </p><p>two ships, hurrying to gain the shore with </p><p>the remnants of its load and for a minute </p><p>or so blotted out all view. </p><p> Following it came a gusty squall and the</p><p>wounded topmast of the Scourge smashed </p><p>at the cross-trees. Still the frigate gained </p><p>and now a long headland loomed up, barring </p><p>the way. The schooner could not clear </p><p>it, but Pugh held on to his tack until the </p><p>last moment before he ordered— </p><p> “ ’Bout ship!”</p><p> The pirates hauled madly on the sheets</p><p>as the Scourge spun on her keel and clawed </p><p>a frantic way seaward into the face of the </p><p>gale with the king’s ship, plunging like a </p><p>bull, coming fast up. As the schooner </p><p>crossed her bows the frigate yawed and fire </p><p>spurted from her dripping sides. Round </p><p>shot screeched through the rigging above </p><p>the voice of the storm, round shot gouged </p><p>the Scourge’s planks and tore away her rail, </p><p>round shot slugged into her side-planks as </p><p>she rose to the roll of the sea. Peak and </p><p>throat halyards of the mainsail were torn </p><p>away as the blocks came smashing down, </p><p>the canvas drooped like the broken wing of </p><p>a bird and the schooner fell off in the trough. </p><p> Two men swarmed aloft with repair</p><p>tackle, but as she rose to the pitch of the </p><p>great waves another volley came and men </p><p>dropped groaning while Pugh cursed at </p><p>their impotence. </p><p> “Satan take me, but send rain,” he</p><p>bawled as he stood at the wheel astride </p><p>the headless helmsman who had fallen </p><p>at his feet in the last discharge. </p><p> Above them an ebon cloud was rived with</p><p>lightning, and from the gash a blinding </p><p>torrent fell, hiding sea and sky, battering </p><p>the deck and hissing in the scuppers, </p><p>striving to flatten the rearing waves </p><p>that ran and leaped uncontrolled as the </p><p>hurricane reached its height. </p><p> The mainsail, reefed close, rose again,</p><p>and the stricken schooner gained headway. </p><p>Pugh could not see the frigate for the storm </p><p>and darkness, but he knew she too must </p><p>have tacked to avoid the cape and was now </p><p>using every effort to combat the gale. Out </p><p>to sea they fought, foot by foot, under the </p><p>inky pall of the sky, while the thunder </p><p>pealed and the rain thudded down. Once </p><p>only as a blue javelin split the clouds from </p><p>the zenith did Pugh catch a glimpse of the </p><p>laboring frigate. </p><p> Hour after hour they beat out until they</p><p>had struggled through to the skirts of the </p><p>tempest, and at sunset sailed a troubled </p><p>but subsiding sea without sail in sight or </p><p>fall of land. </p><p>CHAPTER VI </p><p>REPRISAL </p><p>AT MIDNIGHT Pugh sat alone in his </p><p>cabin. Neither his lieutenant, Folsom, </p><p>the leech, nor Simon Hart, who slept in </p><p>tiny cubbyholes that opened from the main </p><p>cabin, had come aft since they had run </p><p>out of the storm. All three were forward </p><p>with the men, and though Pugh had closed </p><p>transom and door against the sound, he </p><p>was conscious of snatches of song and </p><p>drunken shouting in the bows. </p><p> For the first time he had lost control</p><p>of his men. They had refused to clean </p><p>ship after they had run out of the gale, </p><p>and Pugh, swallowing his black wrath, </p><p>had let the matter go under Simon Hart’s </p><p>smiling excuse that the hands were dog- </p><p>tired. </p><p> It presaged trouble; Pugh realized that</p><p>very plainly. He was not the man to </p><p>brook tamely the taking away of his </p><p>authority and a place forward among the </p><p>hands with his share the same as the least </p><p>among them. He could hardly believe </p><p>that he had dropped the whip and lost the</p><p>power over his bullies. They were all </p><p>brainless—save Simon Hart. Left to them- </p><p>selves they knew naught but to drink, sing </p><p>or listen to bragging, evil yarns. They </p><p>never thought. A story-spinner could hold </p><p>them, any one with initiative could get an </p><p>audience, the last thought placed in their </p><p>heads was the prime one, and Simon Hart, </p><p>the crafty devil, had worked upon them </p><p>as a modeler would handle clay until they </p><p>were all of his pattern. With Hart out of </p><p>the way, he, Pugh, could bring them ’round </p><p>again. </p><p>The Marooner </p><p> And he walked the cabin pondering the</p><p>best way of disposing of Simon Hart. He </p><p>might challenge him or start a quarrel? </p><p> The medico came down the companion-</p><p>way and sank down unbidden on a chair </p><p>at the table beneath the gimbaled lamp. </p><p>His face was drawn and his tired eyes were </p><p>set in black caverns. </p><p> “ ‘Ranting Dick’ has gone,” he said.</p><p>“Bates and Willett will go out with the </p><p>dawn. I may pull Ames through, but he’ll </p><p>lack a leg. And Bartlet is in evil case.” </p><p>Pugh scowled. Of all the crew Bates </p><p>and Ranting Dick might have been de- </p><p>pended upon to stand with him against </p><p>the rest. </p><p> “Stop your croaking,” he said angrily,</p><p>then changed his note. “Nay Folsom, </p><p>I meant it not. Ye need somewhat to </p><p>bring back your own blood. Art white </p><p>as a corpse. Mix yourself a rummer of </p><p>grog. Mix one for me.” </p><p> The leech looked craftily at Pugh as he</p><p>mixed gin, water and the juice of limes </p><p>with sugar into a cold toddy. There was </p><p>malice in his eyes. </p><p> “There’s trouble for’ard,” he essayed</p><p>tentatively, and as Pugh did not forbid him, </p><p>went on. </p><p> “The men say that Pugh’s luck has</p><p>broken, that ye have given your soul to </p><p>Satan and that ye are accursed. They </p><p>have held a council and they have voted </p><p>to slip ye the spot.” </p><p> He squealed suddenly like a rabbit when</p><p>it feels the fetters bite, and his glass fell </p><p>from his palsied hands as Pugh clutched </p><p>him about the throat and shook him clear </p><p>of the floor. </p><p> “So, they will slip me the spot, will they?</p><p>And they have sent ye sneaking aft to </p><p>deliver it. You dog, you drug-pounding, </p><p>treacherous dog. Ye dare to come to me </p><p>and tell me I am to be deposed!” </p><p> He flung the doctor from him with a</p><p>crash and the leech landed in a huddle upon </p><p>his hands and knees. </p><p> “Nay, I bring nothing. I—I voted</p><p>against it. I came to warn ye. They </p><p>will slip ye the spot in the morning. I tell </p><p>ye some wanted to see ye walk the plank </p><p>but I would none of it.” </p><p> “Aye, ye persuaded Simon Hart to mercy,</p><p>I doubt not,” said Pugh grimly. “Get up, </p><p>man, and finish your grog. Mix more. </p><p>Now listen. Where are your drugs? In </p><p>Hart’s cabin?” </p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “Have ye enough to mix a sleeping draft</p><p>for the quartermaster, have ye enough to </p><p>mix one so deep for Hart that he will wake </p><p>up in hell? Listen, Folsom, do this for me </p><p>and we will win through yet. We’ll slip </p><p>through this cordon, we’ll repair ship and </p><p>sneak back to Porto Bello or some other </p><p>port and refit. We’ll get more bullies to </p><p>replace our dead and you, Folsom, shall be </p><p>my right-hand man. A double share for </p><p>ye in all. We’ll set up another rendezvous </p><p>and ye shall have a house there of your own, </p><p>a house for your loot and your women. </p><p>What say ye? </p><p> “It must be a cunning drug or that devil</p><p>Hart will note it in his liquor. And one </p><p>that acts swiftly. With him down I will </p><p>drive the rest of them until they beg for </p><p>me to forgive them. Have ye such a drug, </p><p>Folsom? Look ye,” he clapped the lecch </p><p>upon the back. “I have gold and jewels </p><p>here aboard the Scourge. I’ll share the </p><p>gold with ye and give ye the pick of the </p><p>jewels. Gems to win a woman’s favor with, </p><p>Folsom, gold to buy it.” </p><p> “Where is it?” asked Folsom, still with</p><p>the malice cold in his eyes, though now it </p><p>was tinged with greed. </p><p> “There is a false bottom to the locker</p><p>in my room cabin below floor-level. Slip </p><p>for’ard and take the drug, put it in Hart’s </p><p>drink and then come back to me. Art </p><p>game for it?” </p><p> The leech nodded and pushed Pugh’s</p><p>second toddy toward him. </p><p> “Ye’ll pledge me your word?” he asked.</p><p> Pugh picked up the rummer and gulped</p><p>down its contents.</p><p> “I’ll play fair with ye,” he said.</p><p> Suddenly his face contracted, his mouth</p><p>drew back in a snarl, and he set an uncertain </p><p>hand to his head, looking at Folsom through </p><p>a thickening haze. His voice came in a </p><p>husky growl that choked in his dry throat </p><p>as his staring eyes began to glaze. </p><p> “Double-dealing knave, I’ll-”</p><p> He lurched heavily against the table and</p><p>groaned as Folsom watched him with </p><p>fascinated gaze. Then Pugh squared him- </p><p>self with a mighty effort and,stood erect, </p><p>a dirk in his hand. </p><p> “Drug me, would ye? I’ll slit thy</p><p>weasand!” </p><p> Folsom made a sudden dive for the com-</p><p>panionway, but Pugh towered between him </p><p>and escape. With the dose that the lecch </p><p>170 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>had mixed in the second toddy it seemed </p><p>incredible that the pirate chief could keep </p><p>his senses. He dodged behind the table </p><p>and Pugh came toward him with a certain </p><p>grim dexterity, wedging him in a corner of </p><p>the main cabin behind the table and reach- </p><p>ing for him, his head nodding as if with </p><p>th.e palsy, dry lips apart, eyes protruding </p><p>with the effort of the will back of </p><p>them. </p><p> Pugh’s fingers closed, twisting the</p><p>medico’s cravat, and dragged him across </p><p>the table, turning him on his back, wind </p><p>and speech cut off, weak and limp from </p><p>semi-suffocation, gaze goggling at the blade </p><p>that descended in inexorable jerks that </p><p>marked the failing coordinations of Pugh’s </p><p>mind and body, descended until its sharp </p><p>edge broke the skin and gashed flesh and </p><p>windpipe while the air from Folsom’s lungs </p><p>rushed whistling out with his escaping soul, </p><p>his half-severed head fell back across the </p><p>table’s edge, and Pugh, groping toward </p><p>the sealed companionway, bolted and barred </p><p>it before he slumped and lay inert. </p><p> „PUGH came back to consciousness</p><p>with a frightful, pounding pain </p><p>in his head, a searing almost un- </p><p>endurable torment. His mouth was foul </p><p>and dry, when, with an effort, he opened </p><p>his gummy eyes the vertical rays of the sun </p><p>glared into them and added torture to the </p><p>pulsating agony of his brain. </p><p> He was lying in the bottom of a small</p><p>boat, his bulk wedged and crumpled be- </p><p>tween the thwarts. The boat floated on </p><p>even keel in a dead calm. There were little </p><p>sucking noises at the bow that sounded to </p><p>him like drum-strokes. Along the thwarts </p><p>lay a mast with its sail wrapped about it, </p><p>together with two oars. In the stern were </p><p>two kegs and a baling pannikin. </p><p> Pugh managed to get one arm across his</p><p>face to shade the furnace of the sun. </p><p>Slowly recollection came back to him in </p><p>disjointed fragments as it had registered. </p><p>He remembered the drugging and the </p><p>killing of Folsom—that was a deed well </p><p>deserved and well done—then the breaking </p><p>of the skylight, the battering down of a </p><p>door, with himself rising and fighting like a</p><p>man in his sleep. He remembered the </p><p>taunting face of Simon Hart, then he had </p><p>fired at it and missed, but had hit some one, </p><p>for a face back of Hart had changed from </p><p>a triumphant grin to a mask of pain. Some </p><p>one had struck him on the head from </p><p>behind—and that had been the end. </p><p> And they had not killed him. Why?</p><p>He lifted his head and exquisite agony </p><p>spread from a spot above his right ear </p><p>until it surged like a white flame through </p><p>his consciousness. The blow must have </p><p>laid bare his brain. He feared to touch </p><p>the place. It seemed to him he would feel </p><p>the pulsing matter oozing at the contact. </p><p>As an egg when the shell is broken but the </p><p>membrane holds intact and dimly shows </p><p>the yolk. That was how his head must be </p><p>and the sun was frying his brains! Yet </p><p>he could use them. He was still alive! </p><p>It was the remnant of the cursed drug that </p><p>bound him. Presently he would get up, </p><p>make an effort, plan the future. </p><p> He lapsed again. When he revived he</p><p>lay in shadow. The sky was a bowl of </p><p>jade above him and the boat was moving, </p><p>tossing to one side and another unevenly </p><p>as if in the jobble of a tide-rip. The'pain </p><p>in his brain was less, the vitality seemed </p><p>to have come back to him somewhat, </p><p>though he was terribly cramped and </p><p>terribly weak, so that the best he could </p><p>do was to crawl and twist himself to a </p><p>huddle in the stern close to the two kegs. </p><p> There was no wind, no tide-rip, no motion</p><p>on the placid sea of peacock-blue. </p><p> Blunt muzzles reared above the surface,</p><p>gray forms rubbed against the planks like </p><p>great cats that arch and scrape their backs </p><p>while waiting to be fed. The boat swayed </p><p>and swerved as the sharks forged under </p><p>the keel and lifted it. There were two </p><p>score of them or more, silently, persistently </p><p>striving to upset the thing that kept from </p><p>them the food they sensed and craved. </p><p> It was cooler. It had rained yesterday,</p><p>tomorrow it would likely rain again, since </p><p>the rains were fairly started. But mean- </p><p>time, with his partial revival, there came a </p><p>craving for food and water, principally for </p><p>water. Pugh knew what was in the kegs </p><p>beside him before he made certain of it.</p><p>They had given him “Pugh’s Provender,” </p><p>the same brandy and salt-meat he had </p><p>devised for those he had marooned. If </p><p>he could only strike land somewhere and </p><p>find puddles and pools of yesterday’s down- </p><p>pour. He seemed partly paralyzed from </p><p>the drug, and he hitched himself up with </p><p>elbows and hands to a higher position. </p><p> Far to the south he thought he glimpsed</p><p>the blue phantom of a sail. That would </p><p>The Marooner </p><p>be the Scourge. There must have been a </p><p>breeze when they had put him overboard. </p><p>Pugh prayed that one of the king’s ships </p><p>might come up and demolish the schooner </p><p>and hang Simon Hart to the yardarm, </p><p>kicking and jerking like an impaled crab. </p><p> The sun dropped and evening swiftly fled</p><p>before night. Pugh could no longer quite </p><p>control his mind. He was still afraid to </p><p>touch the wound he had received. It must </p><p>have been from belaying pin or marlinspike, </p><p>he thought, and he held the belief that only </p><p>a thin integument lay between his brain </p><p>and the air. Once let that be picrced and </p><p>he would die. </p><p> All night gray sharks trailed with the</p><p>boat, muzzling, nudging each other in a </p><p>ghastly cortege. Sooner or later what was </p><p>in the boat would come to them. Sooner— </p><p>or later. Once Pugh thought he heard the </p><p>boom of guns across the watery sounding- </p><p>board, but he could not be sure. </p><p> Soon after that he began to see shapes,</p><p>seated on thwart and gunwales, some with </p><p>their dried arms folded and their desiccated </p><p>bodies in the water. There were others </p><p>who grinned at him from the bows. Folsom, </p><p>the leech, with his severed throat, and Simon </p><p>Hart! Good—if that was Simon’s ghost </p><p>Simon was dead and he, Pugh, was still </p><p>alive, very weak, but alive! And there- </p><p>fore still the better man. </p><p> The shapes were those of men and</p><p>women. Vaguely he remembered some of </p><p>them. He had marooned them. There </p><p>was one phantom of a girl with great black </p><p>eyes. She had died by her own hand— </p><p>after. . . . And there were the four men </p><p>he had left on the cay. He had left three </p><p>there just recently. Where were they? </p><p>Ah, there—there on the next thwart! One </p><p>was bald-headed. Priest-face he had called </p><p>him. </p><p> The boat began to slide along in the grip</p><p>of some mysterious current, for there was </p><p>no breeze, no veil in the sky to herald rain. </p><p>Water! There it was, a hidden stream </p><p>running underneath the keel. And he too </p><p>weak to dig for it. Once he had seen a man </p><p>with divining rods. . . . </p><p> Dawn rushed up and the phantoms dis-</p><p>appeared. The boat rocked. The gray </p><p>shapes were breaking water now. Pugh </p><p>essayed to pick up an oar and batted feebly </p><p>at the snouts that showed. The boat </p><p>swerved. They were trying to capsize it. </p><p>The boat moved on, grounded and now the </p><p>blood-beat in his brain grew louder. It </p><p>was surf breaking on low land. Pugh craned </p><p>his head painfully. He was being carried </p><p>fast by flood and current to a sandy beach </p><p>dotted with gray shrubs. </p><p> Land! And somewhere in some rock</p><p>crevice there must be water. The boat </p><p>bumped, dragged, lifted and bumped on </p><p>again. A swell tilted the stem and swept </p><p>the boat on to strand it on the shore. The </p><p>gray shapes were cheated, left behind in </p><p>deeper water. He was ashore. </p><p> Somehow he got out and collapsed on</p><p>the wet sand. Then some vital spark </p><p>brightened and he began to crawl me- </p><p>chanically up the slope. There were no </p><p>rocks about that his bleary eyes could see, </p><p>but there were marks that showed that </p><p>turtles had been there. How fresh the </p><p>trail he could not tell. He could no longer </p><p>reason, his moves were instinctive. Some </p><p>low mounds loomed ahead. They should </p><p>be where the turtles had covered their eggs. </p><p>He clawed with painful effort and unearthed </p><p>a grinning skull. </p><p> He tried to scramble from the place and</p><p>bones grasped at him from the loosened </p><p>sand. With a prodigious effort he got to his </p><p>knees and so to tottering feet. Out of the </p><p>palmetto scrub three grisly figures came </p><p>toward him, ragged, thin—one of them </p><p>had a bald head. The others. . . . </p><p> Pugh turned and lurched down the slope.</p><p>He was blind and dizzy, his brain afire. </p><p>He could not see his boat, and staggered </p><p>on with outspread arms, pursued by the </p><p>phantoms. He heard the lap of water. </p><p>It was the old swimming-pool! He would </p><p>dive and escape. There was a gap behind </p><p>an old root. Waist-deep he splashed into </p><p>the lagoon, scooping up the salt sea and </p><p>thinking it nectar. Then he struck the </p><p>verge of a tide-swept gulf and plunged </p><p>forward. </p><p> A gray shape, followed swiftly by another</p><p>and yet another, rose, swirled and lunged.</p><p>There was a commotion under the surface </p><p>that sent long ripples diverging on the top, </p><p>ripples stained with crimson that rapidly </p><p>dissolved to streamers of pink. </p><p>“ ’TWAS Pugh himself!” cried Alec </p><p>Graeme. “The sharks have got </p><p>him!” </p><p> “He has left his boat,” said Will Graeme</p><p>hoarsely. “He has left his boat! See, </p><p>there are mast and sail. Come Alec, come </p><p>172 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>John. We’ve won through. Margaret!” </p><p>He fell to his knees on the sand in thank- </p><p>fulness, and his brothers dragged up the </p><p>boat. </p><p> “We’ll broach the kegs and clean them,”</p><p>said Alec. “It is clouding for rain. With </p><p>these and the two others filled with water </p><p>we can essay the trip.” </p><p> Will Graeme came up.</p><p> “We start now,” he said fiercely.</p><p> Alec set an arm about his shoulders.</p><p>“Tonight, lad,” he said. “ ’Tis an un- </p><p>certain trip. Pray God there be stars to </p><p>set our course.” </p><p>CHAPTER VII </p><p>THE END OF THE CHASE </p><p>IN THE gray of the dawn Captain Thorne </p><p>of his Majesty’s sloop-of-war Thetis </p><p>chuckled as he picked up the pirate schooner </p><p>that he had fought at long range as they </p><p>drifted through the starlit, almost breeze- </p><p>less night. Now the wind strengthened </p><p>with the dawn, the canvas filled and they </p><p>bore down upon the Scourge. </p><p> It was the end of the long chase. The</p><p>schooner sailed but sluggishly compared </p><p>with the sloop, and while her stern-chaser </p><p>fired intermittently, the aim was bad and </p><p>the shot fell short. </p><p> “They are saving on the charges. Pow-</p><p>der’s low,” he said to his lieutenant. </p><p>“We’ve got them now, Blair.” </p><p> The woman standing by the rail moved</p><p>over to him. Her sleepless eyes were </p><p>brilliant. Captain Thorne nodded to her. </p><p> “We’ll have them inside of an hour, Mrs.</p><p>Graeme,” he said kindly. “Thanks, in </p><p>great measure to you.” </p><p> “Pugh must know the island where he</p><p>left them. You’ll get; it from him, Cap- </p><p>tain.” </p><p> “Aye, we’ll persuade him to tell all he</p><p>knows.” As she moved back to the rail </p><p>where she had watched ever since the </p><p>first shot had been fired Thome added in </p><p>an undertone to his junior. “If we get him </p><p>alive. We’ll keep bargain with her and </p><p>seek the island, but they can hardly be alive </p><p>for all her faith. Look—look at their flag! </p><p>They are surrendering.” </p><p> The black flag of the pirate was fluttering</p><p>down its halyards. Then it stopped and </p><p>through his glass Captain Thome noted a </p><p>commotion on her decks. A figure broke </p><p>from a mob of men and fled down a hatch- </p><p>way. But the flag came on down to the deck. </p><p> “Cease firing!” ordered Thorne.</p><p> Suddenly the schooner seemed to split</p><p>apart as a gush of black smoke rushed up </p><p>from her amidships. A dull roar came over </p><p>the water and the smoke spread above a </p><p>flash of red while fragments of spars fell </p><p>slowly. There was a momentary vision </p><p>of the stern and bow of the schooner </p><p>plunging beneath the waves and then, as </p><p>the smoke drifted off before the wind, a few </p><p>blackened scraps of floating timber, a </p><p>struggling speck or two that vanished and </p><p>the career of the Scourge was ended. </p><p>Simon Hart, cheating the gallows, had </p><p>broken through his spirit-crushed men and </p><p>fired the remnants of the magazine. </p><p> Margaret Graeme, pale-faced, gazed</p><p>horror-struck at the spot where the Scourge </p><p>had vanished. Now the last hope of find- </p><p>ing Will was surely gone. Slowly, with </p><p>hanging head, she went below to the cabin </p><p>Thorne had assigned her, where the negress </p><p>sat with the babe. </p><p> She was still there, sick, despairing, when</p><p>a cry came from the mast-head. </p><p> Hardly discernible, a black dot showed</p><p>against the salmon of the sunset sky. The </p><p>Thetis shifted course and soon the dot </p><p>became a boat making steady headway </p><p>to the northwest under a lug sail. Closer </p><p>and closer the sloop came toward the tiny </p><p>craft until all aboard could see three men </p><p>in the stern and then a waving cloth. </p><p> “Mrs. Graeme, a miracle has happened,”</p><p>said Captain Thome. “Your husband and </p><p>his brothers are alongside.”</p><p> Margaret rose with shining eyes.</p><p> “An answer to prayer is not a miracle,</p><p>Captain Thorne,” she said. And, with her </p><p>babe in her arms, she went on deck. </p><p> “There must have been a hurricane</p><p>somewhere,” said Alec Graeme, “the kind </p><p>that comes before the rains arrive. Prob- </p><p>ably it destroyed the growth on some isle, </p><p>and it’s to be hoped there were none living </p><p>on it, but the drift brought the uprooted </p><p>palms to us and scattered five of them </p><p>along the beach. Two more we got by </p><p>wading off the point. Seven in all, close </p><p>to two hundred nuts, with nigh to half a </p><p>pint of life-saving liquor in each of them. </p><p>That saved us. Sheer luck, I call it.” </p><p> “Plus sheer pluck,” said Captain Thorne.</p><p> But Margaret Graeme, safe in her hus-</p><p>band’s wasted arms, knew otherwise. </p><p>DO YOU remember that several years ago </p><p>we suggest ed naming regiments instead </p><p>of numbering them, or in addition to num- </p><p>bering them? The idea is sound. Since </p><p>we’ve enlarged our Army, regiments and </p><p>divisions have frequently been given names. </p><p>It makes for esprit de corps. Also it is a </p><p>natural human impulse. </p><p> One of you who took up the idea was C. S.</p><p>Edmiston of Quitman, Mississippi, who sug- </p><p>gested a regiment of musicians. But he did </p><p>more than that. He went ahead and by his </p><p>own efforts organized a military band. That </p><p>band was accepted for service and, when I </p><p>heard from Mr. Edmiston, was stationed </p><p>with the 114th Engineer Regiment. He </p><p>himself was expecting a discharge because </p><p>of physical disability (his third honorable </p><p>discharge), but his band remains in service. </p><p>AN INTERESTING word from H. A. </p><p>Lamb concerning his story in this </p><p>issue. Mr. Lamb, like several others of </p><p>our writers’ brigade, is still able to furnish </p><p>us occasional stories though in the Army. </p><p> Alamut is not a creation of the author. It was</p><p>one of the four castles of the Refik. The latter are </p><p>more commonly known as the Ismail ians, a sect </p><p>that separated themselves from the other Moham- </p><p>medans. </p><p> A secret empire, wielding murderous power,</p><p>more powerful than the Knights Templars, the </p><p>Council of Twelve, or the Ku Klux Klan! The </p><p>“Old Man of the Mountain” a master of the </p><p>empire so feared by his subjects that two of them </p><p>threw themselves from the high walls of a castle </p><p>at the bidding of a priest in order to impress a </p><p>foreign envoy! A paradise so devilishly ingenious </p><p>that the warriors of the Refik threw away their </p><p>lives readily in order to return, as they supposed, </p><p>to the joys of the Ismailian paradise! </p><p>TpHESE were startling particulars, even for the </p><p>adventurous times of the thirteenth and </p><p>fourteenth centuries. They proved, however, to </p><p>be history and not legend. The dynasty of the </p><p>Assassins, as the rulers of Alamut were called, </p><p>holds its place among the kings of Persia. The </p><p>Old Man of the Mountains, who should more </p><p>correctly be called the Sheikh of the Mountains, </p><p>was known to travelers and historians from Marco </p><p>Polo to Mirkhond. As to the paradise, it is not </p><p>known whether its power for evil lay in the effects </p><p>of the drug hashish or in an actual scene of splendoi </p><p>and license.</p><p> The power of the Assassins was broken by Hulagu</p><p>Khan and his Tatars some two hundred and fifty </p><p>years before the time of Khlit, but nests of the </p><p>Ismailians survived until the end of the eighteenth </p><p>century, and as a religious sect the Ismailians </p><p>number many followers today—deprived, of course, </p><p>of the secret terror of their ancient daggers. </p><p>ANY one who can tell just what our </p><p>Camp-Fire is is wiser than I. On the </p><p>face of things it is merely an indefinite </p><p>something on paper only. Certainly there </p><p>is no definite organization of any kind—no </p><p>officers, no constitution or by-laws, no fees </p><p>or dues. A few unwritten rules but no </p><p>formalities of any kind. Any one belongs </p><p>who wishes to and he doesn’t need any help </p><p>in joining. </p><p> Our Camp-Fire’s general object is an in-</p><p>definite kind of good-fellowship and it pre- </p><p>tends to nothing except being the means </p><p>of swapping interesting experiences. Of </p><p>course our “Lost Trails,” “Ask Adventure” </p><p>and other free services are practical helps, </p><p>but in each of them the magazine is a neces- </p><p>sary factor. Our magazine avowedly tries </p><p>to help its readers when it can, but the </p><p>thing that always leaves me in doubt is the </p><p>relationship among the Camp-Fire mem- </p><p>bers themselves. Theoretically they are </p><p>under no obligations to each other. Theo- </p><p>retically they only read or write the letters </p><p>we have in our department of the magazine. </p><p>Theoretically they are acquainted only on </p><p>paper. </p><p> But the facts of the case? The facts</p><p>knock the theories sky-high. Again and </p><p>again and again I learn, here at this clear- </p><p>ing-house desk, of real friendships created </p><p>by our Camp-Fire. I am the richer by quite </p><p>Adventure </p><p> 174</p><p> a number of them myself. And here is a</p><p> letted (from one of you which speaks for itself:</p><p> To show the Camp-Fire what its members are like</p><p> I wish you would print this letter, without names or</p><p> identity, of course. Just say a Camp-Fire-ist had</p><p> his shack burgled and gutted, and got this letter</p><p> from another Camp-Firer. I only wish it was good</p><p> form to tell who he was. Of coursc, I didn’t need</p><p> the help, but oh, man! What a man he is to so</p><p> offer! Any lodge would ask me “Are your dues</p><p> paid up?” but he—I haven’t the words to tell what</p><p> he is. That is the old-time West exemplified in him.</p><p> The last sentence in his letter refers to three</p><p> notches in the butt of my .45 that he noticed but</p><p> was too tactful to ask about.</p><p> Following is the letter he enclosed and</p><p> asked to have returned to him. The two</p><p> men never heard of each other until they</p><p> got acquainted through our Camp-Fire.</p><p> I am coming at you head on, square as a brick,</p><p> with no evasion or dodging the issue. You would</p><p> take me in and feed me and sleep me and divide your</p><p> tobacco with me if I came along broke and down on</p><p> my luck. Now you give your friends the same</p><p> privilege.</p><p> OEND me a list of what you need most, with sizes,</p><p> descriptions, etc., and send it at once. I’ll be</p><p> teetotally jumped up if I am going to have you left</p><p>0	in such a plight. I have been studying how to help</p><p> in some way that would not hurt your feelings and</p><p> I have given up the struggle, believing that tbe best</p><p> way is to come at you like one man meeting an-</p><p> other. You and I are no women to hem and haw</p><p> over things. If we were trapping in partnership or</p><p> prospecting the same way, what one had both would</p><p> have. It don’t niake a-bit of difference if I am</p><p> here in an upper room and you out there. We have</p><p> got to look at this thing as though we slept under the</p><p> same blanket and ate out of the same frying-pan.</p><p> What do you need most? If it is underclothing,</p><p> what sizes? If it is socks too, what size? If it is</p><p> grub, what would you rather have? I’ve got a few</p><p> dollars in my kick and I’m not going to keep it there</p><p> and have you hungry or cold. Come through, old</p><p> man, come through!</p><p> TF THAT list does not get in here right soon I</p><p> shall steal some fellow’s auto and hike down</p><p> there to wallop you. I went to the hospital for a</p><p> big operation once, appendicitis, and had only</p><p> thirteen dollars to my name and a wife and three</p><p> children dependent on me. I was glad to have a</p><p> man slip me a hundred and say, “Pay it when you</p><p> get well.” I took it, of course I did, for it was no</p><p> worse to grab that than to grab a bit of plank some</p><p> one hove to me when I was drowning.</p><p> Don’t act squeamish now. If you had me as a pal</p><p> and ran out of plug, you would say, “Here, you big</p><p> stiff, whack up on that plug and when I get more I’ll</p><p> do the same.” I won’t eat an ounce less or have a</p><p> mite less on my back for helping you out of a hole.</p><p> OO	SPILL that list to me muy pronto, amigo, if you</p><p> want to remain amigo. Underclothes, socks,</p><p> grub, tobacco, whatever you need. I don’t want</p><p> you to do any funny stunt of letting pride get be-</p><p> tween us, any more than you would if we had</p><p> bunked together all over the coast. I know one</p><p> other man who feels just as I do and who will dig as</p><p> deep, so you are to tell the truth about your need</p><p> and quit your danged blushing like a kid girl.</p><p> ’Taint your fault that-robbed you.</p><p>Q’POSE you rode along a road and saw a house </p><p>burning down and some poor cuss in his shirt- </p><p>tail beside the road, all his clothes gone in the fire. </p><p>If you had some extra clothing along I reckon he'd </p><p>get in them right soon. Well, the dirty ladrones </p><p>were the fire and you are the victim beside the road. </p><p>Now don’t be dirty mean and refuse help that is </p><p>offered as freely as you would offer an extra coat in </p><p>such a case. If you do, well, just count that you </p><p>have slapped a friend’s face, and that without provo- </p><p>cation. That list and the sizes, pronloi </p><p> I shall expect that list by return mail.</p><p> I wish I could get hold of that guy you think has</p><p>your gun. I have a hunch that he would produce it </p><p>and squeal on the rest before I hit him more than </p><p>half a dozen times. If I had a car I would have gone </p><p>right down there as soon as I heard and if I did go </p><p>there I would sure labor with that cuss by force of </p><p>arms. Don’t you kill anybody unless you can prove </p><p>self defense. </p><p>JUT ERE is a letter with some big ideas. </p><p>*■ The general purpose is the real Ameri- </p><p>canization of naturalized citizens and the </p><p>prevention of strong alien allegiance among </p><p>those in this country who are not citizens, a </p><p>general purpose- which I indorse un-</p><p>qualifiedly. </p><p> As to barring the teaching of any foreign</p><p>language in our schools, there must be limi- </p><p>tations. If no Americans could speak French, </p><p>Spanish and other foreign languages it </p><p>would mean not only an immense com- </p><p>mercial, social, literary and scientific loss </p><p>but an increase in the provincialism that is </p><p>one of our national weaknesses. Even </p><p>from a military point of view a nation none </p><p>of whose people can speak the enemy lan- </p><p>guage is at a decided practical disadvantage, </p><p>to say nothing of ability to speak the lan- </p><p>guage of foreign allies. My own first im- </p><p>pulse was a desire to sweep all foreign </p><p>languages from our schools, but second </p><p>thought convinces most of us that the rem- </p><p>edy itself would be a calamity. </p><p>AND a needless calamity. Only the Ger- </p><p>man language is now a danger. In its </p><p>case I am for drastic measures. The other </p><p>languages are a different matter, one that </p><p>can safely be handled by wise limitations </p><p>and a more gradual treatment. As a first </p><p>step we might, for example, bar all lan- </p><p>guages as compulsory parts of any school </p><p>course, forbid the use in schools of any for- </p><p>eign language as the teaching language in any </p><p>The Camp-Fire </p><p>175 </p><p>subject except that language itself, and, per- </p><p>haps ban the teaching of any foreign language </p><p>in primary grades. These merely as sugges- </p><p>tions; the subject is far too complicated for </p><p>settlement in a few brief sentences. </p><p>BUT the German language is a case by </p><p>itself, a case in which the one pressing </p><p>necessity overrides academic arguments </p><p>and even consistency in according German </p><p>the same treatment as other languages. </p><p>The issue of the war is, at the date this is </p><p>written, still in doubt, but only a blind fool </p><p>can deny that up to 1918 military success </p><p>has been with the enemy. Their success </p><p>has been due to only four things—(1) mili- </p><p>tary and economic organization and pre- </p><p>paredness, (2) unity of command in the </p><p>hands of trained soldiers, (3) sacrifice of </p><p>right to might, of humanity and decency to </p><p>brute efficiency and, at least as important </p><p>as any of the other reasons, (4) systematic </p><p>propaganda at home and abroad. </p><p> We have been inclined to view this fourth</p><p>reason, German propaganda, as bad but not </p><p>as vital. Yet if you analyze the German </p><p>success down to its very fundamentals and </p><p>beginnings you find that systematic propa- </p><p>ganda has been their most important weapon. </p><p>It began several generations ago in Ger- </p><p>many itself, the systematic, governmental </p><p>education of the German people into effi- </p><p>cient, carefully shaped cogs in the great </p><p>Hun machine of brute force. The second </p><p>step was the planting of Germans in other </p><p>countries, notably Russia, the United </p><p>States and Latin America, generally as citi- </p><p>zens of these countries but always held to </p><p>Germany and Germany’s interests by the </p><p>invisible steel chains of German propa- </p><p>ganda. The third step was the building up </p><p>among these hospitable peoples of senti- </p><p>ments advantageous to Germany’s inter- </p><p>ests and particularly the fomenting and </p><p>encouraging of any and all kinds of internal </p><p>differences and strife among these peoples </p><p>that would weaken them against the day </p><p>when Germany would be ready to strike. </p><p>THERE was no chance in all this. No </p><p>luck. No accident. Nothing but a </p><p>coldly, carefully worked-out definite plan of </p><p>tremendous size. And the whole sum and </p><p>substance of that plan, the very heart of it,</p><p>was Hun propaganda and education. Sub- </p><p>tle, delicate, psychological, invisible and </p><p>almost unsuspected. When sometimes we </p><p>noticed a silken thread of the great Hun web </p><p>we failed to realize that it was not silk but </p><p>steel. Almost no one realized that the little </p><p>thread was part of a vast, world-choking </p><p>web of evil Hun ambition. </p><p> Even now Americans fail to give this web</p><p>a hundredth part of its real importance. </p><p>We are still enmeshed in it, our every effort </p><p>more or less crippled by its barely visible </p><p>throttling grip. It is not just a crude mat- </p><p>ter of spies and property destroyers in our </p><p>midst. That is merely ordinary enemy </p><p>activity—mere child’s play compared to the </p><p>less visible instruments, and not half so </p><p>serious. Spies and bombs produce quick </p><p>results; these more subtle instruments may </p><p>not produce results for years or generations, </p><p>but their results arc infinitely more danger- </p><p>ous to us and—more permanent. </p><p> It would take years and volumes to</p><p>specify all the tiny and various means em- </p><p>ployed, but as a whole they can be quickly </p><p>gaged by considering the central Hun ma- </p><p>chine at Berlin that for years and years has </p><p>been systematically spinning this silk- </p><p>steel web. Do you know that at Berlin </p><p>there is a regular and permanent govern- </p><p>ment department officially called “The </p><p>Bureau of Enemy Psychology”? Stop read- </p><p>ing a minute and think what that means. </p><p>WE PRIDE ourselves on being a “prac- </p><p>tical” people. We believe in driving </p><p>at main results by direct paths. We are </p><p>commercial and industrial; labor, material, </p><p>capital, transportation, these we consider </p><p>the “practical” factors. We belong to the </p><p>“want results,” “show me,” “ain’t no such </p><p>animal” class. It is things, not ideas, that </p><p>we handle and believe in. The most patri- </p><p>otic thing I can say is that we are - </p><p>fools. No thing ever existed that was not </p><p>first an idea or that can not be shaped and </p><p>controlled by ideas. The average Ameri- </p><p>can business man believes nothing is “prac- </p><p>tical” unless he can feel it with his fingers </p><p>or enter it on the pages of a ledger. And </p><p>thereby proves himself an infant in swad- </p><p>dling-clothes, or an adult imbecile. And all </p><p>the rest of us are a good deal like him. </p><p>Wherefore the Hun, who, for all his brutish-</p><p>ness, is intelligent enough to understand </p><p>that ideas are more important and more </p><p>practical than things, has been able to en- </p><p>tangle us in a net whose strength is almost </p><p>wholly psychological. </p><p> The Hun wove this kind of net because he</p><p>176	Adventure</p><p>knew that to control the ideas of men is to </p><p>control every concrete thing that men </p><p>possess. We let him “get away with it” </p><p>because we were too drunk with our childish </p><p>delusion that only things were “practical.” </p><p>* 11HE Hun is so alive to the value of his </p><p>psychological net that he guards from </p><p>publicity its very existence; he has pre- </p><p>vailed thus far solely because of it and he </p><p>knows that if we begin to realize the im- </p><p>portance of that net his immediate and his </p><p>ultimate hopes are dead. I have heard </p><p>that any one who sees the psychological net </p><p>and tries to warn his fellows will be marked </p><p>down by the Hun machine and quieted or— </p><p>removed. Probably you and I differ be- </p><p>cause you do not believe that and I consider </p><p>it very possible. God knows that if I knew </p><p>more of the inside, definite details I’d gladly </p><p>shout them from the house-tops. I do not </p><p>know them, but I can see the web; the de- </p><p>tails are important only as a means for </p><p>making you see it. If I can make any see 'it </p><p>who have not seen it hitherto I do not mind </p><p>seeming silly and childish to the rest of you </p><p>by suggesting that, if any calamity “hap- </p><p>pens” to drop on me after this is published, </p><p>said “accident” might be taken as tending </p><p>to prove the very point I wish to make. </p><p>T~\OUBTLESS most of you will consider </p><p>■I—1" merely silly and fantastic the report </p><p>that German thoroughness and understand- </p><p>ing of psychological values has led them to </p><p>install at Berlin a little corps of men </p><p>steeped in the psychological wisdom of </p><p>India, adepts in human “mysteries” laughed </p><p>at by the “practical” Western world, and </p><p>that hypnotism on an international scale is </p><p>one of the weapons systematically used by </p><p>the Hun machine. Personally I do not </p><p>consider it silly and fantastic; it may not be </p><p>true, and yet it may. Certainly it is in </p><p>keeping with German methods, and I am </p><p>not fool enough to laugh it off the boards </p><p>merely because I can’t pinch it with my fin- </p><p>gers. In any case it is a perfect example of </p><p>the kind of net they have been spinning for </p><p>generations. </p><p>r 1 'HIS (to come back to our letter) is why </p><p>I am strong for drastic action against </p><p>the German language in our schools, for </p><p>that and publications in German are an </p><p>essential part of the Hun web. The letter’s </p><p>suggestion that German be barred from all</p><p>our primary schools seems to hit at the </p><p>heart of the matter, but the remedy should </p><p>go further. For example, no German </p><p>course should be open at any time to any </p><p>child of German parentage or birth. </p><p> As to the German press there is only one</p><p>safe argument against suppressing it at </p><p>least during the war—the plea that loyal </p><p>publications in German can be of value in </p><p>creating American loyalty among Germans. </p><p>I do not belive this argument is sufficient. </p><p>TN GENERAL, Mr. Sexton’s letter is </p><p>based on the principle that no one is fit </p><p>to be a citizen of the United States unless he </p><p>is fully able to speak the language of the </p><p>United States, fully able to transact all the </p><p>business of a citizen of the United States in </p><p>the language of the United States. A </p><p>sound principle and a truth so elementary </p><p>that we seem very stupid in being so long in </p><p>seeing that truth. Any organization in </p><p>support of this would be good, but it is to be </p><p>remembered that there is already a strong </p><p>organization working along similar lines— </p><p>the American Defense Society, 44 East </p><p>23d Street, New York City, N. Y. </p><p> This is Mr. Sexton’s letter; he can be ad-</p><p>dressed in our care. </p><p> Dear Sir:—I propose the formation of “The</p><p>American Language League.” Objects: (a) Enact- </p><p>ment of legislation (with concurrent development of </p><p>public sentiment) to prohibit the teaching of any </p><p>alien language in any primary school, whether pub- </p><p>lic or private, (b) The suppression, so far as pos- </p><p>sible, of daily newspapers published in an alien </p><p>tongue (whether or not they print parallel columns </p><p>in English), (c) The Americanization of immi- </p><p>grants as quickly and completely as possible by pro- </p><p>viding facilities for learning the English language </p><p>and encouragement to make use of said facilities, </p><p>(d) Legislation limiting the rights of aliens to vote </p><p>to such of them as can read and write and speak </p><p>English fluently, (e) The development of a senti- </p><p>ment hostile to organizations designed to keep alive </p><p>the interest of foreigners in alien governments, cus- </p><p>toms and institutions. </p><p> But the one weapon of sharp steel wherewith to</p><p>fight alien intrigue is—language. It is because this </p><p>is so true that the German Government through its </p><p>agents in America fights so hard to retain the Ger- </p><p>man language in the daily life of our people. Re- </p><p>move it and the Kaiser goes with its removal. You</p><p>can not have a real American country unless the </p><p>members thereof think exclusively in the American </p><p>language and approach other languages as they ap- </p><p>proach Greek or Latin or as they learn some modem </p><p>and unfamiliar language in the years of youth or </p><p>manhood as an elective study. </p><p> If some of the “Adventurers” started such an or-</p><p>ganization I believe it would quickly acquire many </p><p>thousands in members.

The loss of a bit of blood will do me a </p><p>lot of good. I’m lucky it was my left hand.” </p><p> And there you have an epitome of life. One</p><p>always happy, always lucky, the other a poor </p><p>afflicted being, mourning and moaning. A pessi- </p><p>mist and a philosopher. The two extremes. </p><p>TJOMANCE and Fun are all around. Yester- </p><p>day, while riding off a bit of ill-temper, I ran </p><p>across a house of sadness. A woman of some </p><p>thirty years had lost her daughter, who was washed, </p><p>clothed in her cerements, and awaiting the ultimate </p><p>offices. </p><p> The grief-stricken mother was seated on the dirt</p><p>floor, giving loud tongue to her affliction. A peri- </p><p>patetic pedler and I arrived simultaneously. I </p><p>dismounted to condole with the sufferer, as is right </p><p>and proper, and expected of every one. Meantime </p><p>the pedler spread his wares on a temporary bench </p><p>which he had erected, using a cedar plank, one end </p><p>on an abardo (native saddle) and the other sup- </p><p>ported on the prone body of a drunk. A most </p><p>satisfactory display counter indeed. </p><p> “At, Mother of God, Virgen del Carmen, se me fue</p><p>mi muchachila, my child is gone. My poor heart </p><p>is breaking. Have mercy, O God, on a poor suffer- </p><p>ing mother. Cuanto vale la cinta rosada, seftor? </p><p>(What price the red ribbon, sir?) Ai, Dios, que</p><p>dolor! (God! what suffering!) I’ll give you a real </p><p>the vara. Socorreme, Dios (Save me, God!). </p><p>Are you carrying silk handkerchiefs? Ai, Madre </p><p>Sanctissima—” and at this juncture the outside leg </p><p>of the bench woke up, gave a heave, in two senses </p><p>of the word, upset the apple-cart and presented his </p><p>breakfast—or supper, mayhap—to the reluctant </p><p>pedler. About this time I made a hurried de- </p><p>parture to save my face. And yet they say ’tis a </p><p>solemn world. </p><p>T HAD a nice letter from -, and I think </p><p> we’ll strike up a friendship after our little spat.</p><p>You surely stirred up the dog when you forwarded </p><p>mine to him.

I don’t. </p><p>Neither does any one else on the staff. </p><p>Further, the staff changes from time to </p><p>time and a comparatively green man re- </p><p>places one who had begun to learn the </p><p>things we have to try to learn in this </p><p>particular office. Yet again, no one man, </p><p>no two men, can copy-read and proof-read </p><p>every story that goes into the magazine. </p><p>Even if one or two of us knew all about </p><p>firearms, it wouldn’t insure against mis- </p><p>takes. Most of our writers are pretty well </p><p>up on firearms personally, but even this </p><p>additional check is not enough to prevent </p><p>a mistake now and then. </p><p>YOU, readers, can help, as you have in </p><p>the past, by pointing out mistakes if </p><p>we make them. Help comes after the mis- </p><p>take is made, but it tends to prevent simi- </p><p>lar mistakes in the future. Recently there </p><p>came a letter from Lloyd F. Brown of the </p><p>A llerton (Iowa) News covering an accumu- </p><p>lation of our past sins. At least part of the </p><p>points he made I already knew, but they </p><p>were made just the same. His letter did two </p><p>things. First, it made us resolve to get as </p><p>full and detailed information on firearms </p><p>as possible for reference here in the office.</p><p>Second, it made me see that this informa- </p><p>tion would be both interesting.and valuable </p><p>to most of you. There’s quite a lot of it, </p><p>even in condensed form, but it follows here </p><p>just as it came in to us and I know most of </p><p>you’ll have a good time with it. Here is </p><p>the letter from Mr. Brown: </p><p>I noticed in the Camp-Fire talks that you say </p><p>you welcome any suggestions that tend to make </p><p>Adventure better, which, of course, is right. Well, </p><p>here are a couple, small matters, to be sure, that </p><p>don’t really have any effect on the stories but which </p><p>would make them sound more realistic:. </p><p>In the first place, I see in stories now and then </p><p>references made to .41 and .44 caliber automatics. </p><p>There is no such thing as a .41 or .44 automatic pistol, </p><p>the only automatic calibers now made being .22, .25, </p><p>.30, .32, .35, .38, .45. Knowing this, the discrep- </p><p>ancies mentioned above are very jarring to me. </p><p>Also, there is reference made in a story in your </p><p>last issue of a man shooting an automatic and the </p><p>gun simply screaming as it poured its bullets forth. </p><p>An automatic does not fire more than one shot to a </p><p>trigger-pull and no one can work one fast enough </p><p>to make the mechanism scream, or anywhere near </p><p>it; and I might state that revolvers can and have </p><p>been fired faster than any automatic ever was. </p><p>It (the story) makes mention of the delicate trig- </p><p>ger, evidently meaning light trigger-pull. No auto- </p><p>matic has a light trigger-pull, all having stiffer pulls </p><p>than a revolver, as to make them light would be </p><p>to cause the probable death of the operator from </p><p>premature explosion caused from the jarring off of </p><p>the arm from the reaction of the slide. </p><p>Also, I hate to read about “automatic revolvers.” </p><p>“There ain’t no such animal.” An automatic is </p><p>either a pistol or a machine gun, and no revolver is </p><p>automatic. Also, if any one thinks he can shoot </p><p>an automatic under water he’d better take my </p><p>advice and not try it. Ht; might not get hurt, but </p><p>the chances are he would. </p><p>Also, in the last issue there is a story in which a </p><p>man has an automatic under water in a lake, dives </p><p>for it and, coming to the surface, shoots his man, </p><p>and later states that they (the automatics) work </p><p>all right when wet. Well, they may work all </p><p>right when wet, and would fire the first shot all </p><p>right, but unless the water had time to nm out </p><p>of the slide-spring recess and the magazine and </p><p>the barrel they wouldn’t function for the second </p><p>shot. </p><p>I know all of the above, having tried them all</p><p>with the exception of shooting the gun under </p><p>water. I wrote two pistol factories about it and </p><p>I78 </p><p>I </p><p>Firearms, Old and New	179</p><p>they told me most emphatically not to try it, as </p><p>t would unquestionably be disastrous. Have owned </p><p>several of eveiy model and make and caliber of </p><p>revolver and pistol obtainable in this country and </p><p>a few not obtainable here.—Lloyd F. Brown. </p><p> I wrote to Mr. Brown and in reply came</p><p>the following interesting letter: </p><p> I am glad to see that you took the suggestions</p><p>I made in the spirit in which they were intended. </p><p>I can appreciate your position as to proof-readers, </p><p>etc., as I am a newspaper man. </p><p> Your idea as to arranging a list of firearms of</p><p>the different makes and calibers of arms is a good </p><p>one, but this subject is a pretty extensive one. I </p><p>have noticed that most discrepancies in this line </p><p>arc made as to revolvers and automatic pistols and </p><p>their respective calibers and possibilities. It is </p><p>truly wonderful the things writers can do with </p><p>small arms. </p><p> Most of them seem to have the idea that auto-</p><p>matic pistols fire their whole magazines by simply </p><p>holding back the trigger. This, as I pointed out in </p><p>my previous letter, is not the case. It can be done </p><p>by filing off or removing the safety-sear which regu- </p><p>lates this, but it would probably be disastrous to </p><p>the party holding the arm. Automatics have a </p><p>sharp recoil, public opinion to the contrary not- </p><p>withstanding; and, as each shot throws the muzzle </p><p>up a little more, the last few shots would no doubt </p><p>shoot the shooter in the head. An automatic can </p><p>not be held rigidly solid, even the smaller calibers, </p><p>because of the lightning-like shifting of balance and </p><p>recoil. One must brace the hand for the back- </p><p>ward plunge of the action-slide and then brace in </p><p>the other direction for the forward plunge of the </p><p>same, which can not be done, as the action is too </p><p>rapid. Also, it has somewhat the effect of an </p><p>electric shock. I once fired three shots from a </p><p>.32-caliber Colt automatic which had been treated </p><p>to act like a machine gun. I put only three car- </p><p>tridges in the arm, as I knew how the gun would </p><p>act and I wanted it to stop shooting by the time </p><p>it was pointed straight up, at least, and the result </p><p>was that I felt as if I had grasped a live wire. </p><p> I am enclosing a list of the makes, models and</p><p>calibers of small arms obtainable in this country, </p><p>which may be of some use to you. If so you are </p><p>welcome toil. I can make a list of the makes and </p><p>calibers of rifles if you wish, though this is such an </p><p>extensive subject that I don’t know all of it. I am, </p><p>however, acquainted with practically all the makes </p><p>used in tlite country.</p><p> The Smith &amp; Wesson Arms Company are now</p><p>making a revolver to handle the .45 Colt auto- </p><p>matic pistol cartridge, but, as they are for the use </p><p>of the Army only and will not be for sale to the </p><p>trade for at least a year to come, I will not list this </p><p>caliber in the revolvers.—Lloyd F. Brown. </p><p> Here is the list Mr. Brown inclosed.</p><p>Many of you know most or all of it already, </p><p>but to any one the list as an assembled </p><p>whole has decided value: </p><p> First, I wish to state that there is no such thing</p><p>as an automatic revolver.

You under-</p><p> stand that the small-caliber arms are all small arms</p><p> and the large calibers are all large arms.</p><p> Now I had also written, on receiving Mr.</p><p> Brown’s first letter, to our old friend D.</p><p> Wiggins, of Salem, Oregon, asking whether</p><p> I couldn’t arrange with him to cover the</p><p> whole subject in considerable detail. He</p><p> rose to the occasion splendidly in the fol-</p><p> lowing letter:</p><p>Salem, Ore. </p><p> I received your letter of the 23rd in due time,</p><p> and have read the letter of Mr. Brown with very</p><p> great interest.</p><p> His list of American automatics is very complete,</p><p> but there is a correction to be made: the H. &amp; R.</p><p> .25 automatic has been suspended. Other than</p><p> this I do not know of a single difference in the list</p><p> he sent.</p><p> The automatic is, in my opinion at least, just a</p><p>man-wounder at short range. From what I can </p><p>leam of the various makes, they are not the equal </p><p>of the heavy lead bullets of the big revolvers, say, </p><p>die Colt and Smith &amp; Wesson .44’s and ,45’s. </p><p> As to the automatic only firing one shot at each</p><p>trigger-pull, B. is exactly right. And I have never </p><p>seen any automatic fired as fast as a good revolver </p><p>can be shot, either. </p><p> Of course when they are not in good order, as he</p><p>suggests, they are dangerous to handle. Witness: </p><p>history sayeth that the first self-loader ever brought </p><p>into Oklahoma Territory was a .38 Colt automatic </p><p>pistol. It was brought as a sample by a drummer </p><p>for a Chicago hardware firm. He was exhibiting it </p><p>in a hotel lobby at Muskogee, I. T., and Bud </p><p>Ledbetter, the U. S. Marshal for the Creek Nation, </p><p>was watching him demonstrate it. As Bud is </p><p>reputed to have caused something like thirty-eight </p><p>bad citizens to leave this vale of tears with their </p><p>boots on, he was doubtless trying to wise up on</p><p>new methods of law enforcement. </p><p> Well, the spatter-gun commenced to give a fine</p><p>exhibition of a Maxim and the populace is reported </p><p>as wearing window-sashes home for neck ornaments. </p><p>The cigar salesman at his booth ducked his head </p><p>just in time to have a bullet put a permanent part </p><p>in his hair. The drummer held on to the gun for the </p><p>first few shots, like one dazed, as he may well have </p><p>been. At last he dropped the spitfire on the floor </p><p>and it fired twice more, spinning like a lop. Bud </p><p>picked the weapon up and, as the drummer refused </p><p>ever to touch it again, he kept it, and just before </p><p>I left the State he killed four or five colored mem- </p><p>bers of a criminal organization with it. An exami- </p><p>nation of the mechanism by a gunsmith showed the </p><p>nose of the sear to have been broken oil in some </p><p>unknown manner. </p><p> I can shoot as well with an automatic as I ever</p><p>saw any one shoot, and I must say that if my man </p><p>were over ten yards from me I would never try to </p><p>get him in a hurry with one of those guns. Ed L. </p><p>Carson was writing when he wrote: </p><p>“When a maverick starts a-millin’ </p><p>Or a bad man needs a-killin’ </p><p> Let me grab my good old-fashioned forty-five.”</p><p> As to the flying-up propensities of the automatic</p><p>I am not able to state, as my chief trouble with </p><p>them was always to get the muzzle high enough to </p><p>hit within a foot of where I wanted the bullet to </p><p>land.—Donegan Wiggins. </p><p> And here is the “dope” itself. Mr. Wig-</p><p>gins has not only given us facts but he’s </p><p>put an amazing amount of color into them. </p><p>I’ll venture that both the tenderfoot and </p><p>the crankiest gun-crank of you all will have </p><p>a pretty good time reading it: </p><p>Salem, Ore. </p><p> Well, the rough draft is inclosed. Look it over,</p><p>give me the points that you wish to have me go </p><p>over with more care, and then I will stir myself. </p><p> As I have been working at this at all times of</p><p>the day and night, it is apt to be a rather crude </p><p>document, both as regards spelling and arrange- </p><p>ment, not to mention the way ye olde mille balls </p><p>Firearms, Old and New </p><p>181 </p><p>up once in a blue moon. However, I think you </p><p>will be able to get the general drift. You once </p><p>spoke of having given the once-over to a manuscript </p><p>written on a rattlesnake skin. </p><p> This is, of course, not complete. That will take</p><p> considerable time. This is just to give you a ready</p><p> reference for the office to use. For instance, John</p><p> Jones alludes to a Winchester automatic pistol,</p><p> when there ain’t no such animal. Or to Captain</p><p> Kidd defending his life with a six-shooter.</p><p> However, most of the contributes get their gun</p><p>material so correct that it does not appear to need </p><p>much of the blue pencil. </p><p> I especially enjoy the articles by the Associate</p><p> Editors in the back pages, and their answers to cor-</p><p> respondents. Mr. Harriman is especially interest-</p><p> ing to me, as I have been over a certain amount of</p><p> the same ground as he. When I get rich (?) I’m</p><p> going down to the Golden State to live once more.</p><p> It’s a relief to a gun-crank like the writer to</p><p>get a magazine like Adventure to read, one that is </p><p>not written by a bunch of weak sisters that sit in </p><p>a sunny window and write about wonder! ul young </p><p>women who drive wicked outlaws out of the towns </p><p>at the point of a .22 bulldog, as some of the </p><p>present scribes would fain pass out to us in other </p><p>publications.—D. Wiggins. </p><p>Firearms, Past and Present </p><p> The origin of firearms and explosives is wrapped</p><p> in mystery. It is supposed that the Carthaginians</p><p> used blasting compounds, but nothing is certainly</p><p> known. It is recorded that the inhabitants of a</p><p> town in India repulsed the troops of Alexander with</p><p> flames and thunders. Greek fire was a well-known</p><p> war engine of the Middle Ages, supposed to have</p><p> been naphtha.</p><p> Gunpowder appears to have come from the Far</p><p>Eastern countries, Korea or China. There is no </p><p>record of the first use of guns, but it is conceded </p><p>that the Celestials were in possession of the secret </p><p>of the smoking weapons as early as the seventh </p><p>century, A. d. </p><p> The invention of gunpowder in Europe is ascribed</p><p> to a friar, one Roger Bacon, who was so progressive</p><p> that I am surprised that he was not attended to by</p><p> the Inquisition as a wizard. Berthold Schwartz</p><p> also was raising Cain and smoke about the same</p><p> time, so we do not know to whom William S. Hart</p><p> is most deeply indebted.</p><p> It is said that the English used cannon at Crficy,</p><p> but the credit for the victory is due to the long bow</p><p> in the hands of the English yeomen. Firearms did</p><p> not play much of a part in war till the beginning</p><p> ’ of the sixteenth century, as till that time the bow</p><p> had a greater range. The shoulder arms seem to</p><p> have appeared about 1485. They were a novelty.</p><p> The gun was in its element in the conquest of the</p><p> Americas. The natives regarded the wielders as</p><p> gods. Said belief was soon shattered by a short</p><p> observation of the actions of the newcomers.</p><p> It is recorded that Cortez had three breech-</p><p>loaders in his campaign in Mexico. They were a </p><p>crude ty^e of wedge breech, and could be loaded </p><p>very fast, but were not very strong on velocity and </p><p>penetration. </p><p> All firearms up to this time had been the match-</p><p> lock, so called from the fact that the charge was</p><p> ignited by the flash of the powder in a shallow</p><p> flash-pan on the breech of the barrel. The flame</p><p> was communicated through a small hole in the</p><p>barrel, the powder in the pan being ignited by the </p><p>slow match carried by the soldier. </p><p> The arm was loaded as follows: First, the powder</p><p>was poured in the muzzle and a wad placed over </p><p>and rammed down on the powder. Then a ball </p><p>was inserted, sometimes wrapped in a greased patch, </p><p>but more often not. This was rammed down, </p><p>and then the cover of the flash-pan was raised, </p><p>and a little priming powder poured in the pan, </p><p>the cover then being let down upon it. </p><p> The great objections to the matchlock were that</p><p>it was visible at night, it was liable to be extin- </p><p>guished by wet weather, and it was apt to be fired </p><p>by a high wind blowing the powder on to the </p><p>spark. </p><p> The wheellock came about 1525, from Nurem-</p><p>berg. It was manipulated in the same manner as </p><p>the matchlock, with the difference that the firing </p><p>was by sparks caused by the action of a toothed </p><p>wheel on a bit of flint held by the lock over the pan. </p><p>It was a great improvement over the matchlock. </p><p> A curious tale is told of the Thirty Years’ War: A</p><p>detachment of the Swedish troops of Gustavus </p><p>Adolphus was besieging a town held by the Aus- </p><p>trians. The latter surrendered one morning, say-</p><p>ing that the great reinforcement received by the </p><p>Swedes made resistance hopeless. They had seen </p><p>the glowing matches, they said. The Swede com- </p><p>mander was loo foxy to let on that the supposed </p><p>army was a swarm of fireflies. Who said “Square- </p><p>head”? </p><p> The flintlock supplanted the preceding ones about</p><p>1675. It is the invention of a bunch of Dutch - </p><p>brigands who were in the habit of eloping with </p><p>their neighbors’ fowls. Not necessarily the neigh- </p><p>bors’ “chickens.” This gentle practise gave them </p><p>the name of “Snaphanns,” and the term became </p><p>“Snaphaunce.” The wheellock was a rich man’s </p><p>tool; the honest robber was forced to extemporize </p><p>something that a watchful hen-owner couldn’t see </p><p>after dark. He did it. </p><p> The flintlock was made by all the gunmakers of</p><p>the day, but the English probably made the best </p><p>ones. I have read that a great London maker by </p><p>the name of Joseph Manton finally reached such a </p><p>pinnacle of perfection that his locks were capable of </p><p>eighty per cent, of fires. Most of the flintlocks </p><p>giving forty to sixty per cent. The flintlock also </p><p>was difficult to use, as there was an appreciable </p><p>pause before the shot due to the slowness of the </p><p>ignition of the powder in the barrel from the powder </p><p>in the pan. </p><p> The American rifle was the finest development</p><p>of the flintlock, and to the skill of the frontiersman </p><p>with his Deckard is due our national pride in shoot- </p><p>ing today. Also our independence. </p><p> In 1807 a Scots clergyman invented the percus-</p><p>sion system of ignition and revolutionized firearms. </p><p>At first the explosive mixture was in the form of a </p><p>small pill. This gave the guns using them the name </p><p>of “pill-locks.” Soon the familiar—to our daddies </p><p>—form of percussion cap came and the rainstorm </p><p>had no more terrors for hunter or soldier. </p><p> ’Tis said that Napoleon offered Forsyth the sum</p><p>of $50,000 for his invention, but the patriotic domi- </p><p>nie refused. He offered his invention to the British </p><p>Government, who treated him with scorn, and only </p><p>was won to the right view in time to pay a few </p><p>thousand dollars after his death. Truly, the way </p><p>of the inventor is hard, and if he’s a patriot it is </p><p>still rougher. </p><p>182 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> In 1836 Colt placed on the market bis world-</p><p>famous revolver, and in the hands of the citizenry </p><p>of the Texas republic it won fame. If we had old </p><p>Sam with us today to produce equally record- </p><p>breaking weapons we would lead K. Ii. up Broad- </p><p>way in chains. He was the man, more than any </p><p>other, who made possible the rapid expansion of </p><p>the United States in the years 1840-1890. As we </p><p>read that he was a man of a most violent temper, </p><p>I think that he was trying to fix up something </p><p>faster than a single-shot pistol or a Bowie knife </p><p>for his intercourse with his opponents. Probably </p><p>couldn’t kill ’em off fast enough with the existing </p><p>armament. John M. Browning is his modem type, </p><p>as to ingenuity. </p><p> Whitney in about 1820 devised the method of</p><p>making arms by machinery to such an extent that </p><p>all parts of the same kind were interchangeable. </p><p>This was a big step in the right direction, as pre- </p><p>viously all broken guns were a matter for expensive </p><p>hand work by the individual gunsmith. </p><p> Guns having a heavy barrel were used with both</p><p>ball and shot in countries where a different type of </p><p>game might be met. India, for instance. </p><p> Three-barreled guns were also well liked, and</p><p>four barrels were not unknown to sportsmen. </p><p> The first repeater, as we now know it, was the</p><p>Volcanic, appearing about 1806. It was a crude </p><p>weapon, and was not a great success. The Henry, </p><p>1860, and the Spencer, 1863, were much better </p><p>arms in every sense of the word. </p><p> Winchesters first appeared in 1806 and have been</p><p>with us since. Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers came </p><p>about 1856. </p><p> Since that time the advance has been too rapid</p><p>to catalogue. The Sharps, Remington, Winchester, </p><p>Ballard, Hotchkiss and others have made more his- </p><p>tory than any of our readers are likely ever to see. </p><p>About all of the real wild life of the globe seems to </p><p>have been tamed, except for spots like Mexico, </p><p>Tibet, and the present disturbance accross the </p><p>herring-pond. That can not rightly be termed a </p><p>bit of aboriginal deviltry; it’s highly civilized; liquid </p><p>fire, gas, non-combatants tortured and slain, etc. </p><p>How Geronimo must revolve in his grave with envy! </p><p> Roughly speaking, flintlocks up to 1820, per-</p><p>cussion to 1860, revolvers to date from 1836, </p><p>breech-loaders from 1860, repeaters the same. Au-</p><p>tomatics from 1899 to date, the old Borchart and </p><p>French arms not being known to any great extent. </p><p>I think the Borchart was invented in 1893. It </p><p>was a funny-looking thing, looking like a letter “T” </p><p>with a short upright. </p><p> So if any one tries to run anything in before these</p><p>dates you may consider him either a gun-crank of </p><p>the thirty-second degree, or a faker. In the latter </p><p>case I think you had better draw the editor's faith- </p><p>ful weapon, the printers’ towel, and assassinate him </p><p>on the spot. See E. Wilson Nye for details. </p><p> As to some tricks that will naturally drop into</p><p>stories. The double roll was done by hanging the </p><p>old single-action Colt's revolver on the forefinger </p><p>and whirling it over rapidly. If the roller was </p><p>expert and the mainspring was not too strong the </p><p>revolver would cock and fire itself by its own </p><p>weight, the thumb catching the hammer in its </p><p>revolution, and the trigger being pulled by the </p><p>gun’s weight coming on it as the roll brought it over. </p><p> Fanning was a great favorite with some of the</p><p>more spectacular of the old gun-fighters, but I </p><p>never knew positively of but one man killed by the </p><p>trick. The Colt was held in the right hand, low </p><p>down by the right side, the trigger held back, and </p><p>the hammer slapped swiftly by the left hand; the </p><p>result was a stunning volley of shots that rarely </p><p>hit anybody. </p><p> The road-agent spin was done by presenting the</p><p>weapon to a captor upon the palm of the open hand </p><p>and, as he reached to pick it up, it was whirled </p><p>over and discharged. Many a good officer was </p><p>killed in this manner, which is attributed to Billy </p><p>the Kid. </p><p> Many gun-fighters removed the trigger from the</p><p>old Colt single-action completely; some tied it back, </p><p>snapping the gun with the hammer only. It was </p><p>quick and picturesque. </p><p> A modem double-action can be fired quicker than</p><p>any automatic I have ever seen, and I am not </p><p>exactly without experience in that line. I think a </p><p>man in Denver, McCutcheon, has fired his Smith &amp; </p><p>Wesson in one second for five shots. How’s that </p><p>for a .38 Special, all on a man-size target? </p><p> The automatic will not fire more than one shot</p><p>at each pull of the trigger, unless there is some </p><p>defect in the gun. This does not apply to machine </p><p>guns, of course. </p><p> As to fancy shooting, no one can with certainty</p><p>tell just what can be done. I have done a little in </p><p>my time, and have seen some really fine work with </p><p>both rifle and revolver. Such men as Toeperwine </p><p>and Gus Peret can do things with a rifle or revolver </p><p>that you would brand as impossible, till you had </p><p>seen them shoot. Gus, for instance, will hold his </p><p>revolver upside down and beat the best that 1 can </p><p>do shooting in regular fashion, while I in turn can </p><p>trim die average shot in the same manner. </p><p> I have heard of one desperado who terrorized the</p><p>Northwestern border some years back. He was </p><p>reputed to have killed about half a dozen of the </p><p>Northwest Mounted. He was said to be able to </p><p>lay a rifle across his arm and, while working the </p><p>lever and shooting with deadly certainty, to be able </p><p>to feed cartridges into the magazine through the </p><p>loading gate in the side of the frame while keeping </p><p>up a steady fire. This with a Winchester, of course. </p><p> There is an old rifle with a history in a drug-store</p><p>in Baker, Oregon. It is an old 1873 Winchester and </p><p>was found on a bluff overlooking upper Powder </p><p>River, rusted into an unrecognizable mass. It was </p><p>finally cleaned up so that we could identify it. It </p><p>lay under a skeleton that had a bullet-hole squarely </p><p>between the eyes, and the remains of about fifty </p><p>cartridge-heads lay around. Probably a lone miner </p><p>or cowboy who had been driven there by the In- </p><p>dians and made a game stand. Or it may have </p><p>been a cattle rustler; there have been some queer </p><p>things done on the edge of the land. I tried to get </p><p>the gun, but the owner will not part with it. </p><p> Now as to machine guns. As I said before, I</p><p>don’t know as much now as I will in a short time, </p><p>but Uien I won’t be allowed to talk, I presume. </p><p> Here in America there are the Colt, Savage, Lewis</p><p>and the B6net-Mercier. The latter is the service </p><p>gun, and won the dislike of all soldiers by the way </p><p>it jams at a crucial time. It is claimed, and prob- </p><p>ably with truth, that if one of the two guns in </p><p>barracks at Columbus had not.jammed they would </p><p>not have had the orders to get him “dead or alive.” </p><p>He would have been dead already. </p><p> The English use a variety of guns; I recall the</p><p>Maxim, the Hotchkiss, the Lewis, the B. S. A., and </p><p>many others. Most of the machine guns now in </p><p>Firearms, Old and New	183</p><p>use in the respective armies use the small-arm am- </p><p>munition, but I understand that special guns for </p><p>the warplanes are using cartridges up to an inch in </p><p>diameter. </p><p> By the way, here’s a little history that you may</p><p>know already. When Hudson Maxim invented his </p><p>famous gun he offered it to the War Department </p><p>first and found a cold shoulder turned toward him. </p><p>England welcomed him with open arms and knight- </p><p>hood. Lewis, a retired colonel of the U. S. Army, </p><p>was treated the same way, and his gun won fame </p><p>as the “Belgian Rattlesnake.” Incidentally, the </p><p>famous inventor Wiggins drew the same deal on a </p><p>sight he patented and offered to his uncle, like a </p><p>dutiful nephew. </p><p>Modern Firearms </p><p> As to present-day firearms, we have a host of</p><p>different makes, calibers and models. I list such </p><p>as I am familiar with: </p><p>WINCHESTERS </p><p>Model* 1873—Calibers, .32, .38 and .44 W. C. F. </p><p> (Discontinued.)</p><p>Model 1876—Calibers, .40-60, .45-60 and .45-75. </p><p> (Discontinued.)</p><p>Model 1883, or Hotchkiss—Caliber, .45-70. (Dis- </p><p> continued.)</p><p>Model 1886—Calibers, .38-56, .38-70, .40-65, .40-70, </p><p>.40-S2, .45-70, .45-90, .50-100 and .50-110. Now </p><p>made for .33 high-power also. All discontinued ex- </p><p>cept, .45-70, .45-90, .50-110, and .33 calibers. </p><p>Model 1890—Caliber, .22 only. </p><p>Model 1892—Calibers, .25-20, .32, .38 and .44 W. </p><p> C. F.</p><p>Model 1894—Calibers, .25-35, .30-30, .32 Special, </p><p> .32-40 and .38-55.</p><p>Model 1895—Calibers, .30-40, .303 British, .30 ’03 </p><p> and .30 ’06, .35 and .405 Winchester, .38-72,</p><p> .40-72. Two latter are now discontinued.</p><p>The automatics run from the .22 caliber up; .32, </p><p>.351, .35, and the .401, the most powerful automatic </p><p>made. </p><p>Shotguns are made in 10, 12, 16 and 20 gage. </p><p>No Winchester revolvers or pistols were ever made, </p><p> some writers to the contrary notwithstaning.</p><p> REMINGTONS</p><p>Autoloading (also called automatic)—Calibers, .25, </p><p>.30, .32 and .35 only. Slide actions the same, with </p><p>the old-style .38 and .44 in addition. </p><p>Remingtons made rifles of all descriptions since </p><p> 1816, and I am not familiar with all the models.</p><p> The Remington-Keene and the later models of</p><p> the Remington-Lee were powerful weapons, the</p><p> latter being a high-power rifle and made in cali-</p><p> bers from .236 (or 6 mm.) up to .45-90.</p><p>SAVAGES </p><p>Savages are made in .22 H. P., .250-3000, .25-35, </p><p> .30-30, .303, .32-40, and .38-55. Light .22 re-</p><p> peaters are also made. Savage automatic pis-</p><p> tols arc made in calibers .32 and .380. A few</p><p> experimental .45’s were made for the U. S. Army,</p><p> and the only ones that were ever offered the pub-</p><p> lic were the ones rejected from the tests when</p><p> automatics were selected by the Board of Ord-</p><p> nance.</p><p>MARLINS </p><p>Marlins are made in calibers .22, .32 and .25 rimfire. </p><p>In more powerful models they are made in .25-20, </p><p> .32-20, .38-40, .44-40, .25-35, .30-30, .32 Special,</p><p> .32-40, .38-55, .38-56, .38-70, .40-70,-45-70 .45-85</p><p> and .45-90.</p><p>Shotguns are made in 12,16 and 20 gages. </p><p>COLTS </p><p>Colt’s revolvers arc made in .22, .32, .38, .41, .44&gt; </p><p> .45, .450, .455 and .476 calibers. The last</p><p> three are for English shells.</p><p>Colt automatics are made in .22, .25, .32, .380, .38 </p><p> and .45 calibers.</p><p>Colts formerly made rifles and shotguns, but have </p><p> ceased to do so several years since. Many</p><p> models of their revolvers have been discontinued</p><p> and I am not familiar with them. Their most</p><p> popular model for hard service is still the old</p><p> model that Colonel Colt placed on the market</p><p> in 1836, with the various improvements neces-</p><p> sary to adapt it to cartridges, it being a muzzle-</p><p> loader when first brought out. Catalogued as</p><p> the Single-Action Army and Frontier.</p><p> Many makes of firearms have been discontinued</p><p>and off the market for years; but the ones I have </p><p>mentioned are the ones in most general use to-day </p><p>in America, and to a great extent in the whole world. </p><p>The Winchester can be found in every country under </p><p>the sky. </p><p>MAUSERS </p><p> In Europe before the beans were spilled the</p><p>Mauser and the heavy double-barreled rifle were </p><p>the heavy game and maii killing weapons. The </p><p>Mauser is the parent, with but two exceptions, as </p><p>nearly as I can tell, of every rifle that is drilling </p><p>holes in Wilhelm’s cohorts today. The two excep- </p><p>tions are the Winchester and the Martini. </p><p> Mausers have been in use since 1871 and were</p><p>modeled on the old needle gun, as made by Dreyse, </p><p>supposedly. They were made in calibers .256, </p><p>.275, .280, .30, .315, .358, .376, .400, .420, .425 and </p><p>433. I think one was made in .460 caliber, but am </p><p>not sure. Mauser made a great many actions and </p><p>barrels for other manufacturers, who finished the </p><p>fine points themselves and then labeled the gun as </p><p>their own product. This was particularly true of </p><p>the English gunmakers. They furnished Mausers </p><p>for a bewildering array of ammunition, and for </p><p>every conceivable game under the sun. Incidentally, </p><p>they demanded many shekels for their handiwork; </p><p>so much, in fact, that I never felt justified in pur- </p><p>chasing any of their wares. </p><p> Yes, there is an automatic revolver made, Mr.</p><p>Brown to the contrary notwithstanding. It is the </p><p>Webley-Fosbery, made by the Webley Company, </p><p>the contractors to the British Government. It is </p><p>made in .38 and .450-455 calibers. Walter Winans, </p><p>the expert shot, praises it highly. </p><p> For the man who is going “Out There” a good</p><p>thing to remember when stocking up on firearms </p><p>is that the sizes of ammunition most easily found in </p><p>out-of-the-way places are the following ones: </p><p> .22 caliber rifle and pistol cartridges.</p><p> 12-gage shotgun shells.</p><p> .44 Winchester (or .44-40) rifle cartridges.</p><p> These can almost always be picked up in any</p><p>store, and even in most camps a man runs across one. </p><p>In this country the .30-30 rifle ammunition is almost </p><p>as easily obtained, but I do not think it would be </p><p>so in foreign countries. </p><p>For the man who needs weapons that can be</p><p>Adventure </p><p>184 </p><p>always used in any country, from the ammunition </p><p>view-point, I would recommend the following bat- </p><p>tery: </p><p> One rifle or carbine, caliber .44 or .30-30, as the</p><p>individual preference map dictate. </p><p> One Colt or Smith &amp; Wesson revolver, as the</p><p>individual may prefer; using the rifle shell in .44. </p><p> One shotgun, 12 gage, double or repeater.</p><p> This armament can always be depended upon to</p><p>get food in any country, and the ammunition is not </p><p>expensive; it can usually be replenished at out-of- </p><p>the-way places. </p><p> If a man must go stripped down to his clothes</p><p>and one weapon, I would choose a double-barreled </p><p>shotgun. This, with shot shells for small game, </p><p>and a few ball loads for large mammals, is without </p><p>doubt the one all-around gun. In a mixed-game </p><p>country carry one barrel loaded with shot and the </p><p>other with the round ball. The latter is deadly at a </p><p>range of fifty yards and gives terrible shocking effect. </p><p> The automatics are at present the best thing in</p><p>the one-hand gun for close work that we have. I </p><p>refer to the Colt .45 automatic pistol, adopted by </p><p>the Government, of course. While it does not </p><p>appear to give the shocking effect of the big calibers </p><p>using black powder and soft-lead bullets, I would </p><p>consider it effectual for pretty nearly anything that </p><p>a weapon of self-defense is ever used for. And you </p><p>can slip in an extra magazine in the time it takes </p><p>you to put one shell in the big revolvers. </p><p> Just a little hint: when going to an argument with</p><p>adversaries of homicidal tendencies, wear a big </p><p>revolver openly at your belt, and a smaller one on </p><p>the opposite side of your body, under a coat. As </p><p>long as you don’t reach for the big fellow your </p><p>opponent will not suspect you and you can get the </p><p>drop on him without much trouble in case he proves </p><p>warlike. This is given in Waller Winans’s work </p><p>on revolver shooting, and seems to be good advice, </p><p>so I pass it over. </p><p>Rifles </p><p> American—Winchester, Savage, Marlin, Rem-</p><p>ington, Stevens, Newton, and the hand-made </p><p>weapons of Adolph, of Genoa, New York. These </p><p>arms are modem ones, in the course of manufacture. </p><p>Some of the older ones whose manufacture has been</p><p>discontinued are as follows: Spencer, Henry, </p><p>Sharps, Howard. Robinson, Maynard, Peabody, </p><p>Whitney, Kennedy, Ballard, Bullard, Allen, Fore- </p><p>hand &amp; Wadsworth, Hopkins &amp; Allen, Star, Merril, </p><p>Smith, Ward-Hutton, Colt, Wesson, Joslyn, Evans, </p><p>and Blake. More modem ones now off the market </p><p>are the Remington-Lee, Lee Straighpull, Standard, </p><p>and Blake. </p><p> English—B. S. A., Westlcy-Richards, Rigby, Jef-</p><p>fery, Webley &amp; Scott, Purdy, Lewis &amp; Sons, Lan- </p><p>caster, and Greener. Pretty nearly every English </p><p>gunmaker made rifles of one sort or another, but </p><p>did not always place their name on the gun. Ross </p><p>rifles are made in Canada; are excellent. </p><p> German—Mauser, Mannlicher and double and</p><p>single barrel tip-up actions are met with. Mauser </p><p>commercial actions are sold by the Mauser works to </p><p>gunmakers in every country, and by these makers </p><p>stocked and finished to be sold as their own make. </p><p>Mannlidiers the same. </p><p> Austrian—Mannlicher the standard arm, but the</p><p>Schoenauer is a popular and excellent action. </p><p> France, Spain, Italy and Russia have distinctive</p><p>military rifles, but their sporting weapons are </p><p>almost all imported ones from Germany and the </p><p>United States. Scandinavian countries use the </p><p>Krag-Jorgensen service arm. </p><p>Actions </p><p> Omitting ,22’s as not worth consideration, the</p><p>leading actions of the world are as follows: </p><p> Winchesters, lever and automatic actions at pres-</p><p> ent; bolt actions were made in .45-70 and .236</p><p> calibers, both now discontinued. Shotguns are</p><p> slide, lever and automatic.</p><p> Savage rifles are lever action in all sizes above .22,</p><p> except the .22 high-power, which is a lever action.</p><p> Marlins are lever action in everything above .25</p><p> rimfire in power. Their shotguns are all slide, or</p><p> pump, actions.</p><p> Remington rifles are slide and automatics. Bolt</p><p>actions and single-shots have been discontinued. </p><p>Shotguns are pump and automatics. Revolvers </p><p>and pistols have been discontinued. </p><p> Newtons are the latest comer in the firearms</p><p>line, and are probably the best we have. They are </p><p>powerful bolt actions. No short arms made.</p><p> Fred Adolph of Genoa, makes fine arms to</p><p>order by hand, having learned his art in Germany. </p><p>He, Ludwig Wundhammer, and W. Wilshirc of </p><p>Los Angeles, California, produce nothing but high- </p><p>grade arms made to the order of the sportsmen. </p><p> Colts formerly made repeating rifles in both lever</p><p> and slide actions and double-barreled shotguns, but</p><p> 'have not made any of these arms for years. They</p><p> make no automatic rifle.</p><p> The Henry, Spencer, and Sharps, with the old</p><p>Springfield needle gun, helped civilize the West. </p><p>They were popular and reliable weapons. The </p><p>first two were rimfire repeaters, the latter was a </p><p>heavy single-shot center-fire rifle. Sharp made a </p><p>repeater and offered it to the Government testing </p><p>department, but it was rejected, and I do not think </p><p>it was ever on the market. Sharp’s pistols were </p><p>made in four-barrel types, also, but for small car- </p><p>tridges. The Sharp, by the way, was the first </p><p>reliable breech-loading weapon we ever had. In- </p><p>vented, according to Bannerman, in 1848. </p><p> I do not consider the Hall breech-loadcr rifle a</p><p> practical arm, as a number of men lost their thumbs</p><p> by its blowing open. It was invented about 1810.</p><p> English rifles are made in a great variety of styles</p><p> and actions, from the old Snider to the latest type</p><p> of bolt action for tlie high-power cartridges for big-</p><p> game shooting. The favorites are the bolt action</p><p> and the double-barreled rifle. They are made in</p><p> calibers ranging from .22 Savage high-power to the</p><p> .600 caliber and the 4 bore. I can not manage to</p><p> recount all the different calibers and cartridges, as</p><p> some of the same shells are known by a different</p><p> name with every maker.</p><p> English shotguns are made in double and single</p><p>barrel styles. The automatic is made, I have read, </p><p>but has never met with favor. They are not strong </p><p>for a multishot gun there. </p><p> The English revolvers I do not know much about,</p><p>but the Webley is the service weapon, and from </p><p>what I have seen of them they are a reliable gun, </p><p>although very clumsy, and of complicated design. </p><p>I guess they deliver the goods. </p><p> As to the other European nations, I am under</p><p>the impression that the bolt action is the standard, </p><p>and this, in fact, is the only action that stands up </p><p>well under the terrific shock of the heavy loads of </p><p>smokeless powder now favored by big-game hunters. </p><p>Firearms, Old and New </p><p>American rifles are exported to a considerable extent, </p><p>but more go to South America than to Europe or </p><p>Africa. Asia seems impartial, from what I can learn. </p><p>Shotguns </p><p> America makes the Parker, Fox, Ithaca, Smith,</p><p>Winchester, Remington, Marlin, Union, Chicago, </p><p>Biffar, Davis, Folsom, Harrington &amp; Richardson, </p><p>Hopkins &amp; Allen, Tver Johnson, Baker, Lefever, </p><p>Stevens, Royal, and Tobin. Winchester, Marlin. </p><p>Remington and Union are pumps; Remington and </p><p>Winchester are automatics; all others are double </p><p>and single barreled. Both hammerless and hammer </p><p>styles are made, with the former in the lead. </p><p> England—Andrews, Anson, Bonehill, Halloway</p><p>Naughton, Lancaster, Osborne, Pulverman, Web- </p><p>ley &amp; Scott, Lang, Westley Richards, and Jeffery. </p><p>All these are double and single barrels. No re- </p><p>peaters to my knowledge. Some are made to handle </p><p>ball or shot equally well and are a favorite weapon </p><p>in a mixed-game field. </p><p> Belgium—Parkhurst, Browning, Pieper, and</p><p>Francotte. Browning is an automatic, the rest are </p><p>double and single barrels. </p><p> Germany—Daly, Sauer, and others I am not</p><p>familiar with. Three-barreled guns, two-shot bar- </p><p>rels with a rifle barrel under and between them are </p><p>very popular. A close friend of mine killed a game </p><p>warden with one, I shall always believe. He praised </p><p>its execution highly. </p><p> All the above double-barrel and single-barrel</p><p>guns are made in 12 gage, and most of them in </p><p>10, 16 and 20 gages also. Automatics are 12 </p><p>gage in United States, but a 16-gage Browning </p><p>is made in Europe. </p><p> Now for my pets, the short guns.</p><p>Revolvers </p><p> America—Colt, Smith &amp; Wesson, Iver Johnson,</p><p>Harrington &amp; Richardson, Forehand and Wads- </p><p>worth, Hopkins &amp;• Allen, Meriden. There are some </p><p>old-timers, now discontinued, that may figure in </p><p>stories, so I list them: Starr, Remington, Bacon, </p><p>Marlin, Whitney, Smith, Thomas, Savage, Morse </p><p>and Pettengill. Civil War period and soon after. </p><p> England—Webley. Old-timers, Tranter, and</p><p>Dean &amp; Adams. Colt made revolvers in London in </p><p>the 50’s, I hear. </p><p> Russia—Naegants.</p><p> Spain—Orbea Hermanos.</p><p>Automatics </p><p>Rifles </p><p> American—Winchester, .22, .32, .35, .351, .401.</p><p>Remington, .22, .25, .30, .32, .35.

I know an appalling number of patents are </p><p>granted upon this type of arm, but how many are </p><p>actually manufactured and how successful they are, </p><p>it’s impossible to state with any accuracy. They </p><p>turn them out about as we do pocket-knives and</p><p>Fords. </p><p> Over there a great business is done by large firms</p><p>like the Mauser works at Oberndorff-on-Neckar, </p><p>where the rough forgings for frames and the rough </p><p>tubes for barrels are made and supplied to indi- </p><p>vidual makers all over the continent, to be made </p><p>up into finished arms and labeled as the finisher’s </p><p>own product. Until the war the American makers </p><p>of shotguns imported practically all their high-grade </p><p>barrel-tubes and bored and finished them them- </p><p>selves. Incidentally, our domestic tubes were far </p><p>superior to the imported article, and the price was </p><p>mostly on the high-sounding foreign name. </p><p> Now as regards ammunition. I can not do all</p><p>I would like to, as it would keep me as busy as a </p><p>blind paper-hanger with the dobie itch to get them </p><p>all down. Here's a little on the matter, however. </p><p> American rimfire ammunition is made in .22,</p><p>.25, .30, .32, .38, .41, .42, .44, .46, .50, .52 and .56 </p><p>calibers. All over .32 rimfire are for obsolete </p><p>weapons, however—old Spencers, Henrys, Howards, </p><p>etc. </p><p> As to the dates when these were introduced I can</p><p>give the following: Colts, for fixed ammunition </p><p>about 1866; Winchesters, the same year; Spencers, </p><p>in 1863; Henrys, in 1860; Volcanics, in 1856. These </p><p>were a lever-action arm, made in repeating pis- </p><p>tols as well as rifles; now very rare. </p><p> The Springfield needle gun was issued as a breech-</p><p>loader in 1863, but was not in general use till 1867. </p><p>It was conceded to be “Hiyu Cultus” by the In- </p><p>dians, who said “Shootum to-day, killum tomor- </p><p>row.” It was as distinctive a weapon as the six- </p><p>shooter. The old veteran served in the infantry </p><p>until 1892, and some of the volunteers shouldered </p><p>it in the Spanish War. The cavalry used the </p><p>Spencer till 1877. then the Springfield carbine, the </p><p>same gun as the infantry, but shorter. </p><p> Winchesters came into general use about the</p><p>time of center-fire cartridges, 1873. They were the </p><p>favorite gun from that time on. The Winchester </p><p>Company state that there are about a million of </p><p>the old model 1873 in use today in every country </p><p>on the globe. </p><p> So there you are. It’s good stuff, but a</p><p>gun-crank isn’t really a good one unless he </p><p>lias violent opinions of his own and in so far </p><p>as space permits we’ll gladly present your </p><p>opinions or additions at our semi-monthly </p><p>meetings. </p><p>ADVENTURE’S FREE SERVICES AND ADDRESSES </p><p>These services of Adventure are free to any one.

What hunting is there </p><p>to be done there in Spring and Summer? \re </p><p>hunting licenses necessary to possess and use fire- </p><p>arms? If so, how much would a license cost? Are </p><p>the mining regions open to a newcomer to stake a </p><p>claim? What region would you advise? Could </p><p>you refer me to any book that explains the kind of </p><p>mining carried on there? What caliber rifle do you </p><p>consider the best for that region?”—George </p><p>Newman, Detroit, Mich. </p><p> An.nver, by Mr. Solomons:—The hunting in</p><p>Spring and Summer is not so good, of course, as in </p><p>lall and Winter, but Alaska is always a good hunt- </p><p>ing-ground, though a big one; and it is not easy to </p><p>get over the ground in Summer. However, with </p><p>a poling-boat one can cover a great deal of ground </p><p>on the many rivers. </p><p> Fur-bearing animals may be taken at the proper</p><p>season and under the moderate regulations in force, </p><p>which you can obtain by writing the Bureau of </p><p>Fisheries, Washington, D. C. Game animals are </p><p>rather rigidly protected, however, including deer, </p><p>moose, caribou, mountain sheep, goats, brown bear </p><p>—the big fellows—ducks, geese, ptarmigan and </p><p>oilier game birds. This is for the market, of course, </p><p>and killings for personal use by miners or explorers </p><p>is sanctioned at any time. </p><p> A resident of Alaska does not pay a license, but</p><p>visiting hunters are taxed fifty dollars, if Americans, </p><p>if foreigners, one hundred dollars. You may ob-</p><p>tain the game regulations, and much general in- </p><p>formation by writing the Geological Survey, or </p><p>Department of the Interior for “General Informa- </p><p>tion regarding the Territory of Alaska,” which mil </p><p>be sent you free of charge. </p><p> I’prefer a .30-30 Winchester for all ’round work in</p><p>Alaska, with soft-nosed bullets for quick use on big </p><p>bear and moose. Any high-powered rifle is good, </p><p>but the lighter the better. Any one out looking for </p><p>the big, brown bear or the silver-tip Alaskan grizzly </p><p>would do well to take a somewhat heavier bore </p><p>rifle however. Good books for present-day use are, </p><p>besides the numerous Government publications, </p><p>Greely’s Hand-book of Alaska—Scribner’s—and </p><p>Alaska, An Empire in the Making, by J. J. Under- </p><p>wood—Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. </p><p>Poor Eyesight at Sea </p><p> Question:—“I am twenty-one years old and have</p><p>a good healthy constitution, but owing to short- </p><p>sightedness am obliged to wear glasses. Would </p><p>that be any obstacle in getting a position on a </p><p>vessel? I can operate a typewriter, have an ex- </p><p>cellent knowledge of bookkeeping and have had a </p><p>year in high school. Might I get a job as assistant </p><p>Ask Adventure </p><p>steward, or something of that kind, until I have </p><p>experience?”—Edward Guild, Adams, Mass. </p><p> Answer, by Captain Dingle—Your defective</p><p>eyesight need not prove a bar to sea service entirely, </p><p>although it is a bad asset for a man seeking to be- </p><p>come an officer. You should have no difficulty in </p><p>getting some sort of a berth, but it is not usually a </p><p>welcome thing aboard ship that a man is absolutely </p><p>obliged to wear his glasses while performing his </p><p>duties. Can you not work without them? A </p><p>steward’s job, for example, at least an assistant </p><p>steward, consists in waiting on table and general </p><p>cleaning up. That doesn’t require excessively keen </p><p>vision but of course neither should a man be so </p><p>imperfect of vision that he would pass a passenger </p><p>sugar for salt. </p><p> In this regard go down to any steamer in your</p><p>nearest port and apply to the chief steward or </p><p>purser. There are m.'vny jobs that a beginner can </p><p>take, and after the first trip the rest is simple. </p><p> One other chance occurs to me, and I think it is</p><p>your best method, if you are able to do it. Glasses </p><p>won’t matter there. Take a course in wireless </p><p>operating—the Marconi Company, Wool worth </p><p>Building, New York, will tell you how and all </p><p>about it—then ship through these same people as </p><p>an operator. You’ll rate as officer right away, </p><p>have a good, respectable job, and it won’t matter </p><p>how your sight is, much, so long as your ears are </p><p>keen. </p><p>Industrial Conditions in Victoria </p><p> Question:—“What are the industrial conditions</p><p>in Victoria? Is there any demand for stenogra- </p><p>phers and newspaper men, and what is the average </p><p>wage? My wife is a stenographer and I am a news- </p><p>paper man. What would be our chance of getting </p><p>by should we come to your country with a capital </p><p>of three thousand dollars or less? The statement </p><p>that I am a newspaper man does not mean that </p><p>any kind of productive work would not look good </p><p>to me as I am in excellent health and physical con- </p><p>dition.”—Kenneth F. Lee, Augusta, Maine. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Carson:—You need have no</p><p>hesitation in coming to this country with the capital </p><p>you mention, but while there are many good open- </p><p>ings for people of your stamp I very much doubt </p><p>if you will ever want them. You can get a start </p><p>on a small ranch with what you have and one </p><p>season in this country will spoil you for indoor </p><p>employment forever. Just the same it is pleasing </p><p>to know that it is there in the event of your ever</p><p>needing it. </p><p> I am rather of the opinion that your chances</p><p>would be better in Seattle if you decide to follow </p><p>your line of employment, but this is a small matter </p><p>as the fare from Seattle to Victoria is only S2.50 </p><p>and the trip only requires some four hours by boat. </p><p> If you finally decide to try the coast I wish you</p><p>to feel that I stand ready to assist you in any way </p><p>I can. It might be a good idea to come direct to </p><p>me and take a week to look things over before </p><p>committing yourselves to any particular line of </p><p>action. Don’t turn on the gratitude flume. I </p><p>have done this before, as letters published in Ad- </p><p>venture will show, but I find the satisfaction of mak- </p><p>ing somebody come alive and really live is a big </p><p>return for any trouble I am put to. I brought one </p><p>man from New Hampshire and he has smiled ever </p><p>since. Glad to hear from you at any time and </p><p>I89 </p><p>any information I can give you is yours for the </p><p>asking. </p><p>Panama Woods </p><p> Question:—“I am seeking information on the</p><p>country located on the north coast of Panama be- </p><p>tween Colon and Bocas del Toro, relative to timber </p><p>possibilities in that section, especially fronting on </p><p>the Caribbean Sea. What is the character of the </p><p>timber and its principal growth, or varieties com- </p><p>pared with cypress, yellow pine, oak and hickory, </p><p>and if hard or soft varieties predominate? What </p><p>are the health conditions and what altitudes are safe </p><p>for fair health? What are the labor conditions, </p><p>prevailing prices, and if intelligent and competent </p><p>or not? Are the people reasonably law-abiding and </p><p>are the general laws such as would be favorable to </p><p>investments and general development?”—E. C. </p><p>Austin, St. Louis, Mo. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Young:—Besides the well-known</p><p>mahogany—swietenia—there are over a hundred </p><p>other timber trees, having woods suitable for one </p><p>purpose or another, in the forests of Panama. </p><p>Prominent among these are the “cedros”—cedrela </p><p>sp.—of which “cedro amargo”—c. glaziovii—fur- </p><p>nishes cigar-box wood and a great deal of imitation </p><p>mahogany used by cabinet-makers. </p><p> Other important lumbers are the numerous</p><p>“quizarras” which belong to the Lauraceae, the </p><p>“guayacan”—tecoma crysantha—one of the many </p><p>woods called lignum vitae, the “laurel”—cordia </p><p>gerascanthus—and such leguminous trees as the</p><p>guanacaztli, guapinol, gavilan, candelillos, guachi- </p><p>pelin, etc. The guachii&gt;elin is very valuable for </p><p>posts, foundations, etc., because when buried it re- </p><p>mains sound almost indefinitely and is not subject </p><p>to the attacks of insects. </p><p> To express it in a few words, the forests of Panama</p><p>are able to duplicate any character of timber we </p><p>have here and have left others with which we are </p><p>not familiar. </p><p> With the exception of malaria Panama is healthy</p><p>in all parts and in the mountains the climate is ideal. </p><p> The Panamanian native is worthless as a laborer</p><p>and all companies who operate in the republic im- </p><p>port West Indian negroes for this purpose. These </p><p>may be had for about a dollar a day and quarters. </p><p>They are very stupid, also, and have to be driven </p><p>every minute of the time. </p><p> Panama in all parts is very law-abiding and the</p><p>laws are favorable to investments with the excep- </p><p>tion of the San Bias Indian country, a strip of land </p><p>between Colon and Colombia. These Indians are </p><p>about as ferocious as one would care to encounter. </p><p>Living Conditions in California </p><p> Question:—“I would like to know about the</p><p>climate of California in general and Los Angeles in </p><p>particular. I have heard that there is a long and </p><p>dreary rainy season in the State. Is that so? </p><p>What are the working conditions in Los Angeles, </p><p>particularly in the hotel business—waiters, cooks, </p><p>etc.? Also what are the chances for a prospective </p><p>civil engineer? Is there much work in that line </p><p>either in Los Angeles or elsewhere in the State? </p><p>Are there good technical schools in the city where </p><p>one may finish out one’s course? What are the </p><p>conditions of life? Is the cost of necessities high? </p><p>Adventure </p><p>190 </p><p>Are rents very high and are the dwellings of the </p><p>lower middle class furnished with modem improve- </p><p>ments?”—Frank Pei, New York, N. Y. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Harriman:—The climate of Cali-</p><p>fornia in general is mild all the year. Where I live </p><p>our Summers are far less heated than the Eastern </p><p>and in Winter—well, to illustrate—I am sitting in a </p><p>chamber-room, no fire going in any part of the </p><p>house, my windows wide open and I without coat or </p><p>vest, perfectly comfortable. It is cool at times, </p><p>occasionally we have frost, and in Summer our </p><p>nights are always cool, allowing us perfect rest. I </p><p>always sleep under one single blanket in Summer. </p><p> Regarding the long, dreary rainy season, we had</p><p>fifteen days in 1917 when we did not have sunshine </p><p>at least part of the day. Could you endure that? </p><p>There are parts of the State where they have fogs </p><p>and more cloudy weather, up around San Fran- </p><p>cisco, for instance. From Santa Barbara to Mex- </p><p>ico it is about as here. I have been here 32 years </p><p>and I wouldn’t take New York as a gift if I had to </p><p>live there. </p><p> This is a great place for hotels and they are going</p><p>to be rushed to the limit from now on. The tour- </p><p>ists are beginning to flock in from the frozen, bliz- </p><p>zardy East and Middle West, filling everything. </p><p>Waiters and cooks are busy men here at this time— </p><p>January—and on till Summer. In fact they are </p><p>busy all the year, but the first five or six months of </p><p>the year are the busiest. </p><p> Civil engineers are not at a premium, since our</p><p>schools turn them out by the score. We have here </p><p>a superb school, the L. A. Polytechnic, and our </p><p>Manual Arts is not far behind it. I have been told </p><p>by Eastern educators that our Polytechnic ranks </p><p>with the best in America. </p><p> As regards living costs, I am told by Eastern men</p><p>now here, that the meals in good places here cost </p><p>less than half New York prices, one said only a </p><p>third as much. A friend of mine went to Boston </p><p>and wrote back that it cost him easily 45% mere to </p><p>feed his family there. </p><p> I ate dinner with a friend who knows the East as</p><p>I know my own yard and has traveled all over the </p><p>world. He said, as we ate— </p><p> “You set up a meal for fifty cents that I would</p><p>buy in New York at from one dollar to one-twenty- </p><p>five.”</p><p> He also told me that he found clothing prices very</p><p>cheap and other things in proportion. Another </p><p>friend, just back from Chicago, said he had a notion </p><p>that he could get a tailored suit more cheaply there </p><p>than here, so he made a call on a tailor and ordered </p><p>two. He said he lost about twenty-four dollars on </p><p>the two by not getting them here. </p><p> Rents are all prices, according to where you go</p><p>and the kind of house you rent. I do not consider </p><p>them high, in fact, just the reverse. </p><p> The homes of even the sewer-diggers have modem</p><p>plumbing. This city has more real homes for its </p><p>workers than any Eastern city of its size I ever saw </p><p>and I have been in many of them. Here there are </p><p>literally thousands of small cottages and bungalows, </p><p>prettily built, with full modem plumbing, fireplace, </p><p>gas and electricity, lawn in front and a garden in </p><p>rear, occupied by laboring men and women. </p><p> I	have lived in Minneapolis, Cleveland, and other</p><p>towns in the Middle West, but I never saw such </p><p>pretty and comfortable homes for workers there. </p><p>Nor did I see anything like so many that owned </p><p>their own. </p><p>The Cook Islands </p><p> Question:—“I am after information regarding</p><p>the Cook Islands in the Southern Pacific. What is </p><p>the title of the representative of the British Crown </p><p>there? How are they governed? Is the white </p><p>population very numerous? Is the climate health- </p><p>ful? Please inform me as to the resources and in- </p><p>dustries of the islands.”—'“Ottawan,” Ottawa, </p><p>Canada. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Mills:—The Pacific group known</p><p>as the Cook Islands, annexed by New Zealand in </p><p>1900, include Rarotonga, Mangaia, Mauke, Aitutaki, </p><p>Mitiaro, and Hervey Islands, Palmerston, Niue, </p><p>Danger, Rakahanga, Manihiki, Penrhyn, and Su- </p><p>warrow. The best known and most important of </p><p>these islands are Rarotonga—which is the head- </p><p>quarters of the Resident Commissioner for the group </p><p>and the seat of the high court—Mangaia, and Niue. </p><p> Rarotonga promises to become a very important</p><p>position in the Pacific Ocean, because it is one of the </p><p>stepping-stones on the greatest of all sea routes </p><p>from America to New Zealand and Australia. It is </p><p>also to be an important wireless station. It is </p><p>easily the finest of the Cook group, both in scenic </p><p>attractions and general productiveness, being a </p><p>particularly good specimen of the volcanic order of </p><p>islands.</p><p> The island is well watered, has a range rising over</p><p>2,000 feet above the sea level, and a belt of rich soil </p><p>varying from one to two miles in width extends all </p><p>’round from the mountains to the sea. The cir- </p><p>cumference of Rarotonga is over 20 miles and the </p><p>total area 16,500 acres. The coconut palm is ex- </p><p>tensively cultivated, and there is a good orange and </p><p>banana trade with New Zealand, the island being </p><p>particularly well suited to the growth of the banana. </p><p> The population of this center of the Cook group</p><p>is something over 2,000 natives—a very gentle and </p><p>kindly people, well educated by the London Mission- </p><p>ary Society schools—and there are not more than </p><p>about 100 Europeans. The Resident Commissioner </p><p>is appointed by the New Zealand Government, and </p><p>all the people in the group are governed by British </p><p>rule, tempered, of course, by a wise and discretion- </p><p>ary use of native customs, as is the case in New </p><p>Zealand with regard to the Maori—the native race. </p><p> By the way, you will be interested to learn that</p><p>there is a contingent of Maoris serving in Flanders </p><p>with the New Zealanders and a contingent of </p><p>Rarotongans serving with the New Zealanders in </p><p>Palestine—all doing splendid war work, for they are </p><p>ideal fighters. The climate of the Cook group is </p><p>healthy, but, of course, it is pretty warm. Some </p><p>delicate friends of mine, however, have been resi- </p><p>dents of Rarotonga these 15 years, and are doing </p><p>well in health and pocket.—Kia Ora (Maori for </p><p>Good Luck.) </p><p>Trading in the Orient </p><p> Question:—'“What are the chances of making a</p><p>good living in China or Malay Peninsula, by trading, </p><p>working for companies, etc.? What have you ever </p><p>heard of the interior of Borneo? I have heard that </p><p>it is peopled by a strange unknown race. Is this so? </p><p>Are they like the Ainus or are they civilized yellow </p><p>men? Do you think that the Oriental coolie </p><p>laborers or labor of all kinds should be excluded </p><p>from the United States? What do you know of the </p><p>Senussi?”—J. O. Shahane, Cavalier, N. D. </p><p>Lost Trails </p><p>191 </p><p> Answer, by Mr. McCreagh:—It is difficult for me</p><p>to tell yno what chances you would have of making </p><p>a good living in China or the Malay States since </p><p>you have not told me what your qualifications are. </p><p> If you are a skilled mechanic in any line you could</p><p>get employment with one of the large firms. I </p><p>might be able to give you further particulars il you </p><p>would tell me what you could do. </p><p> As to trading: I would advise you and every-</p><p>body else never to try to trade against the Asiatic </p><p>races unless you happen to have enough capital to </p><p>swamp them out. The white man can not trade in </p><p>a small way against the Asiatic, for the Asiatic can </p><p>outbuy him, outlie him, and undersell him every </p><p>time. Remember, the Asiatic can live on about </p><p>one-tenth as much as the white man, and can afford </p><p>to cut his profits correspondingly. Also, there is a </p><p>strong race sentiment prevalent; the Asiatic will buy </p><p>from an Asiatic whenever he can in preference to </p><p>a white man. No, you can’t buck that game with- </p><p>out capital. </p><p> Interior of Borneo: there has been written in past</p><p>years an awful lot of hot air about the wild and </p><p>mysterious people of the jungles. As a matter of </p><p>fact, they are nothing more than savages in a very </p><p>low state of civilization. They represent what is </p><p>left of the original inhabitants; Muruts or Dusuns, </p><p>they are known as, ethnologically distinct from the </p><p>Dyak race. They have some queer customs, as </p><p>have all savages, but there is nothing mysterious </p><p>about them. They are not even cannibals, though </p><p>they all collect heads, just as the Indian of this </p><p>country collected scalps. </p><p> They live largely on meat, any kind of meat from</p><p>iguana lizard to wild pig or dog, and they would just </p><p>as soon eat it raw as not. The jungle communities </p><p>are always very small; a village consists usually of a </p><p>single immense hut like a barrack, with separate </p><p>cubicles for each family. All the cubicles, filthy </p><p>places in which ten or twenty people herd together </p><p>irrespective of sex, open on to a wide sort of ver- </p><p>anda with a hard-stamped earth floor. Where the </p><p>bungalow-dweller of our Summer colonies would </p><p>hang fem-pots and flowers, the junglies hang heads. </p><p> An interesting item is their coinage—or rather,</p><p>the recognized medium of exchange. A large porous </p><p>earthen pot is currency for one pig, or twenty </p><p>chickens, or a pigskin full of yams, and so on. An- </p><p>other inteiesting fact is that all of them, from</p><p>infants of three or four years of age, get periodically </p><p>very drunk on a fiery liquor which they call murua </p><p>or bolo which they brew in some weird way out of </p><p>rice and fermenting bamboo shoots. They get </p><p>drunk whenever they have a religious festival, and </p><p>they hold a religious festival whenever it is necessary </p><p>to propitiate any of their numerous devils who live </p><p>in the trees and the streams and the rocks. Owing </p><p>to this high living and to some of their queer mar- </p><p>riage conventions they are gradually dying out— </p><p>and it isn’t anybody’s loss either. </p><p> Do I think that Oriental coolie labor should be</p><p>excluded from the U. S. A.? Yes, I do. I think </p><p>that any form of labor which can underbid the </p><p>white man in his own country owing to a lower scale </p><p>of living should be excluded from a white man’s </p><p>country. </p><p> The Senussi: I can’t tell you much about the</p><p>Senussi except that about them too a great deal of </p><p>foolishness has been written. They are a semi- </p><p>political, semi-secret organization of considerable </p><p>power; but there is nothing particularly mysterious </p><p>about them. </p><p> If you are particularly interested, you might write</p><p>to Capt. Achmed Abdullah, care of Jean Wick, </p><p>Aeolian Hall, N. Y. City. He is a member of the </p><p>organization and knows more about them than any </p><p>man in America, as he does about most matters </p><p>Oriental. </p><p> Note—We offer this department of the "Camp-Fire" free of charge to those of our read-</p><p>ers who wish to get in touch again with old friends or acquaintances from whom the years </p><p>have separated them.

Mr.</p><p>Addison Sims of Seattle. </p><p> “If I remember correctly—and I</p><p>do remember correctly—Mr. Bur- </p><p>roughs, the lumberman, introduced </p><p>me to you at the luncheon of the </p><p>Seattle Rotary Club three years ago </p><p>in May. This is a pleasure indeed! </p><p>I	haven’t laid eyes on you since that</p><p>day. How is the grain business? </p><p>And how did that amalgamation </p><p>work out?” </p><p> The assurance of the speaker—in</p><p>the crowded corridor of the Hotel </p><p>'McAlpin—compelled me to turn and </p><p>look at him, though I must say it </p><p>is not my usual habit to “listen in” </p><p>even in a hotel lobby. </p><p> “He is David M. Roth, the most</p><p>famous memory expert in the United </p><p>States,” said my 'riend Kennedy, </p><p>answering my question before 1 could </p><p>get it out. “He will show you a lot </p><p>more wonderful things than that, </p><p>before the evening is over.” </p><p> And he did.</p><p> As we went into the banquet room the</p><p>toastmaster was introducing a long line of </p><p>guests to Mr. Roth. I got in line and </p><p>when it came my turn, Mr. Roth asked. </p><p>"What are your initials. Mr. Jones, and </p><p>your business connection and telephone </p><p>number?" Why he asked this I learned </p><p>later, when he picked out from the crowd </p><p>the 60 men he had met two hours before </p><p>and called each by name without a mis- </p><p>take. What is more, he named each </p><p>man's business and telephone number, for </p><p>good measure. </p><p> I won't tell you all the other amazing</p><p>things this man did except to tell how he </p><p>called back, without a minute's hesita- </p><p>tion, long lists of numbers, bank clear- </p><p>ings, prices, lot numbers, pared post rates </p><p>and anything else the guests had given </p><p>him in rapid order. </p><p>****** </p><p> When I met Mr. Roth again—which</p><p>you may be sure I did the first chance I </p><p>got—he rather bowled me over by saying, </p><p>in his quiet, modest way: </p><p> "There is nothing miraculous about my</p><p>remembering anything I want to remem- </p><p>ber, whether it be names, faces, figures, </p><p>facts or something I have read in a </p><p>magazine. </p><p> " You can do this just as easily as I do.</p><p> Anyone with an average mind can learn</p><p> quickly to do exactly the same things</p><p> which seem so miraculous when I do them.</p><p> "My own memory," continued Mr.</p><p>Roth, "was originally very faulty. Yes </p><p>it was—a really poor memory. On meet- </p><p>ing a man I would lose his name in thirty </p><p>seconds, while now there are probably </p><p>10,000 men and women in the United </p><p>States, many of whom I have met but </p><p>once, whose names I can tell instantly on </p><p>meeting them.” </p><p> "That is all right for you, Mr. Roth,"</p><p>I interrupted, "you have given years to </p><p>it. But how about me?" </p><p> “Mr. Jones," he replied, "I can teach</p><p>you the secret of a good memory in one </p><p>evening. This is not a guess, because I </p><p>have done it with thousands of pupils. In </p><p>the first of seven simple lessons which I </p><p>have prepared for home study. I show you </p><p>the basic principle of my whole system </p><p>and you will find it—not hard work as you </p><p>might fear—but just like playing a fasci- </p><p>nating game. I will prove it to you." </p><p> He didn't have to prove it. His Course</p><p>did; I got it the very next day from his </p><p>publishers, the Independent Corporation. </p><p> When I tackled the first lesson, I sup-</p><p>pose I was the most surprised man in </p><p>forty-eight states to find that I had learned </p><p>in about one hour—how to remember </p><p>a list of one hundred words so that I could </p><p>call them off forward and back without </p><p>a single mistake. </p><p> That first lesson stuck. And so did the</p><p>other six. </p><p> Read this letter from C. Louis Allen,</p><p>who at 32 years is president of a million </p><p>dollar corporation, the Pyrene Manufac- </p><p>turing Company of New York, makers of </p><p>the famous fire extinguisher: </p><p> "Now that the Roth Memory</p><p> Course Is Ilntshed. I want to tell</p><p> you how much I have enjoyed the</p><p> study of this most fascinating sub-</p><p> ject. Usually these courses Involve</p><p> a great deal of drudgery, but this</p><p> has been nothing but pure plea-</p><p> sure all the way through. I have</p><p> derived much beneht from taking</p><p> the course of Instruction and feel</p><p> that I shall continue to strengthen</p><p> my memory. That Is the best part</p><p> or it. I shall be glad of an op-</p><p> portunity to recommend your work</p><p> to my friends."</p><p> Mr. Allen didn't put it a bit too strong.</p><p>The Roth Course is priceless! I can ab- </p><p>solutely count on my memory now. 1 can </p><p>call the name of most any man I have </p><p>met before—and I am getting better all </p><p>the time. I can remember any figures I </p><p>wish to remember. Telephone numbers </p><p>come to mind instantly, once I have filed </p><p>them by Mr. Roth's easy method. Street </p><p>addresses are just as easy. </p><p> The old fear of forgetting (you know</p><p>what that is) has vanished. I used to be </p><p>"scared stiff" on my feet—because I </p><p>wasn't sure. X couldn't remember what </p><p>I wanted to say. </p><p> Now I am sure of myself, and confident</p><p>and "easy as an old shoe" when I get on </p><p>my feet at the club, or at a banquet, </p><p>or in a business meeting, or in any social </p><p>gathering. </p><p> Perhaps the most enjoyable part of it</p><p>all is that I have become a good con- </p><p>versationalist—and I used to be as silent </p><p>as a sphinx when I got into a crowd of </p><p>people who knew things. </p><p> Now I can call up like a flash of light-</p><p>ning most any fact 1 want right at the </p><p>instant I need it most. I used to think </p><p>a "hair trigger" memory belonged only </p><p>to the prodigy and genius. Now I see </p><p>that every man of us has that kind of a </p><p>memory if he only knows how to make it</p><p>work right. </p><p> I	tell you it is a wonderful thing, after</p><p>groping around in the dark for so many </p><p>years to be able to switch the big search- </p><p>light on your mind and see instantly </p><p>everything you want to remember. </p><p> This Roth Course will do wonders in</p><p>your office. </p><p> Siiice we took it up you never hear any-</p><p>one in our oflice say "I guess" or "I think </p><p>it was about so much” or "I forget that </p><p>right now" or "1 can't remember" or "I </p><p>must look up his name." Now they are </p><p>right there with the answer—like a shot. </p><p> Have you ever heard of "Multigraph"</p><p>Smith? Real name H. Q. Smith.
