For Cotameg and Smoking Pine</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to go down 'round the Great Bend of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Saskatchewan, beyond the mouth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carrot to the Pasquia River where the post</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Pas lay in the crotch the Pasquia</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed with the Saskatchewan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps the supplies had not reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lewis when they got there!

Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">day from sunrise to sunset the guns of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian goose hunters talked on the lonely</seg><seg type="columnLine">shores, and by the hundreds they brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in, to be eaten fresh or salted down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrels, for Winter use.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But white men quickly sicken of flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone and white women more quickly than</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, and often Carlisle wondered how Joan</seg><seg type="columnLine">was faring on the savage diet.

Her flowers were withered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dead, but he looked in vain for another</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting. All the week days there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically no communication between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">posts and on Sundays she never came any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more to Andrews' mixed services on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wondered if she were ill, and censured</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself for pressing the trade war so bit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terly.

She would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be living on the post diet, and he feared it</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not agree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The idea harassed him continually, set</seg><seg type="columnLine">him searching at nights for overlooked food</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the shelves of his quarters till one</seg><seg type="columnLine">night he came across his gear bag, thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside and forgotten since he had established</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself at the post.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In its bottom his groping fingers felt a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bundle which he did not recognize at first</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as he unrolled the oilcloth in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was wrapped he suddenly remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it. It was a small reserve of pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visions, stowed away there when he left</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moose Factory in case of accident or emer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gency on the trip to Cumberland House.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eagerly he spread out its contents and</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed the articles with satisfaction--a tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">bag of flour, the same of meal, a tin of</seg><seg type="columnLine">salted butter, a package of raisins, a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">powdered chocolate. Delicacies for any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one in the North, a boon to Joan whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was sick or not!

As</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as being equipped with a land-gate, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northwest fort boasted a water-gate, part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stockade extending out over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, enclosing a little harbor entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a heavy log barrier that was raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">by ropes on capstan-like drums inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carlisle saw that the water-gate stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">open and that it was Richelieu's plan to</seg><seg type="columnLine">slide the York boats, cargoes and all, inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">his palisades.

For Wayne's</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt was no mere hostile raid. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a serious venture forced by the dire need</seg><seg type="columnLine">of better sustenance, and the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Richelieu had outwitted them as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlisle was bitter as hemlock drink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wayne brooded over it continually, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brooding finally brought him to a reluc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant decision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the Doom, Joan, I'll have to send</seg><seg type="columnLine">you out," he told her, his eyes dwelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">longingly upon her.

The Hudson's Bay men knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the depth of the water, a knowledge that</seg><seg type="columnLine">their enemies lacked, and therein lay their</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage and Carlisle's strategy. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">total unexpectedness of the move lent it</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the greater force, and the number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carlisle's officers distributed throughout</seg><seg type="columnLine">the line ensured perfect unison of effort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Galt, Drummond, Lewis, Jarvis, Hamp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, Garry, Lea, Missowa and Waseyawin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the lesser clerks were personally respon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible for the men undertheir command, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw to it that all moved in concert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus it was an unbroken row of men that</seg><seg type="columnLine">barred an unbroken row of canoes, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the occupants of the canoes could jump</seg><seg type="columnLine">from craft to boom, and seized their low-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunk gunwales. The clear-headed Todd</seg><seg type="columnLine">smelled disaster the moment the Hudson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bay men launched through the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hades!

To settle a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vexed question he looked for an answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the book. "Everything's in it," was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of his favorite retorts to criticism.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All you have to do is to find the right</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> word." And his shipmates on the Dixie</seg><seg type="columnLine">had long since ceased to hold lightly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advice he gave. Somehow things had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of working out as Reasoner said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the officers turned over to him many</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange problems among the recruits which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the training on the Dixie was to make fit</seg><seg type="columnLine">for places in the big fleet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Dictionary Dick usually found a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way out. In this case it was a petty</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer who was causing trouble. Like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy family the ship's company of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dixie had taken on draft after draft of</seg><seg type="columnLine">recruits, had worked together, molding</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fitting them for duty, until Billy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yonts, chief petty-officer of the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">division, was paid off and Dugan had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take his place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The second division is falling behind,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">complained the first lieutenant.

The men were lined up</seg><seg type="columnLine">for inspection, and the second had showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up poorer than usual in the morning drill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had been "away all boats," and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">division had failed to provide all their</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment, had rowed raggedly, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not kept up in the evolutions. The men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were nervous and full of false movements</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the vicious string of commands from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dugan made them worse instead of better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're a bunch of quitters, sir," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dugan, putting all the contempt that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could into the words and making them</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud enough so that all the division heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're here to help train the men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not find fault with them," spoke the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieutenant sharply. "Find out the cause,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and correct it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This Dugan proceeded to do in his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. The division had no rest from him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">More than half the men went on the report</seg><seg type="columnLine">for trivial infractions of the rules and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">went about their tasks jerkily. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next inspection they had not improved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their nervousness had given place to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sullen resentment at all authority in</seg><seg type="columnLine">general and to Cain Dugan in particular.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The first lieutenant sent for Dugan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your division is not improving," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said severely.

"They're spoiled, but give me</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, and I'll break them."</seg><seg type="columnLine">98</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first lieutenant shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know about that. Maybe you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are too hard on them. Try easing up."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Aye, aye, sir," said Dugan, with as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much anger as he dared, and from then on</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove the division harder than ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AGAIN it was early morning, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men were stopping their clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the line. Little Bryan Weber</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the second had crept out of his hammock</seg><seg type="columnLine">half an hour early, and had just finished</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a big wash. At the line Dugan shoved</seg><seg type="columnLine">him aside and took his place--a place</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward where the wet clothing was in no</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger of swinging against the stays and</seg><seg type="columnLine">being soiled. This was not the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">that little Weber had been roughly handled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Dugan. The other times he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid to resent it, but now after weeks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad treatment he could stand it no longer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and revolted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get out of my place," he cried shrilly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I was there first."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dugan paid no attention.

Dugan</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken a special dislike to him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">continually gave him the worst end of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the watches and lookouts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Robbed of his place and ignored, Weber</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beside himself with rage and humili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation, and Cain Dugan had the surprise of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bullying life when the boy charged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking blindly with both fists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why you little devil," said Dugan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Haven't I taught you anything yet?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he struck with one of his big fists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boy whirled dizzily, and fell back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward across the deck at the feet of Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reasoner.

He was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignorant of the finer rules and science of</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxing, but chose to ignore them for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">freer display of his brute strength. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">game was to tear his opponent down, over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelm his defense, trample him under foot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without further warning he drove in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking wickedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reasoner met the attack unexpectedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Other men had always given way before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dugan's vicious rush. It was to be ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected that this rather slow and reluctant</seg><seg type="columnLine">opponent would do the same, but Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reasoner was no longer slow. His body</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffened as if the material in him had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly tempered into spring steel. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">long loose-jointed frame drew into itself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">became compact, finely knit, a working</seg><seg type="columnLine">unit of perfectly coordinated parts. Du-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan's rush met a swifter one from the made-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Reasoner. Before his adversary could</seg><seg type="columnLine">gather momentum he had landed two</seg><seg type="columnLine">punishing blows where they would do the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most good. Dugan shook his head side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways to offset the shock, and stepped back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His charge had been ruined by this quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reasoner gave him no rest, no chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to draw breath. All the half-forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">science that he had ignored, Dugan used</seg><seg type="columnLine">for defense, and all his wonderful store of</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength he called on to withstand the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shower of blows. As he fought he threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened and abused, but the silent Reasoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">met all his rushes with swifter attacks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued to lash out blows that Dugan at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first ignored, and then came to dread.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It does my heart good to see old Dic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionary Dick in action," said Slim Higgins</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the group that surrounded the two men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Shift into Reverse</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">99</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Dugan had it in his head that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">boss of the ship.

It made</seg><seg type="columnLine">him furious, and he began to use his head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Covering up as best he could, he saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">his strength for another rush. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting lighter, and by Reasoner's side</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a spot of soapy deck. He maneuvered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get Reasoner on it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slim Higgins saw the danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look out for the soap to the left, Dick,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he called. "He's workin' you over to it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The warning came too late. Dugan</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed with all the power of his carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarded strength. Reasoner slipped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soap and went down. Before he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">get up, Dugan had leaped at his prostrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, feet first. What he meant to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to put Reasoner out by jumping on</seg><seg type="columnLine">him with his one hundred and eighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds. Reasoner squirmed aside, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Dugan tried again, lay face up on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shame!

As Dugan jumped Reasoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck upward with his feet, catching</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dugan in the stomach.

Dugan</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunted as they struck him, and his weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">sagged down inertly over Reasoner, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">with another heave threw him backward</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the deck.

He recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">no power but force, and while he respected</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reasoner, he felt that no other man on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship had a right to consideration, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">even under his increased driving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">division began to improve in its work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you account for it?" asked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Slim. "Dugan is about as bad as ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his bunch, but they're doin' better.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They're snappier in the drills and don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">look so hopeless."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are beginning to see that Dugan</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't invincible," said Reasoner.

'Batty' McGinnis</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprung it on me when he was watchin' this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dugan makin' it hard on the Weber kid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Batty told me something else.

That officer woke the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first lieutenant, and after a few minutes'</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigation the captain was called. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">passenger steamer Senator was afire, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire was beyond control of the crew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">100</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Being forward, the ship was afraid to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the wind toward shore on account of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fanning the flames aft, and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking for help.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Dixie was a bare hundred miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, and the nearest other ship was three</seg><seg type="columnLine">times that.

When the Dixie picked her up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she asked that rescue hurry, as the passen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers were demanding to be allowed to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the boats, which the officers refused to do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as long as the Senator could steam back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward toward land, and there was a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of getting control of the fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Dixie answered that she was coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">at full speed, and the final word from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Senator was that the fire was gaining, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would be barely time to get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers to safety before the ammunition</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be in danger.

It was hard, exciting work. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers came first, some of them cool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some half-hysterical, most of them insisting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on bringing their baggage. The Dixie's</seg><seg type="columnLine">men mingled with the crew of the Senator,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifting children and women into the boats,</seg><seg type="columnLine">comforting the frightened, keeping back</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cowardly able-bodied who pushed for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward for first places.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cain Dugan had returned for his second</seg><seg type="columnLine">load. The Senator's boats and those from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Dixie had thinned out the passengers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dugan was his usual self. On his first trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had quarreled with a sailor from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Senator, and knocked the man down when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sought to take a place in the boat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get out," he said harshly. "We'll get</seg><seg type="columnLine">you in plenty of time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the man came on, and Dugan struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.

"I intend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">report you for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this had not improved Dugan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">temper. On the way over he had abused</seg><seg type="columnLine">his crew for slowness, when they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowing as if in a race, for the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were taking part in a rescue, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the fire might reach the ammunition</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Senator and blow her up at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Shift into Reverse</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IOI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">minute, was stimulation enough for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngsters. Until Dugan railed at them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had forgotten how they hated him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alongside the Senator a few passengers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a part of the crew who had been re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved from the fire-fighting, came into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat at once, but when there was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">room for half a dozen more, they stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming. Dugan stepped out of the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ran up the ship's gangway to the deck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wanted to get a full load before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoved off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man met him at the top. He wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">no hat, his face was scorched, his eyes red.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Help!" he cried, in a voice full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shut up yappin'," ordered Dugan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You grown men give me a pain, actin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a lot of babies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My wife," explained the man, resenting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other's tone, "not me.

Here are two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the rescue ship.

The man's revolver lay on a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">table at one side of the room. Dugan</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped quickly forward and secured it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman's eyes followed him fasci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cain!" she cried, "Cain Dugan! Stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, John! He'll kill you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her voice rose into the hysterical note of</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolute terror, and as her husband turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Dugan she repeated the warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a barely audible whisper as she passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into unconsciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Alice," said Cain Dugan, addressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman as if she could still hear what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was saying. "The devil is good to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own. I knew that the big chance would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come.

Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">addressed the man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you are John Ryan.

"I will shoot you</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a moment and then carry the woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to the boats. She has fainted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't see me do it, but then that allows</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to tell my own tale when I come to trial.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A man mustn't expect too much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John Ryan was no coward.

Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't he thought of the pistol! He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid it out so that it would be at hand if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he needed it, and the precaution had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dugan's opportunity. When Dugan's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardened into a resolution to fire he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop his wife and leap at his enemy, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">until then what? The sight of little Bryan</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weber gave him an idea. The boy stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the door and a little behind Dugan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You forget the man with you," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ryan. "He will have a different tale</seg><seg type="columnLine">from yours.

"These two people love one an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other and are happy together. You shan't</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it. You may threaten all you like, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will tell on you as sure as I live if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot this man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You won't live, you little squealer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Say you'll keep your mouth shut or I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin on you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned the pistol toward the boy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but before he could point it, Ryan had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped the opportunity and hurled him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self forward, letting his wife slip to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. One of his clutching hands struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gun and knocked it to the deck as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">grappled with Dugan. Weber leaped for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it as swiftly as a cat jumps for a mouse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and caught it up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dugan had recovered from the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock of the other's attack. Pulling Ryan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands from his throat he hurled him across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deck, and as the man stumbled to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet met him with a blow in the face which</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent him down beside his wife. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to Weber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gimme that gun," he ordered. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to finish this job before this old wagon</seg><seg type="columnLine">blows up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" said Weber, backing away, "leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">them alone or I'll shoot."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shoot!" dared Dugan, still advancing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You haven't got the nerve. You poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">chicken-hearted mama's boy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Weber had his back to the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep off!" he begged. "I don't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shoot."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You bet you don't," scoffed Dugan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made a flying leap at the boy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He really thought that his cruel treat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment on the Dixie had broken the younger</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's spirit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Weber fired twice. He was quick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">handy with a revolver, and led his division</seg><seg type="columnLine">in small-arm practise. Dugan plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">blindly on, struck the wall as Weber</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodged, and slumped down on deck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Both shots had hit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ryan was trying to get to his feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weber helped him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shot him," he sobbed. "I'll help</seg><seg type="columnLine">you carry your wife out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Together the two men picked up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">still unconscious woman and groped their</seg><seg type="columnLine">way down the smoke-filled' passage. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">they left the stateroom the door slammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut behind them and the latch caught.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The people on deck had thinned out</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Weber and Ryan reached the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. "Hurry down the gangway," advised</seg><seg type="columnLine">a smoke-blackened sailor, "there's a boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">just about to shove off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There are two places in the boat, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weber had Ryan go with his wife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jump aboard, kid," advised the Sena-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor's officer who was in charge. "You look</seg><seg type="columnLine">all in and you are light."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," said Weber, "I'll wait for my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat. It's on the way back now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His mind was confused as to what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Dixie's boat that Dugan had come in</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been filled with passengers and shoved</seg><seg type="columnLine">off to its own ship without waiting for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men absent, and now it was coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">back with Dick Reasoner in charge. Weber</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw him as he refused to get in the Senator's</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat. He felt that Reasoner would under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand about Dugan and he wanted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">help. The boat shoved off and he stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the lower gangway and waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before the boat arrived other men</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined him on the platform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's going fast," said one. "There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one bulkhead left between the ammu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nition and the fire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The captain is relieving the men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fo2tting his papers together," answered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. "There's two boats waiting along-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the other gangway to take off the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fire-hose men and the officers."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Above him Weber could hear the roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the flames and it seemed as if the noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew momentarily louder. He turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Shift into Reverse</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">103</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the men by him. Maybe it wasn't right</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wait for Reasoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's a man down in stateroom</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve," he blurted out, "he's hurt-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Twelve, you say," interrupted the man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, I wouldn't go back into twelve for</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the money in the world. It's next the</seg><seg type="columnLine">refrigerator plant, and the ammonia pipes</seg><seg type="columnLine">are breaking. Not for me. How do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know there's somebody there yet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Weber did not answer, for Dick Rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soner's boat was alongside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's Dugan?" asked Reasoner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Things are looking mighty bad, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to get all our men off.

"He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">in stateroom twelve and can't get out. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't lift him by myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," said Reasoner cheerfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Jump out, half a dozen of you, and follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weber."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not a man of the second division moved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They did not intend to undergo even a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight risk for the sake of the hated Dugan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reasoner had feared this. His first thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that if the men of the division would</seg><seg type="columnLine">help Dugan the man might feel grate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful enough to relax a little in his severity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the feeling against him had gone too</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep. The second did not care what</seg><seg type="columnLine">became of Dugan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come now," persisted Reasoner. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how it is, but this has to be done.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would go myself if I didn't think it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">do more good to have you go. There's no</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No danger!" exclaimed one of the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the gangway, and just ready to step into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat. "Number twelve is right at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire, and word has just come that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage is filled with ammonia gas from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ice-tanks. The whole blooming ship is</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely to go fluey any minute!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Out you go," insisted Reasoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was sorry now that he had issued the</seg><seg type="columnLine">order, but once given he felt that it must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be obeyed for the good of the division.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His tone was sharp, incisive, the men re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spected and liked him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The two forward thwarts," he directed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We'll do it for you," said one of the men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the four stepped on to the gangway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weber ran in front of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The more we hurry, the safer it will be,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he encouraged, but those following did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">increase their pace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll see how it looks," muttered one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As Weber plunged into the smoke they</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated, ran after him for a few paces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then slowed to a walk. A man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head tucked into his arm and dragging</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hose, bumped into them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get out of here!" he directed. "Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain's orders. Take your places for aban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">don ship!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The four stopped. Weber had disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared in the smoke down the passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's it to me about Dugan?" said</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. "I'm for taking the safety-first route.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What do you say, fellows? We can tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reasoner that we couldn't make it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where's Weber?" asked another. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate to let the kid go on alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When he finds out he's alone, he'll come</seg><seg type="columnLine">on out," said the first speaker. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't find him now if we went on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so it was that the four men trailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the clearer air on deck, and at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion of the leader decided to wait a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes for Weber before they reported</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Reasoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CAIN DUGAN only lapsed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete unconsciousness for a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes. The shock of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel-jacketed bullets, the first one through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his upper body, and the other through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right arm and shoulder as he extended his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm to catch the gun, wore off quickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as he sat up on the deck he saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Left me to burn," he muttered, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll fool 'em yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he sought to pull himself to his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall. Half-way up his unin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jured arm gave way, and he sank down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The kid did shoot," he said weakly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I thought I had him busted."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both of Dugan's wounds were bleeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">freely, and he could feel himself losing</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength. To reach the passage outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">and get through the smoke to the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck, he must lose no time. With his unin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jured hand, he bound a part of his blouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the arm, wadded the remainder</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a pack over his. body wound, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to crawl to the door. Twice on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the journey he stopped to rest, but kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">on doggedly. The smoke interfered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his breathing, and the injured arm dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">uselessly, making his progress difficult.</seg><seg type="columnLine">104</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only by calling on the last reserve of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great strength was he able to gain the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a full minute he lay panting before it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then inch by inch he raised himself, caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knob and turned it. The door did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">open. The latch was a foot higher up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Dugan, stupid with pain, sank to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor before he realized the trouble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door opened inboard. Once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dugan pulled himself up by the knob.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then with infinitely greater effort, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained the additional foot to the latch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even pulled it back, and sought to open the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, but his inert body blocked him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The door came open an inch and no more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for one of Dugan's knees, which he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerless to move, was in the way. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast of smoke and the stifling sting of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ammonia gas in his nostrils, sent him</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeling backward, and an awkward foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">slammed the door again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flat on the deck, Dugan realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not open the door, that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not raise himself to the knob again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless more strength came to him, that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not even move. This was a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling to Dugan. Always there had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">an abundance of strength to do with as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished, to override all oppositions, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make others obey him, and now he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly shorn of it all and left to die</seg><seg type="columnLine">miserably by a man he had sworn to kill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman whom he had taught to fear him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a boy whose courage he despised.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rage and humiliation burned in his soul,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as he lay helpless they cooled some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what, and left only bitterness and a clearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision of his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Always he had been unhappy, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">always he had dominated and ruled bru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tally. And now facing the end, he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">why no one came to get him out, why little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weber, driven into a corner, had fired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">why men loved Dick Reasoner, and fled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him. Knew the whole volume of hate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that its answer in a crisis was failure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Realized fully that love and hate are like</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysteries of the soul, and that the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man gives of each, the more he gets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It can't be long now," he groaned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimly looking up at the closed door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The smell of the gas came to him a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger, and he closed his eyes. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">stung with the increasing smoke, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">eased the irritation, but the noise of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire became louder, and he had to open them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he did so, the door burst open, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Bryan Weber came in with head bent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose in his wet neckkerchief. Dugan</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought his eyes were tricking him until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy began shaking him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Help's coming," he cried. "Talk to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dugan. Are you alive? I came back as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as I could get help. I tried to put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets in your shoulders."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dugan's good arm pulled the boy down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weber leaped back, breaking the hold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't be afraid," whispered Dugan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I won't hurt you.

But this time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved barely a foot before he stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to his knees and from his knees to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach. As he tried to struggle up again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">letting go of his burden, a strong hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted him and shoved him down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage. It was Reasoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll bring Dugan," he said. "Get on</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and take your place in the boat."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weber obeyed. What Dick Reasoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised, he would do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the men sent with Weber reported</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the smoke had driven them out, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Weber had gone on alone, Reasoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed what had happened, for he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the men of the second did not intend</seg><seg type="columnLine">to risk much to save Dugan, and that in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke it would be difficult to find stateroom</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve. So he went to the rescue himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thought he was lucky when he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weber and Dugan in the passage. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weber went on at his orders, he picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy man in the approved first-aid</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner, and bore him to comparative</seg><seg type="columnLine">safety on deck. The officers of the Senator</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rounding up the last members of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire-fighters, and getting them into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boats.

The four who had failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow Weber kept their eyes in the boat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Reasoner did not speak to them. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that when the whole story of Weber's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heroism came out, they would be punished</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With temporary bandages in place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dugan lay in the stern-sheets of the boat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reasoner had the tiller, and Weber, too</seg><seg type="columnLine">weak to pull an oar, sat aft also.

She did not realize that</seg><seg type="columnLine">her visitor was deep in a mathematical prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lem and making an exceedingly boggy ford</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it. One and one will simply not make</seg><seg type="columnLine">four no matter how many times you add or</seg><seg type="columnLine">multiply them together. But Johnny was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a persistent soul.

But his two</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends did not seek to further that wish.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their earnest desire was to make it a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening. To which end they hung Johnny</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and themselves over the bar of the Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">Card and invited all and sundry to join</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny took a small part of one drink,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after which, by the exercise of some strategy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all his natural agility, he contrived to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape through a rear window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Standing well back and to one side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">splayed light from the window, Johnny</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard Soapy and Jim call on him by name,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and finally leave hurriedly by the front door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let 'em hunt," he grinned. "Me, I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned and looked along the irregular</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of rear elevations. There was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Golden Rule--those three small glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows. Beyond it the houses were dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">--private residences. Beyond these again</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a dim light--the stage station. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark bulk adjoining the stage station was, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, the rear of the Broken Dollar saloon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gambling-joint. There were six win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows and a doorway in the rear wall of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broken Dollar's back room, but all were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Slay's shore economical o' light in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">back room," was Johnny's idle comment, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he started toward the stage company's</seg><seg type="columnLine">corrals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny's objective was the Broken Dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar, which palace of chance he intended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">surreptitiously approach from the other end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Main Street in order that his friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">might not see him enter. For, should they</seg><seg type="columnLine">see him, they would undoubtedly join him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his better protection. And Johnny</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished to study his enemy unhampered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">any one. That Slay was his most vindictive</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy was certain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Why?

As has been stated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny was no marvel on the draw, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed the ability to shoot accurately</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the hip and through the bottom of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny, skirting the rear of the stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">company's two corrals, turned the corner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second enclosure and fell over the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jecting tongue of a tiltless freight-wagon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He arose, swearing softly and rubbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">barked shins.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt about for it in the darkness, and swore</seg><seg type="columnLine">124</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">some more. He found it, and straightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as the six windows in the back room of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Broken Dollar sprang into dusty radi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance and a line of light showed yellowly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom of the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That door always did hang slanchways,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed Johnny, and thoughtfully edged</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the freight-wagon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door opened. For an instant the</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of a woman was silhouetted against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light within, then the door closed behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the freight-wagon to the Broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dollar was not more than seventy yards.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny heard the tink of a kicked tin can.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A high heel clicked on a flat stone. A tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">angular splotch of white, gliding toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">freight-wagon, gradually took shape in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness. The white splotch reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind wheels, and Johnny heard the pleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper of silk. Noiselessly Johnny scut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled to the safer shelter of the corral stock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ade. Body flattened against the posts, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The white splotch appeared at the fore</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels of the freight-wagon, and bobbed up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward as the woman swung herself into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver's seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Followed then the scratch of a drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">match. Johnny stared. The woman was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighting a cigaret. The pulsing flame re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed the face of Slay's sister, Mrs. Lotta</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wallace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this close range her extreme beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more than ever apparent. The black</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair growing low in a widow's peak on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead, the finely arched eyebrows, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long and curving eyelashes, the straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose, the wide, full-lipped mouth, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm and pointed chin above the round,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth throat and lovely shoulders, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">individually sufficiently striking. In com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bination with each other the effect was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewildering. Yet Johnny was left cold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He remembered Scotty's leopard and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came colder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The situation was becoming impossible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The spark that was Mrs. Wallace's cigaret</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not twenty feet distant. At any mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment the lady might climb down, walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the stockade and discover him. Nat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urally, she would think he was spying on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, and to be suspected of that by such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown quantity as Slay's sister was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinkable. Why hadn't he kept on going</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the stockade when he had the oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity? Scotty was right. He was a fine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">detective, making mistakes this way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny sweated clammily and breathed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">little as possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he saw Mrs. Wallace's cigaret</seg><seg type="columnLine">describe a firefly arc in the air and strike the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground in a sputter of sparks. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sound of a movement on the driver's</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat. Wasn't the woman ever coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">down?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A long minute's silence, then a whisper--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God, what a life!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The exclamatory sentence was followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a pronounced sniffle, then more sniffles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and finally choky little sobs. It was evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent that Mrs. Wallace was striving to fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">down her emotion. But her grief was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">great to be stifled easily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wish I were dead!" she moaned, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to cry quietly and steadily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny, hating himself acutely, began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">itch between the shoulders. The itch wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself out after centuries of torture and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cramp fastened sullenly on the muscles of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left foot. Something alive and many-legged</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell off the stockade and landed on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. The something crawled along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shoulder to his neck and tickled his ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With infinite caution he raised a nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, removed a night-riding spider and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deavored to drop the loathsome thing at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance. With the perversity of vermin it</seg><seg type="columnLine">clung whole-heartedly to his finger, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was forced to slat it off against a post of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stockade, detaching in the process a loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of dry bark. The bark fell with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustle. Johnny caught his breath, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensed his muscles for a flying start. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound of weeping abated not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny took heart of hope and a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath. The taking of the latter was inju-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicious. For many months dust of the cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ral, stirred into action by the hoofs of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage-horses, had been sifting and settling</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind that loose piece of bark. The fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">thereof released an atomic cloud that, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intake of the long breath, promptly smote</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sensitive membrane of Johnny's nos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trils.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny gritted his teeth, violently rubbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nose, and otherwise by main strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a robust will contrived to suffocate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneeze before it was born. He almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangled in the effort, and was left with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tear-wet eyes and throbbing temples. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had made not the slightest sound. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Wallace wept on forlornly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny's gambling spirit urged him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hidden Trails</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">125</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">take a chance on departure. Between</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiders and itchings and incipient sneezes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the locality was fast losing its charm. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of the many tin cans held him</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. There was an ancient cast-off stove</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere about, too. If he should fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">over that!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Centuries became eons, and eons became</seg><seg type="columnLine">eternity before there was an appreciable</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessening of that distressful sobbing on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wagon-seat. Johnny's first-formed esti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate of Mrs. Wallace had been gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">altering. By the time her sobs gave way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">long-drawn gasping breaths his opinion</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly opposed that of Scotty. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not understand how she could remind Scotty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a leopard. Why, she was just a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">wretched girl, crying her heart out, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all. Johnny felt quite sorry for her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Which, could he have but known it, is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">most dangerous feeling when the lady con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerned is as beautiful as was Mrs. Wallace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE WAS a deep sigh from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aforesaid lady, and then a rustling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a scraping as she swung down</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the double-tree to the ground. White</seg><seg type="columnLine">shawl trailing across one shoulder she headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">back toward the Broken Dollar. Johnny</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched legs and arms in aching relief and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodged 'round the pole of the freight-wagon</seg><seg type="columnLine">to where he could follow her with his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw her figure become one with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness and then reappear with magic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantern abruptness under one of the lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">windows of the Broken Dollar. Here she</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted, produced from her bosom a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittering object, held it before her face, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dabbed at her features with an article the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size and shape of a small apple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Powderin' her face, poor li'l thing,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">commented Johnny. "I'll bet her eyes are</seg><seg type="columnLine">some swole."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The back door of the saloon opened. Slay</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in the doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lotta! Lotta!" he called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here I am," she replied, almost at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">elbow. "There's no need to yell your head</seg><seg type="columnLine">off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Didn't see you," he said crossly. "Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">in here quick. What's the matter with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you? Why did you leave the wheel?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because I felt like it!" she flung back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothing a perfect eyebrow with the ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her thumb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I see. Suppose you come in then--</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you feel like it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When I feel like it, I will."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She powdered her nose again with mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dening deliberation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come in here at once!" The command</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost most of its force because Slay pettishly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamped his foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course, you frighten me to death</seg><seg type="columnLine">when you do that," she observed sweetly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why don't you drag me in by the hair?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Are you coming in?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I meant to, but since you've been so</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant, I think I'll go home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slay stepped back and slammed shut the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. Mrs. Wallace returned mirror and</seg><seg type="columnLine">powder-puff to their hiding-place, blew a</seg><seg type="columnLine">kiss at the closed door, and walked slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">'round the corner of the building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shore got a mind of her own, that one,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked Johnny. "Maybe she ain't such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a poor li'l tiling after all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pondering the unexpectedness of woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny cautiously diagonaled across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open ground to where, beyond the outer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most shack, Main Street became a trail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here he turned townward and, walking lei-</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely, came to the Broken Dollar, pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">open the door, and entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The long wide barroom was filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tobacco-smoke and customers. The to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bacco-smoke hung in layers in the atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere. The customers hung in suspense</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the turn of the cards and the caprice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a tiny ball dancing within a sunken wheel</seg><seg type="columnLine">of many pockets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny did not pause at the door. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked without haste between the tables to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bar at the other end of the room. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were only three men standing at the bar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One was the hard-faced Tom Keen, he of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two guns, Ganev of the dyed mustache,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a sharp-featured citizen known as Spill</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harper. These three turned and surveyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as he approached. Johnny gave them</seg><seg type="columnLine">stare for stare, fronted up to the bar, rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a quarter and called for whisky. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bartender shoved forward a bottle and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass. Johnny poured out a scant two fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers, cupped his left hand 'round the glass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leaned sidewise against the bar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His attitude was lazy and his demeanor</seg><seg type="columnLine">careless, but his half-shut sardonic eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed no detail of what was passing under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hanging lamps in that big room. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceived that fully half the men in the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">were neglecting their play to watch him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of them nudged each other and whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered among themselves, but when his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">126</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fell upon these they ceased nudging and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispering and affected an air of extreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconcern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Johnny's gaze fell upon the roulette</seg><seg type="columnLine">table he smiled slightly. He understood</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slay's anger at Mrs. Wallace's defection.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harry Slay was behind the table now, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the patronage was slim. With his sister to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spin the wheel roulette would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most popular game in the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The gambler's face as he dropped the ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">and worked the lever was wooden. He paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took in bets without once lifting his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the level of the table. Abruptly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to a friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Spin her, will you, Bill?" he asked. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a little matter of business to</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrange."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shore," replied friend Bill, and Slay</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped out from behind the table and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked straight toward Johnny Ramsay</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing at the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny had not been expecting any such</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden move as this, but he was in readi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iness. The heel of his right hand just</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the butt of his gun. Slay's hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">were swinging at his sides, but this meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. Johnny had seen Slay throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">down once before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Slay approached Johnny the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">following the hasty shuffling of folk intent</seg><seg type="columnLine">on leaving the zone of fire, became as still as</seg><seg type="columnLine">midnight in a church. Johnny wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Slay's bullet would make its little</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole. He himself intended to put as many</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces of lead as he could into Slay's abdo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. Johnny had killed three men since</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to punch cows for a living. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had killed them in an impersonal way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is, at long range, with a rifle. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">borne^no special animosity against these</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. He had shot them simply as a mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of course. They had been rustlers, out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laws of the range, wolves to be destroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on sight. And he had not seen them die.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But here was a man he must shoot at</seg><seg type="columnLine">close range with a six-shooter. How would</seg><seg type="columnLine">it feel to perforate an enemy and watch him</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass out under one's very eyes. It sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly struck him that he himself would in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all likelihood be too dead to observe with</seg><seg type="columnLine">any thoroughness the demise of another.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The idea tickled his sense of humor, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled audibly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not ten feet away Slay halted, his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">held well away from his sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looking for me?" Slay asked, his pale</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">slanting eyes meeting Johnny's fixed gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">stare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I never hunt trouble," replied Johnny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Any hard feelings?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never use 'em."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have a drink?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shore."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bartender made ludicrous haste to</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve the boss and Johnny. Eye to eye the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men drank off their liquor. Johnny, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">etiquette required, called for another round.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They drank again. Then Slay nodded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny, mentioned that he would see him</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, and went back to his roulette table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The incident was closed, and the spectators</seg><seg type="columnLine">resumed their pursuit of pleasure with noisy</seg><seg type="columnLine">avidity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny, standing alone at the bar--Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keen, Ganey and Spill Harper had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">elsewhere--sought to probe the true inward-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the gambler's motive in seeking peace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Trying to make me believe he's willin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be friendly," he reflected. "But he shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a bigger man than I took him to be, cornin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">right out an' facin' it thisaway.

He stared at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">without friendliness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Won't you talk to me? I've already</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked you three times."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had closed her parasol and now stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her hands clasped over the round</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle. There was a talented patch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">court-plaster on her left cheek-bone. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips were slightly parted and her eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmly pleading. She was very lovely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she wanted him to talk to her. W'hat</seg><seg type="columnLine">small hands she had. The prospect of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long afternoon, full of empty hours and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shimmering heat, decided Johnny.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ma'am, I'd shore admire to talk to yuh,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he declared solemnly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's dear of you to say that," she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I know you don't mean it, but I really</seg><seg type="columnLine">would like to make up to you for Dorothy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">absence if--if I could and you'd let me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was spreading the jam rather thick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, but man is an obtuse animal. Johnny</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I guess now you an' I'd oughta get along</seg><seg type="columnLine">together real well," was his hearty endorse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Wallace smiled, and a fugitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimple showed for an instant in her right</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suppose we go over to my house," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested. "It's near the river, and there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost always some breeze."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That shore listens well," said Johnny.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let's go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went. Half Main Street saw them</seg><seg type="columnLine">go, and the whole town knew it ten minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just watch her grin at him!" urged Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mace, flattening a snubby nose against a</seg><seg type="columnLine">window-pane in her kitchen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the first time I ever seen her out</seg><seg type="columnLine">walkin' with a man," declared Mrs. Rags-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dale. "Move over, dear. I can't see a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. She's wearin' the gray again, ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">she? Makes her look hump-shouldered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shore does, an' that rose-color ain't fit</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a sallow thing like her to wear. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasn't color enough. Look! Look! See</seg><seg type="columnLine">her walk close to him. The brazen</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I always knew she was a hussy for all her</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet ways. The cat!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, she's a sly minx. They're the ones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ella. The putty-faced things who act as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if butter wouldn't melt in their mouths,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they're the ones to look out for."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's skinny as a rail," contributed Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ragsdale, holding resolutely to the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">road. "I'll bet her legs ain't thicker'n</seg><seg type="columnLine">matches."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whose legs ain't thicker'n matches?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Jim Mace, entering at the moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None of your business," his wife told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "Didja see that widow woman an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny Ramsay?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Y'betcha. Johnny always was a lucky</seg><seg type="columnLine">jigger."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, is that so? Well, if you think so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Mace, I'll just thank you to keep such</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinions to yoreself, an' don't you forget it</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither! C'mon, Ella, let's go in the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. I believe she's takin' him home, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">128</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">if they sit on the porch we can watch 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Mrs. Wallace and Johnny did not sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the porch. The fascinating widow knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about a small town, and she took her</seg><seg type="columnLine">guest into the house. The puncher's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">widened at sight of the sitting-room and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointments. There were several water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors and three small paintings on the walls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Above the door the mounted head of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">buffalo bull faced a splendid Sioux war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonnet hanging on the opposite wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chairs, broad and deep, a wide table, a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">sofa covered with fat pillows, a book-case</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of books, and a thick, soft carpet com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted the picture. Even the sitting-room</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Bar-S was not so fine as this</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. Johnny moved cautiously. Spurs are</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratchy things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Wallace excused herself and van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished through a doorway hung with a pair</seg><seg type="columnLine">of striped Zuni blankets. Johnny slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the carpet to the nearest chair. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat, having care to his spin's, and absent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mindedly pulled out the makings. He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered his manners as he was on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of striking a match and disgustedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot the white roll out of the window. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to wish he hadn't come. It was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">fun sitting alone this way. Where was Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wallace anyway?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment she pushed aside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zuni blankets and came toward him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling delightfully. She was carrying a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small tray. There were two tall glasses and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a square bottle on that tray. Times im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately began to improve. Johnny's</seg><seg type="columnLine">somber eye brightened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may not like this," she said, hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out the tray. "It's something I invent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed myself. I call it Texas Pete."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Texas Pete was of a light brown color and</seg><seg type="columnLine">both glasses were full of him. Johnny's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers wrapped themselves 'round one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glasses. Mrs. Wallace took the other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">set the tray on the table, and sat down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sofa. She tucked one leg under her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swung the other child-fashion. Rais-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the glass to her lips, she looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny across the rim and sipped slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny did not sip slowly. He was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed to drinking that way. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowered the half-emptied glass to the arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the chair and grinned cheerfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Reg'lar shore 'nough drink," he assured</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. "What's in it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She told him. He stared aghast at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tale of ingredients, and looked down at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass with sudden respect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One more o' this here Texas gent an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd shore push the bridge over," said he.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, ma'am, no more. I'll just finish this</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' call it a day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're not going yet!" she exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">piteously. "Oh, you mustn't! I'll be so</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonely if you do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more the jam and the trowel. Such</seg><seg type="columnLine">flattery would have held Johnny even if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had intended going, which he hadn't.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wasn't thinkin' o' goin'," he told her</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an ease born of Texas Pete and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady's blandishments. "Can I smoke?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Surely. Try one of mine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did, and she taught him how two ciga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rets may be simultaneously lit by the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">match. Besides being economical this</seg><seg type="columnLine">method of starting a smoke has a charm all</seg><seg type="columnLine">its own. Of course it necessitated Johnny's</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving to the sofa. He did not return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chair. With every passing minute he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was feeling more at home. He almost for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">got that the lady's brother was his enemy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He watched her leaning back among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffy cushions. Her eyes were deep as</seg><seg type="columnLine">wells. Then it suddenly struck him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the last hour he had been doing most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the talking. She had asked questions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently casual questions, but they re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired lengthy answers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," he said with a slight laugh, "I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore warmed up to-day. Bet I've talked</seg><seg type="columnLine">an arm off yuh."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't stop," she begged, in her earnest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness leaning forward and clasping her hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">'round her silken knee. "I'm enjoying it so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I just love to hear how men do things."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do yuh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course. Tell me some more about</seg><seg type="columnLine">those Indians. Did they keep right • on</seg><seg type="columnLine">stealing horses?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nobody keeps right on stealin' hosses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ma'am. He steals one hoss too many an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets stretched. An' them Injuns did an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">they was."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose it always turns out that way,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said she softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes'm, an' it's always that one hoss too</seg><seg type="columnLine">many does it," he moralized. "If a gent</seg><seg type="columnLine">would only be satisfied. But 'No,' he says,</seg><seg type="columnLine">'when it comes to stealin' hosses I'm the</seg><seg type="columnLine">original Solomon forty ways from the Jack,'</seg><seg type="columnLine">an' out he prances, foolish an' certain, an'</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloms on to that extra cayuse. It's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same in everythin' else thataway, ma'am--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hidden Trails</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">129</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">killin', hold-ups, an' all. They ain't no</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And yet nothing seems to stop the road-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agents in this county." She was looking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his face with brilliant eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he admitted, "they seem to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">playin' in right good luck. But you wait.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe yuh'll have to wait a year or two,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe longer, but you wait. They'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">got, ma'am."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sure I hope so," she declared, lean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing back and patting her hair with long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slim fingers. "I had some silk for a gown</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming all the way from Chicago, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage was stopped that trip, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">raining, and they ripped open the package</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left it there in the mud. I could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">wept when the agent told me. My pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow silk ruined! I hope they do catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's shore too bad about yore dress,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sympathized. "Likely them bandits</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know what it was, or they wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">'a' touched it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE WAS watching a tiny pulse on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side of her round throat. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't noticed it before. The little</seg><seg type="columnLine">telltale was throbbing steadily and fast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet the color in her cheeks had not altered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shade. It was her own color, too. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made sure of that at the cigaret-lighting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wish you were the sheriff or a deputy</seg><seg type="columnLine">or something," aud she.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Me? Why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because I believ.e you could catch them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I believe you could do more than this</seg><seg type="columnLine">idiotic sheriff."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's doin' his best, ma'am. Ain't yuh</seg><seg type="columnLine">takin' the loss o' that dress mighty hard?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, it isn't the dress. It's the idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these bandits being able to do what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">please. They make a perfect joke of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff and his men. Oh, if I were a man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'd get out and do something! I'd give</seg><seg type="columnLine">these road-agents a run for their money.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You said yourself there's always one horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">too many. I'd make the Fane job that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse. There are two thousand dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">apiece offered for those bandits. Did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd heard." He nodded a grave head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It would certainly be worth almost any</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's while. I should think you'd try it</seg><seg type="columnLine">out." The brilliant eyes had narrowed ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">so slightly, and the little pulse was beating</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite rapidly now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">9</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I ain't a fool," he said seriously. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never hunt trouble, not never. An' two</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand dollars ain't enough for me to bet</seg><seg type="columnLine">my life against nohow. S'pose now I lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">the life. What good's two thousand wheels</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me? No sirree, you hear me talkin', if</seg><seg type="columnLine">anybody wants to hunt road-agents, let 'em.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wouldn't think o' spoilin' their fun.

"Yuh see, I figure to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spend all my money first.

He thought it was. Mrs. Wallace</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned her eyes away and inspected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pink tips of her pretty fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know," she remarked suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I like you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's--that's fine," said he lamely, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was somewhat taken aback.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," she continued, "you tell funny</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories, and you aren't fresh.

There was one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was not the woman to break her custom</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a mere whim. Johnny wore his best</seg><seg type="columnLine">poker face, but his eye was sardonic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For a storekeeper, Soapy, yo're one wise</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abraham," said Johnny Ramsay, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed the subject with a request for rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">cartridges, caliber 40-65.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Soapy Ragsdale did not stock the</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd calibers. Johnny departed for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Golden Rule. Again he was out of luck--</seg><seg type="columnLine">40-65's were apparently a dead card in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paradise Bend. Johny reflected that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were other towns and other stores and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took heart of hope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That evening Johnny went to see Dorothy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burr.

Somehow he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not feel it was necessary. Why drag her</seg><seg type="columnLine">in?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At dusk Johnny and Laguerre separated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter to ride the trail in to the Bend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the former to cross the Yellow Medicine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, ever keeping that stream on his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, skirt the sprawling length of Crow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mountain, strike the Flying-M trail at</seg><seg type="columnLine">132</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wagon Slue, and arrive in town from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Between eleven and twelve Johnny dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted at the hitching-rail of the Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">Card. He was to meet Laguerre at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three Card. But the half-^reed was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the saloon, nor was he at the Jacks Up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor at Soapy Ragsdale's. Buster was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge of the store, but he didn't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">where pop was. Guessed he must be 'round</seg><seg type="columnLine">some'ers. Johnny guessed so too and, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way to the Broken Dollar, looked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Golden Rule. Cal Mason was there</seg><seg type="columnLine">buying tobacco, and Dan Smith, the mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shal, was picking out a shirt, a beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of savage orange, thickly besprinkled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a chaste design of purple horseshoes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cal Mason greeted Johnny with a grave</seg><seg type="columnLine">"H'are yuh?" behind which lurked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile of friendship, but Dan Smith did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">go beyond a stiff nod. Johnny, his sar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">donic eye fixed on the marshal's ultra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bilious choice, leaned against the counter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, that's what I call a shirt," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed cheerfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I dunno as yuh got any license to call</seg><seg type="columnLine">it anythin'," said the liverish Dan Smith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was just admirin' it, Marshal," in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted Johnny. "No offense, but yuh'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore be right up in style. Back East they</seg><seg type="columnLine">sell shirts like this here so fast that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">factories all have to work overtime. Yessir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore do. An' why, 'cause all the laundry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men buy 'em. No soap-wrastlin' Chink</seg><seg type="columnLine">o' the lot thinks he can go out walkin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sunday afternoons less'n he's inside one o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">these shirts. Funny, ain't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny's eyes were no longer sardonic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were calm and sweetly innocent as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they gazed into the face of the marshal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The latter, very angry, could have slain</seg><seg type="columnLine">him willingly. But there are times when</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take offense means to make oneself</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridiculous. Dan Smith did not wish to</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear ridiculous. He compromised by</seg><seg type="columnLine">according Johnny no further attention and</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking the shirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny, allowing him thirty seconds'</seg><seg type="columnLine">handicap, followed. He was in time to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the marshal pause a hundred feet away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swing his arm, and hurl something in be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween two houses. After which the mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shal went into the Jacks Up Saloon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny hurried to where the marshal had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood and dived into the space between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two houses. Groping purposefully in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness, his fingers encountered a paper-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped parcel. He swept it up and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the street. In the light from</seg><seg type="columnLine">an open window he tore off a corner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapping. A vivid purple horseshoe backed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by savage orange stared him out of coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The marshal, drinking with friends at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jacks Up bar, felt a touch on his shoulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned to behold the too-familiar fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures of Johnny Ramsay. The puncher</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid a parcel on the bar, a parcel from whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn wrapper protruded the tail of Dan</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith's recent purchase.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yore shirt," Johnny announced dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinctly. "Yuh dropped it--in the street."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pause between the two halves of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanatory sentence was obvious. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">marshal knew that he was being maliciously</seg><seg type="columnLine">badgered, and he knew that Johnny knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he knew. But again this was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those times. Besides, Cal Mason, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectantly solemn, was watching from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway. The marshal mumbled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanks, tucked in the dangling shirt-tail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stuck the package under his arm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny went out into the street. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">the delighted Cal Mason fell into step at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yore style suits me," averred Cal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let's licker."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So they crossed the street to the Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">Card and said "How" twice. After which</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceremony Johnny drifted down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broken Dollar and Cal went home to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wife how Scotty Mackenzie's stray man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had run a blazer on Dan Smith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the Broken Dollar Johnny found</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laguerre playing poker with the express-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agent, hard-faced Tom Keen, and one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slay's dealers. Johnny smiled inwardly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the half-breed was skilful at cards, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his skill was costing the others much money.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All the blue chips on the table were in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Laguerre, and a blue chip in the Broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dollar was standard at ten dollars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny, on his way to the bar, passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roulette table. Mrs. Wallace was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind the wheel, and business was very brisk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leaning against the wall at her back stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">her brother. His hands were in his trousers</seg><seg type="columnLine">pockets and a long black cigar was clamped</seg><seg type="columnLine">between his jaws. He glanced at Johnny</seg><seg type="columnLine">with twinkling, merry eyes and nodded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Wallace did not see the puncher. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was busy raking in several bets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While Johnny was still eyeing his first</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink, in marched, to his intense disgust,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hidden Trails</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">133</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Racey Dawson. Racey was not due for</seg><seg type="columnLine">two days, and here he was on the heels of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Telescope. Johnny yearned to tell Racey</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he thought of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS RACEY came through the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way he slapped his side with a full</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweep of both arms. Dust flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him in a gray cloud. His face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashen with it. Grinning widely, he crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor straight to where Johnny stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the bar, and Johnny saw that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dust inside his ears and down his</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thought you'd get away from me, huh?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried Racey, teetering on his heels in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Johnny. "Tried to give me the slip,</seg><seg type="columnLine">huh? Just 'cause I had a li'l business over</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Two Deer an' was maybe, now a</seg><seg type="columnLine">day late, yuh run off an' left me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Racey in his teetering apparently lost his</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance and fell forward against the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mayed Johnny, who foresaw the crumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his plans under Racey's blundering. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Racey's hand, flung out to save himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripped Johnny's arm, and Johnny felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">member squeezed three times before Racey</seg><seg type="columnLine">regained his equilibrium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aw, yuh'd oughta come sooner," Johnny</seg><seg type="columnLine">said instantly. "Djuh think I got nothin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do but wait for yuh while yo're hellin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">'round all over the country?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their voices were not pitched low, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laguerre, facing them at his table across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room, gave no sign that he heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, yuh might 'a' waited," grumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Racey. "Le's irrigate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While they stood in silence, the bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them, a man slouched in from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street and halted inside the doorway. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a stocky citizen with a sandy mustache</seg><seg type="columnLine">and an aggressive chin. He pushed back</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hat and one perceived that his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">was curiously pinched-in at the temples.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This characteristic, combined as it was with</seg><seg type="columnLine">total absence of eyebrows, and a wall-eye,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not make for attractiveness. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">stocky man surveyed the roomful with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold and fishy stare. His oblique gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed over Johnny and Racey and appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently fixed itself on a corner of the bar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still looking at the corner of the bar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wall-eye swaggered bow-leggedly up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Racey Dawson and suggested drinks. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">likewise smiled amiably, revealing the lack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of two upper front teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This here's my friend, Johnny Ram-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">say," said Racey, flicking a tactful thumb</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Johnny. "What might I call you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now I shore did forget to tell yuh my</seg><seg type="columnLine">name, didn't I?" smiled the stranger, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked eye missing Racey by four feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Which she's 'Bale' Harper. Barkeep, got</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lame arm? I'm waitin' for a glass."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bartender hastily slid a bottle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glass across the bar. As the newcomer</seg><seg type="columnLine">tilted the bottle Johnny noticed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third finger of his right hand was cut off</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the second joint. Bale Harper downed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his liquor at a gulp, and instantly poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">out another glassful.

It required the setting of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea, the loneliness of the sea, the brood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing power of vast spaces that inevitably and</seg><seg type="columnLine">inexorably takes possession of the human</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul, kneads it, molds it, goads it to a pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">destined goal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sea is the fate, the master, the Neme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sis of those that follow it; the sea is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great Kismet. And it is more. It is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unalterable past and a sham future; in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">stillness, its loneliness, its vastness, mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ories are mirrored back; and in its depths,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its reposeful beauty, are dreams not of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what will be, shall be, but of what ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, should be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This story is not my story; I was merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">an onlooker, a supernumerary, you may</seg><seg type="columnLine">say; I had no vital part in this drama, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifth act of a man's destiny. This is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story of the sea and of Captain Horace</seg><seg type="columnLine">Findlay and his ship, the Aladdin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During my life at sea I have sailed under</seg><seg type="columnLine">many commanders, and of them all Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Findlay was the strangest, his picture stands</seg><seg type="columnLine">out vividest, sharpest-drawn against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">background of the past. That last impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of him, alone on the bridge in the night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is eternal. But even at first he had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unreal mystifying fascination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seemed to be at once an appeal and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">command. He was heavy-set and taciturn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little up in years--about sixty--rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortish, bald, keen-featured, sailow-com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plexioned. He wore a full beard, black in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terwoven with gray, black that had lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">its color in places, a beard long and square</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gave him a religious, almost patri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">archal appearance. But his eyes were most</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressive--no, impressive is not the word</seg><seg type="columnLine">--they were disconcerting, bewildering as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strange child's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their color was black, a color not uncom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon or remarkable; but the strangeness, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might almost say the weirdness, was in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression. Imagine a perpetual painful</seg><seg type="columnLine">frown, thick eyebrows, long, dark eyelashes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a look that seemed troubled and ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pealing as if questioning Fate. And with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spasmodic restlessness. At times the eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardened. If they were turned at one, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed bright and probing, abnormally so;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but mostly they looked beyond one as if seek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing something, as if seeing into the unseen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the Spring of 1907 I signed on as second</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate in the Aladdin at Liverpool, where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship was owned, and took the train across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country to Newcastle where she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">loading. I was excited. It was to be my</seg><seg type="columnLine">first long trip; the itinerary that the owners</seg><seg type="columnLine">had mapped out to me was:Newcastle, Bom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bay, Colombo, Hongkong; textiles and ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chinery from Newcastle to Bombay, rice</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Bombay to Colombo, tea from Co-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lombo to Hongkong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">141</seg><seg type="columnLine">142</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was becoming aware of the vastness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world; I was going to the vast mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious Orient. The very name had a charm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a fear; it was as far removed from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">commonplaces of existence as the stars are</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the moon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I left Liverpool late one evening, curled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in my seat and slept soundly through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. Before dawn I woke up feeling sick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curious smell was assailing my nose, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">insidious pungent smell. I roused myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked out into the departing night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gas lamps burned feebly in the gloom; two-</seg><seg type="columnLine">story houses, steep-roofed and desolate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">huddled close together along the embank-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. They seemed dead, blind and dead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The windows were dark; black niches in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pervading gloom, empty eye-sockets look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out upon the world unseeing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Farther off somber chimneys reared</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the sky from which rose slowly thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds of smoke, soaring heavenward like</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayers from burning hearts. Farther still I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw glimpses of the dirty gray of the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">where small smoke-emitting things crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and forth incessantly. Above to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north lay the city, clinging to the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">hillside, and above all, the jagged, serrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">skyline of Newcastle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The city had awakened when I stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the train. Slowly I sauntered through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the streets toward the docks. The squalor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the place was unthinkable; concentrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugliness everywhere, and fog. Busses rum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled along the pavement, horse-drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">trucks clattered and screeched 'round cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ners, soot-smirched houses crowded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets. At long intervals there were breaks</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the lines of grimy buildings as if here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there a tooth had rotted down to the jaw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone of rock in the city's multiple rows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Passing along I saw interminable vistas</seg><seg type="columnLine">of whisky signs, gaudy clothing shops, pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lic-houses, restaurants, forbidding ware-</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses. Fat, florid, old women, baskets on</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, strutted about importantly; sailors</seg><seg type="columnLine">strolled along, leisurely, hands tucked far</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the horizontal pockets of their dun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garees; dirty children, barefooted, bare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed, ran about in the March slush at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretense of play. The squalor seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be slowly strangling me. I longed for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, for the East, for the Orient.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last I came to the docks. Here, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the squalor persisted. The Tyne was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credibly dirty, yellowish brown and slug-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gish, a slovenly prostitute of commerce. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">pall of fog and smoke hovered over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water and hid the farther side. Black im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posing bridges, rooted in granite, hung sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended in the air like fingers pointing ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cusingly into the mist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swift, powerful tugs scooted from fog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank to fog-bank, sometimes alone, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times with blunt-nosed barges in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">wake. An irregular fence of masts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">funnels lined the wharves beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ramparts of the dock-sheds, and a noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">as of a carnival of devils rose from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loading and unloading ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again commerce, the strident discords</seg><seg type="columnLine">that constitute the symphony of commerce:</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy rumbling of trucks, the clanking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of chains, the screeching of whistles, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounding of winches, the clanging of bells,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the groaning of donkey-engines, the hiss of</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaping steam. Ships of all nations con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tributed to the turmoil, ships not only from</seg><seg type="columnLine">all parts of Britain, but from Germany,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from France, from Norway, from Russia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Denmark, from Spain, from the Colo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THIS international exposition</seg><seg type="columnLine">of industry and enterprise I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Aladdin, of Liverpool, a fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, a ship to be proud of; long, beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines, a bow that bespoke speed--twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">knots at least--as fine a two-thousand-ton</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamer as I have ever seen. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">loading--it was somewhat of a shock--</seg><seg type="columnLine">printing-presses for Bombay. I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">like it; it did not harmonize with my con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ception of the East. Printing-presses spell</seg><seg type="columnLine">the death of mysticism, of romance, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventure. Printing-presses mean hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">logic and dry facts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Most decidedly I did not like this inva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of the charmed Orient by Occidental</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilization. I liked the other part of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">cargo--textiles--better; it suggested adven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turesome trips into the jungle, trading with</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages, pioneering. Aboard the ship the</seg><seg type="columnLine">longshoremen held sway; all was bustle;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they worked as if anxious to forestall an</seg><seg type="columnLine">impending doom, as if their lives depended</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the quick loading of the disillusioning</seg><seg type="columnLine">printing-presses for Bombay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dodging up the gangway like an escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">thief I made my way amidships and knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a door that I guessed led to the captain's</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters.

The uneasiness that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to characterize this voyage was noticeable</seg><seg type="columnLine">already the first morning and threatened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to become &lt; chronic. It was undefinable</seg><seg type="columnLine">but undeniable.

Duncan</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw oftener; he was on my watch, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had the habit of hanging over the rail</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring into the water for half-hours at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time deeply immersed in contemplation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the receding waves. Occasionally when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I passed he spoke to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The captain was all but invisible; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept to his cabin, ate there, slept there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the company of his Bible, his charts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chronometers, and that absurd picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the girl that had lived in another age.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was, however, a good sailor; when</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders were needed, he emerged from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">seclusion like an omniscient spirit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At times in the night he would appear on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bridge, his sallow face looking un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly white above his black flowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard, immovable, staring into the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.

They seemed to have a touch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">humanness ; they seemed highly intellec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tual, understanding, and almost femi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ninely vain mirroring themselves in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining placid sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was leaning over the railing in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wheelsman, musing, dreaming about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the East, when I heard steps behind. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the captain, very correctly dressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a white cotton suit and white uniform</seg><seg type="columnLine">cap. He walked slowly, haltingly, a pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful frown on his face and a look in his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had fear, terror in it. Suddenly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed, almost screamed to the helms-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"PORT the helm! Quick! Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see her lights? Do you want</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to ram us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Surprised, shocked by my carelessness</seg><seg type="columnLine">I looked about, rubbed my eyes, looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">everywhere--there were no lights!

There</seg><seg type="columnLine">are no lights."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at me, through me, beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, with those awful eyes of his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the devil!" he roared, then check-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed himself with a convulsive effort and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked away. "Well," he said. "All right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned and left the bridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stared after him in an imbecile fashion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I fear; then resumed my former position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir," said the sailor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes--what is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't happen to know if the cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain keeps liquors in his cabin, do you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is none of your business," I said</seg><seg type="columnLine">as harshly as I could.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, aye, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">This incident troubled me, worried me</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Findlay's Last Voyage</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">147</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for a time; it seemed to bear out Penning-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's hints; but soon it lost its freshness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and while I did not forget it, it ceased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry me. I ascribed it to the heat, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink, or dope; thought it of little im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portance. The nearness of the East was</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible for this easy optimism; it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the charm of the unknown, the singular</seg><seg type="columnLine">attraction of the unseen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Through the current of the Strait of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bab-el-Mandeb we escaped into the Ara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bian Sea, and after coaling again at Aden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a desolate cluster of houses and huts</seg><seg type="columnLine">roosting in the crater of an extinct volcano,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood out to sea for India. India! I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">like shouting. Bombay! The name had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a singular foreign flavor; it savored of</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty and adventure and grotesque pagan</seg><seg type="columnLine">gods. Just a week more at sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The weather was fine, a clear sky and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing sun most of the time, and a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea after we got into the trade-winds. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole the trip was pleasant and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventful, though I noticed a gradual change</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the captain. He seemed more restless;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he sought the bridge more, began to haunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in fact--I suppose his cabin was too hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">for comfort, even though it contained his</seg><seg type="columnLine">charts and chronometers and that old</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture, that picture of the Puritanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was disconcerting to have him on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge; he disturbed my mind, but still--</seg><seg type="columnLine">still I could not help feeling sympathetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him. There was something very</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathetic about him, that fixed expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wo about the eyes, for instance; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fearful searching of the sea, especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">at night, for some unseen danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The mate, too, had changed somehow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His manners had become ingratiating; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated me like the proverbial long-lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother. Since there was no apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause for this change, I concluded there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something he wished me to do, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that for some reason or other he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't want to do himself. I wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Early in the morning on which we sighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, he joined me on the bridge. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on duty; the captain was below. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to talk--his chief business in life, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"So," he said, "you have never been in</seg><seg type="columnLine">India before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I expressed a superfluous negation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"It's a fine country," he said medi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tatively. "Lot of women -- first-class</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">whisky-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment he lost himself in antici-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pated joys, then regretfully returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want you to be candid with me," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said confidentially. "What do you think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the captain?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose he is all right," I replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">guardedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is what he isn't," he wagged his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head to emphasize the statement. "He is</seg><seg type="columnLine">off his head. It's plain as daylight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After waiting in vain for an answer he</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued smirkingly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I were you I would report him to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">harbor commission at Bombay. I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">•do it myself if I hadn't a wife at home."</seg><seg type="columnLine">This last was an obscure point. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife at home seemed to me to be an irrele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vant factor that had nothing to do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the affair; but I did not contradict him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the moment I had forgotten everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerning the ship. India, the paradise</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my dreams, was taking shape, becoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">real, rising out of the ocean, meeting me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All that I had hoped it to be it seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be; beautiful, full of mystery, fraught with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unfathomable meaning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly it came nearer. Soft velvety</seg><seg type="columnLine">greens became visible everywhere; palms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a luxuriant undergrowth of jungle</seg><seg type="columnLine">hedged in the coast, the city, the islands</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bay, the shelves of rice-fields that</seg><seg type="columnLine">like steps for a mighty god mounted to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inland hills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain was on the bridge, calm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficient, patriarchal. I began to doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soundness of my memory; the incident</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Red Sea seemed preposterous, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">believable; yet still, still ....</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Duncan, whose attitude toward me had</seg><seg type="columnLine">assumed a benevolent fatherliness, volun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teered as my guide on my first excursion</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashore in this land of beauty and mystic</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams. The first glance of the inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">harbor had been disappointing. It re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded me of that hotbed of commerce,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Newcastle. Vistas of wharves and quays;</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships of many nationalities: English,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dutch, French, Norwegian and a solitary</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamer flying the Stars and Stripes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The noise and the bustle were here, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the discordant symphony of trade. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dockers were different. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">children of the East, sandaled, turbaned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">148</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dark, sinuous in their movements and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious. One wondered whether they</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt like white men, thought like white men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">died like white men. They were a profound</seg><seg type="columnLine">enigma.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The city itself was Eastern, unmistakably</seg><seg type="columnLine">so, picturesquely so; even the Victoria</seg><seg type="columnLine">railway terminus, with its opulent archi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tecture, its lavish decorations, its towers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and minarets,»*even to the statue perched</seg><seg type="columnLine">high on its dome, was Oriental, Indian; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been the palace of some fabled</seg><seg type="columnLine">maharajah.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Near this terminus I received one of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">strongest impressions of this first intimate</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of the East. Curious that a beggar</seg><seg type="columnLine">should make such a profound impression,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he did. He seemed to typify the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignity, the fatalism of the East. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">old, his straggly beard white, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">sightless. His turban was a medley of</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors; a kaftan of white cotton covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lean body. But it was the bearing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attenuated figure that gripped me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seemed more like a statue, a statue</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a hoarse mechanical voice, than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">human being. His spirit seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the body leaning against the wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while it flew untrammeled to other spheres.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He seemed at once to be a true representa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive of the East and a contrast to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motley crowds that passed him by with</seg><seg type="columnLine">graceful, gliding, rhythmical movements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LATE in the afternoon something</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened that rather marred our</seg><seg type="columnLine">keen enjoyment in the pilgrimage</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashore; certainly it disturbed our minds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were drinking tea in the Kapad Bazaar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting near the main entrance, when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">person we knew well came in. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear to be looking for company, so we</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained silent, unseen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked about furtively, as if ashamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be there, sneaked up to a fakir's booth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hurriedly bought a heathen charm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was guaranteed, so an inscription in bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">English above the booth said, to avert</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger from evil spirits, bad luck, wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals and several other more or less</seg><seg type="columnLine">fantastic things, besides reserving for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearer a berth in the Mussulman's paradise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The buyer was Captain Findlay. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneaked out again, pushing his way rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the throng. We stared after him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nonplused. Why did he want the charm?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why the secrecy? What new inconsistency</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had arisen in his character? Hitherto he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had pored over his Bible, now he bought</seg><seg type="columnLine">heathen charms! The two things did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to harmonize. The incident awakened</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh misgivings, fed the old uneasiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wonder what ails Findlay?" I said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Duncan when we were at last making our</seg><seg type="columnLine">way back to the ship, away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinating life of the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pondered awhile, lifted his cap and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratched his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," he confessed. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems sane enough whenever I happen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see him. I don't like it though. I feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my bones that something is wrong."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The mate wants me to report him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the harbor commission," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you do it, my lad. Do what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Penny orders you to do--you have to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, you know--but never do what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asks you to do. He is a cheap edition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man, a sixpenny affair. I never could</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand him since that time in Calcutta."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well," said I, "I don't think Findlay</seg><seg type="columnLine">is quite rational."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"We will watch him, and if he goes off</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head entirely, we will cable the owners."</seg><seg type="columnLine">It never occured to the honest Scotchman</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there might not be time for that;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that something might happen suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is all Penny's business, anyway,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he grumbled irritably.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bombay was wonderful but too hot for</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfort. I explored the city and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">environs; and I watched the coolie dock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands struggle with the clumsy crated</seg><seg type="columnLine">printing-presses just as I had watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the longshoremen at Newcastle. Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt a sharp disappointment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I foresaw the time when the enchantment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the East would become articulate, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">become commonplace, staring at one from</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the covers of books. Hardly were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the holds emptied, before they were filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, this time with rice for Colombo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chests of opium for Hongkong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bombay dropped behind, sank slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">below the horizon, shrouded with palms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Other beauties arose, other pictures were</seg><seg type="columnLine">unveiled, as beautiful, as grand. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Malabar coast was a revelation of soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">luxuriance, a mute eloquent splendor. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">palm-fringed coast; the terraced table-land;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and farther back, lofty wooded hills. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">with this a faint aroma, a tropic languor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat and a limpid blue sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Findlay behaved strangely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Findlay's Last Voyage</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">149</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Possibly he wasn't mad yet--at least he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had moments of sanity--but if ever I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hunted, haunted man it was he. I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">he realized his strange behavior and fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">against it, blindly, hopelessly. He began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to read his Bible again, shut up in his cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his charts and chronometers and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture on the wall. Somehow I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget that picture; it seemed to be a part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this slow silent tragedy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Findlay was sick, deathly sick--with fear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fear of madness, and then at times the fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the other thing that I couldn't see, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">phantom ship that seemed to pursue us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was always watching for and fleeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">from. He seemed hardly to sleep; most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the night he spent on the bridge, pacing</seg><seg type="columnLine">restlessly to and fro, sometimes muttering</seg><seg type="columnLine">incoherently, thinking aloud in snatches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in these mutterings two names were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever recurring: "Estelle" and "Martha."</seg><seg type="columnLine">But generally he was silent, brooding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">melancholy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Only once did he speak to me directly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As usual in the dead of night he emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his den and began to pace the deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">irresolutely with sporadic flashes of deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mination, always scanning the sea with</seg><seg type="columnLine">painful vigilance. Suddenly he joined me</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my post ahead of the pilot-house. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes wandered from me to the ship, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky, to the sea, resting at last on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant retreating horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How is it with your soul?" he asked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">low unearthly tones that conjured up</seg><seg type="columnLine">visions of death and damnation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Confused and irritated I murmured</seg><seg type="columnLine">something, some stupid conventional re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark about not having thought of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no opinion in fact, which was the truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far as it went.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A sailor's life is full of dangers," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitatingly as if reciting a half-forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">lesson.

It became</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily worse, nourished as it was by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat; but still it did not kill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The look of profound misery on his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">deepened, became like a mask in fixedness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He ate little; he slept not at all; he read</seg><seg type="columnLine">his Bible in the daytime without getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">any apparent comfort, and spent his nights</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the bridge pacing back and forth rest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly, always searching the sea with</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained, glowing eyes. For long periods</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would remain silent, then he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk incoherently, fragmentarily, about</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Estelle," "Martha," "my wife," and "my</seg><seg type="columnLine">children."

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">became grayer, thinner; the fire of his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">more feverish. He was an awesome, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pathetic figure, a perpetual reminder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's changeful fate, of the tyranny of</seg><seg type="columnLine">time and of memory, and of the infectious</seg><seg type="columnLine">melancholy of the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He was a monument, an ironic monument</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life, to life, by life.

He did, finally; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was by no means strange.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seemed to be obsessed with the idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we were all going to die. Like a half-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">crazed, hell-and-damnation evangelist, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went about saying to the men in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave-like, even voice of his:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How is it with your soul? Are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to die?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His insistence on the subject was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">canny, demoralizing. It gave us the creeps</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear that patriarchal madman like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniformed Jeremiah utter his doleful" Wo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wo." To the superstitious sailors he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a prophet of evil, despised and feared. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke down the discipline; we had difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">handling the men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tried to save him once--but only once.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Afterward I thought it advisable to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him alone, to pursue the road of his per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verted fancies.

I could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sepulchral voice and that horror-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pervaded question:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How is it with your soul? Are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to die?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir," I said impatiently, determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">if possible to divert his attention from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject of death, "sir, there is a ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">yonder."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was not prepared for what followed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As if in a trance he came toward me, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face livid, his eyes fixed and staring, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs atremble, his lips moving can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulsively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it she?" he whispered hoarsely, "is</seg><seg type="columnLine">it the Estelle of Bristol?

Why can't she leave me</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He broke down, actually sobbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Save us, oh Lord," he prayed, "save us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's the children she wants; she wants to</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill the little children.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">case would be reported, investigated, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported again, and, when all the red tape</seg><seg type="columnLine">was exhausted, finally settled. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">odious but preferable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Malay Peninsula emerged from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea, coming nearer, rising higher.

When all seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">well and safe, something turns up</seg><seg type="columnLine">that entirely overthrows the firmest ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectations, as if Providence delighted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing pranks with men, in tormenting</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, in letting them go their own ways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mold their own destiny, until an expecta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion is assuming the guise of reality, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly the incalculable factor appears</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a moment destroys forever the</seg><seg type="columnLine">equation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was about four in the morning. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just relieved Pennington on the bridge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The captain was there as usual, an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">auspicious figure in white flannels pacing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deck restlessly on the port side. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then he stopped to stare into the water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The night was calm and clear, the sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright, the sea almost mirror-like. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung into the Strait of Singapore; its</seg><seg type="columnLine">long narrow reach lay like a river before us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inland river with magnificent woods on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the banks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The lights and the shadowy outline of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamer appeared in the darkness ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, hugging the northern shore. As far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could make out she was a ship of about</seg><seg type="columnLine">three thousand tons, seemed heavily loaded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and moved at a rather slow speed; a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon type of freighter. There was nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguishing about her, and nothing inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I watched her idly; she was a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venient object on which to rest my eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In comparison with the Aladdin she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">abnormally clumsy; she also seemed neg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lected, like an abused wife. I remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinctly the last thought I had before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the commotion started. I was thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if I were aboard her, I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">her lanterns cleaned, especially the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward on her masthead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her course lay about a hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">off our port side, and she might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">about two hundred and fifty yards ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our bows, when all suddenly a sharp com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand rang out behind me--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Starboard the helm!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned instantly, doubting my hearing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A ship bearing down on our port side and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a command to starboard the helm! It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an insane order given by a madman. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course it was Findlay. But a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">Findlay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This man was not childish, irresolute,</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of fear, any longer; terror evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">had at last shocked him into determination;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spirit of his better days had arisen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reinforce his frenzy. He was formidable</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night; he was dangerous. I felt it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the sailor at the wheel felt it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, aye, sir," he said, and actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung the ship over a point or two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Hold your course!" I roared, and turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted to the man on the forecastle head</seg><seg type="columnLine">to call the mate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Findlay would not give in; he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dominated by his single mad idea. Snatch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a hatchet from the pilot-house wall he</seg><seg type="columnLine">brandished it aloft like a medieval warrior</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shouted in stentorian tones:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will save my ship! I will save my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship!" And exultantly--"I have her at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last; she sha'n't kill the children; she sha'n't</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursue me any more!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wheelsman, terrified, in fear of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, ducked away and fled down on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower deck. Findlay grabbed the wheel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swung it over. He had dropped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ax. I jumped at him. He was strong,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, stronger than I had thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I expected him to weaken, to back away:</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he didn't; he fought. We struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">madly, and even as we struggled I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship was obeying her rudder, turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the channel, heading for the vul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerable side of the other ship. I tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">break away, made a rush for the wheel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but stumbled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A terrific blow hit me in the face, flusli</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the jaw; and the next instant I sprawleci</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the deck, dazed, helpless; but stili</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow, able to think, to imagine things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew the other ship could not suspeci</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truth; when she noticed our altered</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, she would swerve over, try to gt</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer the shore, and expose her entire side</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tried to get up, but couldn't.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I could think, I could plan, but my limb;</seg><seg type="columnLine">refused to obey, my nerves seemed para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lyzed. The agony increased; each moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">each fraction of a moment, brought a fullei</seg><seg type="columnLine">realization of the impending tragedy. Ii</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed a horrible dream, but I knew it wa</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrible truth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inducement</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">153</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then there was a moment, eternal it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed, of still intensity, of maddening</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspense, of growing horror. A voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieked into the night--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Are you mad?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A siren shrilled. Then a deafening</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash, a rending of steel plates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The impact threw me against the railing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front. The shock restored me somewhat;</seg><seg type="columnLine">I rose unsteadily and scrambled to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel. I signaled the engine-room for full</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed ahead. I had but one thought, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep the nose of the Aladdin in the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the other ship until she sank. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a wild scramble down on the deck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">curses, cries, orders--and Findlay? I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">never forget it</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stood near the starboard life-boat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his spotless but somewhat wrinkled white</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniform, his sallow upturned face and bald</seg><seg type="columnLine">head gleaming white and ghastly like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead man's, his arms stretched outward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and upward as if in rapturous prayer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he began to chant, slowly, solemnly--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doxology! I hope I shall never hear it</seg><seg type="columnLine">again under such circumstances!

A girl of eighteen, he told himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too young to make promises covering</seg><seg type="columnLine">five years of time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peter arrived in Westover at noontime</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the fateful day. When he had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">luncheon at the inn, he dressed himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">smartly all in white save for a gray Norfolk</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat, and set out for a great sycamore tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">that stood on the river's north bank at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper edge of town. All along the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">avenue he met people whom he instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized, but none of them recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Even old Judge Urhart, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known him exceedingly well, stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him blankly as he bowled past in a purring</seg><seg type="columnLine">six-cylinder car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Huntley reached the shrine of his boyhood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">154</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">f "1HERE is nothing that a man may</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate so bitterly and at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">t'me l°ve so devotedly as his home</seg><seg type="columnLine">town. Young Peter Huntley hated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Westover because it had named him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruffian and a brawler when he was only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good and quick fighter, and because it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleeced his father of the price of a mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nificent plantation. He loved Westover</seg><seg type="columnLine">because it was the home of his boyhood</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of the sweetheart who had agreed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait for him for five years without even an</seg><seg type="columnLine">exchange of letters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Huntley had asked for five years in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which to make something of himself. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">letters were to be exchanged because all</seg><seg type="columnLine">Westover postmasters were tools of "Judge"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Urhart, who was Marian's father and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big Boss of the entire county.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Westover was a beautiful little city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Along a crystal-clear river it lay, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather narrow valley. It had many stately</seg><seg type="columnLine">old maples, and many handsome old resi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dences; in the warmer months it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">veritable fairyland of roses and lilies and</seg><seg type="columnLine">honeysuckles. There was hardly a middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">class. Most of the people, by far, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">either rich or poor. All the former lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">on an avenue an eighth of a mile broad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the center of which the sparkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">river flowed; the halves of this pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Man Who Whipped a City</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">155</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour before the appointed time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down on a stone to wait. The old</seg><seg type="columnLine">sycamore was to him the same gaunt, good</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend it had been in his earlier youth; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only change he noticed was that the initials</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the date he had cut in the white bark</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly five years before were now grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and dim. Peter rose, took out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife and renewed the letters and</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he sat down and began to watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gold repeater religiously. He tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepare himself for disappointment by</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying over and over:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A girl of eighteen doesn't know herself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I needn't hope. It's silly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And each time there came, like an echo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this from his memory:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I'm alive, Peter, I'll meet you here</seg><seg type="columnLine">at three o'clock, five years from today."</seg><seg type="columnLine">When at last his watch told him it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">three, he rose disheartenedly. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had tried hard to brace himself for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow, he hadn't done it; it staggered him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He became bitter. What a fool's paradise</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been living in! All women were</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that, of course. Not only this woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but all women. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was the sound of dragging foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps out to his right, and his heart paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its beating. He half turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Marian!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then he stood aghast at that which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw. It was Marian who stood there</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him, but it was not the Marian</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had known. The other Marian</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been supple and roundish, bright-eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and laughing, full of life as a robin, pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a dawn in June. This girl was death-</seg><seg type="columnLine">white and pitifully thin; she was like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghost of the other Marian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've had typhoid, Peter," she explained,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a voice that he barely heard. "Peter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dear," she went on in the same weak voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I told you I'd be here to meet you at three</seg><seg type="columnLine">this afternoon if I were alive, didn't I?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, I am here; but I'm afraid you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to carry me back. I got out of bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stole away--I could hardly dress</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself--Peter, I didn't forget my promise</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to you--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was in his arms long before she</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished speaking. Then she collapsed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huntley was a strong man; he carried her</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he would have carried a baby, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">more tenderly. And as he went down the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">river, he swore at himself because he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubted that she would come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he reached the big brick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">granite home of Judge Urhart and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter, the neighborhood had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarmed by the nurse. Word had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">telephoned to Marian's father, and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just arriving, with the doctor beside him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his automobile. Huntley carried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">limp figure to a bed the nurse showed him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and put it down carefully. The doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped to the bedside, and at that moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl opened her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'm all right now," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Urhart hastily questioned the nurse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She must have been delirious," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white-clad woman told them. "She sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">me on an errand, and went out while I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Urhart seemed satisfied with the explana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion; but the doctor narrowed his gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She was getting along so well," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered. "I don't see how she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be delirious at this stage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After receiving assurance that his daugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter was not much the worse for her exertion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Urhart motioned to Huntley to follow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then led the way to the library. The old</seg><seg type="columnLine">ex-judge was a tall, lean man with mutton-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chop whiskers, a sharp profile and a hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. In the library he turned upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huntley with a frown that would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">disconcerted a lesser man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whom," he asked, "have I to thank for</seg><seg type="columnLine">this service?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you know me, Judge?" smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That smile was like pulling front teeth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the other happened to be Marian's father.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm Peter Huntley."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The older man had not forgotten--and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, few other Westoverites had for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten--the youthful peccadilloes of Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huntley, whom they had named a brawler</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a ruffian because he had fought so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much. But now Urhart forced himself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear both grateful and glad to see Hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley. They shook hands. The rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained situation was relieved a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes later by the abrupt entrance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Urhart family physician.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Urhart wishes to see the gentleman</seg><seg type="columnLine">who brought her back," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She wishes to thank you personally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huntley," the girl's father chose to believe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Go on."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ANOTHER minute found Huntley</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Marian's room. When she saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, Marian smiled and pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Draw it up, Peter," she invited, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sit down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peter did so. He bent toward her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Maybe you shouldn't talk, Marian."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I've got to, Peter. A little. Now tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me about yourself. Tell me what you did</seg><seg type="columnLine">in those five years."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "First," Huntley began, "I tried to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a business man of myself. But I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it. It made me fidgety to sit still all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time. Then I went in for electricity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am now a very capable electrical engineer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Are you--" he glanced toward the nurse, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered this--"very much disappointed?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marian smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, no, Peter. Listen: you can get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">position here, maybe. You see, we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting in a dam and power-plant four</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles up the river. It's to be municipally</seg><seg type="columnLine">owned and controlled. The city floated a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred thousand in bonds for it. Father's</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the head of it; he's mayor of Westover</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. See father, get the place, and--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a whisper--"try to make him like you</seg><seg type="columnLine">well enough to give us his permission--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm tired, Peter--I'll have to let you go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The nurse isn't looking, Peter-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Huntley kissed her slyly, bade her good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">by, and hurried back to the library. Old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Urhart seemed displeased at the length of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your daughter," Peter explained, "was</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling me about the new dam and power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Westover's Big Boss brightened at once.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's going to make money for us, Hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley.

By the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can locate a good engineer to take charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the plant--•--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm your man," Huntley interrupted;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he couldn't help it. "I'm a first-class</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrical engineer, if I do say it myself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I'll work for you and old Westover</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a little cheaper than I'd work for</seg><seg type="columnLine">anybody else."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment Urhart seemed at a loss</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know what to say. At last he blurted:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You'll have to see Alden, Huntley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's the contractor, and he is to find the</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrician. You remember Farnsworth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alden, of course?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the mention of the name, the younger</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's face clouded. Certainly, he remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered Farnsworth Alden, contractor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alden had been one of the chief men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ring that had robbed his good old</seg><seg type="columnLine">father to the very bone of him--it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been done mostly within the law, but to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bone just the same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Huntley controlled his feelings as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he could, and told Judge Urhart good-by</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the time being.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was undecided as to just what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going to do. He believed that Marian's</seg><seg type="columnLine">father would see that he did not get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">position he wanted, simply because he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peter Huntley. Moreover, he very heartily</seg><seg type="columnLine">disliked having to ask a job of a man whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">he detested as he detested Farnsworth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alden. The Huntleys had a high old pride</seg><seg type="columnLine">in them, and Peter had as much of it as any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went back to the inn, changed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes, and shortly afterward boarded a</seg><seg type="columnLine">train for a neighboring town to visit his</seg><seg type="columnLine">parents. He found his father running a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little grocery store almost at a loss because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the big heart he had in him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the evening meal was over, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of them, father and mother and son,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered in the sitting-room. Though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in June, the evening had fallen with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chill, which was due to a recent rain, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a fire in the grate. Old John.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huntley lay back in his armchair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared silently and thoughtfully into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing coals. His wife sat beside him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on the floor at her feet sat Peter, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her was a far greater person than a mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">king.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wish you'd tell me, dad," Peter said</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly, "exactly how Westover fleeced</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. I'd like to know all about--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">details, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd much rather not go over it, Peter,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the quick reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost immediately afterward, John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huntley made an excuse to leave the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the door had closed behind him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Huntley bent forward and put a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tender hand on Peter's dark-brown head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You touched a sore spot when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned that, son," said she. "He can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear to even think about it.

But your</seg><seg type="columnLine">father's lack of business sense was partly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to blame.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so white that it looked ghastly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruddy firelight. Judge Urhart had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">that! His Marian's father had done that</seg><seg type="columnLine">unspeakable thing!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sitting there at his mother's knee, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the first altar of life, big young Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huntley told himself firmly that those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had wronged his father must make all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amends possible. It had to be done</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his father's sake, to restore his father's</seg><seg type="columnLine">faith in humanity; there was not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiniest scrap of cheap red vengeance con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For he knew that a man, no matter how</seg><seg type="columnLine">good, who had lost his faith in his fellows</seg><seg type="columnLine">was little better than dead. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON THE following day, Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huntley went back to the West-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over that he had both loved and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hated. He meant to put his pride in irons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so to speak, and see Farnsworth Alden</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately, to ask for the position at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new power-plant; he would accept it at</seg><seg type="columnLine">any salary. That would give him a reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">for being in Westover; he could then work</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the gigantic task of righting the wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">unsuspected, if it were necessary. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet know how he was going to under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take that task, but he did know that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going to undertake it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peter walked up the river to the dam.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Four miles is no distance for such a man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as Peter Huntley--who never smoked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">never drank and who slept eight hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">every night. The little journey required</seg><seg type="columnLine">but an hour of his time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alden was not there when he arrived,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he began to look over the work. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">dam was about three-fourths finished.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The power-plant was all ready except for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the setting up of the switchboards and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the adjustment of the turbines and gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erators. And when Huntley had seen all</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was to see, every nerve in him was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tingling because of a most amazing dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery that he had made. That discovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">was this:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The material of the dam contained less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than half the percentage of cement it</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have had to make it safe; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power-plant was cheaply erected; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery, turbines and generators and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, was second-hand and of old types and</seg><seg type="columnLine">painted and polished to deceive inex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perienced eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Marian Urhart had acquainted him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that a hundred thousand dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the people's money was going into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">project; but it was not really costing</seg><seg type="columnLine">much more than fifty thousand--the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring that had robbed his father was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparing to rake down at least forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand in graft!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The fools!" said Huntley to himself, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truth had fully dawned. "They've</seg><seg type="columnLine">built this rotten sand dam above the town</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of below--and the first high water</seg><seg type="columnLine">is sure to break it, and the town will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept away!" Peter Huntley knew. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">added -- "I'd have thought Alden had</seg><seg type="columnLine">better judgment than he's shown here, sure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But Alden was essentially a builder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings, and not a builder of dams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The contractor arrived in his six-cylinder</seg><seg type="columnLine">runabout half an hour later. Instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huntley's finding him, he found Huntley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a big and pudgy, ruddy-faced man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his countenance was peculiar in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was both piggish and shrewd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What's your business here?" he wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was a hostile light in his pale gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I'm looking for an electrician's job,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the very prompt answer. "Judge</seg><seg type="columnLine">Urhart suggested that I see you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is your name Huntley?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Alden, like most of the other Westover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ites, had failed to recognize him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">158</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Peter Huntley. I can get fine letters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">recommendation from two big Indiana</seg><seg type="columnLine">corporations, and I'll take the place at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very reasonable figure. You see, Westover</seg><seg type="columnLine">is my home town."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're too late," Farnsworth Alden said</seg><seg type="columnLine">sourly. "I've got a man coming from Vir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginia. If you've no further business with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had lied. He had no man coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Virginia, and the other knew it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huntley went white with anger. Alden</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have remembered that the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man there before him had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick fighter all his life, but he didn't.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With a burning insolence, he went on:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You'd better be going. We've got noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing here for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were standing on the river's bank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just below the new building.

"And it's this:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm going to tell the people of Westover</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your graft scheme; I'm going to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">them all about this rotten dam that will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a constant menace to them, about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old and worn-out machinery, about every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing; and I'm also going to wire the</seg><seg type="columnLine">State's committee on public safety! You</seg><seg type="columnLine">may hoodwink people who don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything about dams and power-plants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but you sure can't hoodwink the authori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties--you lying, stealing, villainous grafter!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farnsworth Alden went guiltily purple.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Graft scheme?" he throated. "Hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley, you're crazy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, am I?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The younger man's smile was white and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know something about graft schemes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy or not. The rest of the ring lets the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contract to you for a hundred thousand;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it costs you sixty, with a handsome profit</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that for yourself; then you split the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remaining forty with the rest of the ring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's polite robbery, which is on a par with</seg><seg type="columnLine">holy murder. Would you mind telling me</seg><seg type="columnLine">just how much I missed it in my figures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Farnsworth Alden?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If only he had thought of Marian, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been more careful. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't think. Alden had called his hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he had been too intensely human to</seg><seg type="columnLine">resist the temptation of showing that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a big one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alden had by this time recovered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you know about machinery and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dams?" he roared. He really believed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dam would hold in any water. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">scapegrace, I remember the reputation you</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to have in Westover. Do you think</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would put a man like you in charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this plant? Not on your life! About the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first thing we knew, you'd be entering suit</seg><seg type="columnLine">against us, like your whining father-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT was as far as he was per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted to go with it. Peter Hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley struck the sneering fat mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">so hard that he knocked out two teeth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">splintered a bone in his hand. Alden</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeled backward, and before he could fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huntley had driven home another blow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This sent him into the river, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder-deep at that point. He came up</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffing and sputtering. Huntley, blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the pent-up anger of years, sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the water and hammered the pudgy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">piggish face again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But in all that he had been unwise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had but let himself fall into a trap that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the resourceful Alden had laid for him--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Alden, it is safe to say, hadn't dreamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would fall so quickly and so hard!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The grafting contractor had been cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nered tight. He saw the State peni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentiary looming gray ahead of him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">easiest way out of that corner was to goad</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huntley to fight him, and then have Hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley tried and imprisoned on a charge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">assault. A ring magistrate would do it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once in the Westover jail, the trouble-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maker would have no opportunity to com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">municate with the State authorities or</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm the populace. Within two weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dam would be finished and therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof against investigations, and the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be too well pleased with their elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trically-lighted town to pay any attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a howler of calamity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A score of workmen rushed to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">employer's aid. They dragged him, gasp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for breath, from the water. Huntley</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly waded out and began to look for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hat, which he had lost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold him!" thickly blustered Alden.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hold that man--he's a lunatic--he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be arrested!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half a dozen men ran to Huntley and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clapped their sand-plastered hands on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders and arms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Man Who Whipped a City</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">159</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep off!" Peter ordered sharply, throw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing them aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold him, I say!" cried Alden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that the men, a round twelve of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time, sprang determinedly upon Hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley. There was a lively struggle, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">lasted for less than a minute. One man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially if he be handicapped by a shat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered finger-bone, can not hope to hold his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own long against a dozen sturdy laborers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They tied Huntley's hands behind him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one of them struck him brutally at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enraged contractor's command when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">protested. Then they bound him hard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast in Alden's runabout, and Alden</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisked him to Westover and to Magis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trate Gurland's office without arousing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the notice of the people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately after a hastily whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">conference between Farnsworth Alden and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the magistrate, Peter was given a semblance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a trial. There was small need of wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesses, Gurland said; the contractor's still</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleeding face furnished all the evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary. Huntley endeavored to present</seg><seg type="columnLine">his side of the affair, but a deputy-sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">promptly hushed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Assault with intent to kill," droned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the magistrate. "Eleven months and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-nine days."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The deputy started away with his pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oner. Alden bent toward Magistrate Gur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land and whispered a reminder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In solitary confinement," added Gur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land. "Watch him. He's dangerous."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Into the dingiest, most dismal cell of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Westover jail went well-dressed Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huntley, and the heavy lock clicked behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. This cell was in the jail's basement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the only light it had struggled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a horizontally narrow, barred</seg><seg type="columnLine">window set on a level with the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside and facing a blank stone fence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only furniture was a wooden box</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a narrow and musty-smelling bed. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whitewashed wall opposite the iron door</seg><seg type="columnLine">some former occupant of that solitary cell</seg><seg type="columnLine">had whimsically written with a piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">charcoal:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VISITORS MUST NOT FEED OR ANNOY THE</seg><seg type="columnLine">ANIMALS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Began for Peter a series of days and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nights that were full of that acute misery</seg><seg type="columnLine">that any manner of confinement brings to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live and red-blooded men. No privileges</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever were granted him save those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">going three times a day, always under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">close guard that is sent with the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">untrustworthy criminals, to the lavatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then to the eating-room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tried to buy the sheriff and the jailer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his money wouldn't touch them. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to tell them about the dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">dam--for Marian's sake he refrained from</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioning the graft scheme--but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been warned in advance that his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was twisted on such questions as those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">power-plants and dams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peter grew sullen, and his face became</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkened with a stubby beard and lean.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But never for a moment did he give up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">aims or lose hope, though it required in him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the indomitable courage of a superman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All along he had been wondering whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marian knew of his incarceration. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come to see him when she was able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be out, he was sure, if she had learned of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his plight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Marian didn't know of it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">grafting ring had taken care that very</seg><seg type="columnLine">very few knew of it. Peter had guessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">too shrewdly in the figures he had presented</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Alden just before the "assault."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three weeks from the date on which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron door swung shut between Huntley</seg><seg type="columnLine">and liberty, the dam was completed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the high tension wires were connected with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distributing station. The streets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost every house in Westover had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">wired and made ready. The evening that</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the town flooded with electric light</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a time of general rejoicing. The band</seg><seg type="columnLine">played, speeches were made in the court-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, the populace cheered wildly. Down</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his dungeon-like cell Peter heard some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of it dimly, and he understood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A month passed, and during those four</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks the stores stopped handling kerosene</seg><seg type="columnLine">and most of the people foolishly threw away</seg><seg type="columnLine">their oil lamps and used the oil they had for</seg><seg type="columnLine">building fires.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also during that month, a scourging</seg><seg type="columnLine">epidemic of typhoid struck the town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is nothing on earth, I think, quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">so uncertain as Tennessee's weather. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last day of July it began to rain hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and steadily. For hours upon hours it</seg><seg type="columnLine">rained, and the river began to rise. Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huntley began to rave about the dam. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was enough, considering the wear of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">solitary confinement, to drive him insane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The jailer refused to listen. Peter then</seg><seg type="columnLine">i6o</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tried to shout his warning through the little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> window. The jailer threatened to gag him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> if he didn't close his mouth of his own</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> accord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "All right," agreed Peter. "But first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">let me say this: if there is such a thing as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reincarnation, you're the same damned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scoundrel that stuck the spear into the side</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the Man they crucified."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The keeper of the keys laughed and went</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">off whistling. Peter began to pace the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dank floor. He kept himself from thinking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of being drowned there in his cell by think-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing of his Marian. How he hoped that she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would escape the devastating flood wall</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that he knew had to come!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Night fell thick. The street electrics</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">made only dim white circles in the misty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">darkness. Two hours, and something failed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the power-plant--and Westover with its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scores of cases of typhoid was plunged into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">impenetrable, Stygian blackness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUDGE URHART tried to sit up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the smothering night, and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was too weak. He lay back</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillow, waited and listened impa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiently. A few minutes later he heard his</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter's soft footsteps in the near-by</seg><seg type="columnLine">hallway. She came slowly, groping, feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her way with her hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What did the engineer say?" he wanted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The telephone worked badly at first,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and I didn't get it all," said Marian, halting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beside his bed. "There's something wrong</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with--the generators, I believe he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Maybe the lights will come on soon. I hope</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so, for this is terrible! I wish Peter Hunt-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ley were in charge up there, father. It's a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shame that Mr. Alden wouldn't give him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the position."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"I've already heard too much of Peter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Huntley," weakly declared the mayor of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Westover.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"If only we knew where to find him!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl continued. "Do you suppose his</seg><seg type="columnLine">parents in Faidleysville would know?

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming of eleven o'clock found half the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women in Westover hysterical. By mid-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">night the hearts of some very strong men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being harassed by that unrelenting</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Farnsworth Alden had been kept busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">answering telephone calls for hours. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew that something had to be done,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that done quickly, to get the generators</seg><seg type="columnLine">to working again; the stricken town had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have light.

Peter in jail for two months!</seg><seg type="columnLine">A graft scheme! In the twinkling of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye, her intuition told her almost the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">story.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper of the keys telephoned to the Urhart</seg><seg type="columnLine">residence, and after a considerable wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farnsworth Alden answered.

Finally he finished the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, and then he gave a signal to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sawmill engineer who called himself an</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrical engineer because he had taken a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short correspondence course in electricity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ready, Wildman!" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sallow little man put the big machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">in motion, and a steady humming sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from it. Then he ran to the breaker</seg><seg type="columnLine">and threw the current on--and the stricken</seg><seg type="columnLine">town below had light!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Peter!" cried Marian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Huntley looked around and saw her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was radiant with perfect health again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">prouder than ever of him, heart-broken with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sympathy for him.

She understood; she took one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his grimy hands, and pressed it to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poor old Peter!" she sobbed.

And have</seg><seg type="columnLine">central instruct them to leave all lights on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when the dam breaks we'll flash the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights three times as a warning. That will</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">give the foolish ones some twenty minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get to safety.

Half an hour later every soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Westover had received the warning. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">typhoid sufferers were wrapped in blankets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carefully carried to houses that stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">high and above the danger-line. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were incredulous enough to remain in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their threatened homes were not, fortu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nately, incredulous enough to put out their</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights. Neither did they go to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sawmill engineer stood at his post</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the current-breaker, ready to flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">the signal in Westover. Huntley stood at</seg><seg type="columnLine">an open window that faced the dam; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside him was Marian, with her gaze upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the muddy, foam-dotted and debris-covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters below. She had wanted to return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her father, but Huntley wouldn't permit it;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road to Westover lay in the valley all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way down, and it was too hazardous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Peter," she murmured, when she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrung from him a confirmation of her sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picions and knew everything, "Peter, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope the dam will break, almost."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Marian!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Almost, I said.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer isn't looking; if you can take</seg><seg type="columnLine">your eyes off that dam for a second, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">may kiss me, Peter, dear."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He did it. Just then the droning</seg><seg type="columnLine">miserere of the mad waters widened into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a far-reaching, gushing roar, and with it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the grinding jar of stone upon stone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peter whirled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Break the current!" he bellowed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Break it!

Peter got well soon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Save for a thorough wetting, Westover</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not very badly damaged by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flood. The waters had spread and thereby</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost much of their force by the time they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone the four miles, and only a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses were swept from their foundations.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fortunately, those buildings directly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">path of the current were of brick or stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN the cleaning-up was over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the people were pretty close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">happiness again, Westover's mayor</seg><seg type="columnLine">called a meeting of certain men in the libra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ry of his home. When they were all there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Judge Urhart rose beside his littered desk</seg><seg type="columnLine">and addressed them with a peculiar glint in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen," he began, "we are here</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonight to organize the Business Men's</seg><seg type="columnLine">League of Westover.

Second, it's going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to build a hundred thousand dollars' worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of dam and power-plant on the river below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city--and the job is going to be put</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the hands of Peter Huntley, the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">to whom Westover owes its life. Third,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's going to stand behind all the bigger</seg><seg type="columnLine">damage done by the flood."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke with an air of finality. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still the Big Boss. And yet, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one man of those present who dared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">criticize him. That man was Farnsworth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have just read," he sneered, "the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wedding announcement."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Judge Urhart went white and stared hard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That has nothing whatever to do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.

The wooden hulls caught fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily, and several were soon ablaze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An abortive cheer rang out as one daring</seg><seg type="columnLine">sampan, carrying a company of eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">men-at-arms, pulled squarely athwart the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tortoise-boat's bows. But the cheer died</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Korean's long, sharp ram cut her</seg><seg type="columnLine">in two as if the sampan had been a straw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spilling her swordsmen into the sea. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">unchecked speed, the ironclad passed over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the swirl where her brave enemy had been,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brained the struggling swimmers with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging oars, and rammed the largest</seg><seg type="columnLine">junk in the Japanese fleet. Her side</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed in at the water-line, the junk heeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, filled and went down with all on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board, as the tortoise-boat backed away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started for a fresh victim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the length of the entire fleet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ironclad tore her way, mangling helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">sampans with her terrible beak, sinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">great junks with the fearful balls from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-directed cannon. With frantic cour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age, the Japanese bore in, hoping against</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope for a chance to board and avenge</seg><seg type="columnLine">their butchered comrades. But all was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">vain. The tortoise forced a path through</seg><seg type="columnLine">them all, and sped on toward the south,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if sated with destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Undaunted, her surviving enemies put</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, doubling on their former course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hastened to .pursue their now fleeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">foe. Soon the Japanese squadron was</seg><seg type="columnLine">strung out in a long, scattering line ahead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the speedier of tbem outdistanced their</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboring fellows. But not even the swiftest</seg><seg type="columnLine">held its own with the tortoise-boat, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-modeled racing hull beneath the over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging gun-deck gave the lie to her name.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On they pressed, pursuers and pursued,</seg><seg type="columnLine">oars churning the water white; till the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japanese line was punctured with great</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the ironclad's speed slackened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her oars trailed idly. With loud shouts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Banzai!" the leading Japanese bore down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon her. When barely two ship's lengths</seg><seg type="columnLine">separated them, the Korean oars struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water again; but with a difference.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Admiral Yi Sun-sin had built his vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">alike at both ends; he had ordered his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowers to face about, and what had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stern of the tortoise-boat was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">her bow. Hardly had his nonplused</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuers realized the maneuver, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ironclad, tearing toward them with growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, rammed and sank the foremost</seg><seg type="columnLine">sampan, and came back down the line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her widely scattered adversaries, striking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">backing and striking again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was too much. Crying that this sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster was the work of gods or demons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not of men, the crews of several ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled their useless weapons into the sea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some, fleeing swiftly, were fortunate enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach the shore, where they beached and</seg><seg type="columnLine">set fire to their vessels to save them from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two Strong .Meil</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">165</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the victorious Koreans. But most of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were slain, fighting or fleeing, so that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chroniclers of that day have declared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea was red with their blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Kurushima did not flee. Inwardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">raging, but steady and skilful as in victory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took upon himself the honor of Japan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Handling his own long, open boat smartly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he offered his broadside to the enemy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ram, swung 'round as it came on, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought her right under the overhang of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ironclad's starboard beam. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">joyous yell, the men of Tosa swarmed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the turtle's back, lusting to flesh their</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy swords. But their fierce cries soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed to shrieks of agony, for the curved</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron deck was studded thickly with sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">spikes and spear-heads, on which the help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less boarders were impaled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kurushima alone was luckier. Leaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at an open port, he succeeded in grasp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one of the great gilded fangs in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower jaw of the dragon's mouth before</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own boat was left behind. Pulling</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself up with his left hand, he took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword from between his teeth and delivered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mighty overhand blow at a dimly seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">form inside the port. He had the joy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling his blade shear through flesh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone and seeing it come back dripping.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the reloaded gun was run out through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the port; the lower lip of its muzzle struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Daimio squarely on his helmeted fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head and knocked him senseless into the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KURUSHIMA'S eyelids fluttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice, and opened wide. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">weak and faint. His fingers found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sleeping-mat on which he lay; his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw, but did not comprehend the pine-tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">which sheltered him, and the six-foot fence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of canvas raised about the tree on spears</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust upright into the ground. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time his brain did not grasp the meaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these things; then, memory and under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing dawning in his mind, he ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">his teeth in humiliated pride.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The savage, hopeless battle against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tortoise-boat; the crunch of the monster's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ram against the ribs of his doomed ships;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the overwhelming defeat; his own desper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate, futile attempt to snatch victory from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the teeth of destruction, and the crashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow that had flung him into oblivion--all</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back upon him now, with accumulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitterness. Japan had relied upon him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he had failed her! Now he lay here,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rescued he knew not how, cared for by folk</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had not seen, but alive, alive, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have died with his brave sailors!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was only one course for a beaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldier, a dishonored Samurai. With hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would scarcely obey the command</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his brain, he fumbled for his dagger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed in the resolution to commit hari-kari,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he might not live continually reproach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing himself for the stain of his defeat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at the sound of his first feeble</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirring, a little man in a gray kimono</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped from behind the pine. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">short, this man, even for a Japanese;</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely five feet tall, and as slightly built</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a child. His face was that of an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credibly old and wrinkled monkey; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eyes which burned in it were those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a god. Whoso met their glance knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in the presence of his master.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kurushima started violently, and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face away. It was Hideyoshi himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the all-conquering dictator of Japan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reading the Daimio's intention, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wont to read the minds of men, Hide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yoshi raised two fingers in a gesture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">restraint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You shall not slay yourself, Kuru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shima," he commanded.

"How can I do this, when I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">already failed?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By returning to your province of Tosa</seg><seg type="columnLine">and playing go in your castle at Urado,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hideyoshi replied enigmatically, and sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor beside the sleeping-mat. "Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not try to rise, for the fever has scarce left</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. It is a fortnight since you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought here. One of your sailors kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">you afloat in spite of all your armor, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew you to a piece of floating wreckage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whence you were taken into the ship of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miyosi of Izumo.

Five years ago a tempest</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove one of those Spanish ships into your</seg><seg type="columnLine">port of Urado."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kurushima nodded, his despair forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">in eager attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She tarried for a week," he affirmed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"filling her water-casks and waiting for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind to moderate, for it was a very great</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This year's ship," said Hideyoshi,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tapping his finger-tips together to em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phasize his words, "will come to Urado,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether there is a storm or not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kurushima was too polite to look in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credulous; but the dictator sensed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubts and thought it best to dispel</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are many Japanese in Manila,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they tell me much," Hideyoshi ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained graciously. "One of them, a Chris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tian named Ichio, sails with this year's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. Her course from Manila lies through</seg><seg type="columnLine">many islands, where the Christian priests</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their converts wait for her coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">and row out to her, bearing gifts of fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">meat and fruit. To certain ones of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">converts on the nearer islands I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">already sent orders which they will repeat</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Ichio when the ship arrives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now Ichio is keeper of the water-casks</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard her. Off the coast of Tosa he will</seg><seg type="columnLine">report, quite truthfully, to his captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the casks are leaky and nearly empty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he will praise the spring that flows</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the wisterias above your beach.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ship's captain will have no choice but</seg><seg type="columnLine">to put into Urado, if he would keep his</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew from perishing of thirst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you must get possession of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. If possible, do so without violence;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I do not wish to begin another war</seg><seg type="columnLine">till this one is finished. If you give the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spaniards a fair opportunity, they may</seg><seg type="columnLine">give up without a struggle. The Spaniards</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Manila are few and fear us greatly;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are merchants, loving gain and hating</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight. Probably you can bribe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain to sell the ship; Ichio has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">told to study his weaknesses and report</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Remember, if it comes to fighting, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship is to be captured, so far as possible,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">without injury. Her crew are of no im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portance, except the sailing-master and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gunners.

That is why I wish for</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to fight the tortoise-boat. If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeed, you shall take the great ship into</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle for the conquest of China. Never-</seg><seg type="columnLine">theless, stout as she is, I forbid you to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">either cannon or fire-arrows when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">capture her, lest mischance occur."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We of Tosa despise such cowards'</seg><seg type="columnLine">tools," Kurushima answered scornfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The brave man knows no weapon but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a smile that beautified his wrinkled</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, Hideyoshi reached within the folds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his kimono, and handed to Kurushima</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Daimio's own beloved blade. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar feel of the sharkskin grip, tears</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst from Kurushima's eyes, and a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">flood of health and strength poured through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fever-wasted veins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even the Sea-God failed to wrest it</seg><seg type="columnLine">from your grasp," said the dictator.

Bom of the most ancient and im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poverished house of de Torres, my captain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don Diego, thinks never of gain, but always</seg><seg type="columnLine">of honor. The Spaniards in his crew boast</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the many battles he has fought with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">English, the Moros and other pirates. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">great is his skill and valor that he has never</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost a ship entrusted to his care. And so</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful is his honesty that, though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">has had charge of whole cargoes of silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gold, he is still poor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There can be no question, then, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bribing such a man," said Kurushima, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">much satisfaction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The idea had been utterly repugnant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his straightforward, hard-hitting nature;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Hideyoshi's commands had been ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicit.

No</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner had the San Gregorio entered Urado</seg><seg type="columnLine">harbor, early that morning, than he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen to it that certain effective but unob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusive methods had been taken to bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">her exit. Moreover, out from the mist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrouded shore had darted a dozen chal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenging guard-boats, crammed with picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">swordsmen, ostensibly to demand the reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the stranger's intrusion. Had there been</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence of panic or unpreparedness on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board the galleon, she would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">boarded and captured then and there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But a culverin had roared from a lower-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck port, and an eighteen-pound solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot struck the water so close to the bows</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the leading guard-boat that the column</seg><seg type="columnLine">of spray it raised fell on and drenched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled rowers as they instinctively backed</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. So there was a halt and a parley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which Ichio served as interpreter. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">when, as a result of that parley, the guard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boats withdrew and some of the galleon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew rowed ashore as the sun drank up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mist, to begin the all-day task of filling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water-casks, Ichio came with them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently slipped away to the castle to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make his report to the Daimio.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is true that Don Diego can not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought with gold," he said regretfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But he has one weakness: he is in love.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On the last voyage from Acapulco to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Manila, we had as passenger the Lady</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ysabel, daughter of the Governor of the -</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philippines.

Perched on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her wrist sat a small, gay-feathered Borneo</seg><seg type="columnLine">parrot, which her father, the ex-governor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had bought for her on the assurance that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it could "play tricks and talk like a Chris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tian."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Has it spoken yet, Dona Ysabel?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Lieutenant Gomez, as he did at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten times daily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Not yet, Don Pablo."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A suspicious gleam of polished metal in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the temple groves ashore caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchful lieutenant's eye. The tide was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ebbing, and the galleon lay head on to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore; Don Pablo bowed and went forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a closer view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For the first time since the galleon had</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared from Manila, Diego and Ysabel</seg><seg type="columnLine">were alone together. Though he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed to speak with her, to be near her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the caballero's rigid sense of honor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced him to maintain a formal distance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">between himself and the betrothed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">another man. Burning with resentment</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the trick that Don Feliz had played</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him, his heart tortured with hopeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">love, he was man and gentleman enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to play the game as he understood it, cost</seg><seg type="columnLine">him what it might. But now he was face</seg><seg type="columnLine">to face with Ysabel herself; the blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">throbbed in his temples, his stern face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense lips showed the strain under which</seg><seg type="columnLine">his self-control was laboring. Ysabel</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him with anxious, tender eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, before either of them could</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter a word, a strange shrill voice spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the empty air between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Diego!" it cried, softly and plaintively,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if its heart were breaking.

The parrot, shaken from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her wrist, flew to the top of one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great, heavily leaded stern lanterns, whence</seg><seg type="columnLine">it cried again--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Diego of my soul, come back to me!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through the open cabin skylight came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clink of glasses and a snatch of a drinking-</seg><seg type="columnLine">song in a high-pitched, unpleasant voice--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the voice of that successful speculator in</seg><seg type="columnLine">billetes, Don Feliz de Arruego.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" said Ysabel, her voice on edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">with loathing, her features firm and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved.

"It can do no good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew that her greedy-souled father</seg><seg type="columnLine">would hold her to the bargain, as by Spanish</seg><seg type="columnLine">law he had every right to do.

She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">his, his in spite of the vile trickster who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stolen her from him, but who had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">won her heart. She loved him, Diego,</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved him enough to give up home, friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">riches and live in exile, so she might only</seg><seg type="columnLine">live with him! And why not?

His gaze was lion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like and frank, his gestures those of a born</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader of men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After tea had been brought in and served,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with much ceremony, in handleless cups</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gay Chinese porcelain, the Daimio</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to talk easily and fluently, Ichio</seg><seg type="columnLine">translating with a mounting air of impor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance. Diego listened intently, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">comment. As calmly as if he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussing an event of ancient history,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kurushima told the tale of the tortoise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat, describing his own defeat in vivid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">concise terms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And this is the ship," he concluded at</seg><seg type="columnLine">length, drawing a roll of stiffened silk from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one capacious sleeve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seated upon a chest--the nearest ap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">proach to a chair in all Urado--Don Diego</seg><seg type="columnLine">received the roll, unfolded it and gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with great interest at a spirited painting</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tortoise-boat, drawn by Kurushima</seg><seg type="columnLine">from memory. The Daimio was an artist</seg><seg type="columnLine">of no mean ability, and had reproduced</seg><seg type="columnLine">every detail of the monstrous craft with</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful accuracy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A new type--a galley with broadside</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns as well as bow-chasers!" exclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Spaniard. "In that point it resembles</seg><seg type="columnLine">the galleasses of Don John of Austria at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lepanto--but those were no true galleys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for they were ship-rigged as well as oared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should like to see a squadron of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">tortoise-boats built for the Mediterranean</seg><seg type="columnLine">service, and sent against the rovers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barbary Coast."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This curved deck, Don Diego, is covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with plates of iron," explained Ichio.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Lord Kurushima wishes to know if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have ever heard of an iron-plated ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">before?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Diego nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When I was at the siege of Antwerp, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hollanders sent against our blockading</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet a large galleon whose sides they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered over, even to her cage-works, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">plates of iron. They expected great things</seg><seg type="columnLine">from this craft, and named her the Finis</seg><seg type="columnLine">Belli, which signifies in Latin 'The End of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the War.' But she steered badly, ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">aground on a shoal, heeled over at low</seg><seg type="columnLine">tide till she was helpless, and so was cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured by the ship which I then had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor to command."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Swiftly Ichio translated this into Japan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ese, and presently put the Daimio's next</seg><seg type="columnLine">question into Spanish:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Since you have captured one iron ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don Diego, could you not capture another?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Could you fight the tortoise-boat with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">galleon like the San Gregorio?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, in the open sea.

Her iron sheathing can not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be more than quarter-inch plate; other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise its weight, carried so high above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water-line, would capsize and sink her even</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a calm.

Here was the chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been hoping for, which he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">even have been moved to suggest himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not the Japanese played into his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a princely offer. Should he accept</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, then he could go back to the San Gregorio</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a light heart, and return to shore with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dona Ysabel. Her father and Don Feliz</seg><seg type="columnLine">would doubtless object, but what could</seg><seg type="columnLine">they do? He himself was free to resign</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the service of Philip of Spain; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gil Robles, the mate, was fully competent</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take the galleon back across the Pacific.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moreover, from the moment he had en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the hall and looked into the Daimio's</seg><seg type="columnLine">frank young face and fearless eye, Diego</seg><seg type="columnLine">had felt himself strongly attracted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kurushima. Friendships had been few</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Diego's lonely life; here, he knew in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctively, was a man who would make</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a strong and loyal friend. Unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Diego, the same thought was in Kuru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shima's mind, as he sat on the cushioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">mat and looked at his outland guest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shrewd little Ichio glanced from one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other, read their minds, and silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">congratulated himself and his master,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hideyoshi.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell the Lord Kurushima that I accept,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Diego, rising, "for his service seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">one in which a man may gain much honor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now I must go to the ship and come back</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a friend, before the galleon resumes</seg><seg type="columnLine">her voyage to Acapulco. When she has</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to Japan; as my Lord Kurushima's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, then will I begin my duties as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">admiral.

Ichio entreated, "his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Excellency wishes that you and whoever</seg><seg type="columnLine">you may bring with you may be his guests</seg><seg type="columnLine">for ten thousand years. But he says that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he can not wait for the galleon to cross the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great ocean and return. He must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">her now, to sink the tortoise-boat as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as possible, that Japan's armies may cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seas. Delay might mean the ruin of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our enterprise! The honorable Daimio</seg><seg type="columnLine">must take possession of the San Gregorio</seg><seg type="columnLine">today!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DIEGO tapped his foot upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That," he answered calmly, "he</seg><seg type="columnLine">can not do.

And the great price</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Lord Kurushima is paying for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship will surely compensate for the delay</seg><seg type="columnLine">to those in authority in Mexico and Spain."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Diego knit his brows. Polite as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daimio's assurances were, he felt a veiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">threat under their silkiness. The Japanese</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed his vessel now; evidently they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not brook delay. Yet his honor would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">permit him, an officer of the king, to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">false to his trust, no matter what it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">cost himself. And that it might cost much</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew, for he was familiar with the repu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation of the Japanese.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And with that thought came realization.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The quiet, but evident purpose of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">fishing-smacks--the gleam of armor in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the temple - groves; the guard-boats</seg><seg type="columnLine">crammed with swordsmen! He understood</seg><seg type="columnLine">it all now: the Daimio would not wait for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a reply from Spain; if he could not get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Gregorio peacefully, he would try what</seg><seg type="columnLine">force could do! Diego's stubborn heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardened, and his reply was crisp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Be that as it may," he said firmly, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can not do this thing his Excellency asks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of me, for I am not yet in the service of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord Kurushima. I am, until he is pleased</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accept my resignation, an officer of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Most Catholic Majesty, the King of Spain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two Strong Men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">173</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And until the sale of the galleon has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">consummated, the San Gregorio is still the</seg><seg type="columnLine">king's ship, which I, who have the honor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">command her, will defend against any who-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soever will try to take her by force of arms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You will make this clear to the Lord Kuru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shima, and add that I have the honor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish him a very good afternoon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And with a courtly bow, he turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked out of the audience hall, looking as</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconcerned as if he were taking a stroll</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Prado. Inwardly, he was suffering</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the tortures of the Inquisition. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him rose the white, pleading face of Ysabel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">doomed by his quixotic action to a hateful</seg><seg type="columnLine">marriage, sacrificed to a pedantic point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor. But, however willing he might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stay with her in Japan, he could not steal</seg><seg type="columnLine">the king's ship. And what was her happi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness or his, compared to the honor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spain? Holding his head high, Diego</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when he came to the outer courtyard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the castle, he found the gateway barred</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a score of Japanese pikemen with</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowered points. Other men-at-arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded the stone steps leading to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform where, in time of siege, archers</seg><seg type="columnLine">could stand to shoot over the battlemented</seg><seg type="columnLine">parapet of the castle wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of the door of the audience hall came</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kurushima, attended by Ichio and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed guard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Daimio regrets, oh Don Diego!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried the interpreter, "that he must detain</seg><seg type="columnLine">you here till he has seized the San Gregorio.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he hopes that you may yet become</seg><seg type="columnLine">his admiral, and serve him as faithfully as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have served the King of Spain!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell the Daimio," answered Diego,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking swiftly about him, "that since he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is coming to visit my ship, I must hasten</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard to prepare a welcome for him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Against the wall, hard by the castle gate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood a wooden rack full of long, stout</seg><seg type="columnLine">bamboo lances. Before any of the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised Japanese could stop him, Diego</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reached the rack and snatched out</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the fourteen-foot spears. Bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to the charge, he ran full-tilt across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravel, not in the direction of the gate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but toward a long, blank stretch of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer wall. Just as the spear-head seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to crash against the granite, Diego</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowered and thrust it^into the ground at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot of the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The butt of the shaft, with the man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging to it, rose straight up into the air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Letting go of the lance, Diego dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his side on the broad platform of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, rose and dived headforemost through</seg><seg type="columnLine">an embrasure into the deep waters of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">castle moat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A startled shout, half rage, half acclama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, went up from the astounded Japanese</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the courtyard. A mounted retainer on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the road outside reined up his horse at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound, and at the sight of a dripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreigner climbing out of the moat beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The horseman made the mistake of</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing up too close; just as he snatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">out his sword, Diego was upon him. Put-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting one hand under the red-lacquered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoe-like stirrup, the athletic Spaniard</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a great heave that lifted the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the saddle and dropped him, half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunned and wholly bewildered, into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of the road. Before the retainer</seg><seg type="columnLine">could scramble to his feet again, Diego had</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted and was galloping down the road</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind him, armed men were pouring in</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting hundreds out of the castle gate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Drums began to beat, conches sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarsely; from both the thatch-roofed</seg><seg type="columnLine">town on Diego's right and the huge old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buddhist temple on his left erupted sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">streams' of men-at-arms. A matchlock</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared; a flight of arrows whirred past</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fugitive's head, but the range was long</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the target far from stationary. Bare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">legged peasants toiling in the wet paddy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fields looked up curiously at the hunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">horseman, but made no attempt to stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; farming was their trade, fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">their masters'.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the beach was very near. Drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">up on the sand like a Viking fleet were</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty or more great open row-boats,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to be manned and pushed off. Diego</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of the flint and steel in his pouch;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there was no time to try burning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy's boats--the pursuers were too</seg><seg type="columnLine">close. Straight down the beach and into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water he rode the panting pony, till</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saddle was awash.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Saint James be praised!" cried Diego</seg><seg type="columnLine">fervently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Halfway between him and the anchored</seg><seg type="columnLine">galleon was the San Gregorio's long-boat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a giant's rosary of fresh-filled water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casks bobbing astern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. "Ho, Gil Robles, to me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Standing up in his stirrups, Diego shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">174</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and waved his broad-brimmed felt hat</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its dripping plume. The stocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure in the stern of the long-boat looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">'round, waved back, whipped out a gleam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing knife and cut the tow-rope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even so, we have filled enough casks</seg><seg type="columnLine">today to last us to the rain-belt of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper latitudes," thought Diego, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw away his hat and dived from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle. "Good man, Gil!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'Round came the long-boat, starboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">oars backing, port oars pulling, in a smother</seg><seg type="columnLine">of foam and a crackling roar of Biscayan</seg><seg type="columnLine">oaths from the mate. Diego swam swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to meet it, his long rapier hampered</seg><seg type="columnLine">him cruelly, but he would not part with it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He swam under water as much as possible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming to the surface only for a hastily-</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched breath and diving again, for fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of arrows from the shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But no arrows fell. Looking back as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">swam, Diego saw the beach a solid mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of excited Japanese soldiery, and, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front rank, archers lowering their bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">bows at the imperative gestures of Kuru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shima, on horseback and in full armor at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water's edge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Heathen though he is," thought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grateful Spaniard, "there breathes not in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all Christendom a more gallant knight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleman than Lord Kurushima!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      THIRTY strokes more, and Gil</seg><seg type="columnLine">Robles was helping him into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long-boat.

Back shrilled an</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer from the boatswain on the ship; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers' trumpeter sounded the call to arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men swarmed up the galleon's shrouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lay out on the yards. 'Round creaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the windlass, as the huge hempen anchor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cable writhed in through the hawse-hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a frightened snake. Foresail and main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sail, huge single topsails--top-gallants and</seg><seg type="columnLine">royals there were none--the little square</seg><seg type="columnLine">spritsail under the high-steeved bowsprit</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the tall, graceful lateen on the mizzen--</seg><seg type="columnLine">all were set and the anchor apeak, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">long-boat shot 'round the San Gregorio's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bows and along her starboard side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the off-shore breeze brought her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head 'round and her port battery to bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the approaching Japanese flotilla.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let them have it!" shouted Diego, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he came over the rail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Already loaded and run out, the nine</seg><seg type="columnLine">culverins on the gun-deck and the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces on the poop and forecastle thundered</seg><seg type="columnLine">together. Before the dense cloud of sul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">furous smoke had lifted, the galleon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">running, with the wind on her starboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter, for the open sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The saints be praised, the heathen are</seg><seg type="columnLine">all slain!" cried a fat Manila silk-dealer, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">pious fervor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two boats sunk, one sinking, the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming on bravely," corrected Diego,</seg><seg type="columnLine">peering through the lifting powder-smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">astern.

The low waist lay like a valley be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween them; to raise its sides and make</seg><seg type="columnLine">them harder for a foe to scale, strips of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stout canvas, painted with gay armorial</seg><seg type="columnLine">devices, were stretched along the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulwarks from poop to forecastle. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the waist-cloths, ancestors of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nineteenth-century boarding-net.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two Strong Men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">175</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mounted at the break of poop and fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">castle were the bases, minions and mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derers; wicked little breech-loading swivels</seg><seg type="columnLine">that could sweep any part of deck or rail</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a storm of small shot.	*3</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Boy, bring me my armor!" cried Diego;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the cabin-boy was below, sanding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun-deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, suddenly, some one stood by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain's side, placing the helmet tenderly</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his head, buckling on his breast and</seg><seg type="columnLine">back plates.

Passing by her infuriated</seg><seg type="columnLine">betrothed as if he did not exist, she went</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the little chapel of Saint Gregory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that opened off the main cabin, and knelt</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the 'altar, where the priests and</seg><seg type="columnLine">friars were praying for deliverance from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury of the heat.hen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On plunged the galleon, at the top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her ponderous speed; the wind was freshen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, the ebb-tide ran like a mill-race down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the narrow channel. But the long, many-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oared craft astern gained steadily, urged</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the straining efforts of the rowers, till</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were not quite within musket-shot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At that distance they remained, holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">their position easily, but making no effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">to gain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I like it not," said Lieutenant Gomez,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Diego came up to inspect the defenses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the poop.

There were five of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying squarely across the fairway, broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side on to the approaching galleon.

But that was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">accurate work for the primitive smooth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bores, on a high-built, deep-pitching galleon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Down came the junk's foremast, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud of splinters flew from her rotten top-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides; that was all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A worn-out, empty hulk," said Gil</seg><seg type="columnLine">Robles, as Diego came on deck again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"With our weight and speed, we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">ride right over her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no other way.

We are on her!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a great crash of splintering timbers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bluff bows of the San Gregorio crushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the frail hull of the fishing-junk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapping her ribs and deck-beams like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">veins of a dried leaf. Then the incredible</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened. Instead of sinking or breaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">in two, the shattered, distorted wreck</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped itself 'round the destroyer's fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot, staying her progress, bringing her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside of ten seconds, from full speed to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead standstill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The strain on the San Gregorio's fabric</seg><seg type="columnLine">was terrific--no modern wind-jammer could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have suffered it without losing most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her top-hamper. But the Manila-Acapulco</seg><seg type="columnLine">galleons had small sail area, teak masts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">massive rigging of pure abaca fiber.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though every inch of her shrieked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">protest, nothing carried away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her plight, however, was hideously ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vious. The wrecked junk plastered 'round</seg><seg type="columnLine">her bows was held together and made fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">176</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">by thick grass hawsers to her four consorts;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and each of the five was double-anchored,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow and stern! The galleon's impact had</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent the line of junks, causing the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest the wreck to drag their anchors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">till the Japanese craft were close up under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the San Gregorio's forecastle, one on either</seg><seg type="columnLine">side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Clear away that wreckage!

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">before they could sever a single strand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there erupted from the holds of the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">uninjured junks a shrieking horde of naked</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown men brandishing naked steel. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were near enough leaped down with</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-heaved blades; others dived over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board and swam round to the wreck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding their swords in their teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gil Robles split the first comer's skull</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his hatchet.

Fighting furiously, the mate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of his detail made good their</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreat up over the bows, while the heathen</seg><seg type="columnLine">hacked at them from below. At last they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were once more sheltered by the high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">square-built forecastle. Here they turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their pursuers, and hurled the foremost</seg><seg type="columnLine">foemen down into the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Send forward the musketeers," implored</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gil Robles, swinging his dripping hatchet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Swivels and musketeers!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But a roar of musketry from the poop</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him the soldiers were busy aft. Well</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might be. The Japanese flotilla</seg><seg type="columnLine">astern was closing in on the trapped galleon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as-fast as oars could drive it. Trapped she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, but not defenseless--the San Gregorio's</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern-chasers, loaded with a solid-shot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bag of bullets each, smashed one crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowboat and made fearful havoc aboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">three more.	*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well done, Master-Gunner!" shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Diego down the main-hatch.

Close and make fast the port-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shutters; then on deck, all!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A savage yell of triumph burst from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throats of the bloodthirsty swordsmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard the two leading Japanese craft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One to port and one to starboard, they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">swept up and made fast alongside the San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gregorio's waist. The eager warriors on</seg><seg type="columnLine">board them took no heed of the galleon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">topmen, who, having furled and stowed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore and mainsails, lay out on the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards. Yet ready to the hands of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">topmen lurked death and destruction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knives flashed through lanyards, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great iron cannon-ball dropped like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunderbolt from aloft on each boat be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath, smashing huge holes through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom-boards.

But at each tell-tale inward bulge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the baffling waist-cloths, a Spanish pike</seg><seg type="columnLine">or sword-point would lunge through canvas</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flesh together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arrows tore through the galleon's rigging.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A big negro on the main-yard fell screaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the sea, a gaily-feathered shaft stick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out from between his shoulder-blades.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Back scrambled his mates to the shelter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the round, high-walled fighting-tops; their</seg><seg type="columnLine">trick had worked well, but it could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked but once. The rest of the Japanese</seg><seg type="columnLine">flotilla had now come up, its archers loosing</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly, its eager swordsmen ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">board.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Spanish musket-balls splintered their</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunwales and tore through their armor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inflicting horrible, tearing wounds; but in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of it, the sampans grappled the San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gregorio fore and aft, port and starboard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as many as could crowd alongside. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest vomited their swordsmen over the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">and into the already packed hulls of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were at close grips. Trained to scale</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls and surmount all obstacles, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallant Samurai, burdened as they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">with armor, swarmed up the sides of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">galleon as easily as the naked men from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the junks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their keen swords slashed away the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist-cloths, now sodden with blood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck full of arrows. Only point or ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">told against them; no cutlas edge could</seg><seg type="columnLine">shear through their strange, loose-meshed</seg><seg type="columnLine">mail of lacquered steel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eight times the Japanese won a footing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the deck amidships.

Eight times</seg><seg type="columnLine">Diego led a handful of weary pikemen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a charge that drove the survivors back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the sea.

Tottering with hands out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung, Feliz fell dead over the fragments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own morion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wrenching his sword free, the Daimio</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to face a seaman who thrust at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a pike. With three strokes of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credible swiftness, Kurushima parried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust, cut the pike-head from its staff, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent the seaman's own head rolling after</seg><seg type="columnLine">it into the scuppers. This was too much--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other Spaniards bunched near shrank</seg><seg type="columnLine">back before him and away from the rail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">over which more Japanese, encouraged by</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lord's example, were clambering in</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing numbers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, men of Tosa!" shouted Kurushima.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The ship is ours!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold them five minutes!" rang an</seg><seg type="columnLine">answering voice in Spanish. "Hold them</seg><seg type="columnLine">off five minutes, and we are free!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And rallying his weary crew, Diego de</seg><seg type="columnLine">Torres leaped forward and crossed swords</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Kurushima. Arch-types of the East-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern and Western warriors of their day, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two engaged in single combat, unhindered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the general melee raging 'round them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No other Spaniard wished to meddle with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrible Daimio; and no Japanese</seg><seg type="columnLine">warrior would have presumed to interfere</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a battle-field duel between two chiefs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Diego, fighting for time, stood on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">defense; but Kurushima attacked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate speed and fury. He did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what new and terrible means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistance the galleon's crew might use at</seg><seg type="columnLine">any moment, and he could see his own men</seg><seg type="columnLine">look anxiously up at the silent swivels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as they fought. And ever in Kuru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shima's mind was a vision of the San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gregorio, under his own command, sinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tortoise-boat and freeing the way for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japan's armies to march on to endless</seg><seg type="columnLine">conquests. The thought that on the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come of this combat hung the fate of Asia</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerved his every blow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In all Japan, few swordsmen were Kuru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shima's equal. His strokes sheared through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stoutest mail, his feints were dazzling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sureness of eye and hand proverbial.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With all his tremendous strength and skill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he cut and slashed, leaping back and forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">to confuse his opponent. Now he struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Diego's head, now for his right shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now for his left thigh, turning his blade in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mid-stroke, till it seemed to fill the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him with a shimmering mist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But wherever it fell, the Japanese sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat and glanced off the parrying blade of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Spanish rapier. Never was the contact</seg><seg type="columnLine">at such an angle that the edge of the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">two-handed weapon could bite into and cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the slender ribbon of steel which</seg><seg type="columnLine">always met and turned it. The European's</seg><seg type="columnLine">supple wrist-play gave him a freedom and</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of reach unknown to the Samurai,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who held his long hilt rigidly with both</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. And ever as Diego parried, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied the strength and weakness of Kuru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shima's strange, silk-braided mail, designed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to turn the edge--but not the point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, as Kurushima heaved up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword for a mighty blow, a cold, tingling</seg><seg type="columnLine">pang shot through his exposed breast. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroke stayed in mid-air, he glanced down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw Diego's silver hilt pressed firmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his breast-bone, the Spaniard's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm outstretched behind it. With a sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull, Diego withdrew his rapier. A foun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain of blood spurted after it; the long blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself was bloody to the point. Kurushima</seg><seg type="columnLine">strove to bring down his own sword, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead, he heaved a long sigh and slid in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumpled heap to the deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">At that very moment, two mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">columns of water, crested with shattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">bits of wood, cordage and human fragments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spouted high into the air from under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">An Alaskan to Wild Geese</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">179</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">galleon's bows. The roar of a double</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosion followed instantly. In obedience</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the captain's orders, the old master-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunner and his mates had dropped the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">two barrels of powder, fitted with burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuses, over the bows to blow away the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangled mass of wreckage and hawsers</seg><seg type="columnLine">that held the ship a prisoner. By one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those rare miracles that sometimes crown</seg><seg type="columnLine">supreme daring, the explosion had done its</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended work without damaging the gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The San Gregorio, her bows heaved high</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air by the force of the concussion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shivered, and brought them down with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">force that snapped the last strands which</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound her. Urged by wind and tide, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">galleon surged ahead, out of the mouth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the channel and into the open sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Terrified by this fearful phenomenon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and by the fall of their invincible Daimio,</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the surviving Japanese turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw themselves overside. The rest cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">down their weapons and begged for mercy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was readily granted, for the San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gregorio was now too desperately short-</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed to continue the light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Te Deum Laiidamus!" sang the priests</seg><seg type="columnLine">and friars in the chapel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Diego, kneeling on the crimsoned deck,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">felt two soft arms steal 'round his neck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a kiss upon his cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I saw it all," whispered Ysabel.

It has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been adventurous, more so perhaps than the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jority of lives. Adventure was bred in me. Born</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one of the prettiest of Norwegian fjords, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">every knoll was a monument to some ancient hero,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where every name was an echo of battle-blasts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">songs of swords, I received as a legitimate heritage</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roving spirit of the Vikings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The intensest recollections of my childhood are</seg><seg type="columnLine">memories of adventure and dreams of adventure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clearly I recall the long Winter evenings on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">farm when I sat on father's knee listening to tales of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his adventures on sea and land in many countries</seg><seg type="columnLine">and climes. They were exciting, breathless ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventures, possible only under the more primitive con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditions of half a century ago. Each tale was a tonic</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my imagination, stimulated my mind to fantastic</seg><seg type="columnLine">activities. At night, before going to sleep, I in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vented the most gorgeous careers for myself.

There were, for instance, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">docks of the nearby seaport with their ceaseless</seg><seg type="columnLine">activities, and the men-of-war, English, German</seg><seg type="columnLine">and French, that each Summer dropped anchor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with much booming of guns, in the roadstead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nothing could be more entrancing to a boy than</seg><seg type="columnLine">these martial vessels, or the crews with their gay</seg><seg type="columnLine">irresponsible ways and incomprehensible, strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">musical speech. Often of a Sunday morning my</seg><seg type="columnLine">two brothers and I trudged the eight miles to town</seg><seg type="columnLine">to marvel at them. At times the sailors would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take us aboard in their steam-launches, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">explored the ships from keel to bridge.

I was a boy alone in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange country, with only a smattering of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">language, a hounding sense of my own uselessness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unimportance, and thousands of miles from home.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were years of restlessness, of grim adventure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing odd work in odd places, searching for a posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in the order of things. Half of the States in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Union are associated with memories in my mind;</seg><seg type="columnLine">whenever I hear mentioned Nicaragua, Guatemala,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Costa Rica, Panama, recollections arc brought up;</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk of the sea and sailing and I can relate personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiences.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But throughout these first aimless years one pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose was my constant companion, to master the</seg><seg type="columnLine">English language. It seemed a hopeless task but</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too fascinating to be let alone. It was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventure in itself the hunting through books for</seg><seg type="columnLine">new words, jotting them down, and getting their</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning whenever a dictionary was within reach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In spite of their harshness, however, those years</seg><seg type="columnLine">were kind. I became acquainted with life, gained a</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater knowledge of myself; and out of the chaos</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my mind grew definite aims which in later less</seg><seg type="columnLine">outwardly exciting years I have tried to realize. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have had a few hard lessons, and I hope I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">profited by them. Life owes me nothing. Out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighing all disappointments, failures, is the gift,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grant of a tomorrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DEFORE I close this confidential but necessarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">rambling talk with you, the readers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Camp-Fire," I wish to mention my work. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">new in the fiction field; but in the future I hope to</seg><seg type="columnLine">devote all my time and energy to it. I do not in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tend to write stories because the work is easy. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't. I wish to write because I wish to justify my</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence, to give something of myself to the world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you. And I want to please you if I can; I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to like me; you are necessary to me. And you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be assured I shall never try to impose upon'</seg><seg type="columnLine">you.

Sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">retary Baker's incompetency seems suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficiently established in other ways. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">pacifist Secretary of War who for three</seg><seg type="columnLine">years refused to prepare at all because "the</seg><seg type="columnLine">war was three thousand miles away" is bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, but a Secretary of War who, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly a year of American participation, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">still three thousand miles away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">war and three million miles away from any</seg><seg type="columnLine">real comprehension of its needs is too lim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ited mentally for the country's fate to rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">so largely in his small hand. If you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced of the incompetency of officials,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is your duty to call for their removal. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is only your second duty to America.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Your first duty is to do your own part well</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fully.

In the present upheaval</seg><seg type="columnLine">of economic conditions, with practical ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complishment dependent so largely upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual effort and stimulus, an eighty per</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent, tax, as in England, would seem wiser</seg><seg type="columnLine">and productive of quicker, better and big-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger results. But not less than eighty per</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent. Most of us believe that the hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of millions of such profits already made</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be the first money spent for Liberty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bonds, since what earned them is so large</seg><seg type="columnLine">a part of what the war is waged to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tect. It is our second duty to America</seg><seg type="columnLine">to force Congress and the Administration</seg><seg type="columnLine">to distribute the cost of the war more fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and justly.

It is our second duty to demand a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coalition Government, but first we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarantee our own full energies and support.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buy Bonds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE KNOW that, after two years and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of warning followed by nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">a year actually in the war, great America,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the richest country in the world, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">population of a hundred millions, is now</seg><seg type="columnLine">contributing to the war much money and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moral support, some brains, a navy smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">than it should be, and, at this writing in Jan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uary, an army almost the size of England's</seg><seg type="columnLine">casualty lists for six or nine months. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that great America is not able to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vital demand of the crisis for merchant</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships--which even a neutral and pacifist</seg><seg type="columnLine">country is free to build--and that at the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a whole year our contribution of ships is</seg><seg type="columnLine">still chiefly plans and provision for the future.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We know that great America was so un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared and so incompetent in the actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">test that she is not even yet able to equip</seg><seg type="columnLine">the comparatively small army she has put</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the field and has had to borrow from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her Allies what they needed for themselves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We know now that William Jennings Bryan</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his glib and silver-tongued prediction</seg><seg type="columnLine">that "a million men would spring to arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">between sunrise and sunset" has written</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself down as the ass of history. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin to feel now the whole long, bitter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragic proof of the blunder of Unprepared-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. It is our duty to see to it that, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">long as other nations carry arms, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">advocates of unpreparedness do not again</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring us to the brink of catastrophe. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">we must think of past unpreparedness now</seg><seg type="columnLine">only as a warning for the future. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">damage will be repaired, so far as it can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">repaired, not by complaint but by work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">loyalty, support.

Another of the Admin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istration's mistakes has been the building</seg><seg type="columnLine">up of the idea that any criticism of itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">is disloyalty. Purely destructive criticism</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it is disloyalty, at least in its effect, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither honest constructive criticism nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">a frank facing of the facts is unpatriotic</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the eyes of any one but fools.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Any man or institution that denies the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right of constructive criticism is un-Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can and undemocratic.

What is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate of pay for officers?"-, Superior, Wis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Answer, by Captain Dingle:--It matters little</seg><seg type="columnLine">how you start going to sea in order to become an</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer, but of course you must enter the Deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Department of ships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is not hard in these days for a young man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a job aboard ship; men are badly needed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospective officers are encouraged. Supposing</seg><seg type="columnLine">first of all that you are healthy, fairly robust, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">have good eyesight, you can do either of several</seg><seg type="columnLine">things: enter one of the big lines as a cadet, ship as</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy in any ship--ocean-going for preference--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter one of the various branches of the Naval</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reserve Service. All this experience will count.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You must serve on deck three years usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">before you are eligible to take the examination for</seg><seg type="columnLine">second mate. The knowledge in navigation neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary for this examination must be acquired by your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, either by study aboard the ship in your own</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, or by attending a school ashore between voy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages. It is by no means difficult. A high-school</seg><seg type="columnLine">education is more than most sailors have before</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to sea. Then, when you get the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate's license, and have served one year in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">capacity, you can take the first mate's exam.; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one year's service as first mate, the master's</seg><seg type="columnLine">exam, is open to you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You should be at least first mate in four years.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But in these war days I think a smart man can</seg><seg type="columnLine">become an officer quicker than the law stipulates.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barriers are being lowered in order to secure officers,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pay for officers at present is high. Third mates</seg><seg type="columnLine">are receiving as much as S75 per month. Of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are fed well and gratis; their lodging is in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, free. Second mates can get up to 8200, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mates as much as $300 in the Atlantic Trade.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captains are making huge sums, with war bonuses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratuities, etc. But after the war, you will, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps, realize, these wages can not obtain, unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">freights are to remain at their present exorbitant</seg><seg type="columnLine">rates. This can hardly be, I think, since trade can</seg><seg type="columnLine">not stand such charges. In any case, a steamer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer is paid well enough to make the profession</seg><seg type="columnLine">attractive, and the life is good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My advice is that you go to your nearest port on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seacoast, and apply in person to the chief mate</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">or captain of any good-sized ship going anywhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The chief mate usually engages the men, subject to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skipper's approval; but for a youngster to start</seg><seg type="columnLine">right he should try to select a fairly good-class</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipper, talk to him in person, and enlist his inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est. Captains in these times are of a superior</seg><seg type="columnLine">mold to the old-timers, at least in education and</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeding, though perhaps not better seamen.
