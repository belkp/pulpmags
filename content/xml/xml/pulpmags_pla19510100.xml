Beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city walls on the landward side, the island</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Achaera lifted still more steeply, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaunt rocky country with a few scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">farms and herds.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not even hear the voices of other</seg><seg type="columnLine">captives; there was only the slow dripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water and the harsh tones of iron links.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cell must lie below even the regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">dungeons, far down in the very bowels of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Vague images floated across his mind--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the high cliffs about Iliontis Bay, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great flowers blooming with sullen fires</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the jungle beyond the beach, the slim</seg><seg type="columnLine">black corsair galleys at anchor. He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered the open sky, the eternally</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouded sky under which blew the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet winds, out of which spilled rain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning and grew the eerie blue of dusk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had often wondered what lay beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">those upper clouds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now and then, he remembered, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see the vague disc of the Heaven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fire, and he had heard of times when</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredibly violent storms opened a brief</seg><seg type="columnLine">rift in the high cloud layers to let through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shaft of searing brilliance at whose touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">water boiled and the earth burst into</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame.

There had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been song and laughter and comradeship</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gigantic deeds over an endless waste</seg><seg type="columnLine">of waters--the long blue hush of twilight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soft black nights, the gray days with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sea running gray and green and gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">under squalls of rain, the storms roaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">and raging, the eager leap of a ship--</seg><seg type="columnLine">frenzy of battle at the taking of town</seg><seg type="columnLine">or galley, death so close one could almost hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beat of black wings, orgy of loot and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vengeance--the pirate town, grass huts</seg><seg type="columnLine">under jungle trees, stuffed with treasure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of brawling bawdy life, the scar-faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaggering men and the lusty insolent wo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, ruddy fire-light hammering back the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night while the stfrf thundered endlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the beach--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, all things came to a close. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he would have wished a differ</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of death for himself, he didn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">long to wait in this misery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something stirred, far down the nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row corridor, and he caught the flickering</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow of a torch. Scowling, he stood up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stooped under the low ceiling. Who in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the hells was this? It was too soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">for feeding, unless his time sense had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely awry, and he didn't think the</seg><seg type="columnLine">games could have been prepared in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">few days since his arrival.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They came up to the entrance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell and stood looking in by the guttering</seg><seg type="columnLine">red torchlight. A snarl twisted Corun's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips. Shorzon and Chryseis---"Of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scum of Achaera," he growled, "I had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be inflicted with you.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is no time for insolence," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sorcerer coldly. He lifted the torch</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher. The red light threw his face into</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood-splashed shadow. His eyes were pits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of darkness in which smoldered two em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers. His black robe blended with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounding shadow, his face and hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to float disembodied in the dank</seg><seg type="columnLine">air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corun's eyes traveled to Chryseis, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in spite of the hate that burned in him he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to admit she was perhaps the loveliest</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman he had ever seen. Tall and slim and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lithe, moving with the soundless grace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Sanduvian pherax, the dark hair sheen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down past the chill sculptured beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her marble-white face, she returned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue stare with eyes of dark flame. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dressed as if for action--a brief tunic</seg><seg type="columnLine">that left arms and legs bare, a short black</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloak, and high buskins--but jewels still</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazed at throat and wrists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind her padded a lean shadow at</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of which Corun stiffened. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of Chryseis' tame erinye. Folk said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the devil-beast had found a harder heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the witch's breast and yielded to her;</seg><seg type="columnLine">some said less mentionable things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The slitted green eyes flared at Corun</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the cruel muzzle opened in a fanged</seg><seg type="columnLine">yawn. "Back, Perias," said Chryseis evenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her voice was low and sweet, almost a</seg><seg type="columnLine">caress. It seemed strange that such a voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spoken the rituals of black sorcery</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ordered the flaying alive of a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless Issarian prisoners and counseled</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the darkest intrigues in Achaera's</seg><seg type="columnLine">10</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody history.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said to Corun: "This is a fine end</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all your noble thoughts, man of Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahur."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At least," he answered, "you credit me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with having had them.

"Human purposes have a habit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ending this way. The mighty warrior,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scourge of the seas, ends in a foul</seg><seg type="columnLine">prison cell waiting for an unimaginative</seg><seg type="columnLine">death.

"We offer you life, free-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom--and the liberation of Conahur!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He shook his tawny head. "It isn't even</seg><seg type="columnLine">funny."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no, I mean it," said Chryseis ear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nestly. "Shorzon had you put in here alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">not out of malice, but simply to make this</seg><seg type="columnLine">private talk possible. You can help us</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a project so immeasurably greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">than your petty quarrels that anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can ask in return will be as nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And you are the one man who can do so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I tell you this so that, realizing you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have some kind of bargaining position, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will meet as us as equal to equal, not as</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner to captor. If you agree to aid us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will be released this instant."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a sudden flame within him, Corun</seg><seg type="columnLine">tautened his huge body. O gods--O al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty gods beyond the clouds--if it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">true--!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice shook: "What do you want ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Your help in a desperate venture,'*</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Chryseis. "I tell you frankly that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">may well all die in it. But at least you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will die as a free man--and if we suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceed, all the world may be ours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?" he asked hoarsely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I cannot tell you everything now,"1</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Shorzon. "But the story has long</seg><seg type="columnLine">been current that you once sailed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lairs of the Xanthi, the Sea Demons, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">returned alive. Is it true?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye." Corun stiffened, with sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm trembling in his nerves. "Aye, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">great good luck I came back. But they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not a race for humans to traffic with."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I think the powers I can summon will</seg><seg type="columnLine">match theirs," said Shorzon. "We want</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to guide us to their dwellings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">teach us the language on the way, as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as whatever else you know about them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When we return, you may go where you</seg><seg type="columnLine">choose. And if we get their help, we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to set Conahur free soon after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corun shook his head. "It's nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">good that you plan," he said slowly. "No</seg><seg type="columnLine">one would approach the Xanthi for any</seg><seg type="columnLine">good purpose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You did, didn't you?" chuckled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wizard dryly. "If you want the truth, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are after their help in seizing the govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of Achaera, as well as certain knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge they have."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you succeeded," argued Corun stub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bornly, "why should you then let Cona-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hur go?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because power over Achaera is only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">step to something too far beyond the petty</seg><seg type="columnLine">goals of empire for you to imagine," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shorzon bleakly. "You must decide now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. If you refuse, you die."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chryseis moved one slim hand and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">erinye padded forward on razor-clawed</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. The leathery wings were folded back</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the long black body, the barbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail lashed hungrily and a snarl vibrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the lean throat. "If you say no," came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman's sweet voice, "Perias will rip</seg><seg type="columnLine">your guts out. That will at least afford us</seg><seg type="columnLine">an amusing spectacle for our trouble."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then she smiled, the dazzling smile which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had driven men to their doom ere this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But if you say yes," she whispered, "a</seg><seg type="columnLine">destiny waits for you that kings would</seg><seg type="columnLine">envy. You are a strong man, Corun. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">like strong men--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The corsair looked into the warm dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of her eyes, and back to the icy</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare of the devil-beast. No unarmed man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever survived the onslaught of an erin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ye--and he was chained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">At thought of returning to the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">home of the Xanthi, he shuddered. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">still wondrous sweet, and--once</seg><seg type="columnLine">WITCH OF THE DEMON SEAS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">11</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">free to move about, he might still have</seg><seg type="columnLine">some chance of escape or even of over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">powering them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Or--who knew? He wondered, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief giddiness, if the dark witch before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him could be as evil as her enemies said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Strong and ruthless, yes--but so was he.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he learned the full truth about</seg><seg type="columnLine">her soaring plans, he might even decide</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In any case--to live! To die, if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must, under the sky!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll go," he said hoarsely. "I'll go with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The low exultant laughter of Chryseis</seg><seg type="columnLine">sang in the flare-lit gloom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shorzon came up and took a key from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his belt. For a bare moment, the thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapping that skinny neck raged through</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corun's mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The magician smiled grimly. "Don't try</seg><seg type="columnLine">it,", he said. "As a small proof of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can do--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he was not there. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster from the jungles of Umlotu stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the cell with Corun, a scaled beast</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hissed at him with grinning jaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spewed poison on the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SORCERY! Corun shrank back, a chill</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fear striking even his steely heart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shorzon resumed human shape and word-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly unlocked the chains. They fell away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Corun stumbled out into the corridor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The erinye snarled and slipped closer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chryseis laid a hand on the beast's head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">checking that gliding rush as if with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">leash. Her smile and the faint sweet scent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her hair were dizzying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come," she said. One hand slipped be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween his own fingers and the cool touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to burn him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shorzon led the way, down a long slop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing tunnel where only the streaming torch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flames had life. Their footsteps echoed</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollowly in the wet black length of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We go at once," he said. "When Khro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man learns of your escape, all Tauros will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be after us. But it will be too late then.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We sail swiftly tonight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sail--whither ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What of my men?" asked Corun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're lost, I'm afraid, unless Khro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man spares them until we get back,''ys"'.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Chryseis. "But we saved you. I'm glad</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A faint smell of fresh salty air blew up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel. It must open on the sea,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thought Corun. He wondered how many</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">passages riddled the depth under Tauros.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They came out, finally, on a narrow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beach under the looming western cliffs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The precipices climbed into the utter dark</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of night, reaching into the unseen sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Before them lay open sea, swirling with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">phosphorescence. Corun drew deep lung-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fulls of air. Salt and seaweed and wet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wild wind--sand under his feet, sky over-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">head, a woman beside him--by the gods,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it was good to be alive!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A galley was moored against a tiny</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pier. By the light of bobbing torches,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Corun's mariner's eye surveyed her. She</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was built along the same lines as his own</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ship, a lean black vessel with one square</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sail; open-decked save at stem and stern,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rower's benches lining the sides with a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">catwalk running between. There would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be quarters for the men under the- poop</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and forecastle decks, supplies in the hold</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beneath. A cabin was erected near the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">waist, apparently for officers, and there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was a ballista mounted in the bows--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">otherwise no superstructure. A carved sea</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">monster reared up for figurehead, and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sternpost curved back to make its tail. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">read the name on the bows: Briseia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Strange that that dark vessel should bear</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a girl's name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  About a fifty-man capacity, he judged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">And she would be fast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The crew were getting aboard--they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">must have come down the cliffs along</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some narrow trail. They were all Umlo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tuan blues, he noticed, a cutthroat gang</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">if ever he saw one but silent and well</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">disciplined. It was shrewd to take only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the mercenary warriors along; they had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">no patriotic interest in what happened to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Achaera, and their reckless courage was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">legendary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A burly one-eyed officer came up and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">saluted. "All set, sir," he reported.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Good," nodded Shorzon. "Captain Im- *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">azu, this is our guide, Captain Corun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The raider, eh?" Imazu chuckled and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">jshook hands in the manner of the bar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">barians. "Well, we could hardly have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">12</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PJLAJVET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">better one, I'm sure. Glad to know you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corun."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pirate murmured polite phrases.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he decided that Imazu was a likeable</seg><seg type="columnLine">chap, and wondered what had led him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take service under anyone with Shor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zon's reputation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went aboard. "The Sea of Demons</seg><seg type="columnLine">lies due north," said Shorzon. "Is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right way to sail?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For the time being," nodded Corun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When we get closer, I'll be able to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you more exactly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you may as well wash and rest,"'</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Chryseis. "You need both." Her smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">was soft in the flickering red light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corun entered the cabin. It was divided</seg><seg type="columnLine">into three compartments--apparently Ima-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zu slept with his men, or perhaps on deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">as many men preferred. His own tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">room was clean, sparsely furnished with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bunk and a washbowl. He cleaned him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self eagerly and put on the fresh tunic</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid out for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he came back on deck the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was already under way. A strong south</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind was blowing, filling the dark sail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Briseia surged forward under its</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust. The phosphorescence shone around</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hull and out on the rolling waters.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Behind, the land faded into the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He'd certainly been given no chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape, he thought. Barring miracles, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to go through with it now--at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they reached the Sea of Demons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after which anything might happen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shivered a little, wondering darkly</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether he had done right, wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">what their mission was and what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world's fate was to be as a result of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chryseis slipped quietly up to stand be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side him. The erinye crouched down near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">by, his baleful eyes never leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Outward bound," she said, and laugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter was gay in her voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said nothing, but stared ahead into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'd better sleep, Corun," she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You're tired now, and you'll need all</seg><seg type="columnLine">your strength later." She laid a hand on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm, and laughed aloud. "It will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">an interesting voyage, to say the least."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rather! he thought with wry humors</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It occurred to him that the trip might</seg><seg type="columnLine">even have its pleasant aspects.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Goodnight, Corun," she said, and left</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently he went back to his room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sleep was long in coming, and uneasy</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it did arrive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN HE CAME OUT ON DECK</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the early morning, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a gray emptiness of waters out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gray horizon.

Cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">un let the tang of salt and moisture and</seg><seg type="columnLine">kelp, the huge restless vista of bounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves, the creak and thrum of the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the thundering surge of the ocean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swell luxuriously up within him, the sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple animal joy of being at home. The sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">was his home now, he realized vaguely;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been on it so long that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">his natural environment--his, as much as</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of the laridae wheeling on white</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings in the cloud-flying heavens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked over the watch. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be well handled--the sailors knew their</seg><seg type="columnLine">business. There were armored guards at</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow and stern, and the rest--clad in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain loincloth of ordinary seamen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world over--were standing by the sail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swabbing the decks, making minor repairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and otherwise occupying themselves. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">off duty were lounging or sleeping well out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the watch's way. The helmsman kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eye on the compass and held the tiller</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a practiced hand--good, good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Captain Imazu padded up to him on</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare feet. The Umlotuan wore helmet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and corselet, had a sword at his side, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried the whip of authority in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">gnarled blue hand. His scarred, one-eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">face cracked in a smile. "Good morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you, Captain Corun," he said politely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Conahurian nodded with an amia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility he had not felt for a long time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The ship is well handled," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">^'/Thanks. I'm about the only Umlotuan</seg><seg type="columnLine">WITCH OF THE DEMON SEAS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">who's ever skippered anything bigger than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a war-canoe, I suppose, but I was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Achaeran fleet for a long time." Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hideous but disarming smile. "I nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">met you professionally once or twice be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, but you always showed us a clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of L heels. Judging from what hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to ships that did have the misfor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune to overhaul you, I'm just as glad of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it." He gestured to the tiny galley below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poop deck. "How about some break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OVER FOOD which was better than</seg><seg type="columnLine">most to be had aboard ship, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell into professional talk. Like all cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains, Imazu was profoundly interested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old and seemingly insoluble problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">of finding an accurate position. "Dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckoning just won't do," he complained.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Men's estimates always differ, no matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">how good they may be. There isn't even</seg><seg type="columnLine">a decent map to be had anywhere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corun mentioned the efforts of theo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rists in Achaera, Conahur, and other civ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilized states to use the Heaven-Fire's alti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude to determine position north and south</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a given line. Imazu was aware of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, but regarded it as of little practical</seg><seg type="columnLine">value. "You just don't see it often enough,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he objected. "And most of the crew would</seg><seg type="columnLine">consider it the worst sort of impiety to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">aiming an instrument at it That's one</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason, I suppose, why Shorzon shipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">only Umlotuans. We don't worship the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heaven-Fire--our gods all live below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds." He cut himself a huge quid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">liangzi and stuffed it into his capacious</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth. "Anyway, it doesn't give you east</seg><seg type="columnLine">and west position."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The philosophers who think the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">is round say we could solve that problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">by making an accurate timepiece," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I know. But it's a lot of gas, if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask me. A sand-glass or a water-clock can</seg><seg type="columnLine">only tell time so close and no closer, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">those mechanical gadgets they've built are</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse yet. I knew an old skipper from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norriki once who kept a joss in his cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and got his position in dreams from it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only had one wreck in his life." Imazu</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned. "Of course, he drowned then."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look," said Corun suddenly, "do yp**</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">know where the hell we're going, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">why ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To the Sea of Demons is all they told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.

I've a notion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of us won't live to find out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm surprised that any crew could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">made to go there without a mutiny."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This gang of bully boys is only fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened of Shorzon and his witch grand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter. They--" Imazu shut up. Look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing around, Corun saw the two approach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the morning light, Chryseis did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem the luring devil-woman of the night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She moved with easy grace across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling deck, the wind blowing her tunic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her long black hair in careless billows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was a girlish joy and eagerness</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her. The pirate's heart stumbled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She chattered gaily of nothing while</seg><seg type="columnLine">she and the old man ate. Shorzon re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained silent until he was through, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">said curtly to the two men: "Come into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin with us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They filled Corun's tiny room, sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on bunk and floor. Shorzon said slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We may as well begin now to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you know, Corun. What is the truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">about your voyage to the Xanthi?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was several seasons ago," replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corsair. "I got the thought you seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have had, that possibly I could enlist</seg><seg type="columnLine">their help against my enemies." He smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirthlessly. "I learned better."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do we know of them, exactly?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Shorzon methodically. He ticked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">points off on his lean fingers. "They are</seg><seg type="columnLine">an amphibious non-human race dwelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Sea of Demons, which is said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grow grass so that ships become tangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">there and never escape."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not so," said Corun. "There's kelp</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the surface, but you can sail right</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it. I think the Sea is just a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">region of water around which the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean currents move."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know," said Shorzon impatiently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and resumed his summary: "Generations</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago, the Xanthi, of whose presence men</seg><seg type="columnLine">had only been vaguely aware before, fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon all the islands in their sea and slew</seg><seg type="columnLine">14	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the people living there. They had great</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers, as well as tamed sea monsters</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unknown powers of sorcery, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one could stand against them. Since</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, they have not gone beyond their</seg><seg type="columnLine">borders, but they ruthlessly destroy all</seg><seg type="columnLine">human vessels venturing inside. King Phi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dion III of Achaera sent a great fleet to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive the Xanthi from their stolen terri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory. Not one ship returned. Men now</seg><seg type="columnLine">shun the whole region as one accursed."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Imazu nodded. "There's a sailor's le-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gend that the souls of the damned go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Xanthi," he offered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shorzon gave him an exasperated look.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm only interested in facts," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">coldly. "What do you know, Corun ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know what you just said, as who</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't?" answered the Conahurian. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think they must have limits to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers, and be reasonable creatures--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the limits are far beyond man's, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their reason is not as ours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't try an invasion, of course. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">took one small fast boat manned with</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked volunteers and waited outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sea for a storm that would blow me into</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. When that came, we ran before it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast! In the rain and wind and waves, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">figured we could get undetected far into</seg><seg type="columnLine">their borders. So, it seemed, we could,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in fact we made it almost to the largest</seg><seg type="columnLine">island inside. Then they came at us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They were riding cetaraea, and driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea serpents before them. They had spears</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bows and swords, and there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of them. Any one of the snakes</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have smashed our boat. We ran for</seg><seg type="columnLine">land and barely made it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We hadn't come to fight, so we held up</seg><seg type="columnLine">our hands as the Xanthi leaped ashore</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wondered if they'd just hack us down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, as I'd hoped, they wanted to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what we were there for. So they took us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the black castle on the island."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Momentarily Corun was cold as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the memory of that wet dark place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of evil shuddered through his mind. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't tell you much about it. They have</seg><seg type="columnLine">great powers of sorcery, and the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed somehow unreal, never the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">--always wrong, always with something</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible just beyond vision in the shadows.'*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I remember the whole time as if it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dream. There were treasures beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">counting. I saw gold and jewels from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea bottom, mixed in with human skulls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the figureheads of drowned ships.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The light was dim and blue, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was always fog, and noises for which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had no name hooting out in the gloom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It stank, with the vile fishy smell they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have. And the walls seemed to have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">watery unreality, as I said, shifting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fading like smoke. You could smell sor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cery in the very air of that place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They kept us there for many ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">days. We'd brought rich gifts, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they accepted ungraciously, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they housed us in a dungeon under guard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They didn't feed us so badly, if you like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a steady fish diet.

No</seg><seg type="columnLine">human throat can. Something like this--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">They stiffened at the chill hissing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">slithered from Corum's lips. "It has words</seg><seg type="columnLine">for things I never did understand, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacks many of the commonest human</seg><seg type="columnLine">words--fear, joy, hope, adventure--" His</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance slid to Chryseis--"love--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do they have a word for hate ?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shorzon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes," Corun grinned without hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mor. After a moment he went on: "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to know more of the outside world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was why they spared our lives. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">we knew the language well enough, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to question us. How they ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned us! It got to be torture, those un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ending days of answering the things that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hissed and gabbled at us in those shadowy</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms. It was like a nightmare, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad happenings go on without ever end-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Politics, science, philosophy, art, geo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graphy--they wanted to know it all. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">pumped us dry of knowledge. When we</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to something they didn't understand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as--love, say--they went back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth over the same ground, over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">over again, until we thought we'd go crazy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And at last they'd give up in bafflement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think they believe humans to be mad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I made my offer, of course: the loot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Achaera in exchange for the freedom</seg><seg type="columnLine">gf Conahur.

Finally they answered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorn that they could take whatever they</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted, the whole world if need be, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out my help."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Shorzon's eyes glittered. "Did you find</seg><seg type="columnLine">out anything of their powers?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A little. They put any human magi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cian to shame, of course. I saw them</seg><seg type="columnLine">charm sea monsters to death ju8t to eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. I saw them working on a new build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on the island--they planted a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">package somewhere, and set fire to it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">great stones leaped into the air with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bang like thunder. I saw their cetaraea</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavalry, their tamed war-snakes--oh, yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have more powers than I could name.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And their numbers must be immense. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">live on the sea bottom, you know--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is, their commoners do. The leaders have</seg><seg type="columnLine">strongholds on land as well. They farm</seg><seg type="columnLine">both sea and land, and have great smithies</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the islands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, in the end they let us go. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were going to put us to death for our</seg><seg type="columnLine">trespass, I think, but I did some fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking. I told them that we could carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">word of their strength back to humans</seg><seg type="columnLine">and overawe our race with it, so that if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they ever wanted to collect tribute or</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of the sort, they'd never have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fight for it. Probably that carried less</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight than the fact that we had, after all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">done no harm and been of some use. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no logical reason to kill us--so they</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't." Corun smiled grimly. "We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pretty tough crew, prepared to take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few Xanthi to death with us even if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were disarmed. Their killing-charms seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work only on animals. That was another</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason to spare us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "One of their wizards was for having me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least, slain.

Moreover, they pointed out, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was to be the case then there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing they could do about it; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to believe in a fixed destiny. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea amused them so much that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still another reason for letting us go."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corun shrugged. "So we sailed away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's all. And never till now did I have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">any smallest thought of returning."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He added bleakly after a moment when</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence had been heavy: "They have all</seg><seg type="columnLine">they want to know from my visit.

The erinye settled his long body</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside Chryseis and watched Corun with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepy malevolence, but he was hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of the devil-beast.

There was almost a flat calm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glassy water was ruffled only by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint breeze which half filled the sail and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent the galley sliding slowly and noise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly northward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Man the oars," directed Shorzon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give the men a chance to rest to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, sir," begged Imazu.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went into his room and slammed the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently Chryseis bade the men good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night and went to her quarters with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">erinye trotting after.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corun's eyes followed her through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deepening blue dusk.

I never had much sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They wandered up on the poop deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">in search of a place to sit. It was deserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">save for the helmsman by the dimly glow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing binnacle, a deeper shadow in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick blue twilight. Sitting back against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the taffrail, they could look forward to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lean waist of the ship and the vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">outline of the listlessly bellying sail. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the hull, the sea was an arabesque</seg><seg type="columnLine">of luminescence, delicate traceries of shift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing white light out to the glowing horizon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cold fire streamed from the ship's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bows and whirled in her wake, the hull</seg><seg type="columnLine">dripped liquid flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night was very quiet.

"I like it not, Corun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have evil feelings about it, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">omens I took before leaving weren't good."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why then did you sail?

He put</seg><seg type="columnLine">his geas on most of these sailors, for in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance.

He has</seg><seg type="columnLine">their souls?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">• "Aye. He put them to sleep in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorcerous way and impressed his command</seg><seg type="columnLine">on them.

He put no</seg><seg type="columnLine">such binding on me--I knew better than</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accept his offer of a luck-bringing spell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he has other ways. He lent me a slave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl from Umlotu for my pleasure--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she is lovely, wonderful, kind, all-that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman should be. She has borne me sons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made homecoming ever a joy. But you</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, she is still Shorzon's and he will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">sell her to me or free her--moreover, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did put his geas on her. If ever I rebelled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she would suffer for it." Imazu spat over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rail. "So I am Shorzon's creature too."'</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It must be a strange service."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It is.

"Only--be careful, pi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate. Don't let her lay her own sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">geas on you. You've been a free man</seg><seg type="columnLine">till now.

"Come, my dearest, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooler on the afterdeck."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sailors rowed steadily, sweat glis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tening on their bare blue hides.

It was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what were the spells? he wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the thousandth time. He did not hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the simple theory that wizards were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in league with gods or demons. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers, yes, but he was sure that some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how these powers came only from within</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves. Chryseis had always evaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">his questions about it. There must be some</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple answer to the problem, some real</seg><seg type="columnLine">process, as real as that of making a fire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the performances of the sorcerers</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but it baffled him to think what it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blast it all, it just wasn't reasonable</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Shorzon, for instance, should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been able actually to change himself into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a jungle monster many times his size.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet he, Corun, had seen the thing, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt its wet scales and smelled its reptile</seg><seg type="columnLine">stink. How?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SHIP plowed slowly on. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then Corun looked at the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass, straining his eyes to discern the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurred needle.

Hissing and snapping, his foe</seg><seg type="columnLine">toppled on him. He heaved the struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">body away and sprang back to his stance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To me!" bellowed Imazu.

Imazu stood stolidly against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mast, smashing at all comers. A rush of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xanthi broke past him and surged against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foredeck. The defenders beat them</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, Chryseis thrusting as savagely with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her sword as any man, and they reeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">back against the masthead warriors to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A Xanthian sprang at Corun, wielding a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long-shafted ax that shivered the sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand.

He saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic gleam of scales, guards pacing</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the walls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly, he edged his way across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">out jutting tower to the main wall of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">castle. Slantwise, he crept over its surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">until a slit of blackness loomed before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, another window. He had to squeeze</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get through, the stone scraping his skin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment he stood inside, breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing heavily, the drawn sword in his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a corridor stretching beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">this room, on into a darkness lit by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghostly blue fungus-glow. He saw and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard nothing of the Xanthi, but some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thing scuttled across the floor and crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a shadowed corner, watching him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On noiseless bare feet, he ran down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hall. Fog eddied and curled in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenebrous length of it, he heard the drip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping of water and once a shuddering</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream ripped the dank air. He thought he</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered where he was in that laby-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rinth--left here, and there would be an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other ramp going down--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A huge golden form loomed around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the comer. Before the jaws could open</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shout, Corun's sword hissed in a vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc and the Xanthian's head leaped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulders. He kicked the flopping body</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind a door and sped on his way, pant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Halfway down the ramp, a narrow en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance gaped, one of the tunnels that rid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dled the building through its massive walls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corun slithered down its lightless wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">length. It should open on the great cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber and--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Black against the dim blue light of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exit, a motionless form was squatting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corun groaned inwardly. They had a guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">against intruders, then. Best to go back</seg><seg type="columnLine">now -- no! He snarled soundlessly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounded forward, clutching the sword in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand and reaching out with the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fingers rasping across the scaly hide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hooked the thing's neck into the crook</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his elbow and yanked the heavy body</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into the tunnel with one enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrench. Blind in the darkness, he stabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the mouth, driving the point of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword through flesh and bone into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dying monster's claws raked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he crouched over the body. He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flected grimly that no matter how bene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volent the Xanthi might be, he would die</seg><seg type="columnLine">for murder if they ever caught him. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had no great fear of their suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming tender toward mankind. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulk of the reptile race was peaceable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually, but their rulers were relentess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tunnel opened on a small balcony</seg><seg type="columnLine">halfway up the rearing chamber wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corun lay on his belly, peering down over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEY SAT at a long table, the lords</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Demon Sea, and he felt a dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">WITCH OF THE DEMON SEAS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">29</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise at seeing that they were almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">through eating. Had his nightmare journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken that long? They were talking, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound drifted up to his ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the head of the table, Tsathu and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his councillors sat on a long ornate couch</seg><seg type="columnLine">ablaze with beaten gold. Shorzon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chryseis were reclining nearby, sipping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitter yellow wine of the Xanthi. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange to hear the hideous hissing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">croaking of the reptile language coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Chryseis' lovely throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "--interesting, I am sure," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">king.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "More than that--more than that!" It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to Corun that he could almost see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrible fire in Shorzon's eyes. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">wizard leaned forward, shaking with in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensity. "You can do it. The Xanthi can</seg><seg type="columnLine">conquer Achaera with ease. Your sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavalry and serpents can smash their ships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">your devil-powder can burst their walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air, your legions can overrun their</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, your wizardry blind and craze them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the terror you will inspire will force</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people to do our bidding."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Possibly you overrate us," said Tsathu.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is true that we have great numbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a strong army, but do not forget that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Xanthi are actually a more peaceful</seg><seg type="columnLine">race than man. Your kind is hard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage, murdering even each other, mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing war simply for loot or glory or no</seg><seg type="columnLine">real reason at all. Until the king-race</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose, the Xanthi dwelt quietly on the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom and a few small islands, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish to harm anyone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They have not even the natural capa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">city for magic possessed, however unde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped, by all humans. As a result they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are much more susceptible to it than men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus, when the king-race was born with</seg><seg type="columnLine">such powers, they were soon able to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol all their people and make themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">the absolute masters of the Xanthi. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">we, kings and wizards and lords of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Demon Sea, are all one interbred clan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without us, the Xanthi power would col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapse; they would go back to what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even Xanthi science is all of our mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.

"Do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">read weakness into that admission," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Even though all the lords who make</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xanthian might are gathered in this one</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, that power is still immeasurably</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater than you can imagine. To show</seg><seg type="columnLine">you how helpless you are--your men are</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked into the dungeons and your geas</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been lifted from their minds."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Impossible!" gasped Shorzon.

As of</seg><seg type="columnLine">today, your folk are free in soul, hating</seg><seg type="columnLine">you for what you made them. You are</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great scaled forms edged closer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">menacingly. Corun's fist clenched about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword. If they harmed Chryseis--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she said cooly: "It does not matter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our men were simply to bring us here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing else.

With us, skilled sor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerers, to direct, and the soldiers of Xan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thi to compel obedience, we could lay a</seg><seg type="columnLine">geas on whole nations without even hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to be near them.

Two human</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings on the Moon. Each eager to kill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randick shook his head angrily.

A slight movement among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreckage caught his trained eye and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">launched a projectile at it. It flared wick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly, tearing fragments of metal loose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flinging them fantastic distances down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer slope of the ridge. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">return fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Randick broke out of the shadow and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ran for the cover of a large pumicestone</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulder farther up the draw. A sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright flash of fire spattered the loose soil</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen feet from him. He slid for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness on his belly. That one had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a near thing!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Behind the boulder lay a trench-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">depression that sloped away up the draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the pass.

Another explosion</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocked the boulder he had just left. Ran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dick didn't even look back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt his breath rasping in his throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his body felt hot and sticky inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulky pressure suit. Glancing down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his right, he could see the proudly erect</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape of his own rocket far below on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor of the crater.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took him almost thirty minutes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the edge of the shadow that spilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the side of the mountain pass. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">his left, not ten feet away, was the sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">white glare of the pumice floor. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">well above and almost behind the wreck</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Russian's ship. His flanks were</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaving with the exertion of the climb as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he searched the buckled mass of the crash</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his opponent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There seemed to be a dark shape wedged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in between two twisted bulkheads. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like a man. With pounding heart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randick murmured a prayer and lifted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bazooka, aimed, and pressed the firing</seg><seg type="columnLine">stud. The shadow vanished in silent white</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The return blast almost knocked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. For a moment Randick was stunned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering foggily where the shot had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from. Then his brain cleared and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that the Russki too had climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the pass, leaving Randick to fire at shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Randick cursed himself for his danger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous stupidity. The other must be among</seg><seg type="columnLine">those shadowy rocks directly across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright floor of the pass. He raised his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bazooka carefully, searching the Stygian</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness for some sign of movement. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger curled around the firing stud . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UT OF THE CORNER of his eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw the flare. The Russian rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">TASK TO LVtfA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">erupted in a gout of bluish flame and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole mountain seemed to rock. Randick</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared stupidly at the glowing crater where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship had been. For just an instant he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that perhaps a meteorite had</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck it, but the explosion had been un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">questionably . . . atomic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Russian must have been stunned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. For he moved out into the light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty-handed, his helmet turned wood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enly toward the rapidly cooling lake of</seg><seg type="columnLine">magma where his space ship had been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They both saw the bright arc of fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">that raced up from beyond the ridge and</seg><seg type="columnLine">.curved down gracefully toward the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crater far below. Openmouthed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randick watched his ship vanish into flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he felt the vague tremor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground under him as the shock rumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the face of the Moon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Russian rocket was gone. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anglo-American rocket was gone.

And, Venus being the land of</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty that it had turned out to be, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to look as if the stay here would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a pleasant one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was just starting to get some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his old spunk back when Jeff Flaunders</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up to him with a worried frown on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Because of the limited space aboard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, Flaunders was a combination of sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral men, as were most of the others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Specially trained for the expedition, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">handled anything that went under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heading of botany, biology or zoology.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he was looking worried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You look a lot like bad news," Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bride said as Flaunders drew near.'</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Might have known there'd be a catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "More than a catch," Flaunders said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I hope none of the men has eaten any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing native to Venus."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McBride shook his head. "They haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they've followed orders. I told them</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to touch anything until you had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a report." He looked at the other ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioningly. "Poison?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We brought twelve white rats and</seg><seg type="columnLine">two monkeys along for experimental pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poses," Flaunders said. "Now we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">only six rats. Each of the others we fed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a different kind of native fruit or meat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was about five hours ago. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past hour they've gone into convulsions</seg><seg type="columnLine">one after another. Seemed to go blind, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Died within minutes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You tried it on just the six rats and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the monkeys?" McBride asked, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a nod from Flaunders. "Then that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">just six things tested. Maybe something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">r</seg><seg type="columnLine">POISON PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">63</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">edible will turn up yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Small chance." Flaunders was positive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thompson used a little of his chemistry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found a substance he couldn't identify,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only in the stuff we fed the rats but</seg><seg type="columnLine">in twenty-some other plants. He even</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it in the flesh of the animals we</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught. That makes it pretty certain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it will be found in everything. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rats died we pegged that substance as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What to do about it is another ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Since it's entirely new to us it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably take years to find a way to neu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tralize it, and it plays such an integral</seg><seg type="columnLine">part in the structure of everything- on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus that we'd have one sweet time try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to completely draw it out. Anyway, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot of needed lab equipment was smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wreck. That makes it even more of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a problem."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McBride listened, frowned and rubbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cheek. "In other words, we might as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well give up any idea of living off the fat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the land."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's about the size of it," Flaunders</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed. "Our best bet, the way things</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand now, would be to try and have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden going before our supply of food</seg><seg type="columnLine">runs out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Check," said McBride. "But the seed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was brought along just in case the soil</seg><seg type="columnLine">and climate should prove suitable for</seg><seg type="columnLine">planting. What do you make of that?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Climate ought to be just about perfect,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flaunders grunted. "As to the soil,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thompson and I will check on that right</seg><seg type="columnLine">away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN ANOTHER DAY a few things had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been learned. There was now no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the poisonous nature of Venus. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">infuriating thing about it was that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures native to Venus thrived about</seg><seg type="columnLine">them on food that would put out the lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">for good for any Earth-born animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But that was not quite so hard to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they found that the soil was suitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Earth crops. That left nothing to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">So they thought, until Venus turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubborn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">No one knew exactly how stubborn</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus could get until the garden location</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was being cleared of weeds. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone over about fifty feet of the clearing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">working earnestly and not bothering to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look back, when one of the men--a lanky</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual called Henry Higgins--turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look back, put one grimy fist on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hip, hunched his shoulders, stuck out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chin and hollered, "Damn!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The others turned and looked surprised.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not that Higgins' well-known exaggera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive ways any longer surprised them, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">what Higgins was looking at might sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise anyone, including the botanist in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flaunders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The eight-or-ten feet of ground directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the men was clear of weeds. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the far edge of this cleared space little</seg><seg type="columnLine">green shoots were thrusting inquisitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">noses above the ground. Beyond these were</seg><seg type="columnLine">one-inch plants, then two-inch, and four</seg><seg type="columnLine">and six and eight, on up. They formed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope up to the edge of the clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Damn!" Higgins said again, and tossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">away his spade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Someone laughed uncertainly. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">others scratched their heads, cast blank</seg><seg type="columnLine">stares at one another and forgot how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep their mouths closed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just what in blazes do you make of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that?" McBride asked of Flaunders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flaunders could be quite an optimist</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he wanted to; he was one of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">rare persons who seem to grow stronger</seg><seg type="columnLine">with each failure. At least on the surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only what I see," he replied, not will-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to show consternation. "Amazingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid growth, but they're still only weeds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's just going to take a little applied</seg><seg type="columnLine">science."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe." McBride didn't like it. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've done a little farming in my time;</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what it is to worry a chunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">of farmland out of the raw. And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature of Earth is dead compared to this."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bunk!" Flaunders scoffed. "Work, cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly. But we'll be eating fresh corn in</seg><seg type="columnLine">two months!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McBride looked around, seeing little you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't see on Earth. What's wrong with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me? he thought. It's my place to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spirits of the men up, not to dampen</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Flaunders is right, of course. This stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">is still only vegetation, even if it is styled</seg><seg type="columnLine">after Jack's beanstalk. Jack chopped down</seg><seg type="columnLine">64</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the beanstalk and killed the giant. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant is the threat of starvation, but kill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it is still a matter of stalk-chopping.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If Jack could do it so can we.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT STARTED OUT like that. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks of hacking and digging, of spe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cially prepared weed-killer and the aid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">every trick known to science, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a strip of dark, rich ground all ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">for planting. It looked like things were</seg><seg type="columnLine">really beginning to roll. They did roll.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Right up against a blank wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few days after the planting, Flaunders</seg><seg type="columnLine">was looking at a handful of black spider-</seg><seg type="columnLine">things and swearing under his breath. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">shriveled spider-things were seeds brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Earth. They were shot through with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hairlike roots, and that was the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. It was strange because the roots</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not their own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took several more days for Flaunders</seg><seg type="columnLine">to understand. When he did he took on</seg><seg type="columnLine">an attitude faintly remindful of a cornered</seg><seg type="columnLine">rat. In a spot, but frustrated to fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger. The ship had contained enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">food for only about two months to begin</seg><seg type="columnLine">with, and more than two weeks had now</seg><seg type="columnLine">come out of that. Starvation was becom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a very real possibility in his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're up against something big," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, peeved with himself for having to</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit it. "We're fighting millions of years</seg><seg type="columnLine">of evolution."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McBride sensed something disturbing ini</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other's voice. Maybe a trace of fear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What do you mean?" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flaunders enlarged. "A very long time</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago a war started here on Venus. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a war among plants. You find the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing on Earth, too, but not on this scale.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There must have been certain 'aggressive'</seg><seg type="columnLine">plants which threatened to force out all</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. The others, in order to survive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to evolve into something even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly to other plants. Once started, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to keep going. Now, after millions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of years, they've evolved into things cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. of vicious little tricks you'd never</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to count.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What happened to our seeds is one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them. Some of the roots extend into</seg><seg type="columnLine">microscopic threads hardly more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaks of single molecules. You can't dig</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">them out and they escape all the ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">weed-fighting methods. One of their cute</seg><seg type="columnLine">little tricks is to attach themselves to other</seg><seg type="columnLine">plants and seeds and absorb them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely enough not harming their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">species. Add to that the rapid growth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost comparable to the motion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute hand of a clock, and planting any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing from Earth among them is some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing like throwing a housecat into a den</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wild lions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A very pretty picture," McBride</seg><seg type="columnLine">groaned. "We can't go back to Earth for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a year, everything on Venus is poison and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have less than two months' supply of</seg><seg type="columnLine">food. Now you as much as admit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there will be no garden. I'm suddenly get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting a headache."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't say we had failed," Flaunders</seg><seg type="columnLine">said sharply. "I'm never going to. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder, we'll beat this hellhole if it takes</seg><seg type="columnLine">every minute of our time!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was a sane enough statement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had the seeds and they had the soil.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With good health and the will to work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was to stop them?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only weeds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">&lt;tONLY WEEDS&gt;" McBride said ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks later. "They couldn't be re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponsible for this! Ten weeks of breaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">our backs and losing our minds, and you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't even tell that we've done anything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It must be a nightmare!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flaunders was a man all washed out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man badly stung. How hard for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">optimist to face defeat!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ten years," he said reflectively. "That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it seems like. Thirteen since we</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed. Lucky number."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A week since we've had anything to</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat," said McBride. "Or has it been two?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anyway, it's too late to think about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden. And if you and Thompson .can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">find a way to make this stuff fit to eat--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no need to complete that sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flaunders said nothing, seemingly ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorbed in thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why don't you stop trying?" McBride</seg><seg type="columnLine">said suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flaunders looked up as if he thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hadn't heard right.

McBride's sunken</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks burned red. He was somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashamed of his thoughts, but still de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined to voice them. "Without that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope we wouldn't go on waiting and starv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. There wouldn't be anything to wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">for. Maybe there isn't anyway. Do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually think there is any hope?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flaunders stared for a moment, consid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering the suicide tendency behind Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bride's words. He turned away, hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbed by the morbid idea. "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">really know," he replied at last. "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">even think any more. I just keep going like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an automaton, not hoping and not giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. That's my responsibility. Mine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thompson's. Maybe we will find a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">and maybe not.

He did it quickly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before anyone had a chance to stop him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He jerked the muzzle of the automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to his own temple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So long, suckers!" he shouted, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled the trigger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOUD REPORT made the si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence that followed seem even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent. The men who had come to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet stood like statues of a mad sculptor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching the black hole turn red and gush.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then it came, dawning in their eyes. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry, frightened, hopeful fascination,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impact of conflicting thoughts. It grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger and burned in the sunken eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these dead men who wanted to live.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no mistaking the intent, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistaking the desire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McBride saw it and understood. "Good</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lord, no!" he said.

Maybe Flaunders would</seg><seg type="columnLine">find something in another week, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal might make the difference between</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing that and not seeing it. One wanted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to live! You couldn't bring Heinie back</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway, so why not live? Heinie had</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted it that way. A human is an animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much as a pig or a cow. A chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to live, to hope again!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some part of his mind screamed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "Cannibal!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The only chance!" cried another part.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Vulture!" said the soul-part with un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerving keening.

McBride shouted, wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing why his voice sounded so angry, why</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face felt distorted.

He sat with unnaturally red cheeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffed out beneath his beard, eyes glassy</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet, looking at McBride as if harboring</seg><seg type="columnLine">some question too awful to ask. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something of the frightened, wild animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him as his eyes left McBride and</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked around from one face to another.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he was up and awkwardly running</seg><seg type="columnLine">in among the trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men got up from the rough table</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   4^</seg><seg type="columnLine">POISON PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been set up outside the ship.

This was not a life-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raft on the open sea, every man told him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. This was a green, smiling world with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smell of flowers on the air, with plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of glistening, tempting fruit growing wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">and enough game to make an Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunter call it the Happy Hunting Ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like a camping trip back on Earth. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a picnic where you get drunk and start</seg><seg type="columnLine">eating and then sober up with the smell</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blood in your nostrils to find yourself</seg><seg type="columnLine">chewing the hair off the detached leg or</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm of your best friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What did every man tell himself? That</seg><seg type="columnLine">it wouldn't happen again, ever, this terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. When they found the strength and</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage to go back and clean up the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mains of a meal, knowing it to be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remains of a meal, when they had put</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was left of Heinie in a hole and</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered it with dirt and set up a stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">marker, they promised one another it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never ever happen again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day they put it on paper, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">black and white. An agreement. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third day they thought about it, and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fourth day they began wondering why</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had done it. And on the fifth day--</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the fifth day they found Thompson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chemist, hanging from a tree a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance from the ship. Quite dead, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, and no one had to ask why he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had done it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Hunger madness walked among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. They took Thompson dowti from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tree. Hunger madness whispered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ears. They listened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">McBride took out the agreement and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at it, having heard the tempter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper. He didn't think much. It hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to think. But something that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been done once--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at the men and saw an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">escapable vise tightening. He looked at him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self and saw the same. At his feet fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">the small fragments of the agreement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">•</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CREEPING HELL closed in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The real Hell that had started with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gun. Could these any longer think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves as men? After the second time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the change starts. It gets a little easier.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All you have to do is keep from looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at anyone. It's nice to live. With life</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's hope. Don't get cheated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What happened one day surprised no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. Eight of the ten remained, two gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thompson had been gone for days. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunger returned. The pendulum swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. The beast man shoved out any re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maining noble thought and screamed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">food. The addict returns to his drug, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pervert to his revolting deed . . . As mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">as these, the starving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor was McBride surprised when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself holding a little stick. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't greatly disturbed when it turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to be the short one. Sympathy from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others? Not a bit. Only a sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brooding resignation. And hunger. Always</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Flaunders," McBride said. "Where's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flaunders ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't worry," the one who had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the straws said. "He took his chance with</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. Been working like a madman since</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thompson went. He wouldn't stop, so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the straws in to him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't care about that," McBride in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed. "But I've known him since we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were kids. Just felt that I'd like to--well</seg><seg type="columnLine">--maybe it's better this way." He started</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where you going?" someone said sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piciously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McBride looked at the man with a feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing part disgust, part pity and a little of</seg><seg type="columnLine">something unexplainable. He almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not depriving you of your next</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal," he said. "I just feel like being alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked slowly on, taking his thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him. What was the purpose in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this? All a monotonous cycle, constantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated. From the torture of starvation</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the torture of the shame and bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-accusation that makes one despise</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, back to the starvation. Men slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming something lower than pigs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing it all too well. A satisfying of</seg><seg type="columnLine">68</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the body at the expense of decency, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sanity. A Hell within souls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And all for what purpose? To live?</seg><seg type="columnLine">For how long, and in what hideous way?</seg><seg type="columnLine">There would be only one lonely and sick</seg><seg type="columnLine">man left long before help could come.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What would that last man do? Go com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely mad and try to devour himself?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like the two snakes who met one sunny</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon and decided to swallow one an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. Each took hold of the tail of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other and both swallowed and swallowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">until nothing at all remained. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no purpose. No purpose or reason at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A SHORT DISTANCE back among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees McBride halted and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. There were bushes between the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and himself. This was it. He drew his</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strange, he thought. I don't feel at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">like I should about this. It's just like</seg><seg type="columnLine">routine procedure, something you do every</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. I actually think I'm glad I came out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the short straw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He even thought coolly about the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to do it. The heart? Not sure enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The brain, like Heinie? A little better, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">what if there should be a nervous twitch</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the wrong time and a deflection caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the bone of the skull?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A babble of voices came to him as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a great distance, through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts. Excited voices. But he was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a world of his own, now. All the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">were behind him, cut off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Safety off, he put the muzzle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic into his mouth and aimed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply upward. The most efficient way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably. His finger tightened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard the deafening report and felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the recoil jerk his arm down. Somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had heard that a man killed instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a gun never lives to hear the report.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It puzzled him. Why didn't he fall? Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">could he still see the green tangle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus and hear sounds?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a ringing in his ears and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sickening shimmer before his eyes. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">shocked mind refused to come back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">things for a moment. Who were these</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing, crying, shouting skeletons whirl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about him with their dirty beards and</seg><seg type="columnLine">red-rimmed eyes?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's Flaunders," someone shouted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He's done it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Done it," McBride repeated dumbly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Done what?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Flaunders was shaking him by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders and grinning. "Come out of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">man! You're safe; we all are, now I</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's no need for any more of this--</seg><seg type="columnLine">gluttony! Don't you understand? I've won!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know how to treat the fruit, even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edible animals of this world, so we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat them and they won't hurt us a bit!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">McBride tried to call order to mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">starting from the beginning. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazedly at the gun in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flaunders laughed. "Don't look so sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised to be alive. One of the men hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">your arm just in time. You missed death</seg><seg type="columnLine">by an inch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was all too much at one time, a skirl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing confusion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That what you said about beating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poison," McBride said. "Are you sure?</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's not just something on paper, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing not proven?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lord, no," Flaunders said, fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">down an urge to shout. "I had it worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out yesterday, but it still had to be tested</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the white rats and two monkeys we</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought along for experimental purposes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gone. So I went out last night and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered some fruit and treated it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried it on myself. Just look at me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have your answer. I feel fine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still dazed, still not quite understanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">how everything had happened, McBride</seg><seg type="columnLine">started back toward the ship with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. But one thing he knew. Venus had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been beaten!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MEAL was all day in the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paring. The eating was a gala event,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a banquet, a roaring party. It lasted two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There wasn't any wolfing down. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have been starving for weeks you</seg><seg type="columnLine">just don't start off that way. You take</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small bite and wait until you are sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is safely down. Then you take another</seg><seg type="columnLine">small bite and wait again. If you keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing that you have a chance of holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you eat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They didn't mind. This food was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kind you had to force yourself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">POISON</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">chew on, like--some other things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were little animals looking some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing like rabbits, but tasting more like</seg><seg type="columnLine">chicken, fried golden brown. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">oranges that tasted like nothing of Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and apples that reminded you of paw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paws in fall. Seven different kinds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">meat there were, and it seemed like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred different kinds of fruits and nuts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and herbs. There was even a juice that</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved mildly intoxicating. All a little dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent, but all delightfully, temptingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">good!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll be eating like this every day!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flaunders said. "Maybe we can even set</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a bar, with fruit-juice drinks and wine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even invent a new kind of beer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big, foamy schooners of beer on Venus!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Won't the work crew be surprised when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they get here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They let it run away with them. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to their heads. The warmth of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toxication, the feel of stomachs filling out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All the things long missing now returning</seg><seg type="columnLine">in full force, all at one time. Almost it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too much. Almost death from ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessive joy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They went on and on like that, the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy men ever. They wanted it to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on for ever, but the feast had started</seg><seg type="columnLine">late and it ended late. After the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours they felt like sleeping. In fact, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a more relentless urge to sleep than</seg><seg type="columnLine">they ever had before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The result of a full stomach, they sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed, or the aftermath of months of hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship let in by the sudden relaxation. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly wasn't a matter of choice. Who</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to sleep at a time like this, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for staying up all night and cele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brating? But the sandman said no, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">right now he had the advantage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One by one they yawned, stretched and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted off to bed like carefree children,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to hell with cleaning up. That could</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait until tomorrow. Tomorrow! It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful to have one to think about.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tomorrow was a golden day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last to turn in was Captain Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bride, just as sleepy but not so carefree.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He alone, perhaps, was not completely sat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isfied. Underneath the powerful urge to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep was a question, and that question</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed answering. Or did it?

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, in theory at any rate, in supreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">command in space, and not every man</seg><seg type="columnLine">could take a job like that and look plea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sant. Bremner was one who could. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could talk and he could listen. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">give advice if asked without sending in</seg><seg type="columnLine">little notes at the end of the journey:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Second Officer Smith revealed astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ignorance of points 10 and 29 of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spaceman's Code," or "Spaceman J.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown appears to have had time since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the completion of his training to develop</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain laxity in his application of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">section on discipline." He would help out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an emergency without reporting coldly</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the inefficiency or insufficiency of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship's complement.

Discipline on the Ionic II</seg><seg type="columnLine">was easy, normally. The ship was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seven run by the small Sapphire Line,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which it was a tradition that directors</seg><seg type="columnLine">made some allowance for management,</seg><seg type="columnLine">management was not harsh with captains,</seg><seg type="columnLine">captains kept crew on a loose rein, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew didn't bother themselves too much.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Essentia? standards were maintained, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was regarded as essential was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit and not the letter of various codes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of laws. Men who had been warned that</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the duration of the run to Venus and</seg><seg type="columnLine">back they might have to obey the letter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and not the spirit for a change relaxed</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratefully from the time that the keenest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighted among them recognised the thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure of Bremner across the field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hallo, Jeff," said Captain Hofmeyer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretching out his hand.

But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers were all right. They always were</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Sapphire Line. It was on smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines--and one or two bigger ones--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">real vigilance was needed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Going to ground us?" asked Hof-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meyer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you think?

He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a young captain, Hofmeyer. Perhaps too</seg><seg type="columnLine">young. He hadn't had years as a subor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinate to give him stability. There had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never been a blemish on his record, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in a way unfortunate for him, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had never had a chance to learn by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own mistakes. He was like a car driver</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had never been in a skid or an acci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent, who had never seen death for him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self or others if he could not pull up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten yards, who had never known brakes</seg><seg type="columnLine">or steering or engine to fail. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergency came at last, he might be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to handle it. Nobody knew. Bremner hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would. Bremner had seen Hofmeyer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife once or twice--a grand girl, the kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of girl Hofmeyer with his invariable good</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck or good judgment would have mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McCall, the second officer, was of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">different stamp. He was twenty years older</seg><seg type="columnLine">than Hofmeyer, very little younger than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bremner himself.

He had mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried at the same age as Hofmeyer, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wife had left him two years later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strangely enough, Bremner knew of no</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer friendship than between the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. Other officers came and went, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">no ship ever reached space with a berth</seg><seg type="columnLine">for one and not for the othec. For ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, in various capacities, but always</seg><seg type="columnLine">some two steps apart, they had traveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">space together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The .first officer came in with the as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trogation correlates. Merson was a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly without capacity for anger or ambi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. He had reached his position because</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had done well enough to be put there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If promotion were not in some measure</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic, Merson would still be a space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Mr. Bremner?" said Merson, holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the calculations interrogatively. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't known Bremner long enough for</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiarity. Bremner nodded the papers</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They've been checked, I suppose?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Heredity should be all right," Mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son replied. "They come from a long line</seg><seg type="columnLine">of astrogators."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bremner grinned. "Is that new, or have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you cracked it before?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He nearly broke it on the run in,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmured Hofmeyer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Hofmeyer took the ship up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gently on the rockets. Then when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a thousand feet off the ground he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stabbed the vibrodrive and held it until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bell rang. Bremner frowned. Ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds' coasting, then the drive went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. This time Hofmeyer just missed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bell, but there could only have been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                     3</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a split second in it. As if to show that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could get closer than that, the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">time Hofmeyer got an instant more of</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive, and still beat the bell. Then Hof-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meyer switched to automatic, and the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">built up velocity in five-second bursts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Mr. Merson," said Bremner. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. McCall. I'd like to speak to the capT</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain for a moment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They hesitated. No single man could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">left in control--not even an Engineer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two officers had to stay at control, or,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rarely, one officer and the Engineer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But they knew, and Hofmeyer knew, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bremner wanted. Hofmeyer had been ask-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for it. And even Bremner had to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to him. McCall and Merson went out</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know," said Hofmeyer cheerfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But it's safe. You get a mind like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chronometer after a bit--up to ten seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway. I've never had less than two</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds to spare."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sometimes," said Bremner carefully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"a man can lose two seconds. He can</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember something important he's for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten. Someone can speak to him. He can</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose his balance or get sudden cramp. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred things can happen to prevent him</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching a button until it's too late."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But if he can lose two seconds he can</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose three."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's not just one and half times as</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlikely. It's far more than that. Hof-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meyer, don't think I'm just making petti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fogging objections. You know what hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pens if the drive's on too long. Chain</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaction. Easy to start and absolutely im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to stop. For a hundred years we've</seg><seg type="columnLine">been trying to find some safe way of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroying the affected part, so that even</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the drive was on too long it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to annihilate the whole mechanism</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the reaction with it. It can't be done.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We only spread the reaction more quickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Your trouble, Hofmeyer, is that you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">no harm can result so long as the drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">is cut within 9.54 seconds. You know it</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't matter, as far as the safety of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship is concerned, whether it's two seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">or 9.53. So, like an experienced operator</seg><seg type="columnLine">in any other sphere, you want to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">right to the limit. But remember all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlikely things that can't be expected on</seg><seg type="columnLine">76</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one trip, but might happen once in two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred. The button sticks. If you've left</seg><seg type="columnLine">three seconds, you've time to cut out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive with the lever. Anything less, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's the end of you and the ship."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hofmeyer had sobered. "All right, Jeff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know. But in my own defense, that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time since I left training school</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I kept on drive until the bell rang.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What I don't understand is, why do they</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave it to human error? Why not make</seg><seg type="columnLine">it impossible for the drive to be kept on</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than nine seconds? It would be easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's several reasons, and the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">one is that every pilot would then rely</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much on the safety device. He couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">help it. He'd know it no longer depended</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him. Another reason is that in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end it's safer to trust human beings in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter like this than machines. Clocks stop,</seg><seg type="columnLine">relays wear, wires break or lose their in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulation. Maybe you don't know it, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty years before you were bom the kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of device you mention was tried out. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">report was unfavorable. The machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't give the safety margin that a human</seg><seg type="columnLine">being knowing what could happen does."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Another thing--just for curiosity. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't knock my head off if I should know</seg><seg type="columnLine">the answer. Why use a button that has</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be pushed twice? Wouldn't it be better</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it had to be held down? Then if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain suddenly dropped dead his finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come off the button."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's more difference of opinion</seg><seg type="columnLine">about that. The reason it's as is, is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's supposed to be -quicker pressing down</seg><seg type="columnLine">than withdrawing pressure, phsyiologi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, isn't it?" '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, but there's also the fact that when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you press a button it has to go right in</seg><seg type="columnLine">and make contact before it has any effect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If you're taking your finger off, contact</seg><seg type="columnLine">is broken from the instant the button is</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed to move. But that's not the sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thing that's likely to matter much. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">main thing is simply that pilots must take</seg><seg type="columnLine">care."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, Jeff. I suppose I needed that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Are you going to report me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not if I have your promise--a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal promise to me, nothing to do with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Spaceman's Code--that you'll take six</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds as your mark."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's done. I suppose, though you won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me about it, that even the 9.54 figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">allows a certain margin of safety which</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. boys are keeping to yourselves?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's a reasonable assumption," Brem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner admitted. "But get this, Hofmeyer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't go thinking it's safe to wait for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell, and then a bit. The margin's been</seg><seg type="columnLine">made as small as it reasonably can be--</seg><seg type="columnLine">for remember, no one wants to waste the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive. You can call the others back now."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Merson and McCall showed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality by making no indication that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew their captain had been on. the carpet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were a good trio, Bremner thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WENT ON being a nice trip, right</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the moment when McCall had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">first suspicion of the astrogation correlates.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Merson and he were in the control-room</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Engineer at the time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get them to run the whole thing again,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Merson suggested. "They'll swear at you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">particularly when the same figures come</seg><seg type="columnLine">out again, but astrogators have things</seg><seg type="columnLine">too easy anyway."'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McCall looked at Bremner for permis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion to leave only the two of them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">control. The Engineer nodded. He wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">worried about the calculations. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in space a long time, and he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see nothing wrong with the course. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were cutting close to the sun to inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept the orbit of Venus, but they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">at full velocity and looked as if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be a lot closer without having to</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">McCall was gone a long time. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought Hofmeyer back with him. Merson</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Engineer looked up, disturbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know whether we can get</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear," said McCall grimly, "but we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to have to try."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He explained what had happened, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">detail. A junior astrogator had run the</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculation. It had looked all right to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second astrogation officer, and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed it to his chief. The chief knew it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was passed by two good men and that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was supposed to be checked by one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the senior officers.

Then he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to automatic. He had done all he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could before they had worked out a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They all worked on it independently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three officers and the Engineer. Part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the blame was his. No authority said</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had to check astrogation correlates--</seg><seg type="columnLine">only that he should see that it was done.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On perhaps fifty out of a hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty or so trips, long and short, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked the whole thing out, painstakingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without calculators. He had never found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tenth-place decimal mistake. Once he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought he had, and an astrogator, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cealing his glee, had demonstrated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">error in his mathematics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hofmeyer consulted charts and passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them on to the others. He got his result</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, and waited patiently while the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed their calculations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They coincided exactly. The ship was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too close to the sun already. To turn it</seg><seg type="columnLine">further than Hofmeyer had done would</seg><seg type="columnLine">give the sun a greater pull. What they</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted was more power to put into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">existing curve. And they didn't have it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The vibrodrive could be operated to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">them over nine seconds at a time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a glance at the Engineer, Hofmeyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeded to do just that, waiting delib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erately each time after the bell rang for</seg><seg type="columnLine">what seemed an interminable time. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was still not enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bremner looked at the three of them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Leave me," he said. "I'll take over."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can't," Hofmeyer remarked quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An Engineer had power of life and</seg><seg type="columnLine">death, but no individual, not even an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Engineer, could be left in sole control.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bremner thought of argument, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take too long.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well," he said. "Leave me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">McCall."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was nothing to show the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind that, the fact that the instant be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he spoke he had not known whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been about to say Hofmeyer, Mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son or McCall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MERSON and Hofmeyer didn't argue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Engineer must have some plan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the longer they waited the less likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be to be effective. Silently, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take over," said Bremner. "Switch</seg><seg type="columnLine">on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The drive was silent. There were scores</seg><seg type="columnLine">of warning devices to show that it was on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but only the lights and buzzers and dials</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed it. McCall watched them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited well over nine seconds. Space of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficers got so that they didn't need clocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">for anything up to ten seconds. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">could feel when the drive had to go off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with increasing urgency as 9.54 approached.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hofmeyer was good, but in emergency</seg><seg type="columnLine">McCall was little behind him. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved his finger at least 9.3 seconds had</seg><seg type="columnLine">elapsed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" exclaimed Bremner. "Leave it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Habit was too strong. McCall cut the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive as usual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put it on and leave it," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Engineer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McCall looked at him to make sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had not suddenly gone mad, and did</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he was told.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's a very big safety margin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then," he murmured. The drive went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">for ten seconds, twenty seconds, a min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The whole thing is safety margin,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Bremner. "It's strange how easy it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is to get a white lie accepted as plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth. There's one in psychology too--</seg><seg type="columnLine">know it? Everyone knows no one can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypnotized into doing something his con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious mind abhors--psychologists teach</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. And it's simply not true. My theory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I haven't looked into history to</seg><seg type="columnLine">check it, is that some early psychologist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Janet or Charcot, maybe, saw that hyp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nosis was liable to be outlawed. So he</seg><seg type="columnLine">invented that--safety margin, if you like.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everybody believed it, because it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nice thing to believe. And whenever it</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred to anyone that there ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be strict control of hypnosis, someone was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure to say, 'But no one can be hypnotized</seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">78	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">into . . And everyone relaxed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean the vibrodrive can be used</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . indefinitely?" McCall asked. "There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">no chain reaction?" His face showed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort it took to believe it. If you believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">for forty years that petrol is inflammable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is a shock when you learn at last that</seg><seg type="columnLine">petrol won't burn under any circumstances.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But the ships that have been lost . . .?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Some of them never existed. We cre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated them on paper, as necessary remin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders. The rest disappeared for other rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons, some of which we don't know; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was convenient to put them all down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the same cause. We were grateful for</seg><seg type="columnLine">these losses, in a way. Sooner or later</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone would realize that no one had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever known a spaceman who was lost,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we relied solely on the paper losses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But when every loss was put down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">carelessness with the vibrodrive, every</seg><seg type="columnLine">spaceman knew someone who had died</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a blowup."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BREMNER was studying the dials on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the board. "You'd only have to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment to see that." The extra</seg><seg type="columnLine">power had done the job. Bremner sighed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The vibrodrive is the most terrible wea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pon ever invented--if it can be used con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuously and if there's no limit to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power that can be put into it. Think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. A fort could be made the armature</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a drive that's no drive. It goes on and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, hour after hour. And no one knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything about it until the fort itself be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gins to spin. Or a directional drive can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be set to an area on a planet maybe a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand miles square. The force isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong enough to move a thing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">area--but after a while storms disrupt it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gales bring everything to a standstill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or if you really want to start something,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you turn your drive on the sun. Or tune</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to a thought waveband. You can stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">all radio communication, kill thousands at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a time, and there's no defense."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bremner fixed the second engineer with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a significant gaze. "And remember," he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">said softly, "that these are only the things</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone can think of offhand, without really</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying. What uses, could be discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the vibrodrive as a weapon in war are</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond all our imaginings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So, long ago, scientists and govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments got together.

They had to blow up a few ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, sacrifices to the good of the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">number.

A long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time in which to think.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of, for example, who had he been for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last hundred years? He had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone, someone with a name, a job, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ritual, a wife, kids, everything. A valu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able worker, a nice round peg in one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless millions of nice round holes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who and what you had been for the past</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred years was certainly a question</seg><seg type="columnLine">that could bother you, he thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced at Keith and Van Ness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It wasn't bothering them now. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been two other people for a century also</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but they weren't bothered now. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed out cold on pre-New World</seg><seg type="columnLine">bourbon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had better snap out of it, Danton</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought a little desperately. The ship had</seg><seg type="columnLine">about reached Mars. They had better get</seg><seg type="columnLine">up from there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His hands started shaking again. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a cigarette lighted and the opiate stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawling in his throat. He closed his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">For an instant it felt better, hiding in</seg><seg type="columnLine">there behind the darkness of his closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">lids. But then the thoughts came faster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like schools of irritated fish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A final war like the last one, destructive</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond memory anyway, was one most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the survivors had been more than happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to forget. They had welcomed recondi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioning, the moving into the PLAN, into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the New World system of non-violence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">People became, largely, depending on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of reconditioning necessary, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one else. You can't change solidly laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">foundations of thought and still be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same person.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So it was a New World. In it the peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple were New. Everything starting over</seg><seg type="columnLine">again from scratch. A small decentralized</seg><seg type="columnLine">population. Beneficent leaders, masters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">psychology. No weapons, not even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">museums, no conception of war, no fears</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tomorrow. There were no enemies on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth. In fact, the mind was conditioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that the concept of an enemy was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible. Outer space was merely a region</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lovely stars on clear nights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of the few New System soldiers left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">most were willing to be reconditioned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Three of them hadn't been willing. Ri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chard Danton, Don Keith, Dwight Van</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ness. They had degenerated into drunken</seg><seg type="columnLine">pariahs, people without a group with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which to identify themselves, lonely, lost,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aging and ailing. Finally they did accept</seg><seg type="columnLine">reconditioning. Not because they wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to. But because they had to or go com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely insane. Seers, Secretary of Social</seg><seg type="columnLine">Security, said this was bad, but that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be able to bring about an adjust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. It would be difficult, he said, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of involuntary conditioning, but he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">see what he could do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Evidently he had done all right. Danton</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't remember the subsequent hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">years. But he had been someone. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had blotted him out, fixed him up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">another name, twisted ganglia, altered syn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">apsis, probed lobotomy here and there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everything went, name, identity, the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">business inside and out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But all the time, Richard Danton had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been there, a pattern. A circuit discon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected. When they had needed him, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had merely twisted ganglia back, altered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  r&gt;</seg><seg type="columnLine">MARTIAN NIGHTMARE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">83</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">synapsis, probed lobotomy again. And af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter a hundred years here he was again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">resurrected, like a .ghost. And when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were done with him, after his assignment</seg><seg type="columnLine">was finished, he would go back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave, and that someone else would go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on living.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But maybe not this time. Maybe not</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. This could be a dangerous assign-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment for him and Keith and Van Ness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They might never get back to earth, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that might be all right--for them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He would rather die fighting, as a sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dier, than keep on living as someone else,</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone he didn't even know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> According to Seers there was a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the final war had not been quite so</seg><seg type="columnLine">final. The Oligarch Council had evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped earth in secretly constructed space-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships, destined for Mars. If they had ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tually gotten to Mars, and had survived,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were there still, and it would be only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a matter of time until they returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth and destroyed, it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Other factors made it even more com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicated. Earth couldn't defend itself, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing. It had no weapons. It had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">human being capable of manning a wea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pon if it had one. Seers had said that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanity of the world depended on absolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">secrecy. The population was never to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know anything at all, never to suspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they might be threatened. Such know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ledge, Seers said, would destroy the New</seg><seg type="columnLine">System. The people weren't psychologi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally capable of receiving knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">insecurity, not for a long time yet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what bothered Danton was--who</seg><seg type="columnLine">have I been for the last hundred years?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KEITH was crawling across the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasping at an oxygen inhalor. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, thin-faced and cynical soldier got</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and sat down. He grinned. "Are we</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Valhalla yet, Captain?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You still take this whole thing as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joke, Keith?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The psyche boys are good," Keith</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Plenty 'good. And I still say this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is just delusion they're feeding us, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion tape, after good shots of hyp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nosene."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why would they do that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They tried to recondition us, make</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">good little workers out of us. But it didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">take. We don't remember, sure--but that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sign we were successfully changed. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">say we weren't. I got it all figured out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain. They're killing us. Mercifully, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, making us die happy. But we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying just the same, dying in a dream.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A dream of soldiering, of heroics, of sac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifice and high honor. Just the way we'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">want it. And instead of waking up, we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">really die, in the line of duty. Like a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldier should."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"But--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not blaming them. I think it's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine idea. For one thing, we aren't sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's not really happening, so we'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accept it as truth. It's the real thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">any way you look at it." Danton saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grin fade slowly across the mask of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keith's face. "Are we really here, Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danton peered into the scope again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Yes," he whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mars, the god of war," Keith said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"awaits his favorite sons."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A big dull reddish ball, like an eye-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball, a blood-shot eye. The cone of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant shadow streaming out, a quadrant</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the heavens. And then all at once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if the eye were closing, it darkened</seg><seg type="columnLine">except where the sun splattered down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">its far half, a pool of sickly light radiating</seg><seg type="columnLine">outward into dissipating orange and brown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danton thought of the Oligarchs down</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, or what remained of them. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oligarchs and the slaves they would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought with them in their ships. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred years they could have multipled</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerably. And the Oligarchs them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves, the last of the old world type of</seg><seg type="columnLine">faithless human madness -- essentially</seg><seg type="columnLine">amoral, no empathy, tremendous egotism</seg><seg type="columnLine">--filled with the old ideas of class su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periority. They destroyed with utter cas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ualness. What advanced stage had their</seg><seg type="columnLine">paranoid culture reached in a century? It</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't something one wanted to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The planet was reaching up like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched red fist. He felt the impulse to</seg><seg type="columnLine">duck. Sweat ran down his face, itched</seg><seg type="columnLine">along his ribs. A hundred years was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time to be someone else, and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danton was wondering if he dared trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">84	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">himself anymore as a soldier. His hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved again over the controls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wrecked Oligarch ship had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">found off the Mindanao Deeps by a sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea exploring party, brought up, recon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditioned, studied. There were records and</seg><seg type="columnLine">documents in it, and from these Seers</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his decision. He brought back Dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton. In secret, of course; send them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of living graves. They were trained,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made into astrogators, cosmologists. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in absolute secrecy, of course. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the ship blasted off for Mars, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three of them and Seers retained</seg><seg type="columnLine">any knowledge that there had been a ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all. The reconditioners had fixed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. Those who had found it, the scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tists who had studied it, no one remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered a thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Find out what you can, then come</seg><seg type="columnLine">back," Seers had said. "Don't fight. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you fight, you might never come back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We would never know then what to do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We can prepare ships like this one, Dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton. In secret, of course, send them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars. But we don't want to take a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that unless we have to. If activity</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that ever leaked out to the people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would be the end of the New Sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem. A sudden blast of insecurity would</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreck our delicately balanced new or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a fine ship, Danton thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Oligarchs knew machines. They wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shiped them. The ship was also a mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strous arsenal, a hurtling fountain of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction, loaded with hydrogen bombs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and something called a proton cannon</seg><seg type="columnLine">that could curl a planet up in space like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moth in a flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Power, death, throbbing around him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot and terrible . . . the ordnance console</seg><seg type="columnLine">key inches from his fingertips.

Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">not let go, blast, die right here when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attack came ?

Any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, now it was too late. Maybe every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one on earth would be wiped out because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it, but Danton blundered, moved too</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly.

Life</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a powertube, dimming to a dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow, flickering dangerously. Movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">was without real substance. Shapes, voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague and distant. He heard Van Ness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Keith talking once. Someone yelled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was the burning sigh of the elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tronic rifles they had evidently been able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to salvage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The light brightened slowly. He sat up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keith and Van Ness stood beside him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clothing torn, faces scratched and bleed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Keith's mouth was tight, his jaw mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cles rigid and pale. He turned, held his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle steady. Van Ness wanted to know if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danton felt all right now, anything else</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong besides the knock on the head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danton said he didn't know. "I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be cold here." He was sweating.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The air was muggy, quiet. The lake was</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge before him, the mountains beyond it</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic and blue-misted. The lake was</seg><seg type="columnLine">glassy and still. Behind him was thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest, reddish leaves, high trees, thickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">entangled, odd flowers, shadows. A feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of things alive--but of a cautious kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of living. Little eyes waiting and watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bushes, on the fringes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Out of this valley, on the desert, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be plenty cold," Keith said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danton asked then, "What happened?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keith watched the forest warily. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit the lake out there, had to swim in."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So now what?"

"They don't know who we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are, or where. They know nothing."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Neither do we," Keith said. "There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance Seers was wrong about the Oli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garchs. Maybe their culture has changed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe they don't intend to attack Earth."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Their ego couldn't stand to forget their</seg><seg type="columnLine">defeat," Danton said. "They had a highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced technology that could conceiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably control any environment, rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other way round. In some ways they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ahead of the rest of the world."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keith grinned. "That's right, Captain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're-so right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danton looked Keith in the eyes. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned earlier, something about some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times thinking you should be an Oligarch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You really feel that way, Keith?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not? We didn't have a choice</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose side we would fight on. We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditioned from the time we were old</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to think, and we fought the Oli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garchs for fifty years. Three-quarters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world's population rubbed out. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then we had a world that didn't want us</seg><seg type="columnLine">--unless we were three other people. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought to destroy the old values, help build</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new society. But let's face it, Captain--</seg><seg type="columnLine">those old values we destroyed were our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own! We helped destroy our own kind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. So what does it mean? It means</seg><seg type="columnLine">we should have fought for the Oligarchs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that we really sympathize with them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their system is a war system, probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">still is. With them, there would always</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a place for a fighting man. A soldier</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the Oligarchs could expect honor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and privilege."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Danton had nothing to say. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought in a similar way more than once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Van Ness said. "Wrong, Keith. We've</seg><seg type="columnLine">committed ourselves, and now we have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go on to the end of the road."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The words drifted with the wind across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glassy lake. You walked along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road, Danton thought, while the road was</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible and you walked it to the end. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither road nor the end was your own</seg><seg type="columnLine">choice. Maybe the only glory was in walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it bravely. But maybe, as Keith had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, they had been on the wrong road.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Oligarchs, had they conquered, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have always provided an honorable place</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for a soldier. Banners, flags, women, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise of battle fever, the ecstatic explosions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of power, the enemy dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keith fired once into the forest wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A shape fluttered away over the tops of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees, then fell, crying at first, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">screaming like a woman. "We've been fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed by those things for about a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the shore edge," Keith said. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't seem friendly. They're intelligent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Big, with wings, and old-style weapons.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Very old. Explosive powder stuff."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Martians," said Van Ness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DANTON said, "I caught a look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">some human beings just before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit the lake. Maybe I was seeing things</seg><seg type="columnLine">that weren't, but there seemed to be an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient amtracs, old-style cannon, marching</seg><seg type="columnLine">men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Keith nodded. "This whole business is</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy. A highly advanced technology with</seg><seg type="columnLine">spaceships in the air--and centuries-old</seg><seg type="columnLine">amtracs and gun-powder on the ground!</seg><seg type="columnLine">If this is all a dream and we're really on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth in a psyche-cell, somebody's got a</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil of an imagination!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">An explosion, then the whine of steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">missiles sent the three on their stomachs</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the small sharp shells. Danton</seg><seg type="columnLine">raked the forest with flash-gun fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally Danton said. "We have to move."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Without a plan of action ?" Keith said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No. Our plan is the same. Find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">all we can and return to Earth. Seers has</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know. He doesn't want to prepare a</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret attack unit to send up here unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's absolutely sure it's necessary."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even if we live long enough to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">out something, how do we get back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth? By teleportation?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">' "We'll have to get a ship, or try," Dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sound of explosions drifted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, the flat reverberating roar of bombs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Van Ness looked to the right and said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That way. And not so far .either."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	* *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten miles from the lake, the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled into the dense brush beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail. They could hear now the approach</seg><seg type="columnLine">of laboring gasoline motors, the shouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men. Danton waited. He waited tensely,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">r</seg><seg type="columnLine">MARTIAN NIGHTMARE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">87</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as though somewhere inside of him was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a knowledge of what he waited for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moons moved across the high val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley. The light was clear, still, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reddish cast. Purple shadows bent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed in the slight and cooler wind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through the odd light, a column of wheez-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing amtracs came. Broad wheels grinding,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coughing engines, voices murmuring, bod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ies wearily slogging, humans, weary</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghosts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Van Ness whispered, "Looks as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they're in retreat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danton nodded. Van Ness said, "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">/ounded, the dead and the dying. I guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">you could say we've come home again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danton slowly licked his lips. The fifty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">years war against the Oligarchs hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">been like this. His war had been swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clean and shiny as the metal cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">that went with the bright hot flames of</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic fission. Now the smells of sweat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing men drifted to him, the smell of blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Weary, white-faced, shabbily-uniformed</seg><seg type="columnLine">men filing by. Many hobbled, wounded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging along in a freakish dance. Crude</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretchers carrying others, somewhat re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentfully. Amtracs hauled still others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some wounded, others dying, some already</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead. The sounds of bombardment edged</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer through the moonlight. The column</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved faster. And Danton noticed then</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the women were there, uniformed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly distinguishable from the men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ground jarred. Projectiles screamed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An amtrac rose up in a blossoming cone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell apart, metal shining and bodies dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">integrating. A small detachment swung in</seg><seg type="columnLine">squarely toward Danton's position. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">three men faded back into deeper con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cealment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A tired, thickly-bearded line-officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">barked an order. "Thomas! Rennin! Take</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bodies away at once.

With a real power gun we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill every Redbird that--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The line-officer brought his revolver up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired. The back of the woman's head ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploded as the flattened bullet came out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The officer's face twitched. "Barrows!

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the officer sat down and looked blankly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the moonlight. That was a quotation</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a manual, Danton thought. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer--hadn't meant it. He hadn't wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shoot the woman.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was strange, he thought, but in that fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of the bloodiest war, the most de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structive in history--he'd never killed any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing hand to hands It had been coldly</seg><seg type="columnLine">impersonal, that war. A 'million here, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">million there. Nine million at once.

Several soldiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were poking around in the tangled debris</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bodies and blood and torn brush. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so still all at once. No sounds at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all except the hard breathing of men. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings threshing, or screams penetrating.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danton played dead. He was surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">at how easy it was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He recognized the officer's voice.

All through him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">from an intravenous injection--horror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked. A mound of metal, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though a bald giant had been buried up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his eyebrows. Metal corroded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">green slime.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't move. Some of the horror was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissolving, because this whole disposal</seg><seg type="columnLine">system was too elaborate. There was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing basic and symptomatic about it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danton felt that it was a key. Van Ness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Keith were gone. He couldn't think</seg><seg type="columnLine">about them now. Their disappearance had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed so very final. He was alone. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">still had his duty, and he was curious.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wanted to find out what he could, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the idea of somehow getting a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship and returning to Earth with what</seg><seg type="columnLine">information he could gamer was no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of his thoughts. You could take ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage of the impossible if it happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps.

The Oligarchs, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Powers, seemed interested in gathering in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blossoms of death from the fields.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Very interested. One of these soldiers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the Powers would be happy. Surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the bodies wouldn't simply go into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vat or a flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here she goes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Darkness. Silent movement whirring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly accelerating speed, hot wind sigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing dry past his face. The body of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead girl, her body tight up against him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness, moved a little. She sighed</seg><seg type="columnLine">brokenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danton felt around, found the belt, hol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster, ancient revolver he had spotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">earlier.

Doors slid open</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a soft blue radiance filtered through.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danton clung to the metal and stared down</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gleaming metal chute. He began to hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">incoherent sounds coming out of his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat, uncontrollably, as the car tilted fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther. He grabbed desperately, hung on as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car dumped its load into the chute,</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, down into a giant pit. The pit was</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded with high mesh walls and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Steel rail. And behind the rail a circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">walkway, with panels, or doors, spaced at</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular intervals. Maybe a hundred or</seg><seg type="columnLine">more doors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And cranes, cranes lifting metal mouths</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of the squirming mass in the pit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifting them to the railing and onto mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing belts that carried them through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls and out of sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">To what? God, to what? Danton</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DANTON clung frantically to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty car. Sweat made a stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">down his chest, though the pit was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">frigerated. Cold. The metal was frosted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it shone like ice. And in the pit some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bodies moved and made sounds. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl soldier. She got to her knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danton tried to crawl back, back up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slippery metal of the railcar. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought darkness back there, a place to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide. Then he stopped trying and felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fingers loosening as he watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl. Her face was unrecognizable behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mask of blood and dirt. But she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing up now. She raised one hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She looked up at the many expressionless</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The strength with which she forced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">keening death-song from her body was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the strength of her body.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">army uniform cap fell away and her hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumbled down over his hand and arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">like red dust. Her lips moved.

None of the doors seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclined to tell him; nothing moved around</seg><seg type="columnLine">him except the crane-and the conveyor</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked round the circular way once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back.

A man was bom from the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of each black rectangle.

Far removed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danton heard the conveyor belt moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly, swiftly behind him, carrying its</seg><seg type="columnLine">macabre load. The revolver felt heavy in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand. Then, from somewhere, a voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">crackled in the pit like ice shifting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bring this soldier to the Council</seg><seg type="columnLine">Room."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man's voice, without any particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">characteristic other than one of detach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.

After</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last bullet was gone, three other men</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted the fallen bodies and placed them</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the conveyor belt.

Further resistance was fu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tile; the firing of the revolver had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">only token defiance anyway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danton felt the refrigerated air of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pit clinging to him as the men marched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him down a long tubular hall walled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">dull metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ROOM was large, metal-vaulted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brittle.

The woman's eyes widened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only slightly, though a tremendous in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner emotional surge was obvious.

They de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped it by selective breeding and--no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one had figured out by what other means.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was the indication of an edge to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman's voice now. "Three of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships vanished. Do you know anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">about those ships, soldier?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danton smiled. "Yes," he said, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused for perhaps five seconds. "We de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The silence then was longer than five</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds. It was very long. It lengthened</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it was painfully heavy. The woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice was a whisper. "How could the rab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble do that? It isn't true, of course. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't be true."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll never find the ships," Danton</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "There aren't any ships now. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">blew them to pieces.

The man is obviously lying.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They couldn't possibly have evolved any</seg><seg type="columnLine">such weapon.

Their cul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tural patterns, their attitudes and heredi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary capabilities are set. They can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">change."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then how do we classify this soldier?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why bother? Some sort of crazy de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viant. We put him under the Scanners</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, then dispose of him. His body has</seg><seg type="columnLine">9ome value."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman said, "There still remains</seg><seg type="columnLine">the question of what happened to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danton thought: the Oligarch Council</seg><seg type="columnLine">operates on a strictly top-down principle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who is the extreme top? The woman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rhone? Or the man, Weisser? One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them certainly. That might be important</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danton dipped into the small supply</seg><seg type="columnLine">packet at his waist, lifted a food-capsule</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his mouth.

"I can tell you a lot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And if you don't find out what is happen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out there very soon, you'll be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed.

Let me remain here, enjoy certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">privileges I've thought about often when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was crawling around out there in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud. Show me what you have here, let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me understand. For that, I'll give you</seg><seg type="columnLine">valuable information you need to survive."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weisser said coldly, "IVe -- bargain</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a mongrel?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This capsule is poison, and it isn't par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tial to blue-blood," Danton said easily. "A</seg><seg type="columnLine">few seconds after putting it into my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth, I'll be dead. I'll be silent then. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can tell you how the ships were destroyed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weapons used, some things about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned revolt. If I don't tell you, you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">never find out. And if you don't find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is happening out there in a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, it will be too late--for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman pointed. "Take that door</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, soldier. Perhaps you'll be contacted</seg><seg type="columnLine">later."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Danton smiled. "Don't wait too long.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You don't have much time, beautiful."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A CORRIDOR led into a circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, one section paneled entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">in glass. Furnishings were suspended at</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd angles, the concepts of an odd struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tural art, from various lengths of silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">strands. He stood there, then tried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. He couldn't open it. He was locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. He felt eyes on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Later he turned, moved back until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">94	PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was facing the door through which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered. He kept the food capsule near</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mouth as the door opened and she stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">there looking at him strangely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then she strode toward him, long slim</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs and an easy imperious stride. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic-silk skirt that came half-way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her knees tinkled like a -thousand infin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itely tiny bells.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said, "The records have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked. One of our ships failed to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of Earth's atmosphere when we came</seg><seg type="columnLine">here a century ago. We had assumed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship had burned up. It has been suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you are from Earth, that you found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ship. It would be odd if you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the Equalitarian soldiers who</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought against us a hundred years ago."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danton shrugged. Self control was dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficult now. He had to resist an urge to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach out, put his fingers around her</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat. She seemed weaponless, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be accomplished rapidly enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There would be a great deal of personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction. But he still clung to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shreds of his duty. His duty to Seers, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth millions who could so easily die</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the bombs of an enemy they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never been allowed to know even existed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or was that the real reason? Maybe I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't really want to kill her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Think whatever you wish. I've told you</seg><seg type="columnLine">the facts. I know nothing about such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. If you believe such a fantastic idea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then where is this ship now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll answer that," she said. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved nearer, nearer than necessary for</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation. How ageless and smooth her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was, he thought. Smooth and pale.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And her eyes like exotic books, conceal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing strange and terrible secrets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shrugged again. "It doesn't matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">much to me," he said. "My offer still</seg><seg type="columnLine">stands. Take it or leave it. As I said, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">capsule will kill me in seconds. After that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the troubles are all yours. You won't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to escape. Those mongrels out there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you call them, they don't need Earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They have minds of their own."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's impossible!

The perfect slavery--cul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turally molded, so they don't even realize</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they're slaves. That's the idea? It isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">working out that way. They're human,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with minds too complex--they can never</seg><seg type="columnLine">be wholly predictable. Of course you could</seg><seg type="columnLine">send an agent to Earth to find out. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would reduce the odds against us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Us?

He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">move either. Danton released the force of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flash-gun, left the gun in the position</seg><seg type="columnLine">Van Ness had indicated, its beam burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep into the .heart of the complicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul of the Oligarch fortress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He would have taken Van Ness with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, but Van Ness wasn't interested any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">more.

The elevator con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued to rise smoothly, carrying Dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton and the car, but Danton felt a giddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying like that of an earthquake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A social system strictly of the top-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down variety. But in the final analysis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top wasn't the mind of Rhone or of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weisser. It was something above both</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, above the Oligarchs.

And maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">one or two or three Oligarchs would also</seg><seg type="columnLine">survive. Even one ship, one Oligarch, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning to Earth, would be one too many.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was looking at the far door as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">slid open and a car sped through, skim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming along the polished metal floor fran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically, desperately. The occupant of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car, a woman, took no notice of Danton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her face was damp and pale with fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">as her car sped past. Her machines were</seg><seg type="columnLine">forsaking her. Her efficiency, her gadgets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the tremendous power that had existed</seg><seg type="columnLine">100</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PLANET STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for so long at her fingertips, were disin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tegrating, and she appeared to be disinte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grating with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She would be intent only on escape,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, not realizing that without her</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines, she was doomed.

And Keith--con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced that soldiering was an end in it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, rather than a means to an end--had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the inevitable end for a soldier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danton wondered about that. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing--that the test was yet to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him. He was not sure yet that Keith</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not been right . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He followed the woman through a door</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a chamber. It was a nice room, Dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton thought. A great deal of pleasure had</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted through this room, and in it, time</seg><seg type="columnLine">had probably never meant anything. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fumed incense. Music, drifting, still rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">from somewhere, pneumatic couches--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">underneath something was cracking open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">veins and arteries of power choking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocked off; but the power had to go some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where; short-circuit, the madness of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great machine-mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman had opened a panel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond her, Danton could see the Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon. He had never seen a Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon before. It was beautiful, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, though he was hardly in a posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to study or appreciate it properly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he saw what she was doing--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman was escaping out the panel. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be some way she was planning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get safely to the ground outside. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be d long way down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she wasn't worried about that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She jumped. She looked back at Dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, her face pale and twisted, then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped. Danton ran, looked out. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked out just in time to see her body</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit. It was too far down for anyone to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go that way. Her body bounced a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">INSANE, Danton thought. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">each become such component parts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bigger machine that very likely they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all going crazy now, right along</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the machine. And the machine wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to last much longer either, insane</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">or otherwise. It was beginning to quiver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shake and shudder, and its metal skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beginning to groan and twist. Its metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">joints were grinding together, its skein</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves wrenching and singing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danton looked around hurriedly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the wires again, everything suspended</seg><seg type="columnLine">by wires, shiny and strong. He gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy table slab--legless, of course, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspended disc of metal--he gave it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous shove and it began to swing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to and fro; it made a heavy pendulum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging wider and wider, and it began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to crash into other suspended things, into</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs and into weird sculpture, crashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">through structural images and distorted</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces of metal. It made a sound like off-</seg><seg type="columnLine">key bells bonging and clanging.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wires finally snapped with a whine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Danton felt the hot sharpness as a strand</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut across his arm, sinking in like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slash of a knife. He pushed the table slab</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the wall, against the window. He man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged to get several strands of the wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied together by complicated knot designs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He yanked down an ornamental drape</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seemed to have a swirling life of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its own, made sheaths for his hands from</seg><seg type="columnLine">finely-woven metallic cloth, and looped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wire three times around the metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheathing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He slid down toward the ground. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was further down than it had seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from above. The wind was high and cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strong. He began to sway dangerously</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the wind threatened to tear him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glanced upward. The structure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Oligarchs was huge, a shining silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal thing of coldness rising up out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare rocks. It was built on the side of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff, very high, and very far below was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a valley. Perhaps it was the valley in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had landed . . . no, that must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been far away from here. He saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">no lake. But, of course, the valley itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched windingly away further than he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ran out of wire. He managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lift his weight with one arm enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">unwrap the wire coils from the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That gave him another three feet. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped. Pain came from a wrenched an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kle and the shock of the weight on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">MARTIAN NIGHTMARE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">101</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bones. But he hit running and he kept on</seg><seg type="columnLine">running.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For somehow, though he had killed her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just before dropping he had seen her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">running away from the Oligarch tower.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Running along a steel walkway. A fine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mesh railing separated the walkway from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sheer drop of at least a thousand feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was Rhone. She was running fast, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Very fast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ran hard. He didn't feel the pain</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his ankle. He couldn't afford to feel any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing now except urgency. The cold thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">air burned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stopped and he stopped too, flat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tening against the hard rust-colored rock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was pushing a lever or something;</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever it was it got results. A silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose projected outward from the cliff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slanting slightly upward; it blossomed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though someone were blowing a silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">bubble from stone. Out and out. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a spaceship, all right. Danton</seg><seg type="columnLine">figured that the power shut-off had pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vented her from reaching the ship from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a subterranean route. Evidently rigged for</seg><seg type="columnLine">such an emergency, the wall of the cliff</seg><seg type="columnLine">could also summon the ship out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, prepare it for blasting off from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cradle cut down into the cliff like a giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannon barrel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the outer door in the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship opened, Rhone ran for it. Danton</seg><seg type="columnLine">was right behind her. She heard him just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she went through and into the air-lock.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She turned, her mouth opened, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he struck her with his shoulder, carried her</seg><seg type="columnLine">on through the inner air-lock door and into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tubular corridor leading forward into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the control room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dragged her forward with him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doors closed behind him. The con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trols were the same in principle as those</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ship he had brought from Earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once set, they were automatic. He strapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rhone in the shock-seat at the side. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">strapped himself into the chair before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">control panel . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SEERS, Secretary of Social Security,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a fat man with a serious round</seg><seg type="columnLine">slate-gray face.

"First I dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough atomic fire to finish destroying the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oligarch fortress completely, and to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">any ships that might have been left inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountain. There's nothing there now</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a big black crater. I don't think there</seg><seg type="columnLine">will ever be any need to worry about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Oligarchs anymore. I landed the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Pacific in as isolated a spot as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could find--midway between New Zea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land and Cape Horn. Then I contacted you</seg><seg type="columnLine">by short wave. And here I am and here</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are. And I guess that's all there is."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why did you bring Rhone back?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I had no choice," Danton said. "I guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I killed her and put her in the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">frigeration bank, that saved her life. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">surgeon did a quick job on her." Danton</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned toward Seers. "If all of it, or any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it, really happened."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"What makes you think it didn't?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"For one thing, I'm back here alive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an impossible mission accomplished.

As Keith</seg><seg type="columnLine">said--you boys are good at that sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. If that's how it was--it was good</seg><seg type="columnLine">therapy. There's a doubt in my mind, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">see.

I'm not in sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathy with encouraging this dianetics craze. It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">obvious that Mr. Blish is being quite cautious, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he hasn't endorsed dianetics in his article;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but just the fact that Ills article isn't obviously</seg><seg type="columnLine">damning will be enough to encourage Joe Dope</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take his wife, his dog, and all the fans for</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles around into dianetic therapy. These are my</seg><seg type="columnLine">criticisms, then:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> (1)	Dianetics is not a science. It is obvious</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Hubbard's book that Hubbard has only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim notion of what constitutes a science; he thinks</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if a thing works consistently, then it's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">science, and that's that. Unfortunately, true</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciences don't work on the principle of statistical</seg><seg type="columnLine">successes. In the field of medicine in particular,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are so many imponderables that it is seldom</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to say whether the therapy cured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient or whether he cured himself.- (Witness</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sudden collapse of the histamine theory of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">common cold). Three hundred people is a ridicu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lously small series of cases, even statistically con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered ; and have all these "cures" been followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for five years to make sure they don't relapse?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The answer is No; and you needn't take my word</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it Call the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dation and ask them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Furthermore, in order to say with reasonable</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainty whether or not a mental patient has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">"cured," you have to have a reasonable definition</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what constitutes a cure. It's not enough to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a "clear" has no engrams, so long as there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt whether or not there is such a thing as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">"engram." Even in the field of psychosomatic dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease, "cures" usually consist simply of a change of</seg><seg type="columnLine">symptoms. People have been hypnotically "cured"</seg><seg type="columnLine">of arthritis; that is, the arthritis has gone away</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for quite a long time--but something subtler and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more serious usually appears in place of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arthritis. (And the "cures" relapse.)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the case of dianetic therapy, there is always</seg><seg type="columnLine">the possibility that what is happening is simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creation of an overmastering obsessional sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem, which replaces the patient's other neuroses--</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his apparent benefit, but to his lasting damage</seg><seg type="columnLine">insofar as his contact with reality is concerned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To be blunt about it, Hubbard would be unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to detect this, because (a) he lacks knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous disciplines, and (b) he has the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">neurosis--he invented it! (Of course one doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">"invent" a neurotic condition, but one can supply</seg><seg type="columnLine">the details.)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The "experiments" which Hubbard has asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">laymen to perform upon each other are not experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments; they are just dabbling. No layman is</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipped to tell the differences between a simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">question and a hypnotic suggestion--Hubbard</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself seems to think of hypnotism exclusively</seg><seg type="columnLine">in terms of trances and tricks, whereas hypnotic</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestions may be given to wide-awake people</seg><seg type="columnLine">without the suggestor being aware of what he is</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing--nor could a layman tell anything about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth or falsity of Hubbard's hypotheses by what</seg><seg type="columnLine">some patient told him in therapy. About the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthless thing in any branch of medicine, includ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing psychotherapy, is the testimony of the patient,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who is always more than anxious to be "cured"</seg><seg type="columnLine">by any damn thing that is handed him. (Hence the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quacks who make money by giving people sugar</seg><seg type="columnLine">pills--which sometimes do "cure" the patient.)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> (2)	I can add, from my own experiences, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Blish is right in saying that the phenomena</seg><seg type="columnLine">described by Hubbard do appear, that they appear</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the order in which Hubbard says they appear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that they do seem to produce subjective</seg><seg type="columnLine">changes in the patient. This proves nothing whatso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever. The very first thing that happens to a patient,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he changes methods of psychotherapy, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his symptoms change, too. I wonder whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not Mr. Blish has worked on any patients who</seg><seg type="columnLine">have not read Mr. Hubbard's book? If Mr. Blish</seg><seg type="columnLine">has read it, surely his wife has, and I suppose you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have too. Has it occurred to any of you that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">book itself--whatever its intention--offers the</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient a blue-print of how he ought to react in</seg><seg type="columnLine">dianetic therapy, and that therefore a patient in</seg><seg type="columnLine">therapy will need, for his own sanity, to react as</seg><seg type="columnLine">described? Harry Stack Sullivan observed some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time back that there is an enormous drive toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental health in everyone, which accounts for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason why patients in any psychotherapy improve</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat, and why all forms of psychotherapy--</seg><seg type="columnLine">including faith healing--produce some "cures."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Any help that is offered is gladly accepted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooperation extended, except by some psychotics.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Have any of you people worked on any cases who</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no knowledge of dianetic theory?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> (3)	I have to object also to Mr. Blish's implica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, at the beginning of his article, that nobody up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Mr. Hubbard knew anything about the opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the mind. Mr. Hubbard would like you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that this is so, but it isn't. Nothing whatso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever---I underline that for heavy emphasis--in</seg><seg type="columnLine">dianetics is at all new to psychotherapy. The re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">combination of the elements is new; but the ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments are not. Mr. Hubbard's theory of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"reduction" of engrams is Freud's abreaction;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Hubbard's theory of Life Force is findable in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jung and Bergson; Mr. Hubbard's apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensational theory of somatic recording comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the studies of the anxiety neurosis, particu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">106	PLANET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">larly from Mrs. Greenacre's survey of anxiety-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">somatic reactions in the unborn child; Mr. Hub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bard's experimental recovery of material from</seg><seg type="columnLine">"unconscious" periods was duplicated at the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning of this century by Breuer; Mr. Hubbard's</seg><seg type="columnLine">emphasis upon the integrity of the patient is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jungian; Mr. Hubbard's (and Mr. Campbell's)</seg><seg type="columnLine">general and specific analogues of the mind to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">computing machine are the intellectual property</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of Dr. Norbert Weiner; and so on.

It's no such thing. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a publisher of surveys, most of them slanted for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the layman. It does publish works by a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">reputable people, but none of these works are</seg><seg type="columnLine">original contributions to psychotherapy; they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply historical summaries, collations, eclectic</seg><seg type="columnLine">books.

It's true, for in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance, that the problem of prenatal somatic re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cording is foreshadowed in the work of Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greenacre (and, much more importantly, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of Otto Rank, whom Mr. Wickham does</seg><seg type="columnLine">not mention) but no-one prior to Hubbard has</seg><seg type="columnLine">centered the sources of major mental disturbances</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the prenatal area. As for new principles: No-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one prior to Hubbard has claimed that physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain is the one source of all psychic disturbance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No-one prior to Hubbard has claimed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">semantic content of pain-experience is the sole</seg><seg type="columnLine">ddterminator of the nature of the subsequent dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbance. No-one prior to Hubbard has claimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the actions of concepts upon the mind to</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce illness are wholly literal--if homonymic</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and never symbolic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It remains to be proven whether or not these</seg><seg type="columnLine">principles are valid, but I don't think any of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">are findable in previous psychotherapies, as Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wickham implies. I'd like to add, though, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of the concepts and tests which Hubbard</seg><seg type="columnLine">claims to be his alone are not his intellectual prop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erty ; and that I think one of the most disturbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">things about dianetic theory to date is Hubbard's</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent desire to palm off his many indebted-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesses as his own discoveries. This does not in</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself make Hubbard's theories invalid, but it does</seg><seg type="columnLine">make one realize that Hubbard himself is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">saner than the rest of us, and emphasizes Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wickham's point that dianetics is not a science--•</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that Hubbard can't yet be described as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Freud didn't behave very much like a scientist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">either.

In this respect dianetics reminds me</seg><seg type="columnLine">overpoweringly of orgone therapy: full of claims</seg><seg type="columnLine">about scientific evidences and proofs, but shifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and evasive when the proofs are asked for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Wickham's characterization of Hermitage</seg><seg type="columnLine">House seems to come from the book list on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of the dust-jacket for Hubbard's book. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">should investigate Hermitage's complete list. Her-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitage, incidentally, did not publish Hubbard's</seg><seg type="columnLine">book without some investigation of the claims--</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inadequate investigation, but not an unin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Gibson's points, being purely hypothetical,</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't have quite the same air of urgency as Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wickham's; after all, before we discuss what</seg><seg type="columnLine">might or might not be the characteristics of clears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have to be sure that there is such a thing as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear.

Not all automatic reactions are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">engrammic, by any means. As for the elan vitale, it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is Hubbard's claim that dianetic therapy increases</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the amount of it available to the organism as a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whole, rather than the other way around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As for Mr. Wickham's advice: I second it, third</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it, and endorse it all the way up the line to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">power where e approaches infinity. Certainly one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">must take dianetics with a large salt pill--the big-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ger, the better. It is unproven.

This is the first copy of Planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stories I have bought. The reason is that though</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have long been an SF reader, I am so repelled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the covers on many of the lurid pulps that I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashamed to be seen on the street with them under</seg><seg type="columnLine">my arm.

I seem to have rung in on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail of a hot controversy about defining SF, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have a strong impression that the contenders</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been defining extensionally. This consists</seg><seg type="columnLine">in looking over a group of individual items, try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to abstract from them their common features,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then framing a definition from those abstracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">features. This is the most common way of doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and most usually comes to grief. The alterna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive (and generally preferable) method is to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine intensionally. This is simply saying that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">class which you are trying to define is "that class</seg><seg type="columnLine">which consists of item 1, item 2, item 3 ... etc."</seg><seg type="columnLine">It shifts the point of view from the contemplation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of glorious abstractions to the problem of whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">this or that questionable example is rightly in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded in the class. This leaves it all a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">custom and individual opinion, which is less soul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching than the other method, but leaves the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem right where it belongs, and saves a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> .Extensional definition is lots of fun, but funda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentally no good.
