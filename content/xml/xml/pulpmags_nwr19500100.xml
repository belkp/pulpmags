Forty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile rocked with life. Miners jostled</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the churned mud and snow of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street. The shrill laugh of a dance-dolly</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoed from the Malemute. An old trail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chaser squatted on the Company porch, bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle propped on his belly, snoring it off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brando flipped away his cigarette; it made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bright red arc against the night.

Anyway, I don't figure you could</seg><seg type="columnLine">buy Beth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cody's shoulders went rigid.

I've been waiting for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl came up the steps, running a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little, small and well made with dark hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">blowing softly against her shoulders, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm flush under clear skin. Her lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted with- the smile. Her hand was light</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Brando's arm. Beth had lived too long</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the frozen wastes of the Yukon, tending</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old trader that was her father until</seg><seg type="columnLine">his insides rotted with liquor and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried him. She had been raised with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tude, hard-driving men of the territory and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dix Brando was something new to her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had never known a man who could</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk poetry and dress the gentleman and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make her feel like a fine lady stepping</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of Godey's magazine. She laughed now</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking up at Brando. Cody had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">that trusting look more than once: in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of a fawn just before the hunter</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired. He started to turn away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Going so soon?" Brando grinned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at the girl. "Cody's kind of miffed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thought he'd have the big deal all to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. The Captain thought different."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cody didn't speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come over to Beth's place," Brando</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Drink a toast to our partnership."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beth smiled. It was automatic.

"A dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerous job?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brando's arm pressed her close. "Nice</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have a woman worry about you, eh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cody?" The laugh cut deep. "No call to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fret, lady. The great Cody's going along.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll be safe with the great . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cody said, "I'll be turning in now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hand reached out, brushing his sleeve.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her dark gaze was sincere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will take care of Dix?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cody's chest felt tight.

His boots struck hol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low sounds from the planks. Halfway</seg><seg type="columnLine">down he crossed through slush to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barracks. Brando and the girl had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved; they stood close in the porch sha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows, her face turned up to his. Cody</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't look back again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The barracks was dark and cold. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't set fire to the kerosene wick. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat on the windowsill listening to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow-muted rumpus of Fortymile. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the laughter belonged to Brando and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beth. He got out makings and rolled one;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planes of his face were hard in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">match-flare. None of your business, Cody.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A woman does her own choosing. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides, she could be right. Sure, Brando</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be solid under the cheap trimmings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when he bedded down sleep wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">come. He lay staring at the uneasy dark.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once, across the street, he noticed the yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low glare of Captain Mackenzie's window</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Brando's tall shadow standing by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It didn't make him sleep better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the dark before sun-up, Fortymile</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as close to bed as it ever got. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pianola still tinkled shrill polkas. A barfly</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandered out of the Malemute, got as far</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the hitching post and sat down. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">tousled husky stretched and padded around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Company corral. There was a smell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow in the air and Cody's dogteam</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped restlessly at harness. Cody</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked silently on the leather sledstraps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did not watch Beth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stood by1 the corral post, small in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the circle of Dix Brando's arm. He kissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. She didn't let go. He kissed her again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cody straightened, pulling up his parka</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whenever you're ready, Brando."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brando grinned, Beth's hand in his.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Eager boy. Always in a hurjy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cody ignored it. North, before the chaf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing team, the street lay white in the paling</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness. Beth said,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't like it, Dix. This Tucker is</seg><seg type="columnLine">in too deep. That kind kills when he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cornered."</seg><seg type="columnLine">6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NORTHWEST ROMANCES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Easy humor went out of Brando's face;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it got thoughtful, set with a brittle hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, as if he were enjoying the thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Unless you kill first," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cody frowned. For a second Beth drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Then the mood passed.

After</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, with the great . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cody looked at him levelly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beth said, "You won't forget, Cody."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Forget!" Brando laughed. "He loves</seg><seg type="columnLine">me! Didn't you know? He loves us both."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BETH flushed. Cody turned back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sled. His eyes were flat on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleak reach of windswept tundras beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the town. He hove against the gee-pole.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The runners rocked free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pretty near sun-up," he said, and threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sharp, "Haw!" at the team. Brando fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">into stride by the lead-dog as the lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauled taut. The sled lurched forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut down the long empty street. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pianola had gone dead. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound but the bright yelp of huskies and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brando's shouted, "Aiee! Mush!" Cody</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see the girl, small and alone in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing light. She was still waving. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They struck North, a short leg along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Yukon, through silvered spruce groves</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the cold shadows of sheer ice-hills.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brando moved steadily, cursing the dogs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His face wasn't easy and laughing any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. His eyes were harsh, narrowed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daylight went too quickly. Handling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pole, Cody didn't talk. He kept thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Brando's eyes; hearing words in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">biting rush of wind: Unless you kill first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless you kill . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He told himself lie was crazy. Letting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feelings for Beth overrun common</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense. Mackenzie was nobody's fool. Come</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, Brando would handle Tucker and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Indians in the right way. He'd keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fist away from the Colt thonged to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his thigh. Cody tried to believe it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">accident didn't help.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun was going. A wolf loped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crest of a distant tundra and squatted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">panting, watching them. The birch sled</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung right at the crotch in the Yukon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pitched Northeast on the treacherous</seg><seg type="columnLine">rimreck of Chandindu River. Rounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sharp bend, the sled-dog lost footing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and slithered over the edge. The runners</seg><seg type="columnLine">listed crazily and Cody lunged back</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the geepole for counterbalance. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sled teetered, settled upright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brando's mukluks made a driving angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">grind in the snow. The muscles of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw had that set, white look and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">freed the rawhide whip from his belt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cody said, "Listen . . ." The wet tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashed out, slicing across the sled-dog's</seg><seg type="columnLine">muzzle; the husky yelped and bristled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brando's lips pulled back from clenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth. The thong swung wide for another</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow. Cody caught the wrist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Easy, mister."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We got time to make. No dumb bitch</seg><seg type="columnLine">is going to bog us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cody's grip tightened. The whiphand</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost color.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a toneless voice, Cody said, "That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">not Tucker you're beating."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wind brushed south over the ice-choked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chandindu. Brando stood very still. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes veiled; he had control of him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. Without a word he twisted away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cody took the lead after that. Brando</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't argue. They had no more trouble on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rimrock. But in gathering twilight</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cody felt the pale eyes on him, watching,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They pitched camp at the foot of a steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill dotted with a stand of aspens. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too quiet. Somewhere on the tundras, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolf worried the moon. The fire was feeble</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sank low in melted ice. Cody dished</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the grub. The bean-mash had no taste</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the tea was bitter. Brando didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat. He sat silent now, smoking, easy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure again, the boy with the clever smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally Cody set down his tin plate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right," he said. "Let's settle it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brando let out a smoke-cloud. Damp</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindling sputtered in the fire. Cody said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That talk about killing Tucker. Forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you give the orders now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll skip the humor, Brando. We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget Beth. That's our score. But this</seg><seg type="columnLine">job is Company business. We take it slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and easy. We get evidence. We find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Tucker cached the contraband, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">how he figures to get it out of the terri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory. Then the law gets him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All nice and neat," Brando said. "Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe I got other ways of settling Tucker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For good." He rose slowly, facing Cody.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WOLF-WOMAN OF CHANDINDU</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Of course, my way takes guts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cody went ramrod stiff. One hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught Brando's shirtfront. Brando threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right low, under the belt. Cody dou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled and a driving knee met his jaw half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. He wheeled back, jarring against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sled. The dogs roused, snapping. Cody</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head to clear it; his eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold, expressionless. Brando closed in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cody's mukluks dug deep, bracing for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge. It didn't come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Halfway between them, a sudden geyser</seg><seg type="columnLine">of snow spouted up. A split-second later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hammer and whine of a .30-.30 echoed</seg><seg type="columnLine">high in the aspen grove. Cody went belly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat in the sled shadows. For a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brando stood numb, outlined against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire. "Down!" Cody snapped. And in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees an orange flame-needle darted. Ice</seg><seg type="columnLine">splintered near Brando's foot. He swore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawling in the snow not far from Cody.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was breathing hard. His lips looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloodless. Cody smiled thinly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You wanted it the hard way, Baby.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here it is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bright boy," Brando growled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A minute passed. The gun in the hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited. The wind soughed. Still lying flat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cody slid the Winchester from its sled-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strapped boot. His eyes swung past a roll-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing snow-hummock to a nest of jagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulders ten yards beyond the firelit camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going over there," he said. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise'll cover me. Keep him busy with your</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colt. When I get there, quit firing."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Quit firing," Cody said. "Whoever's</seg><seg type="columnLine">up there, he'll get curious and head down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knows something. We want him alive."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brando frowned, drawing the Colt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Get that," Cody told him. "Alive."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brando nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GOING was slow. The hummock</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shallow, poor protection, but be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the fire, darkness helped. Cody</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled flat against the ice, holding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winchester clear. Brando opened fire. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colt slugs fluttered and ricocheted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the aspen stand a heavy roar answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cody's hand was numb on the rifle; an</seg><seg type="columnLine">iceridge dug at his face. He kept going.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He made it. The Colt let go a final shot;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the .30-.30 flashed and echoes died slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then there was no sound at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cody hunched in the lee of a tall boul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der. His gaze flicked to Brando. If that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun-happy chechako moved too soon. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing stirred by the sled. The hillgrove</seg><seg type="columnLine">was different. A small slide of shale and</seg><seg type="columnLine">muddy ice trickled downgrade. Cody's fist</seg><seg type="columnLine">hugged the rifle; the trigger was cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his finger. The footsteps came down</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, wary, the quick light tread of moc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casins. The man was wearing a parka; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">.30-.30 was ready in the crotch of his arm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Firelight picked out the flat, blank planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an Indian face; hard black eyes probed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clearing. The Indian took a stride</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the sled. Cody stood up and lev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">elled the Winchester.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't turn around."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Indian didn't. Only his arms moved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly swinging out and up. Cody moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">in; the chatter of his mukluks sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud. He stopped with the riflle muzzle</seg><seg type="columnLine">nudging the man's spine. The Indian let</seg><seg type="columnLine">go of the .30-.30.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cody said, "All right, Brando."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The figure by the sled stirred. Brando's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips were drawn back; as he bent for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle, his eyes glittered. He clubbed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">.30-.30 and wheeled for the Indian.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Easy!" Cody snapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brando stopped the blow midway but</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mouth stayed crooked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Facing him now Cody reached out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slid the skinning-knife from the Indian's</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt. The Indian stood quite still, nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all in his level stare. But when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathed, a strong smell carried on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night air--the stink of white-man's rotgut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In English Cody said, "You're a Cree</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Chandindu Post."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black eyes slitted. "No savvy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a Cree. Tucker sent you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The brave took a step back. Automati-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally his hand went to the empty knife-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheath. All he said was, "No savvy."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lying sonofa . . ." The lunge was ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal-quick, like the flare of Brando's eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Colt-barrel raked down in a vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc. The Indian staggered to one side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cody stepped between them.

Echoes rebounded. The other</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun didn't bite back. Through his teeth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cody said, "Take care of the Indian,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started up the steep grade. He ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a low crouch. Drifts dragged at his tnuk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luk9. He waited for a yellow spurt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire from the ambush. It didn't come. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">climb was rugged. Rocks scraped at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clawing hands.

The chopping hoofmarks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">two ponies beat off down the North side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hill, jumbled here with the deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide scars of the Indian's tread. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cody whistled softly and went to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">knee. Another set of prints fanned out</seg><seg type="columnLine">near brush where the horses had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">tethered--the prints of small feet in dainty</seg><seg type="columnLine">moccasins. Cody stood erect, frowning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Half aloud, he said "Not only a man . . ."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abruptly he headed downhill. The Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">had talked. But not enough. The talk had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shied clear of something; some special</seg><seg type="columnLine">detail tied in with Tucker and a king's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ransom in pirated pelts. Half running, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the campsite. And stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brando stood by the fire building a cig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arette.

He watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cree, the ragdoll figure lying face-up</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, its eyes open and glazed, the blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">making dark frozen stains in the jaw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubble. A small wind brushed snow from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tundras; flakes settled on the Indian's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. They did not blink. Brando smoked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cody said, "He didn't say anymore?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He was dead when he hit ground."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pale angry gaze switched to the as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pens.

Minutes later</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were back, waiting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two men bedded down.

There was cold sweat on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fist that reached out for the Winches-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. The camp was empty, still. Maybe he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dreamed the soft grind of footsteps</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the snow. But he couldn't get shut of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the notion that they were watched by</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than wolves. He did not sleep again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He lay there wondering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CHANDINDU layout was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor excuse for an outpost. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">skinlodges were mangy and neglected; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">untended fires were scanty. Squaws and</seg><seg type="columnLine">children with the swollen bellies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunger stood silent under the tent</seg><seg type="columnLine">flies, their faces flat and beyond feeling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only the black eyes narrowed, following</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cody and Brando as they tooled the sled</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the compound. Cree braves came</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly from the lodges, rifles and skin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning-knives close to hand. Their faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">were feverish with whiskey and blank sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise as if they watched dead men walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">by.

Cody gentled it. The Cree</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief was close now, breathing whiskey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand tight on the knifehilt; sun winked</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the razoredged blade. Brando squared</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">off and his right swung low to the Colt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quietly, Cody said, "No guns."

An old squaw stiflled a scream</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Tucker's haunch-like fist flung out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cody caught the glint of brass knuckles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Chief lurched and sprawled crazily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Casual, deliberate, Tucker drew back the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left boot; the hobnails got Tantlak just</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the temple.

"Get him out of here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bucks did not move.

After</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minute, they followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tiny puffs of powdery topsnow lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the night wind across the clearing.

Without a word,</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, he went on across the compound.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a long walk. His mukluks made</seg><seg type="columnLine">sad crunching noises. The office windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">were black, but there was no movement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no quicksilver glint of rifle-metal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Crees muttered.

He tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to forget the silent questioning look that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed from Moma to Brando. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">circled the Post widely. Blue-green bran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ches shuddered with his passing, dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, muted avalanches of snow and brit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle needles. He cleared the spruce stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the north end, beyond the office cabin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting west and south again through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the high shielding passes of tundras.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Malemutes kiyi-ed in the corral behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">Headquarters.

Ahead now he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morna's cabin, low against the tall stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger of the Headquarters chimney.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were no lights.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the compound Cree guns flared orange</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the night. A heavier rifle ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mered steadily in Tucker's office. Pain</seg><seg type="columnLine">screams lifted wild and drained away to</seg><seg type="columnLine">moans but the Indians kept firing. Cody</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldered into the small cabin and down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark connecting passage. The screams</seg><seg type="columnLine">got worse. One Cree let out a high</seg><seg type="columnLine">agonized wail and the cry of a squaw an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">16	NORTHWEST ROMANCES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cody felt sick. Over and over his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "The fool, the damn gun-crazy fool!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The office was black and the stink of</seg><seg type="columnLine">burnt powder bit his nostrils. He moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow and careful. Against the gray square</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the east window he glimpsed Tucker</seg><seg type="columnLine">levering steel into the smoking rifle cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers, shouldering the butt. In the sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame of the shot he saw the broad face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tucker was laughing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside, over the screams, Brando's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarse voice rattled commands. Tucker</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept firing. Cody edged forward as</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound thundered in the cabin, a sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavier than the gun-roar. The door</seg><seg type="columnLine">planks sagged inward and shuddered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brando shouted again; the battering-ram</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploded against the planks. Tucker grated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Indian rats!" and pumped the rifle. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ram shot home again. Flatly, in the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief silence, Cody said, "That's all, mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tucker's head swivelled wildly; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jowls and mouth were gray in the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">light; the laugh didn't re-echo. He lunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, trying to wheel; he wasn't made</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fancy footwork. The massive torso</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurched as he brought up the gun-barrel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cody was in under it, jarring the muzzle</seg><seg type="columnLine">high, slamming out with a backhand right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rifle bellowed and, overhead, glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinkled and the hangdown lamp swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazily. Cody's left found soft gut and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind jolted out of Tucker; he lunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, arms flung wide; a chair-leg shat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered under his reeling weight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of the wounded were still scream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. The cabin rumbled with the ram's</seg><seg type="columnLine">impact; the heavy doorbar gave and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracked. Tucker was on his feet, wheez-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing like a wounded musk-ox, circling</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cody for the charge. Cody set his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the door splintered and crashed wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spilling moonglow into darkness. Hulk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing low in the light, Tucker closed in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, beyond him, in the doorway, an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other figure squared off, lifting a rifle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cody yelled, "No, Dix!" It was lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ripping blast of the gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tucker stopped dead and stared stupidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at nothing. Brando fired again. A bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the spine straightened Tucker con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulsively. He rocked on his heels for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, then fell like a damp-rotten log.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He tumbled over on his back and lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">still.

His lips were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a taut thread. He bent down. Tucker's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were open. The first bullet had torn</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the front just over the heart. Dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood welled, soaking into the plaid mack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inaw.

The Indian spilled sideward, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head jarring; hunger-weak legs gave under</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Cree braves surged forward like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">roused pack. Brando's knuckles went livid</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the Colt butt.

Once a squaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly spilled a steaming soupbowl.

Male-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutes lay sleeping, dug into small snow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pits for warmth. The last gray light was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. Beyond the winking sleepless stare</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Cree fires, the ice-strangled river and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonely tundras reached away into empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness. Nothing, he thought. Beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, beyond Beth--nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cabin was cold. He lit the lamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">wick. The potbellied stove was black with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead ashes. He didn't build a fire. He got</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canteen and swallowed a stiff drink.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He screwed on the lid and stood silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a long time. His mouth worked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abruptly, he let fly; the canteen clanked</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall and rolled to rest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangled bunkblankets. Cody lay down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut his eyes. Why wait ? Why hang</seg><seg type="columnLine">around till morning? Don't kid yourself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Glory-boy. Morning won't be better. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see that grinning mask against his</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed eyelids.

Sleep and torget a moment «n</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue shadows of the porch and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arch of Beth's body to his circling arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deep promise of her lips parted under</seg><seg type="columnLine">his. It didn't mean a thing. Not a thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just a mixed-up kid needing a shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cry on. Good old Cody; the man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the friendly shoulder. Damn good old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cody! The canteen tilted. A little whiskey</seg><seg type="columnLine">spilled along his jaw. He wiped it away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forget this morning, too. Shut out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory of uneasy fear in her eyes when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brando butchered the Cree.

Forget.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the end, the liquor got to him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamp glow swayed with the soughing</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin drafts and went far away. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozed. It was like dreaming. Something</seg><seg type="columnLine">had roused the huskies; one dog yapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whined endlessly. There was a creek</seg><seg type="columnLine">of steel runners on packed snow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere a door closed. Cody jolted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sitting position. He felt sweat along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the small of his back. The lamp wick</seg><seg type="columnLine">simmered low. There was no sound at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all. He swore silently. Nerves. Waiting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ROMANCES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and nerves. With a sudden, final move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment he got up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It didn't take long to pack the saddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">roll. It was not thinking, now. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving, acting, letting it all go for good.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no emotion in Cody's face as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hauled on mukluks and parka. The ker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">osene flame still burned. He ignored it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Outside there was no moon; the sky hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">black and heavy and there was a tang</seg><seg type="columnLine">of snow in the air that ripped down from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Barrens. A light still gleamed in Bran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">do's office, but the window of Beth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">room was dark. Cody didn't look at it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He headed for the corral.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first he didn't notice the sled. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">started toward the clapboard leanto where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the calico was stalled. Then the fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">scars of sled blades printed themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">across his consciousness. He frowned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning to follow them. The sled had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">parked in black shadow by the rear cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. Its seat was loaded with a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">grub pack and sleeping bag; the male-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutes, bright-eyed with hunger and a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">haul, were still lashed in the traces. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sled didn't belong at Chandindu.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cody crossed to the shed. It was dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside and heavy with the odor of stale</seg><seg type="columnLine">mash and horse nitrogen. The calico whin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neyed, blowing against the raw wind from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. Cody gentled it, reaching up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the peg-hung saddle. His hands stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">halfway. His mouth went stiff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sounds came clear and sharp in</seg><seg type="columnLine">night stillness--the murmuring jumble of</seg><seg type="columnLine">footsteps in the softer corral snow. Cody</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in black shadows behind the cali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">co's stall. A long minute passed. Rest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less dogs whimpered in the corral. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">warped leanto door groaned wider, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut and the sound of breathing was loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dark. A lamp-shutter creaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrilly; a wedge of light cut across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shed. Cody could see Brando's pale face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The eyes were harsh with damned-up</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury. So was the voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I told you to stay away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nobody answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The calico's here. Cody won't ride</seg><seg type="columnLine">out 'til morning. You should've waited."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other figure was motionless, back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Cody, short and thickset in a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">oarka and mukluks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WOLF-WOMAN OF CHANDINDU</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brando said, "There's Beth, too.

The front of the parka was</seg><seg type="columnLine">open; the hood fell back.

The door swung to,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumping idly; the calico stirred and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stallion in the next stall nickered. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time Brando did not move. His face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clear in the lantern glare. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cody's mouth had a bad taste. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing burned behind his eyes and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist clamped hard on the stall post. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to let go, feel that damn grin</seg><seg type="columnLine">smash and break again under driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">knuckles. He didn't. Evidence, his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">rasped. None of it's any good without</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence. The cache; the skins Tucker</seg><seg type="columnLine">had pirated and Brando figured to build</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher with another season of theft; Mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">na was heading out now by dogsled.

Even with Brando gone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone in the dark, saddling was slow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful work. He led the calico out through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear corral gate. He didn't swing</seg><seg type="columnLine">astride till he was well clear of the Post.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The calico was fresh. So was the long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">weaving trace of paw-churned snow be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween purplish ribs cut bv runners.

The calico</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove forward, head down, blowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the needling cut of it. Once a</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreleg buckled and lurched the pony too</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the rim of a sunken drift. Cody</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauled taut on the reins, wheeling back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the trail that reached up through black</seg><seg type="columnLine">spruce stands to a higher plateau of dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">white silence. The wind got higher. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">24	NORTHWEST</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sled-marks blurred with shifting snow;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the calico broke through tangled brush</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the clear and ahead, abruptly, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land reared in a steep hill that ended</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the snow valley, a sheer cliff over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging a two-hundred-foot drop to ice-</seg><seg type="columnLine">capped boulders.

Windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinked light like the eyes of a crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolf and pale smoke blew in heavy clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the chimney. It was a good spot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A spot where a single man with a rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">could command the valley on every side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cody sat quiet at the grove-edge eyeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the twin runner-ribbons that slid out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the violent grade toward the cabin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could circle; maybe, in darkness, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could take the cabin from the rear. May-</seg><seg type="columnLine">be. But, there was a sound now in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind, a low, beating voice: Wait up for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, I'll be back . . . His jaw set. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn, the evidence and the skin-pirates,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all in one neat bundle.

Beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">it Tantlak sat crosslegged, chin buried in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bony chest. A raw gust flurried across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the compound; he did not stir under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">skins. But his eyes moved slow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepless toward the north cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cody swung down and tethered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">calico to a rail.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">business-end centered on Cody's middle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He quit moving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The swivel hinge groaned as Brando</seg><seg type="columnLine">eased back.

At the door, Brando paused,</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to speak. Cody looked at him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">got out. Cody filled a cup and drank as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if to wash a bad taste from his mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The room was very quiet.

A few Cree braves</seg><seg type="columnLine">had wakened to the night noises. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared after Brando. Nobody tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop him.

A second passed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mukluks trod easy on the porchboards</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the inner doorlatch tilted up. Moma</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to speak. The words dried in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat.

In the frozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment of shock, a sharp totoo of hooves</seg><seg type="columnLine">drummed across the packed snow of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">compound. Cody said, "Damn!" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeled for the door. The clearing had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone wild with movement and a babble</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Indian voices. Bucks brushed into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open through whispering tentflies and</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed for the north cabin. Preacher Cot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton came through the offiice in night shirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and trousers. "My boy, what . . ..?"

The calico's trace cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">south and east, paralleling the ribbons</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliced by Brando's sled. Snow pits waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a step from the broken trail. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm got worse. Cody concentrated on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beth's smile, the memory of her standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone in the compound watching him drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">out.

Gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arctic dawn glittered on the ice-capped</seg><seg type="columnLine">cones of pine and blue spruce, and then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grove had dropped behind and the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise before him was a blizzard-whipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert, showing nothing but blurred hoof</seg><seg type="columnLine">prints and the bobbing lines of Brando's</seg><seg type="columnLine">course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the crest of the hill, hidden by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jutting ridge, Cody hauled in. His snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">order silenced the dogs. He lay belly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat, unconscious of the cold gnaw of</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow against his face. Westward, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land dropped white and dead to the frozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chandindu shallows. He oould see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sled, standing deserted on the flat and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just east of it, the sharp bluff crowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">by jagged outcroppings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He watched the calico pick its mincing</seg><seg type="columnLine">way along the sled trail, the thick figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying man-like in the saddle. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowned. His eyes swung to the eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluff. A shadow moved in the outcrop of</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulders. Early daylight glinted on gun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal. Cody's mouth twisted. "Geez, no!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fire flashed and his cry was lost in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nasal whine of the slug and down on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat the calico reared, its reins dragging.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rider straightened sharply, then sagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, clutching the pony's mane. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">body slipped out of the saddle and lay in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snowbank near the sled, one mukluk still</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught in the stirrup. The calico pawed</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow, blowing shrilly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wind beat against silence.

Cody got to his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brando didn't notice anything but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark, crumpled form by the sled.

Black smoke billowed up against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bloodred glow of the sky. Freeze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotten timbers were already groaning, sag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging forward on the ledge, and ice-boulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">slagged away, crashing down to shatter on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jagged rocks of the valley. But, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the fire held their attention. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could see Brando outlined very clearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">against its rising, roaring torch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood straight, facing the grove, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs wide set, the wind tearing at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes and hair. The Winchester was</seg><seg type="columnLine">levelled for action. One of the Crees</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a deep angry sound in his chest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped into the open. The Winchester</seg><seg type="columnLine">arched up and flashed back splintered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the tree trunks just above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian's head. The Cree didn't go any far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther. Another brave cranked his own rifle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew bead.

Those cheek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones pushing through its tanned skinni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness reminded her of those of an Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">squaw. The thin lips between the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">set jaw and broad nose opened to speak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Katy heard herself saying, "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">you want is my money."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dizzy's mouth sagged until it was higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">than it was wide.

Katy stood up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to wait on the customer who was pushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the swinging doors.

He recalled</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was an important omen, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't remember whether it was for</seg><seg type="columnLine">good or bad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why has Lady Luck always over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked me ?" he wondered.

She never refused to grubstake</seg><seg type="columnLine">a miner after she had cleaned him out;</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead she sent him out into the hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, on shares.

It'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">be hard to hit the jackpot: that is, unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">he contrived to beat the game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dizzy dropped in at the Mining Claims</seg><seg type="columnLine">Registry Office, asking to see the books.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ike Martin, the grizzled old clerk, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile was usually warm with friendliness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him a hard look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ye ain't thinking of claim jumpin', be</seg><seg type="columnLine">yer Diz?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Distaining to reply, Dizzy scrutinized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the many entries.

Their final</seg><seg type="columnLine">Location Notice was on a wooden head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board, large enough for three, in the hill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side graveyard, back of town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, more than half the entries</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never proved out.

Coupling miner's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gossip with failure to report each year's</seg><seg type="columnLine">assessment work on the property, Dizzy</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeded to eliminate these claims. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was looking for that rare oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity for profit where a prospector had</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered what looked like a good mine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had filed on it, leaving the description of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his claim here in the record office--then</seg><seg type="columnLine">had neglected to develop his claim to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extent required under the mining laws</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sometimes unhappy things happen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">miners; they get into fights, someone</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets hurt, maybe killed.

Maybe that leaves a rich mine up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hills without an owner, or a newly</seg><seg type="columnLine">filed claim without the exploration tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed on it to show how rich it is.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dizzy was hoping against hope for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">such piece of luck.

Katy had apparently accepted</seg><seg type="columnLine">this undeveloped mine of his to settle up</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bill at the time he left town. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been something to his mine;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andy had been an erratic sort of man;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would work himself sick out in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills, finally come into town to recover.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he would drink himself silly, get</seg><seg type="columnLine">morbid, chuck whatever he had been up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to, and start all over again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fact that a fellow like Andy hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to his mine didn't mean it wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">any good.

It seemed impossible to miss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had shoved a couple of sandwiches</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his pockets and concealed his rock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammer in his shirt before sauntering out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of town with such obvious casualness as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to allay suspicion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Katy'll sure be furious if she catches</seg><seg type="columnLine">on," he thought. But it didn't seem she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had. He waited, concealed in the brush</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the trail, just beyond town, for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">full half hour, to make certain that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one intended to follow him. Then he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">zigzagged, double-tracked and looped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking every precaution to conceal his</seg><seg type="columnLine">intention of hiking up Aspen Creek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Katy might have been fooled tonight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except that she had kept watch over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little one ever since she had caught him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the registry office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two minutes after Dizzy hit the trail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her informer rushed into the Golden Goose</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the news. She might have sicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing henchmen on the little rascal, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she did nothing of the sort. She would</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursue him herself. She liked to fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own battles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A good tracker like Katy didn't need</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rush after Dizzy. She gave him plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time to strike out where he was really</seg><seg type="columnLine">going. She was careful not to approach too</seg><seg type="columnLine">close, for once he found her on his trail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would head for home without showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Dizzy pulled his final trick. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped down from its aspen wooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks to walk in the creekbed. Where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water flowed over a flat slab of rock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking reddish beneath the swiftly flow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing current, it was flanked by a thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">grove of small quaking aspen trees, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves still green and small with the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush of new growth. These trees filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tight little vale between the rounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaley walls of the canyon of the stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dizzy broke a small branch from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greenish white trunk of a tree overhang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the water. It snapped with a brittle</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound. He left it swinging, still suspended</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a slender thread of bark, from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunk of the tree. This was his way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">"drawing a red herring across the trail,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">RAINBOW'S END	35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as the saying goes. No tracker could help</seg><seg type="columnLine">but see it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dropped his rock hammer and two</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandwiches on a log on the streambank</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he completed his deception. To ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complish this, he swung up into the bran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ches. The slender trunk would never have</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried a full weight Tarzan, but it held</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dizzy readily enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He swung, monkey-fashion, from tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tree across the little forest, for fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet or so, until he reached the shale clut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered hillside. As he went, every now and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, he'd drop a leaf or break a twig,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just enough to disclose to a prying eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">that someone had climbed through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees. Finally, he dropped to the ground,</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the rocks of the hillside, to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">an obvious trail up the slope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This delaying action completed, he back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracked through the branches once again</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Aspen Creek, where he picked up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammer and his lunch and went on up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream. Anyone following his trail would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to stop to investigate this possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch in direction, even if the tracker</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistrusted it; that would absorb time and</seg><seg type="columnLine">time was all he needed. But Dizzy did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not give enough credit to the depths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Katy's perception.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Katy had been tracking a man to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown destination, when she arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the rock-slab, she might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">fooled, but by now, she knew that Dizzy</seg><seg type="columnLine">was heading toward her Johnson quartz</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim. After all, he had to; there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no other place he could go from here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She chuckled at the thought of Dizzy dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porting himself in the trees more like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chump than a chimp. "If he'd only had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail," she concluded, "he might a made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">respectable monkey!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She tried to recall the details of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnson claim. She had visited it two</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago, just as she did all her mining</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventures. There hadn't been much work</seg><seg type="columnLine">done on that quartz vein; the only good</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing she remembered of it was the beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful sunset on the cliff face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All that Dizzy would ever get out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Johnson claim would be trouble, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. And his troubles would start this</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening, if he insisted on going through</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his plans. "Claim-hoppin's a mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad thing to encourage in these mountains,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she decided as she fingered her rifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EANWHILE DIZZY was toying</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his rock hammer as he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued upstream. It had a long slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle, light for carrying, and a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp point, curved to pick out rock. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered if he'd be picking out any rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">ore samples tonight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently he recognized the landmarks;</seg><seg type="columnLine">flanking cliffs topping the foliage that</seg><seg type="columnLine">embraced the little sparkling rapids, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole a moonlit diamond gateway to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high mountain regions beyond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he was not to be waylaid by visions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mountain beauty. Swinging abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the stream, he ascended the</seg><seg type="columnLine">western hill, a mass of broken slabs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shale at the base of the cliff to the left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The grade pulled at his lungs as he climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight uphill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With five minutes vigorous effort, Dizzy</seg><seg type="columnLine">topped the rise, arriving at the base of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliff. He paused to ease his straining</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nature checked closely with the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">corded description. Behind and below,</seg><seg type="columnLine">roared the rapids of Aspen Creek. Across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stream rose the companion landmark</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff. The vertical wall of the cliff he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood beneath was marked by the slanting</seg><seg type="columnLine">undercut vein. He had to be right, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet, he lingered, studying the twinkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">thread of silver that rippled below him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wanted to make certain that no one had</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursued him up Aspen Creek. He saw no</seg><seg type="columnLine">indication of movement in the moist little</seg><seg type="columnLine">vale of the stream, the brush grew green</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rank, making observation difficult.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, finally satisfied, Dizzy turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliff whose brow protruded above him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">towering a distance of some three hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet. He advanced along its flank, exam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ining its shadows at close hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rock mass angled to the right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealing a natural pathway up the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut vein across the surface of the cliff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bright unobstructed moonlight at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">point gave it the effect of an etching in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cutting winds of time had scraped</seg><seg type="columnLine">this foothold into the granite sandwich of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crag, yet they had not overdone their</seg><seg type="columnLine">labors. There was barely width for tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dizzy to claw his way along the slope</seg><seg type="columnLine">on hands and knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By throwing his weight inward, away</seg><seg type="columnLine">36</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NORTHWEST ROMANCES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from the precipice, and steadying himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">at times by the rock that shelved out both</seg><seg type="columnLine">above and below him for about eighteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches of foothold, he crawled along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow slot in the vein, leading, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times gently, sometimes steeply, up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the cliff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The perils of the ascent would have ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rified most men, but Dizy had never been</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid of height. He kept good control</seg><seg type="columnLine">over himself, not looking down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths of space below him, but up toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">his goal, a fault plane in the cliff, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gold would lie, if anywhere at all in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this eerie spot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He brought his hammer into use, test-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the solidity of the weathered rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the ledge. Presently his efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him to the end of the slot, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet in the air, where the vertical</seg><seg type="columnLine">fault plane in the granite cliff had abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheered it off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fault at this point was about five</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet wide and filled with an outcropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">of white quartz. Below him, long before</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching the ground the fault pinched off</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a mere crack in the granite. Prospect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from below might not have shown it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now that Dizzy thought about it, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascent of this slot in the cliff, hardly more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a mere scratch on the face of Na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, was about as crazy as trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb a rainbow in the sky. The question</seg><seg type="columnLine">now was, had he discovered the pot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold at the end of it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even the surface of the quartz was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard. He hammered off as many of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small projecting lumps as he could. Several</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the chips bounced over the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff as he hammered. His blows resounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with telltale sharpness in the night air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE WAS much too busy to notice</seg><seg type="columnLine">Katy emerge from the creek bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to approach the rock face. Katy with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun in her right hand. She passed beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dizzy's perch, stopping to examine the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chips falling from his blows. She walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">three hundred or so paces further along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliff and toyed with the loose rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. Retracing her steps, she paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">again in the shadows. Standing just south</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the vein, and hidden in the darkness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she looked up and watched him intently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally she disappeared westward into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dizzy halted in his hammering to study</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little pile of rock chips on the ledge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In all of them were large yellow particles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gold. He had found the hoped-for pot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gold at the end of his rainbow. He de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided that he would christen his discovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Rainbow Road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Won't folks be excited when I tell 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">about this," he thought in high glee. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the biggest moment of his life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perched as he was two hundred feet up</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air, with what seemed like all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold in the world right beside his elbow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took a folded sugar bag from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast pocket and filled it with samples</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ore. These he stuffed back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pocket. To think that Johnson, the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">guzzler, had traded off a bonanza like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this for the price of a few drinks!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dizzy backed down the trail, rubbing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammer handle across the ledge as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to erase his tracks. He certainty</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't want anyone to discover his Rain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow Road at this point. Now he must get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the location safely refiled on at Ike Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin's office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just beyond the point at which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">commenced to climb the vein, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled to find a three foot monument</seg><seg type="columnLine">of loosely piled rocks. Then he recalled</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, of course, Johnson had to build</seg><seg type="columnLine">monuments on his claim. "I should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected to find them!" he thought. For-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunately they were in good condition. "It'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">save me spending the rest of the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">building them." He had barely time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to Ballycop Falls before Ike opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He bent over the monument and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tobacco can with a claim paper in it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is Johnson's work. Remember, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to smoke that kind of tobacco too."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He decided to add his own Notice of Lo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation to it After he had replaced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">can in the monument he hightailed it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Ike Martin opened his office door</seg><seg type="columnLine">at 8:10 that morning, the first citizen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the town to greet him was Dizzy Izzy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Isadore. Dizzy swiftly accomplished his</seg><seg type="columnLine">legal business, refiling the original John-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son notice, changing only name and date.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Exact duplication seemed to tie up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ownership clearly to that known location.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he had finished- his new wealth</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed safe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">RAINBOW'S END</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By noon every Ballycoptian had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the news. Little Dizzy Izzy had refiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Johnson claim! And the ore sam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ples from his land had proved to be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">richest ever tested in the assay office.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What was that high-fallutin' name</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dizzy had rechristened the old Johnson</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim? Oh, yes, the Rainbow Road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within the hour, every curious rider,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who could borrow a horse, was on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way out to look over this old Johnson</seg><seg type="columnLine">property. Meanwhile, Dizzy dropped into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Golden Goose to call on Katrinka</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to press his courtship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the joy that only love can lend,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he told of his discovery and, consequently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fulfillment of her demand for success</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wealth on his part. He again asked her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to marry him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's wait a little longer, Dizzy, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">we're sure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean, 'Sure'?" he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded. The cocky little man of sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth was surprised. "I could have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand women now," he told himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yet Katy puts me off. Still those gals</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be like her, though!" He de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided to l&gt;e magnanimous and wait a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer for her to be reasonable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Katrinka would give him no explanation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wait and see," was all she would say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Late in the afternoon, the horsemen</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned from their trip to the Johnson</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mine. They had carefully followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">original description of the property, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one which Dizzy had refiled in his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">name that morning. They stomped into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Golden Goose, nearly slamming the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors off their hinges, to confront little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dizzy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you were only heavy enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tighten a rope, we'd string you from Hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's Tree," said the larger man, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">acted as spokesman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter, boys," inquired</seg><seg type="columnLine">supercilious Dizzy. He was remembering</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wealth and tried hard not to quiver</seg><seg type="columnLine">from mere force of habit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's no gold on that Johnson claim</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you swiped from Katy, here. Where'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">you get that rich quartz you pretended</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from there?" his tormenter de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what's that to you, men? de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded Katy, coming around the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her crude oak bar with the menacing air</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">37</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of a mastiff protecting her puppies. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly don't own it in any case: that is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless you had thought of jumping it to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day yourselves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That could-a' been, Mum," admitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oldest among the men, apologetically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had learned from experience to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the truth in the vicinity of the Golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mebbe you didn't know already," went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Katy, "That old man Johnson faked</seg><seg type="columnLine">that claim he gave me just to wheedle me</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of a few drinks.

"The drinks are on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house boys." But Katy's invitation cost</seg><seg type="columnLine">her nothing. Once Dizzy had let the cat</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the bag, everylxidy dashed out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, after the little minerjin a race to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">first at Ike's office windc»v to file on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slice of the bonanza, so suddenly revealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be without an owner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A score of men had run out after</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dizzy, men with longer legs.

"Tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you what," his face brightened. "You fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows could always go out there and shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">it out!" He slammed down the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The goldrush was on.

This time there wasn't much</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt but that they all would turn "west."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But poor little Dizzy was out of the*</seg><seg type="columnLine">running. He crumpled down on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooden steps outside the claims office,</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcome by his woes, and sobbed. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost a fortune; he'd lost fame; he'd lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything, but chiefly, he'd lost Katrinka.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was the deepest hurt of all.

The horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a chestnut with powerful withers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a friendly disposition. John Cottrell</seg><seg type="columnLine">had money enough to buy the best and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty of it. The men at Guthrie's Post</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stopped laughing; Wash enjoyed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixture of surprise and growing thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their eyes. He pulled the packcinch tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the pony's belly and looked at Cott-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rell. In the pallid mist of dawn, the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was calm and sure. Cottrell winked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hawing the animal on toward the marshes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plodding alongside, silently, Wash</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered to the waking earth, This is it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">baby; now, we'll show them. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time before he realized the land wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">answering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A notionable wind, purged down from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blinding steep wall of the Pass, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned suddenly icy. Gritty blasts of snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploded in their faces. The marshes</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed thicker and mud clung heavy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their mukluks. And over everything lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dead while silence broken only by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneasy snuffing of the horse. Cottrell</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed forward steadily; he seemed not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to notice the sudden grayness of the land.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wash shrugged off a shiver. Day-dreams,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought. Why should the land turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">against him? They were friends; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lived together a mighty long time;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they knew and trusted each-other. Still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of White Pass glared palely at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their approach. The wind was too sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">and quiet. And, at noon, in the last treach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erous reaches of the marsh, the horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">caved in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leg wasn't broken, but the muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">were strained. Cottrell straightened from</seg><seg type="columnLine">examining the animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's hauling too much. We'll have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">back-pack some of the stuff."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started to unhitch the rawhide</seg><seg type="columnLine">thongs. Wash didn't move to help. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood staring through silent whirling snow</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the bleakness of the Pass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't like it," he said softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cottrell looked at him.

A long</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute passed. Finally, he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll mush whenever you're ready."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Things didn't get better. Cottrell hauled</seg><seg type="columnLine">half the load on thickset shoulders and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chestnut went on. But she was nervous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now; her eyes had bugged and the broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest heaved too quickly. Her footwork was</seg><seg type="columnLine">skittish and unsure. Slowly, the party</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved through a tangled spruce grove to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foot of White Pass. Neither man</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked. There was only the frozen snap of</seg><seg type="columnLine">undergrowth and the wind playing sullenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at hide-and-seek. The pony whinneyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrilly. The evergreens thinned and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming into blanched naked foothills, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">began the climb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once, the trail that straggled up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountainbelly had been covered with top-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil, but for years now, Indians had used</seg><seg type="columnLine">White Pass as a portage. Quilled moc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casins and unshod hooves had worn away</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth coating and now the searching</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot found poor hold on jagged, slippery</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock and shale. The path was narrow and</seg><seg type="columnLine">steep; the chestnut shied back from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer lip. Cottrell swore, prodding her on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wash Tetley said nothing. His weath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered face, squinted against rising storm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind, had a listening expression. He looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a man who load asked a question and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited for an answer. The land rose bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">and silent against a crepe-gray sky. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">snowfall thickened. And the answer did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not come. Maybe he was wrong. Maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">the anger of the man killer was a passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing and the storm would let up. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">told himself that. But he never believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">44	NORTHWEST</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The answer came at nightfall.

He searched</seg><seg type="columnLine">every pocket. He came back to Wash and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "Stand up," through his teeth. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands were rough.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it didn't quite come off. He lay huddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his blankets, the stock of the Win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chester under his fingers, and watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tetley l&gt;ed down. Dark mountain scrub</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattled in the raking wind. A drift</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounded over the unlit fire. Tetley slept.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once, in the night, a sound woke him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Across from him, Cottrell sat rigid, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle half-lifted to his armpit. His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched the darkness beyond the bend in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pass. But there was nothing. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">trackless white and the secret face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">summit brooding over them. Cottrell didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at the old man. He lay back and pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended to sleep again. It was a rotten piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of acting. His grip on the Winchester</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't relax for a second.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FIRE made things worse. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn, Cottrell was working over</seg><seg type="columnLine">frozen kindling. Wash leaned against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, watching. The snow-wind had turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperamental. It worried a man and let</seg><seg type="columnLine">him be and then came back to worry some</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. It played hell with Cottrell's matches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The tall man swore and tried again. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lean-to canvas flapped. A sulphur tip sput-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered and blackened, stillborn. Tetly laughed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I told you. One way or another the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land fights back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cottrell fumbled with another match.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Careful," Wash said. "In a storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">like this, without fire, you're a dead man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A minute passed. Deliberately Cottrell</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the matchbox. His liand shook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll eat the mush cold.

He studied Cottrell's dark face;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mask of certainty had gone crooked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A tic twitched under one eye, and dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips moved as though Cottrell cursed voice-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly; cursed blinding sleet and smother-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wind and, maybe, the echo of Tetley's</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning. Easy, Wash thought; he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooked, now; give him play and think,</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan. Under his boots the earth muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">secrets. He listened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hope of a better camp was a daydream.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They both knew it.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire they managed was feeble. Without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word, they ate and turned in. Wash waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cottrell lay on his side, facing the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man; his frost-stiffened parka shadowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hard features. Maybe his eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed. Maybe they were open and watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. His finger twitched on the rifle's</seg><seg type="columnLine">triggerguard. After a time, gently, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">snored. Tetley moved carefully. The scrap</seg><seg type="columnLine">of paper was dirty and creased; the pencil</seg><seg type="columnLine">stub worked by instinct in the dying fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. Time and again, wary eyes flicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Cottrell. Then, the work was finished.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wash folded the paper. Its crackle was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a gunshot in nighted stillness. Wash</seg><seg type="columnLine">fumbled with the sheath of his canteen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrusting the paper between it and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal flask. The noise got louder. Cottrell</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a thick grunt and sat bolt upright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What was that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wash had moved fast; but maybe not</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast enough.

Bill himself was convinced that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man was either a crank, or belonged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the slicker type</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reached the tent-office of the Dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trict Recorder and filed his Notices of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Location.

As he entered the big tent</seg><seg type="columnLine">and elbowed his way through the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the grocery department, a small man, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">miner's boots and mackinaw, sauntered</seg><seg type="columnLine">casually away from a group of men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped by Bill and extended his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Was just figuring to look you up," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.

"Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body's been talking," he stated haughtily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And I'm glad to know that you're capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of learning. Didn't stop in at the Profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor's on your way back, did you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Considering the source, I choose to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignore both of the implications contained</seg><seg type="columnLine">in your remark," Bill answered. "And I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk about more important business. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">are leaving in just ten minutes for a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike on Wilson Creek. And I suggest</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you get your puny frame in motion</seg><seg type="columnLine">and roll your pack."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill Simons and Andy reached the El-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dorado Crossing just as Shorty broke over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank. With a wave of the hand, Shorty</seg><seg type="columnLine">started for the divide and the partners</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell in behind. The pace never hurried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">never slowed, but maintained an even gait</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ate up the miles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dusk was falling as the three men</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the summit of the pass. Shorty</seg><seg type="columnLine">made for some scrub spruce, a mfle down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slope. The snow, which covered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">(summit to a depth of two feet, thinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceptible as they descended. Only a skim</seg><seg type="columnLine">of white remained at the grove, but an icy</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind was blowing off the glacier bluffs to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the north of the pass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Andy and Shorty pitched camp, and Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">took an ax and attacked a dead spruce</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree, slashing some of the smaller boughs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soon the men were sipping hot tea and</seg><seg type="columnLine">munching hardtack before the relaxing</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfort and warmth of a bright, crackling</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly Andy pointed to the back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail. "Stampede," he shouted. "And it</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks as if all the Chisana Camp has turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill looked towards the pass just as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon emerged from behind a cloud bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there, against the sky line, he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see many moving objects. Shorty Best</seg><seg type="columnLine">took one look, then raced for his horse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll have to hit the trail, and now!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he called, over his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In just a few minutes they were again</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the move. There was no trail, but an</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost full-moon made the descent not</seg><seg type="columnLine">too hazardous. Shorty urged the little pack</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse into a shuffling trot, while Andy</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeded up and took the lead. Many times,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the next few hours, Bill marveled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his small partner's ingenuity. Once, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were on the edge of a seemingly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">precipitous diff, Andy, with almost uncan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ny accuracy, led them to a passable descent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dawn was breaking as they reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wilson Creek beach and clambered down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the creek level.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A puzzled look spread over Bill Simons's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face as he looked at the sheer walls of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the granite cliffs across Wilson Creek. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">nudged Shorty and pointed. Shorty Best</seg><seg type="columnLine">took one look and leaped high into the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then threw his hat to the ground and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamped it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This here calls for killing," he shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrathfully. "And when I get my hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">on that there white-livered tadpole, Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williams, I'll make buzzard feed. Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that wolverene told me this here was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a schist country, and gravel pans went up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to an ounce. And what do we find ? Noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing but granite bluffs.

"Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you midget-brained, little weasel," shouted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill. "I'll pull you apart and poison the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buzzards with the remnants of your car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cass.

"That there partner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours is holding four aces, and you and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have it coming.

"You know'd I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't been across this here c^ivide before."</seg><seg type="columnLine">For answer Shorty Best's hand shot out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Sam reeled back from the force of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open-handed slap.

"Or ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you got the guts?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The face of Sam Williams grew livid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his hand flashed to the .45 at his belt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The next instant, the almost deafening roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the two guns, fired almost at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, shattered the stillness. Then both</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shorty and Sam were sprawled full length</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the gravel bar, but not from the effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bullets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Andy Burke and Bill Simons had leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scant second before the trigger fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tightened.

A horseman was</seg><seg type="columnLine">advancing up the trail, traveling at a fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk. Just ahead of the horse stumbled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall, lanky Professor Goudlemeyer. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">horseman was Andy Burke, mounted on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own pony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was leaning over the horse's neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and prodding the Professor with a slim</seg><seg type="columnLine">pole, held in his left hand. A heavy .45</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested menacingly in his right.

One day in the early spring an In-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  dian saw a lynx crouclting on a log, watch-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ing the beaver hole in the ice.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked over to him and asked him to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">me their cache. In it I found several</seg><seg type="columnLine">pouches of raw gold.

In the second place, the burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had received a bullet through the head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the third place, the canoe had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken. Other points were, Ripley had fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed the safest plan, remained in the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trict and reported the crime himself, pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tending ignorance of a corpse in the ruins.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had he left it to chance for the crime</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be discovered, and a check-up of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">district showed he had run for it, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been apprehended, for it is almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible for a wanted man to avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventual arrest no matter what part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world he goes to.

He lighted a lamp and looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself in the piece of rusty mirror. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a three-day growth of whiskers.

He laughed at himself, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt better.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went to the American Bar and drank</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiskies. The swamper had a barber chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a back room, so he spent a dollar on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shave.

Suddenly he realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was someone in the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started back, hand by habit going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the place at his waist where he'd carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">the .38 Smith &amp; Wesson on his way up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, but the gun wasn't there.

It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too dark to get even a shadow impression</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him, but he was a heavy man, Ryan</seg><seg type="columnLine">could tell that by the creak of the floor as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he moved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A match flared up in his fingers, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit the lamp, put the chimney on.

Draw your gun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shorty, and get behind him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shorty carried a Colt in a halfbreed</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster beneath his left armpit, hidden by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mackinaw. The holster had a spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism designed to snap the gun up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward when the catch was released, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shorty almost lost it on the floor. He got</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with a stab of his hand, and wheeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it, aiming at Ryan's back. His finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so hard on the trigger it rocked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">double-acting hammer half way back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ryan hissed, "Be careful."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Battles laughed. He said, "Stand up!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Raise your hands!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ceiling was low, and Ryan's fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost brushed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What was it that Carson sent you in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Telaqua?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How many times do I have to say--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Battles moved suddenly.

The forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">76	NORTHWEST ROMANCES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sight ripped him from the base of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw, across his cheek, the bridge of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It sent him staggering. For a second he</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot about Shorty, about the Colt aimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his back.

It beat on his eardrums,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the words didn't get through to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Battles stood in front of him, his logger</seg><seg type="columnLine">boots set wide. He lifted one of the boots.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ryan saw it coming. He was like a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a nightmare whose muscles refuse to</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer to his will. He couldn't move. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">boot smashed him in the temple, driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">him back against the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where did he locate it?"

Ignoring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns, Ryan lunged forward, but Battles</seg><seg type="columnLine">met him and slugged him to the wall.

He snapped his fingers at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the memory. The Stormwind Cache!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Story of the cache dated back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">days of the first gold miners, before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Klondike rush. It was a legend, something</seg><seg type="columnLine">that everyone talked about, and only half</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four prospectors were supposed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">come down the Yukon from Circle City</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a quarter-ton of gold. At that time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">living in Unakitleet, was an outlaw colony</seg><seg type="columnLine">BONANZA!	77</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of salmon and fur pirates. A group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty of these scoundrels had camped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Yukon, and seeing the prospectors'</seg><seg type="columnLine">bateau, they attacked. After an all-day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">floating battle the prospectors escaped on</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore near the Flattail Muskegs, and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der cover of the short, summer night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to get out of sight in the scrub</seg><seg type="columnLine">timber covering the Kuskokwim divide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pirates, however, picked up their</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail and fell on them again near the head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters of Stormwind Creek. This time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the propectors were killed, but they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">cached their gold which was never found.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was one of the stories. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty others. For instance, he'd heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one of the men had escaped and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned later to spend his life hunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">fruitlessly for the cache; that one had</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled off to die in an Indian village;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he'd escaped and died behind the bars</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the B.C. provincial asylum. Ryan could</seg><seg type="columnLine">even recall some gaudy headlines a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">years back when a convict at Walla Walla,</seg><seg type="columnLine">claiming to be Stormwind survivor, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced a group of Seattle businessmen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who used their influence to gain his parole</seg><seg type="columnLine">and subsequently took them for eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand dollars in a variation of the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spanish Trunk racket</seg><seg type="columnLine">He said, "Tom, do you think there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything to that Stormwind story?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blind man laughed. "Well, maybe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I'd rather go up to Circle and sluice</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own quarter-ton of gold. It'd be easier</seg><seg type="columnLine">that way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ryan saw no more of Battles. He stayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in town, recuperating from his beating,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoping that Dave Carson would learn he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was there and show himself. When two</seg><seg type="columnLine">days passed and no word of him, he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">upriver to the mouth of the Comeluck, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thence up that swift silt-milky stream to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Porcupine Flats. There an Aleut half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breed caught up with him, bringing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">news Dave Carson's drowned body had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been washed up on the rocks below Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pillar Rapids.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He'd already been buried in the mission</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard of St. Paul's five miles downstream</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Ryan got there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I want the body exhumed," Ryan said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His request angered the Jesuit. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood, a big, thick-necked man, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the wind and his cassock blowing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">around him, and said, "Nonsense, Ryan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hate to turn a good Irishman down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but what good could it possibly do?

In an hour their shovels revealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dave in his rough board coffin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was dressed in the same sourdoughs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt and mackinaw he'd worn when he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">been washed up on the crags.

With muscles heavy from</seg><seg type="columnLine">78	NORTHWEST</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fatigue, he turned his canoe ashore and</seg><seg type="columnLine">camped on a dry hummock among cotton-</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He built a fire, siwashed a salmon he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought earlier at an Indian fishwheel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with midnight sun still hanging on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon, rolled up in his rabbitskin blanket</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He awoke suddenly and sat up.

The river</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a perpetual roar. There was a slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind in the cottonwood branches.

It was a belt, or a collarpiece,</seg><seg type="columnLine">about as long as his arm, four inches wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the center and tapering to half that</seg><seg type="columnLine">width at ends which were fitted with tie</seg><seg type="columnLine">strings of pliant caribou tendon. The front</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a solid mass of beads, a pale blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">background worked with figures symbol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical of men, animals, canoes, trees and</seg><seg type="columnLine">igloos in red, purple and orange.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally he rolled it up and thrust it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pocket.

The Swede was half drunk, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd been off and on for two days. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">background, moving quietly, keeping more</seg><seg type="columnLine">home brew ready, was Nel's wife, a full-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood Aleut from Kulakak Bay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For what must have been an hour, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">no pause except to pour more home brew</seg><seg type="columnLine">down his throat, Nels had recounted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventures in the harvest fields of "Noord</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dakota." Then, while taking apart Fargo</seg><seg type="columnLine">board for board, he forgot his story and</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to bellowing the interminable verses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a song, each alternate stanza of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended in the words,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yah, yah!

Her eyes might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been blue, but in the half light they seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE WAS excited and fighting to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the excitement down.

There is</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing for me to do now except get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States marshal and run you down."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She laughed at him and tossed her head</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. "You're not scaring me! What</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States marshal would hunt down a</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl for taking such a thing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was true.

The malemute had stopped bark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and now he started again. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate to the dog pens, held on the outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a prop-pole. With heel he felt the prop</seg><seg type="columnLine">pole behind him, and was tempted to drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gate and let the dog loose on her. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal, savage as he sounded, wouldn't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">actually attack her, but he'd get tier</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned away with the gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ryan hesitated, and took his foot away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Capturing her would do no good.

A canoe had been pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in to shore among some flooded willows. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty yards, she turned, and watching bade</seg><seg type="columnLine">across her shoulder, ran to it. Ryan could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have drawn, and with the .38, blasted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe bottom out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, thinking clearly for the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">in days, he knew it would do him no good</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get the girdle back.

That would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the tough part, following her, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">letting her get away along those trackless</seg><seg type="columnLine">rivers of the North.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He watched her slide the canoe from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the willows, leap in, and crouching drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">the paddle with sharp strength and skill</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sent the craft, light as bubble, into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the current, holding a level course across</seg><seg type="columnLine">and downstream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ran to the trading house.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was forced to use a pikepole; he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead with the babiche line, towing it past</seg><seg type="columnLine">riffles and rapids, wading waist deep in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the icy flood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through wet-slick moccasins the rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the river bruised his feet.

Carefully feeling for each</seg><seg type="columnLine">foothold, he climbed, using the crevice</seg><seg type="columnLine">for protection until he reached the fringe</seg><seg type="columnLine">of spruce timber high on the mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the canyon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glimpsed her then, a mile away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling swiftly through the big timber</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bottoms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RYAN STAYED with the high coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try and kept her in sight, watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">her leave false trail, double back, hunt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocky going, then leave false trail again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yes, Ryan, there was a woman. Clever</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a cross fox.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She left the valley, crossed the narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge of Hsluika Divide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond Hsluika a wild pattern of gul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ches fanned into muskeg which still held</seg><seg type="columnLine">the frost of winter a few inches beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He bound the driftwood trunks of cot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonwoods together and crossed a current-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less stream. Here again was hill country</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered by jacktimber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He caught an odor of woodsmoke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trails laced the hillsides. The benches and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottoms were pockmarked by old placer</seg><seg type="columnLine">diggings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These, he knew, were the old Mucker</seg><seg type="columnLine">diggings, discovered back in 1902 by men</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving through Alaska from the Klon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dike diggings. Now Mucker was an out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">law town, reputedly the home of half the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sluice robbers and fur thieves of the Yu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From high along a ridge he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on the town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had once boasted more than a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred houses, but now all except seventeen</seg><seg type="columnLine">or eighteen lay in ruins, or had disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared using only their sill logs to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they had stood. One, a long, nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row building had the appearance of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trading post. There was a creek which</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined a river about two miles below</seg><seg type="columnLine">town. It was the same river he'd crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">earlier that day, only larger now, swifter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At one time there'd been another settle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment there, but now all that remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a ramshackle boathouse. The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement he saw was a man over there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">puttering around an upended canoe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twilight settled as he descended, hunt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing concealment among the bench dig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gings. He stopped behind a dog shed</seg><seg type="columnLine">about fifty steps from the long, log</seg><seg type="columnLine">building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The odor of food struck his nostrils, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">left him momentarily weak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dropped his pack and rifle. Male-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutes were barking at him, but he paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">no attention. He crossed to the house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped outside, listened. Men's voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from the deep interior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Candlelight shone amber through some</seg><seg type="columnLine">BONANZA!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">83</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">parchment windows. He started around</seg><seg type="columnLine">to listen, but a man was coming, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly concealed himself in the shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a storm shed that was built against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man was familiar. Bill Battles!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hatred made him start forward, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked himself. Now wasn't the time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Battles went past so close Ryan could</seg><seg type="columnLine">smell the tobacco smoke that clung to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes, and disappeared inside the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ryan waited. He was sure Battles had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone on to the distant, lighted room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through the open storm shed door he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could dimly see a kitchen, the teeth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruddy light glowing through the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">draft of a cookstove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked in. He could hear Battles'</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, and her voice. He knew she'd come</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, but it made him curse anyway. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so young and pretty--he didn't like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought of her coming to Battles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wolfed some left-over pancakes. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">big, iron pot of squaw mulligan bubbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the stove. He dipped some in a tin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate, ate, spearing huge chunks of cari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bou with his hunting knife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the edge off his hunger, he paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to the voices.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Battles seemed to be in high humor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying, "I'd liked to have seen his ugly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irish face when you took it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could hear the whisky-hoarse voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Shorty, and the girl was laughing. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be slightly hysterical. Hunger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fatigue had left her that way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Len," Battles said. "You'd better have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little more to eat. You wait. I'll get it</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was her name, Len.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ryan put his dipper of stew aside and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood with his shoulders high, his fists</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubled. It would be a pleasure to smash</seg><seg type="columnLine">Battles' teeth down his throat when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked throtigh the door. Then reluctantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he decided to stay quiet. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of kicking things over now just when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was on the verge of learning what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hunkered behind the table as Bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tles walked in. The man was so close he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have thrust a leg beneath the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">and touched him. His back was turned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took a lid off the stove for illumina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Firelight struck him strongly, turn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his face to yellowish copper, bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">put its hard lines, the long jaw, the small</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He filled a dish and without once look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing toward Ryan, went out, leaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">damp wool and tobacco odor of his clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It went against Ryan's nature to hide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stood up, cursing him, stabbing chunks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of meat with his hunting knife, carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to his mouth. Finished, he listened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shorty said something about beadwork,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he knew they were examining the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girdle. He stood close to the door, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">only stray groups of words reached him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could hear from the intervening</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, but it was too light, and it offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">no place for concealment. He considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">going outside, lisetcning with an ear to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parchment window, but he gave that</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His roving eyes fell on a four-rung,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pole ladder that had been nailed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen's inner wall. It led to a small loft</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the rafters and the roof poles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He climbed, crawled over some bundled</seg><seg type="columnLine">mildewed hides, and stopped on one knee</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get dust and cobwebs out of his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nasal passages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There wasn't room for a man to stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">upright. Even on one knee, his head was</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent against the ceiling. It was so warm</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sweat rolled off him. Six poles had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been laid side by side down the middle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the rafters. Heavy, gray building</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper had been tacked on the undersides</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rafters to form a ceiling, but it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been punctured here and there, and shafts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light from the candle gave a fair illumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He edged forward, stopping when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices lowered, starting against when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were raised, or when someone laughed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had been a long time since the foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poles had supported anyone. One of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled with a slight thud. He remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">very still. The voices had stopped. Dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose in a cloud. He wanted to sneeze and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cough. He set his teeth, held his breath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tears streamed from his eyes. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking again now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the moment lie gave up trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get closer. He lay on his stomach and</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GIRL had called someone "Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mai." It was Shorty's whisky hoarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice that answered her. He should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed before that they were related.</seg><seg type="columnLine">84</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NORTHWEST ROMANCES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They had the same broad foreheads, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same sharply cut features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He'd want it that way," Shorty was</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying. "You can't worry about such</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. When you fight a wolf's fight, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to use a wolf's weapons. Anyhow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing will come of it. We'll register</seg><seg type="columnLine">this as newly mined gold, and who is</seg><seg type="columnLine">there to prove that it isn't?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Battles laughed, saying, "Well, we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to dig it out of the ground. Isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">that mining it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said, "You sound as though we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">it already."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're closer than you think." There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a pause. Battles had looked at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch. Ryan could hear the snap as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the case. "It's been better than an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour. That breed should have been here</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten minutes ago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She asked, "Where was he?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At the Siwash camp.

I said I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting down, and I am. A man can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">just cut himself off like that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ryan could hear the squeak of a cork,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound of little movements. Several</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes passed. Finally Battles said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think I could decipher this myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I had the time." He was evidently ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amining the girdle. Ryan wanted to creep</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trifle further but he didn't. He lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">still. "You see that, Len? That's the Si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wash figure for nas-gin-ax-gan--three men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And those marks indicate the time of day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's ga-gan or the sun, those indicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the length of shadows, and that the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the year. I've decided that's how the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old squaw established her direction to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cache--through sunset on a certain day</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the year."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She said, "The day the gold was buried ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What day was it? I mean, what time</seg><seg type="columnLine">of year?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Late July, I'd imagine, or August.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's just a guess, but their placer muck</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't thaw up in Circle until mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">June, and it would take them anyhow</seg><seg type="columnLine">three weeks to sluice it and clean up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then they'd have to paddle all this dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance down the Yukon. Don't worry, Len.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll figure this out." Something told</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ryan that he'd laid his hand on the girl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm. "Sure. We'll have it out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground and be on our way to Seattle be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore snow flies. Seattle, Len! I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to enjoy showing you that town. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Francisco, Los Angeles, maylje the</seg><seg type="columnLine">East Coast. There's no limit what we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">do with that kind of money!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pieces all fit. According to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most commonly told story, the four pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectors had been attacked near the head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters of Stormwind Creek. Three had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been killed while a fourth escaped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded, to a Siwash village. Ryan could</seg><seg type="columnLine">put the rest together. A squaw had hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den the wounded man from his pursuers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he'd died there after giving her the</seg><seg type="columnLine">location of the cache. Squaw-fashion, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">information had been worked in the bead</seg><seg type="columnLine">pattern of the girdle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And finally Dave had got hold of it! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned and thought, The old philanderer!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'd heard many tales dating to Dave's</seg><seg type="columnLine">younger days telling of his prowess among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the squaws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lay, listened to them talk of small</seg><seg type="columnLine">things, move impatiently, walk repeatedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the door to watch for the breed's ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rival.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There he is now," Battles said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two men in moccasins, by the sound.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Someone spoke a low word or two in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian tongue.

"Here, let me look at it.

This is it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then. See, Hakteel? What you think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bead work? Ol' mama damn good, no?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was quiet. Evidently Hakteel had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girdle and was trying to decipher it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ked-jin-qua," he said over a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Battles asked, "What does he mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A hundred," the breed answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A hundred what?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hakteel muttered, "No savvy.

He rose on hands and knees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slid forward little by little. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tear in the building paper about four feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant. Finally he reached it, bent his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head far down between the rafters, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could see them below. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunched over the table, Hakteel an old,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ragged Siwash pointing to some feature</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the beadwork with a fingernail that</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked white as a bit of clam shell on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of his filthy, black finger; Steve,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tall, lean half breed of thirty with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply scarred right check and little pew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter rings in his ears, Battles on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the table with Shorty trying to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his shoulder.

He didn't want to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">cornered there. From below, he could hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">Battles coughing.

It had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">packrat, a night bird, or just his over-taut</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves. He was too much on edge. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled too long without sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He put the gun away. Then he heard it</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. This time he had no doubt. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a man, the light whisper of moccasins</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He circled the building. He had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of someone just disappearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the front corner.

The man wasn't there. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">already gone through the front door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt slightly sick. He wondered what</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man had on his mind.

He stood by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, listened. There was light around it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No one in that front room.

He was a fool. He should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have stayed there like he'd agreed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men were in front of him.

There was an inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vening room, then the kitchen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men were on his heels. He flung the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen door shut, grabbled the table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled it against the door. It stopped them</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a couple of seconds. The stove was</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, at his right. He overturned it. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed down across the table, spilling</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire. It put them in retreat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside, he stopped. "Len!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She didn't answer him. He skirted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm shed, shouting, "Len, Len! where</seg><seg type="columnLine">are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A short, heavy set man was on the run</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the house. He drew up, bellowed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There he is!" and lifting the carbine</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle in his hands, fired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ryan had pivoted, dived to one side. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the wind-whip of lead past his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. His .38 answered in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">fraction of time. The bullet hit. It smashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavyset man backward. He dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rifle. He reeled for three steps with</seg><seg type="columnLine">both arms wrapped around his middle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he caught himself and took a step</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward over crumpling knees and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">face forward to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ryan saw it in a glance as he returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunfire from another direction. He kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">firing, moving along in the shadow of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pole eave. His gun clicked empty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE RAN across open ground with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets from two directions churning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dirt back of his heels, reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">placer trench, dived face foremost into</seg><seg type="columnLine">its protection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reloaded the gun, untangled himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">from brush, moved in a direction that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would bring him closer to the dog pens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His rifle was back there. He wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Men were coming around in two di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rections, trying to pin him down, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">.38 reached out well, and none of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">risked suicide by getting close.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The house was in flames now. Light</seg><seg type="columnLine">90	NORTHWEST</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from the fire, and light from approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunrise made them still more wary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No bullet had been close for five minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. Ryan risked showing himself. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked to the rear of the dog sheds, found</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bedroll and rifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He cupped his hands and called, "Len!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing he'd get no answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He'd seen nothing of her. Heard nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her since those shots in the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flames was rolling both ways through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house now, and a thought occurred to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that made him sick. She wasn't in</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. She'd gotten out. He kept telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself that she'd gotten out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fight had left him groggy. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know which way to turn. It was quite light</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. The rising sun made a rusty-yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">flare on the horizon. He walked across</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one was there. His eyes roved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town. Everything seemed to be peaceful.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smoke rose from a couple of cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">chimneys.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started toward the nearest house. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have expected to be met with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunfire. He didn't. The night just passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed like a bad dream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could see a man, crouched over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching his approach through an open</seg><seg type="columnLine">window. When he reached the door, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had moved back and picked up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put it down," Ryan said. "I have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked in and sat down.

An hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed, and the current had carried him</seg><seg type="columnLine">far downstream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The valley narrowed. Ahead of him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream was pinched down to a third of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">former width.

Y.</seg><seg type="columnLine">92	NORTHWEST ROMANCES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled into the headwaters of Hell's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Skidway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The river was quiet. Its current made</seg><seg type="columnLine">glassy swells, dipped and swelled again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It slid at a half-mile-a-minute rate along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smooth-worn bottom. Ahead, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising mist, he could hear the deep boom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water tom to froth by crags and water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt a slight lurch as the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeded. It was still smooth. Looking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water, he had the impression of stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing still. It was only on glancing at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canyon walls that he realized how swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the current was carrying him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spray met him with a sudden wave. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat lurched and creaked. For blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds it seemed that the craft had</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumpled under the impact of crosscur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rents. Then, through spray, he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prow still at the correct angle, sinking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dipping water, rising, dipping again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He battled to keep it lined with the cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent. A crag split the channel ahead. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">his left lay the broader half of the river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently without obstruction. To his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right it was funnelled down through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow chute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fought to swing away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chute. For a few seconds he seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">winning, but a swerve of the current seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the craft, and all his paddling had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">futile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't struggle further. He sat back</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing the river would do what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted with him. Its power was too vast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a quarter-minute--a quarter-mile--</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertical rock walls closed the channel in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He burst in the clear. He saw then that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the channel he'd fought to attain was cut to</seg><seg type="columnLine">churning froth by a thousand crags that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose from the bottom. They would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamped the oomiyak, cut it to ribbons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but luck, in spite of all his efforts, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">guided him the way of safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was still a long stretch of rapids</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, but he was able to maneuver them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he saw on shore the lower terminus of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the portage trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked for Battles and the girl. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of them. He wondered if they, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shot the rapids. If not, if they'd taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">the portage, he'd been able to obliterate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hour's head start they had from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mucker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He crossed choppy water, cleared a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gravelly point, shot more rapids. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed like nothing after Hell's Skidway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A bullet tore splinters from the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunwale and whipped past his shoulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The crack and echo of a high power rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">smacked down close atop it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He instinctively went to the bottom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oomiyak. The craft had shipped six</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches of water, and his rifle was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where under the surface. He groped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it, poured water from the barrel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were ahead of him less that three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards. Two men, a canoe. It made</seg><seg type="columnLine">him go gutless and sick. For a second he</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared she had died in the fire; that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men back in Mucker had lied to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he saw her, seated in the bottom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying back, evidently with elbows bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the canoe's center seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A second bullet shot up a spurt of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">a couple yards to his right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BATTLES was in the prow, firing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The tall breed was in the stem,</seg><seg type="columnLine">maneuvering the canoe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dropped the gun. He cursed them</seg><seg type="columnLine">for hiding behind a woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had no chance in an open chase.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'd kill him without his daring to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire a shot back. His only chance was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get out of range, and follow them until</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck gave him an opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He swung the oomiyak toward shore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The third bullet skipped water and tore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole through both sides at the waterline.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Battles was firing as fast as he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">lever the rifle. The river geysered through</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a dozen places. Ryan could feel the</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft lose buoyancy. Crouched in the bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom, water rolled midway of his thighs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The craft listed slowly. He tried desper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately to compensate with his own weight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it kept going, water gurgling over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, and capsized.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was over his head in the stream. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being carried with the gray white river</seg><seg type="columnLine">all around him. He lost all sense of di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection, of up and down. Then, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing how it happened, he was on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, balanced against the current, wading</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist-deep over the rock-slippery bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rested and coughed water from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs. There was no longer any sign of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt for his gun. The holster was</seg><seg type="columnLine">BONANZA!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">93</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">empty. He was unarmed except for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting knife at his belt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked for hours, following the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore where he could, leaving it when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river passed through canyon walls, return-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, watching for the canoe. The sun grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot and dried his clothes, it sank and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold wind sprang up. The hills played out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river meandered off into the Yukon</seg><seg type="columnLine">flats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">This was barren country, muskeg</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, cottonwood and brush country. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed a tree, saw the river tracings for</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles until it bent westward to join the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty Yukon, but no canoe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In half a mile he was startled by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice from willows near the water's edge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was Steve, the halfbreed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ryan, you come. Good Injun hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped, drew his hunting knife. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of ambush was in his mind but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dismissed it. The breed was no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than fifty steps away, short enough range</seg><seg type="columnLine">for any ambush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you doing here ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hurt--bad. Bullet, you sawy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's Battles and the girl?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steve cursed until his voice played out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">naming Battles every vile word in English</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the coastal jargons. He was still cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sing when Ryan worked through the tangle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of brush and found him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was lying on his back, his shirt was</seg><seg type="columnLine">open to the waist, a bloody bandage was</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted around his chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who got you? Battles?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stray bullet. Cabin. I don't know. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot Shorty by mistake, maybe me, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think--just scratch. You sawy?" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to lie still to get the strength to go on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"So, I come with them. But all the time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe it bleed.

He stood at his full height, feet set</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide, the gun gripped in both hands, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove its steel-shod butt down toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ryan's skull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would have crushed his skull like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dry mushroom. He saw Ryan drop and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that had happened. He laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a wild shout and cried, "So you</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught me--for this!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the word this he drove the gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">butt again, but Ryan had taken the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow glancing off his neck and shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as the second came, he grappled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms around Battles' thick thighs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second blow missed. He carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Battles staggering backward. He got his</seg><seg type="columnLine">footing. He stood, lifting the big man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms. Battles tried to use the gun and</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed. He let it fall, and swung his fists.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ryan carried him, running, and fell with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, flinging him head foremost to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp rocks at the edge of the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Battles picked himself up. The saw edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a rock had sliced his right ear until it</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung by a ribbon down the side of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fall had left Battles groggy. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt for his ear, knew what had happened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It infuriated him. He charged and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">met by a left and right. He went down like</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hit by a sledge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He got up. He took another left and</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. His head rolled. His loose jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">sagged, his eyes stared without seeing. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down again and again. He ended on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face in knee-deep water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ryan watched the milky river roll over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him for a few seconds and started forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pull him out, but the big man had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">BONANZA!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">95</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">brute's endurance. He got to his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a dripping, rectangular chunk of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock in his hands. He tried to lift it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive it down on Ryan's skull, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet slipped from under him. The rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangled itself inside the front of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliirt. He got up. Its weight carried him</seg><seg type="columnLine">off balance. He was waist deep. He fell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">got up. The stone was no longer there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the river current and its slick rock and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud baffled him. He floundered deep, lash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the water to a froth as the undertow</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was gone, and the river was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet. A big stream, a deep stream, flow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing between muskeg banks to Yukon, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norton Soimd, to the Bering Sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ryan noticed that the left arm of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mackinaw was heavy from blood. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed the bank, and saw Len, fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself free from some babiche thongs that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hdd her wrists to a cottonwood sapling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A strip of cloth had been wound tightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">around her mouth as a gag.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found his knife on the ground, cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">her free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're wounded," were the first words</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said. "Take off your mackinaw."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't seem to hear. He took her</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the arms, just below her shoulders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped her to stand,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Len! I never thought I'd see you</seg><seg type="columnLine">again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take off your mackinaw." She got free</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him, grabbed the front of his mackinaw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled it open. "Now lie down before you</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleed to death."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He watched her cut the sleeve of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt off revealing the bullet wound, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">work swiftly staunching the flow of blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It missed the vein by half an inch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You were lucky."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the luck of the Ryans.

There were many</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  things that pleased the natives: It removed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  a number of taboos, and made it possible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  for them to eat anything they liked at any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  time. But the new religion permitted them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  to haw only one wife--and that was very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  inconvenient at times. For the missionaries</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  frozvned upon the old custom of borrowing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  a friend's wife--to take on a journey, for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  example; or to make up one's winter ward-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  robe.

In the old days, you could, if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  you were willing to relinquish your pretty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  young wife for a couple of weeks, get a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  real bargain in a seamstress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Nowadays, say the Eskimo men, it is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> very difficult when you want to make a trip</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of perhaps a hundred miles by dogteam,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and your wife is expecting a baby. She</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> can't make the trip, of course; yet he needs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a woman to mend his skin clothing, do the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> cooking, dry his boots and socks at night,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and be a companion to him on the journey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before the missionaries came, he could have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> borrowed a frie&gt;id's wife who was in good</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> condition for traveling; she might even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> visit a sister or a brother at the village he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> was headed for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   There was another phase of the white</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> man's religion that the Eskimos found dif-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ficult to understand: The "do unto others"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> precept.
