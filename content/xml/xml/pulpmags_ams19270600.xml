Captain Clinton, my great-grand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">father, died yesterday at the age of nearly one hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred and twenty-six years, and his death unseals</seg><seg type="columnLine">my lips and releases me from the promise I made</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, a year ago, on his birthday.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although, as I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated, my own personal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity is of no importance in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this narrative, it affords</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a certain amused sat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isfaction to realize that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am perhaps the last his-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torian of the human race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Owing to the changed con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditions under which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">live, the professional his-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torian has become almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">as obsolete as the lawyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the alchemist of past</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages. There is an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying that "Happy is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation which has no history," and that proverb is</seg><seg type="columnLine">as true today as in the past, except that for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word "nation" we must substitute "planet." His-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory is rightly defined as the record of the suffer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings of mankind. Without suffering, there is noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing deemed worthy of record.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the past century the world has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing through the most extraordinary phase of</seg><seg type="columnLine">transition which ever has been, or ever will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">known. Prior to the year 1950---the Year of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Visitation--Humanity was divided by innumerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines, largely artificial, into hundreds of races and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nations. Since that date man has known only two</seg><seg type="columnLine">divisions; those who were living at the time of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Visitation and those who were born afterwards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We have adopted the two Deelathon words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Zykof" and "Epzykof" (immortal and mortal), in</seg><seg type="columnLine">referring to these two subdivisions of mankind and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the names convey a fairly clear picture of human</seg><seg type="columnLine">society of today. We of the new generation, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zykofs, having been born to a knowledge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thon, glory in the prospect of a life which, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly not eternal, is infinitely richer and hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pier and more extended than that which our fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fathers knew, but sometimes we are saddened by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sight of those who are nearest and dearest to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us growing older and dying before our very eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our friends the Epzykofs, who saw the great events</seg><seg type="columnLine">which transpired nearly a century ago and even, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my great-grandfather's case, were directly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponsible for bringing about the Visitation, have</seg><seg type="columnLine">only an acquired and not an inborn knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Thon and therefore are not fated to share with</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, for long, the innumerable benefits it brings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A year ago today I left my little workshop in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">palm groves of Florida, where I carve and decorate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the polar bosses for pleasure Zeeths, and before</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening I set foot on the pine-clad shores of Van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">couver Island. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come, with many of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">relatives and friends, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay honor to Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clinton on his one hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">d r e d and twenty-fifth</seg><seg type="columnLine">birthday. From all parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world we came and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I alighted from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zeeth, I was greeted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">several old friends who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just arrived from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Japan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Together we walk 'd up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the winding pathway</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the forest, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw the gleam of white marble and emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a wide lawn, upon the farther side of which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half hidden in a group of graceful cedar trees, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Capt. Clinton's home, with its fluted columns and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ellipsoidal roof. The Captain was seated upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps, his white hair shining like a beacon light in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last rays of the setting sun, and gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him was a group of our relatives in ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mated conversation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we approached, Captain Clinton rose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came forward to greet us, his fine figure still erect</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his eyes bright with youth in spite of his (for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">TN introducing the new author of the prise story of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">our covcr contest, we believe you will agree with us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that Mr. Wates not only knows how to write interest-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ingly arid convincingly, but he also keeps your interest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from beginning to end.

As you all know, I am the last survivor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crew of the Shah of Iran and soon I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to join my shipmates. Tomorrow I will tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">Benedict the story of my last voyage, a story which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be kept secret until the last of us had sailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the home port. When I am gone, Benedict will</seg><seg type="columnLine">write it out for all the world to read."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We surrounded him with loving words and ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der caresses. Not because he was the most famous</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in the world for nearly a hundred years, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of his simple nobility, we loved this line</seg><seg type="columnLine">old sea captain of a past age. Thelma, his eldest</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter, who with her companion, John Adair, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from their home in Spain that day, slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">her arm around her father's neck and cried:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must not leave us yet, Father dear! You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a hundred years of life in that big body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours still.

For Thelma was a famous</seg><seg type="columnLine">swimmer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That remains to be proven, my dear," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain with a little laugh, half gay, half sad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Prove it! Prove it, Thelma!" we cried and soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were all running down the path to the shore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we plunged into the warm waters of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pacific.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thelma beat her father by a length, her white</seg><seg type="columnLine">body flashing through the water like an ivory</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zeeth cleaving the air. We remained sporting in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bay until the daylight died and the big moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As we loitered up the hill, my great-grandfather</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew me .back from the gay crowd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I should like you to climb the Shah with me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the morning, Benedict," he said. "I want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch the sun rise--who knows, it may be for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last time--and then I will tell you the story of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">last voyage and the Visitation of the Deelathon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Will you come?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The half light of dawn was just touching th^</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow-capped peaks in the east when Capt. Clinton</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I started our ascent of the Shah, the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain just behind his home, to which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">attached the name of his old ship. We tiptoed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the steps in order not to disturb the sleeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">guests, whose white forms lay--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Star-scattered on the grass'"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">--as old Omar puts it. Soon we were high up</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the rocky buttresses of the Shah. An hour</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of exhilarating climbing brought us to the summit</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we sat on a flat boulder to watch the ever-new</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracle of the Dawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the East shone the placid waters of Queen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charlotte Sound, sparkling like molten gold in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiance of the rising sun. Beyond towered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains of the mainland, lifting their snowy</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads above their mantle of green. To the West,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waters of the Pacific widened to an unbroken</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the Captain broke the silence and for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour I sat spellbound, listening to his deep voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling the story of that last voyage--the Voyage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Visitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            CHAPTER I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            The Meteor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">YOU must often have wondered (said Capt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clinton) in common with the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, why no person among the crew or pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sengers of the Shah of Iran has ever revealed what</seg><seg type="columnLine">took place on the last voyage of the old ship. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason for this secrecy on the subject which is nat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urally of more than average interest to everyone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is quite simple.	«</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the Deelathon conceded to our request to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the Visitation, it was upon the express under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing that the location of their country should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be concealed. They pointed out to us that it was *</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible to foresee the outcome of the Visita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and they wanted to insure their own safety in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any event.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This request was so entirely reasonable that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">all unhesitatingly agreed to it. We realized that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not possible to release into the world a tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous force like the Thon, without producing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">widespread upheaval, which might be beneficent or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reverse. We decided that the simplest way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">preserving the secret was to make a pact among</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves that the entire story of the voyage should</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain untold until the last of us was dead. If it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed wise, in the light of events which were still</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the future, the last living member of the party</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to tell the story to some dear friend, who would</seg><seg type="columnLine">publish it after his death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This, then, Benedict (continued the Captain), is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the task I am asking you to undertake. Say noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing until I am gone and then publish what I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">about to tell you, word for word as I shall tell it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you may easily do by the aid of the Thon. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel that my end is not far off. All possibility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger to our friends and benefactors, the Deela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thon, has long passed away and the necessity for</seg><seg type="columnLine">preserving their secret no longer exists. And now</seg><seg type="columnLine">for my story!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Shah of Iran, of which I was Captain, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of a line of huge steamers which made the jour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney between Vancouver and Australia in the fifth</seg><seg type="columnLine">decade of the twentieth century. These great ves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sels, which became obsolete with the introduction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Zeeth, were magnificently equipped according</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the strange standards of that time and were so</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful that, although they floated upon the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the water, they had little to fear from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">worst storms they were likely to encounter. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried a thousand passengers and a large crew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VISITATION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">217</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not only to handle the elaborate machinery and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">navigate the vessel, but also to attend to the thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand and one wants of the thousand passengers!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the seventeenth day of September, 1949, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailed from Vancouver on a pleasure tour for which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Shah of Iran had been chartered. We were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch at San Francisco, Manzanillo and Panama</seg><seg type="columnLine">before striking across the Pacific for Sidney. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">voyage was uneventful until we left the Isthmus</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were three days' journey southwest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galapagos Islands. I was standing on the bridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my chief officer, a fine fellow named Ian Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fane, you knew him, Benedict.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun was rising. Ian and I were discussing</seg><seg type="columnLine">some matter relating to the navigation of the ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a sailor came running up the steps and, touch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his cap, as was the custom in those days, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Beg pardon, Sir! There's something wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the sun!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ian McFane and I both looked to the East and</seg><seg type="columnLine">both cried out in astonishment. Exactly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">centre of the golden disc was a round spot. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot was perfectly black and about one-quarter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent diameter of the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you make of that, Mr. McFane?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I hardly know, sir," replied the mate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's too big and black to be a sun-spot and, besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's moving!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sure enough, as we watched the spot, it crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly to the edge of the sun and in about ten min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes had left the disc altogether and vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is some opaque object between us and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some new kind of plane, maybe," suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I "I doubt it, Mister," I replied. "It simply van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished when it left the solar disc and that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">show that it's outside the atmosphere. More likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big meteorite."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If that was a meteorite and it hits the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we're going to know it!" said Ian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, don't start that idea circulating among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers," I replied. "We don't want a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">sized panic on our hands and, anyway, we may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely wrong in supposing that it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteorite."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My warning proved to be useless, for when I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended to the promenade deck, I found many of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers gathered in groups, discussing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange phenomenon, which had been seen by sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral early risers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thehews of the curious black spot on the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread like wild-fire and as soon as I made my ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance I was surrounded by a group of pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sengers, clamoring for an explanation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen," I said, "but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am as much at a loss to explain the spot as your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves. I can only suggest that it may have been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, very cjense cloud."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But that wouldn't explain why it vanished when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it passed off the face of the sun," objected one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ladies. "Oh! here comes Professor Smithton!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He'll be able to tell us all about it," and the group</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke afray from me and re-formed around the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">famous astronomer and physicist, who had just ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rived on deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF course, I knew that my theory of a dense</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud was ridiculous, but I was anxious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoid any suggestion that might cause alarm</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the passengers. A panic is a nasty thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to handle and would have reflected seriously upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">my management and indirectly upon the shipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">company.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I walked across the deck in time to hear the Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor giving his opinion in his best lecture-room</seg><seg type="columnLine">style. He had not seen the spot himself, so he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">obliged to base his judgment upon the descriptions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the few who had been on deck at the time. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened to all carefully and then said, laughing:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I have no doubt that this spot on the sun seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">very mysterious to all of you, even you, Captain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the explanation is, after all, extremely simple."</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a murmur of surprise followed by de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mands for enlightenment.,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The spot you saw was simply a parachute de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scending from an aeroplane flying at a height so</seg><seg type="columnLine">great that it was invisible. The spot was oval</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than round, was it not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again there was a babble of voices, some saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the spot was distinctly oval, others that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite round. When there was silence, the Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued, apparently quite deaf to any evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">that did not fit in with his preconceived theory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah! Quite so! Distinctively oval," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Due to the angle of vision, of course," and rub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing his hands together with the air of a man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">has cleared away all possible doubt, he disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the saloon and was soon engrossed in a hearty</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast, an excellent example which all the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sengers followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So that's that!" remarked Ian, who had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">up during the discourse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," I replied, dryly, "at least it would be if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a parachute! Fortunately for the profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor's • reputation for scientific infallibility, no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">except ourselves seems to have noticed that the spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the sun at its upper edge. If anyone has in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vented a rising parachute, I haven't heard of it!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Throughout the day, the Shah of Iran continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">to plough her way southward through an ocean as</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth as the proverbial sheet of glass. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather was perfect, although the heat was oppres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive, but that was to be expected during a calm</seg><seg type="columnLine">just south of the equator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the late afternoon a slight swell manifested</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, getting gradually heavier until at sunset th^</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamer was perceptibly pitching, in spite of hef</seg><seg type="columnLine">gyroscopic stabilizers. The air was still motionless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only breeze being due to the speed of the ves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sel, and the sky was absolutely cloudless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went to my cabin early and turned in, but could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not sleep. An oppressive sense of impending dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aster descended upon me like a pall, and resisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">all my efforts to shake it off. At last I rose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed. I went out on the bridge, where I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ian McFane talking to the officer of the watch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gordon Caswell, the third mate. Both were look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up at the sky, where the stars were sparkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">with tropical brilliancy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">218</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm glad you came out, sir," said Ian, "but what</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the trouble?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I couldn't sleep," I exclaimed. "The heat, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It sure is hot, even for the tropics," said Cas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you two looking at?" I queried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's something funny about the stars," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied Caswell and he pointed up towards the West.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following the direction of his finger, I saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galaxy or Milky Way, as it is commonly called,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining like a belt of silver spray across the vel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vety sky. About fifty degrees above the horizon</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared a perfectly circular patch approximately</seg><seg type="columnLine">three times the diameter of the moon. Within this</seg><seg type="columnLine">area, the stars of the Galaxy were blotted out, giv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing exactly the appearance of the Coal Sack, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious vacant space which has been familiar to as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tronomers for centuries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you think it is, sir?" asked Ian. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot we saw this morning?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It looks unpleasantly like it," I said, "and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">also looks as though my theory of a huge meteorite</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a wandering asteroid were correct."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If so, it must be moving with tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed," said Caswell. "It has doubled in size dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the half hour that Mr. McFane and I have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't like the looks of it!" I said. "If that</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing hits the sea anywhere near the boat, there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to be one gosh-awful explosion! Mr. Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fane, will you kindly have all hands called on deck.1</seg><seg type="columnLine">And quietly, please. Tell the Chief Steward to post</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in all doorways and corridors to keep the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sengers below decks in case of accident. Tell them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use tact and avoid a panic at all costs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In ten minutes my orders had been carried out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the entire crew were standing by, waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">■--we knew not what!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The swell of the afternoon had increased rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to huge proportions, but the waves were so long</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unbroken that the Shah rode them with ease.</seg><seg type="columnLine">McFane, Caswell and I stood on the bridge watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that ominous disc in the sky spreading until</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had blotted out fully one-eighth of the stars in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the southwestern quadrant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the edges of the black circle were sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by an awful halo of flame. Far quicker</seg><seg type="columnLine">than I can describe it the whole surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteor, if that was what it was, had turned to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white heat, so intense that we were blinded by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare. As the visitor from interstellar space tore</seg><seg type="columnLine">its furious way through the hundred miles of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere, the whole expanse of ocean became as</seg><seg type="columnLine">light as day. Great streams of molten lava shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in every direction and yet, most ghastly touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all, absolute silence reigned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The blazing meteor struck the sea exactly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon, that is to say about twenty miles away. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a momentary glimpse of a fearful column of</seg><seg type="columnLine">boiling water, wreathed in clouds of steam, hurling</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself towards the zenith and then--darkness!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the breathless silence my voice rang out:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hard a-starbo'd!" and the great ship began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">swing around in order to place her stem towards the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">point from which I was sure the inevitable danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">must come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then came the NOISE!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NO words of mine can hope to describe the fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful bellowing tumult of that explosion. First</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the shrill shriek produced by the brief passage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the meteor through our atmosphere. Following</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was a roar as if all the artillery of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">armies and navies of that unhappy old world of ours</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been fired simultaneously and the sound multi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied a thousand-fold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every man whose position exposed him to the di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rect force of the blast was hurled to the deck and</seg><seg type="columnLine">many were injured. Cries of pain from the deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and screams of fear from the staterooms were</seg><seg type="columnLine">mingled with the continuous, soul-shattering blasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of noise as the white hot meteor uttered its indig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nant protests at being sunk in four miles of salt</seg><seg type="columnLine">water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And last came the storm!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As when a boy casts a pebble into a pond to watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ripples spread, so when the hand of fate cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the greatest pond on earth, a pebble forty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">in diameter, ripples fled out in all directions. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">these ripples were walls of water a hundred feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">height and moving with incredible rapidity!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment the vessel was caught up and hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastward with the speed of an express train. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">vain her powerful screws beat the water in a brave</seg><seg type="columnLine">endeavor to stem the force of a two hundred mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurricane! We were helpless and could only trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the mercy of God, the strength of steel plates and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knowledge that hundreds of miles of open sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay between us and the coasts of South America.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You know, Benedict, that there has been a pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vailing impression for the last ninety years that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deelathon arrived from the realms of space upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meteor, whose shattered fragments now form an</seg><seg type="columnLine">island in the Pacific. We who could have contra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicted that idea were pledged to silence, but no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had witnessed that hellish globe descend from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavens and the tempest that followed it, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have believed for a moment that any living being</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have survived such a cataclysm. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For five hours we drove before the storm. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellow of the cooling meteor had long since died</seg><seg type="columnLine">away in the West, but was replaced by the tumult</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wind and waves. It would take too long to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you all the terror of that awful night. A dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">times it seemed impossible that we could remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">afloat another moment and a dozen times the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just before four o'clock the waves died down as</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly as they had arisen and the Shah of Iran</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested on an even keel in smooth water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rain still poured down and the roar of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempest could be heard, as it were, far overhead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The darkness was stygian and it was impossible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see more than a hundred yards in any direction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even with the aid of the Shah's powerful search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. I untied the rope with which I had lashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself to the bridge rail and staggered over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">McFane.	j</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's pretty obvious that we have been driven by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some miracle into a sheltered harbor on the South</seg><seg type="columnLine">American Coast," I said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VISITATION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">219</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If that's so, sir," replied Ian, "it's a miracle in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, and that's not the only miracle," said Cas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well's voice.

I said. "Mr. Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fane, please have a sounding made and if we're in</seg><seg type="columnLine">shallow water, as I suspect, drop anchor. We don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to drift on the rocks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time these instructions had been carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, the storm outside had somewhat abated, but as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tumult of the wind became less, I noticed a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuous roar which at first I attributed to breakers</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the rocks outside the harbor. On glancing at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">compass, I was surprised to find that the sound came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the west; the probable direction of the land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In about an hour, the noise of the wind had died</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a whisper and then the roar from the west be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came very noticeable. Caswell, who had remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the bridge, called my attention to the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sound was practically steady and therefore could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be breakers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, we shall have to wait for daylight to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it is," I said. "I'm going down now to see how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passengers have stood the racket. Call me if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see or hear anything unusual."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I found the passengers huddled in the main sa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loon, most of them showing evidence of the severe</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain to which they had been exposed, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship's doctor reported that aside from one broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm and a few bruises, there were no injuries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've certainly got to hand it to Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smithton, sir," said the Doctor. "He did more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of us to keep the crowd under control. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as cool as if he were in his class room."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having given orders for coffee and biscuits to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">served as soon as possible, I was going from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">group to another with assurances that all danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now past, when the fourth officer came hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riedly down the stairs and told me that Mr. Caswell</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted me on deck at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS I reached the deck I saw that dawn was break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. The curtain of rain had been withdrawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">and 1 was able to take in at a glance the extraor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinary chance to which we all owed our lives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Shah was lying peacefully at anchor in a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">bay surrounded by sheer, black cliffs which seemed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dim light, to tower to a height of at least a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet on all sides. The harbor was shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a pear, with the narrow part--the stem--to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards the open sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The steady roaring sound still continued and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to come from a point in the cliffs directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite the entrance to the bay, which was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mile across at its broadest part. The width of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "stem" was certainly not above a quarter of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile and you will understand my feelings, Benedict,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I tell you that the sight of that narrow gap</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the beetling cliffs literally turned me sick! We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had all been under too great a strain all night, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize our plight clearly, but the thought of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have happened if ye had missed that narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went up on the bridge and joined Caswell. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to make some remark on the providential</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance which had brought us safely into the, harbor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I saw that he was paying no attention to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but was gazing intently to the westward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the trouble, Mr. Caswell?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, sir, I don't know if the light of that meteor</seg><seg type="columnLine">has affected my eyesight, but would you mind telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">me how we got in here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            CHAPTER II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">            Imprisoned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STARTLED at Gordon Caswell's strange ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, I followed the direction of his gaze and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw with amazement that the entire breadth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the harbor mouth was bridged by a natural break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, against which the waves from the open Pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cific were bursting in columns of spray. No open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was visible in the reef and I was completely at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a loss to answer Caswell's question as to how we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had crossed it. A steamer of thirty thousand tons</seg><seg type="columnLine">does not fly and even allowing for the height, of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves, it was hardly conceivable that we could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been washed over the reef without grounding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There must be an opening somewhere, Mr. Cas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well," I said. "When you have had breakfast and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's lighter, please take number three launch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">explore the reef."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While the second officer was away, the passengers</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to throng the decks and many were the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressions of wonder at the remarkable harbor into</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we had so providentially been carried. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">black cliffs, which lost none of their height with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">increasing light, were not smooth but broken by ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tical seams at regular intervals. The whole scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">reminded me of some picture I had seen, I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell where. It was Ian McFane, whose birthplace</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in northern Scotland, who remarked on the close</seg><seg type="columnLine">resemblance between these cliffs and the basaltic</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation of the famous Fingall's Cave in the He-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brides. The vertical clefts we observed were indeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spaces between huge hexagonal columns extend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the surface of the water to the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs without a break, giving the semblance of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic temple built for some ghastly cult of devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">worship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The water was almost without a ripple and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tier of thousand foot columns unbroken, except at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point from which the thundering roar still came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here appeared a gap, forming a narrow gorge, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mirror-like surface of the sea was broken by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable stream which cascaded over broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocks of basalt. It was apparent that the roar we</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard came from a huge waterfall, hidden from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight in the recesses of the canyon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Caswell returned at noon. His report only served</seg><seg type="columnLine">to increase our bewilderment. With three of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, he had landed at the base of the cliffs where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">southern end of the reef abutted against them. Or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering the launch to follow them at some distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the rocks, they had walked northward along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the broken tops of basaltic columns similar to those</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which the cliffs were composed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About half way along the reef they were stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a torrent of water flowing across the barrier into</seg><seg type="columnLine">220</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the open sea, and were obliged to signal to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">launch to pick them up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Landing again at the northern end of the reef,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they walked back to the central stream without find-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing any trace of an opening. The stream was too</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">narrow to permit the passage of such a vessel as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Shah, even had the water been sufficiently deep,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which was obviously not the case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They crossed the reef, which was about two hun-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dred yards in width, and looked out upon the open</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Pacific, still heaving in long rollers; the aftermath</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the storm of the previous night. They returned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the Shah completely nonplussed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Having listened to Caswell's report, I thought it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">best to take the passengers into our confidence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mounting the orchestra platform in the grand sa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">,'loon, I made a short speech in which I stated that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Shah of Iran was imprisoned in a land-locked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">harbor. How she got there I could not explain, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it was impossible to get her out with anything</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">short of dynamite, which naturally we did not pos-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There is no possible cause for alarm, ladies and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gentlemen," I said. "The Shah is provisioned for a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">long voyage and is perfectly safe in this bay. As</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">soon as the necessary arrangements can be made, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will send an expedition inland to the nearest settle-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment which affords telegraphic or radio facilities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Our own radio is, unfortunately, damaged beyond</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">possibility of repair. In a few weeks at the latest,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a relief boat will arrive, bringing the necessary</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">explosive to release the Shah, and I think I can</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">promise you all some entertainment when the blast-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing begins. In the meantime I hope everyone will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">make the best of a bad job."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was some applause and when it subsided,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Professor Smithton arose and asked for permission</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to question the Second Officer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Will you kindly describe the nature of the beach</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">along the barrier reef, Mr. Caswell," said the Pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fessor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The fact is," said Caswell, "there is no beach of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">any kind on either side of the reef. The rocks go</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">straight down into the water."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "One more question," said the Professor. "Do</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the ends of the reef lie conformably against the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cliffs? I mean," he explained, smiling at Caswell's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">evident bewilderment, "do the rocks fit closely to-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gether?"	s':</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">j "No, sir, they do not," he replied. "They are very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">much broken up at both ends."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Ah! Quite so!" ejaculated the Professor with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Y	satisfaction. "I think I can explain the mystery of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">i our arrival, even if I did make a slight, though per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fectly excusable mistake about the parachute," and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he smiled blandly at his audience. "When the Shah</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">entered the harbor, the reef was not there!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">v "Not there?" I exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Quite so. The absence of beaches and the uncon-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">formable--excuse me, I should say broken condition</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the ends of the reef show that it was recently</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">raised above the water. The parachute--beg par-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">don, the meteor was apparently about forty miles in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">diameter, judging by the area of sky it obscured</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when it touched our atmosphere. If its composition</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were similar to that of most meteors, it would weigh</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the neighborhood of fifty million million tons. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is hardly to be expected that such a missile could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strike the earth at a velocity of perhaps three hun-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dred thousand miles per hour, without causing wide-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spread seismic disturbances, which would flow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through the solid gloBe in ripples from the point of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">impact. It is these ripples which were mainly re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sponsible for the storm, which may be regarded as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a series of tidal waves, and it was these ripples,'or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rather one . of them, which raised the barrier reef</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">•and cut us off from the ocean--fortunately, after we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">entered the bay!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Professor was going on to enlarge on his sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject when the Quartermaster entered the room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up to where I was standing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Beg pardon, sir. Mr. McFane told me to tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the ship is sinking."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR the second time we came very near having a</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious panic. I rushed on deck but could see no</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs of anything to give basis for Ian's message.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In reply to my questions he informed me that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone down into the launch, which was still floating</seg><seg type="columnLine">alongside, to get some specimens of basalt which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Caswell had brought from the reef. While there, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that the Shah was floating nearly a foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper than when she left port. He had given orders</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have all compartments examined for a leak be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore reporting to me, but could find nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile the excitement among the passengers</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fast getting beyond control when the Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">began waving his arms and shouting for silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ladies and gentlemen! There is no cause for</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm. The Shah is perfectly safe, as I hope to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove in a few minutes. Captain, will you kindly</seg><seg type="columnLine">have one of your men draw a bucket of sea water."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I nodded to Ian to have the request carried out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Professor disappeared into his stateroom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">returning in a few moments with a wooden case</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which he took a thin glass tube with a bulb at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one end. He dropped this into the bucket of water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it floated upright. Having examined it care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully, he straightened up and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah! Quite so! It is not the ship that is respons-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible for this unwarranted alarm, but the sea. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal specific gravity of water is, of course 1.00,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while that of sea water is about 1.031. Now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">specific gravity .of this water is only 1.014, so nat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urally the ship has settled."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what could possibly cause such a state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs, Professor?" I demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah! Quite simple, Captain. The sea water has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been cut off by the reef, leaving the shallow harbor</seg><seg type="columnLine">land-locked. There is a tremendous amount of fresh *</seg><seg type="columnLine">water running into the bay from that canyon at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">western end and it is forcing out the salt water over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reef, as Mr. Caswell told us. Naturally the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">is settling and will continue to do so--and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a dramatic pause. "--for about six inches fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther, when the water will be entirely fresh."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Needless to say, the Professor's stock, which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumped after the "parachute" fiasco and made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick recovery during the meeting in the saloon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">went sky high as the result of this second example</seg><seg type="columnLine">of scientific acumen. Indeed, I was so much im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed with Prof. Smithton's versatility, common</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense and unfailing good nature, that I invited him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to attend a conference of the officers to be held that</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VISITATION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">221</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon for the purpose of laying definite plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">for sending out a relief party.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the Professor's suggestion, I also asked two</seg><seg type="columnLine">young men named Alderson and FitzGerald; athletic</seg><seg type="columnLine">young fellows, both members of the English and</seg><seg type="columnLine">American Alpine Clubs, who were enroute to New</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zealand to attempt the ascent of an unclimbed peak</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Southern Alps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When these three passengers and the officers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered in the smoking room, I made a brief out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of the situation and asked for suggestions, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaining that the important thing was to get in</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch with civilization as soon as possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Professor rose and asked if I could state the</seg><seg type="columnLine">approximate location of the Shah and whether it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be better to send out a relief party by sea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than by land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am afraid that it is impossible to give a satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">factory answer to your first question, Professor. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no way of determining how far North or South</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were carried by the storm and the heavy pall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds makes an observation out of the question."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah! Quite so! The clouds are undoubtedly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">result of the immense amount of steam produced by</seg><seg type="columnLine">contact betwen the meteor and the ocean. I venture</seg><seg type="columnLine">to predict that, on account of the great size of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteor, which would preclude more than a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">portion being immersed, these clouds will continue</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a long period of time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With regard to sending out a party by sea," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued, "I had thought of that possibility, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside from the great difficulty of transporting one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the launches across the reef, there are two serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">objections to that plan. One is that the sea is too</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough for a small craft to navigate in safety and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other is that all our launches are electric and</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended for short trips. The storage batteries</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not last for over a couple of days at the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah! Quite so!" said the Professor. "Then I ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture to suggest, Captain, that you send a party on</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore at the mouth of the river, tomorrow, and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termine the feasibility of reaching the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs. I foresee that the presence of a waterfall</seg><seg type="columnLine">might prove a serious obstruction. Here is where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountaineering skill of our two young friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Alderson and Mr. FitzGerald, will be invalu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. If the cliffs are successfully surmounted, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can then arrange the personnel of your party and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the necessary outfit of provisions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Professor's suggestions met with unanimous</seg><seg type="columnLine">approval. No sooner did the result of our confer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence become known than a number of the passengers</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked my permission to accompany the proposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">expedition. Thus it happened that a large and light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearted party crossed the strip of smooth water that</seg><seg type="columnLine">separated us from the shore and set foot on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow beach just north of the mouth of the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Coming of the Deelathon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ACCOMPANIED by the Professor and the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountaineers, I led the way inland; Pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently we approached the point where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river made its way through the wall of cliffs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning sharply to the north, scrambled over masses</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of fallen rock into the entrance of the canyon, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of falling water growing louder as we advanced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above the fallen rock we turned to the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">around a magnificent group of the hexagonal basalt</seg><seg type="columnLine">columns and the words of some remark I was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make, died on my lips in sheer wonderment. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were confronted with a sight which, for appalling</seg><seg type="columnLine">grandeur is probably unequalled anywhere on earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We stood on the edge of a vast, cup-like depres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion in the rock. On every side towered the pillars</seg><seg type="columnLine">of basalt, as smooth and perfect as though they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been carved and polished by the hand of man. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the farther side of this huge theatre, the river de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended from the brow of the cliffs in one mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand-foot leap, to strike squarely on the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great cup, which was filled to the brim with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">churning mass of foam, while the deafening roar of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tortured waters echoed and re-echoed from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black walls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So tremendous were the cliffs that we stood, as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, at the bottom of a circular pit and the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">that filtered down from above was but a dim simili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude of day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long time we stood transfixed with awe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the other members of the party gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined us, their laughter quenched by the wonder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sight that met their gaze. As our eyes became</seg><seg type="columnLine">more accustomed to the half-light, we were able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that it was only around the rocky margins of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pool that the water was beaten into foam. The en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire centre was occupied by a mass of water per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly smooth and piled up like a dome of glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first sight this central mass seemed motionless</seg><seg type="columnLine">but we soon realized that its whole surface was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">playground of titanic forces. The entire structure</seg><seg type="columnLine">quivered as though it were in a state of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicate equilibrium, as indeed it was, and it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though one had only to throw a pebble to see it</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissolve in a slather of foam, like a giant bubble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently the voice of the Professor broke the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm a old man, Captain, and in my time I've seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glories of the starry heavens as perhaps few</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done, but I thank God that He has spared me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see this!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought the great snow peaks were the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful things in creation," said FitzGerald, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">this has got them all beat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And look at the light, Fred!" exclaimed his sis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, who had joined us. "It's like all the opals in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world rolled into one. Or rather, like a soap bubble</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the point of bursting, for these colors move."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss FitzGerald's exclamation brought us to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">realization that this water was not like other water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but seemed to glow with an effulgence of its own.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Streamers of light of every imaginable color darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there over the shining surface of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome, now blending into masses of rose or green or</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet, now mingling in a glittering confusion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rainbow hues.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, we knew that we were looking at some</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarkable natural optical illusion, caused by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflection of the light from above, but the effect was</seg><seg type="columnLine">none the less impressive. The living, shining dome</seg><seg type="columnLine">of color, set in its girdle of snowy foam; the silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs with their ebony towers; the thundering col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umn of water eternally descending from above; all</seg><seg type="columnLine">222</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">combined into a dramatic whole whose overwhelm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing grandeur was foiled by a broad band of emerald</seg><seg type="columnLine">green turf which framed the central cup and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dotted here and there with graceful palm trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose fronds glistened with diamond drops of spray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last I tore my eyes from that living opal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the two mountaineers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, gentlemen, what do you think of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances of getting out of this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hopeless!" replied Alderson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Absolutely I" agreed FitzGerald. "We're by way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of being mountaineers, but we're not flies! There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a handhold anywhere. But, good Lord! What's</seg><seg type="columnLine">that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At his cry of surprise, we all looked up, to behold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">poised in the air above the rim of the waterfall, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great ball like a gigantic soap bubble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your parachute, I guess, Professor!" said Cas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well slyly. "Look; it's coming down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VERY slowly the ball descended into the abyss</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now we realized that it was far larger than</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had at first supposed. It was apparently made</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some transparent material like glass, except that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it glittered with the same play of colors as that</seg><seg type="columnLine">which appeared on the surface of the pool. Around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the centre of the balloon, if balloon it was, was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad band of some metal, such as copper or gold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This girdle formed the equator and at either pole</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a projecting boss of the same metal, from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were suspended by cables, inverted cups which hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">some distance below the globe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the strange aerial visitor drew nearer we saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the equatorial band was studded at intervals</seg><seg type="columnLine">with circular windows of the glassy material. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the centre of each of these projected a long needle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purpose of which we could not guess unless they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were for directing the course of the vessel--a theory</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we afterwards found to be correct.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Very slowly the great ball sank until the two cups</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the grassy sward about three hundred yard3</seg><seg type="columnLine">from us. Still it sank, the cables from which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cups were suspended being withdrawn into the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal bosses, until the lower edge of the central</seg><seg type="columnLine">girdle was but a foot above the ground. Here the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining sphere hung, swaying gently in the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rose from the churning water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later one of the circular windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung open and a figure stepped down upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass, followed by several others. They started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk around the margin of the pool towards us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they drew nearer the Professor exclaimed in sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Heavens! They're Indians! Look at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">headdress!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't worry, Sir Charles," I said. "We're</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed," and I drew my revolver from its holster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as I did so I had a curious sensation that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">warlike act was a gesture absolutely without mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh! I wasn't afraid," replied Sir Charles, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they haven't got any--I mean, they're rather lightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad for polite society, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The group from the sphere were now near enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me to see that Sir Charles was correct. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were five or six men and two women and each wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a great headdress of what seemed to be white</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">feathers. I also realized that these were no Indians.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The color of the skin which had at a distance ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared coppery, was now revealed as rosy pink, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">due to the presence of any coloring pigment, but as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the skin were so transparent and the health</seg><seg type="columnLine">so abounding, that the blood literally shone through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I began to agree with Sir Charles that it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be wise for the ladies to retire while we interviewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">these strange inhabitants. I turned to make some</seg><seg type="columnLine">such suggestion and caught sight of Margaret Fitz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerald staring at the approaching party, her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining with excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a burst of admiration from the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sengers, men and women joining in exclamations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">delight at the physical perfection and nobility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenance of these splendid beings who were now</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a few yards from us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The party came to a halt and one of the tallest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men stepped forward and saluted us with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious but graceful gesture. As he did so I real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized with a distinct shock that what we had taken to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a feather headdress was not a headdress at all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but was a semi-transparent, membranous frill, actu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally growing upon the heads of these beings. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">frill or "thonmelek" as we afterwards learned was</seg><seg type="columnLine">their word for it, ran across the forehead just in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the hair, down each side of the neck, over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shoulders and terminated just above the elbows,.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know of nothing which it so much resembled as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fin of a flying fish, except that the "thonmelek"</seg><seg type="columnLine">was infinitely more delicate, but it was supported</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon blades of cartilage in much the same way. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">this we absorbed at a glance and then the tall man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently the appointed spokesman of the party, ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Deelarana, Deelathon zeloma ek tara!" and rais-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their hands in the same graceful gesture, all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others echoed "Zeloma!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Zeloma!" exclaimed Sir Charles. "I say, Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain, it sounds as if they were giving us a salute of</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcome."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I agree with you," I replied, "and they all</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the kindliest smile I ever saw on human coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenance. I am certain they mean us no harm."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned back to the tall stranger with the inten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of trying to convey our friendliness to him, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of signs, when his lips opened and he said in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most perfect English, without a trace of accent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I welcome you. Us, the Deelathon, mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">no harm. Welcome!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF all the strange incidents of this strange voy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age, I think this was the most astonishing. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrill of excitement passed through the crowd. We,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sophisticated citizens of the twentieth century, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered an unknown country, inhabited by an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known race as beautiful as angels, who wore no</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes, grew a frill on their foreheads, and--spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">English without an accent! True, they spoke it</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanically and not quite correctly, but it \tas</seg><seg type="columnLine">English!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You speak English, friend!" I exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tall man shook his head and smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you understand it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled again and said, "Yes!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, Captain," cried Miss FitzGerald, "this is</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a romance out of a book!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VISITATION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">223</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At these apparently innocent words our visitors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Deelathon (for you will have guessed that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was they) showed their first sign of excitement and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw that their frills or thonmeleks', which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">normally pearly white, flashed with rainbow colors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the surface of the Dome of Water. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls stepped forward and spoke rapidly in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft, musical language, several times repeating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word "book."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now it happened that Miss FitzGerald had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought a volume of Emerson's essays with her, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">read while her brother and Mr. Alderson were ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploring the cliffs. She smiled and handed it to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lovely girl, saying:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is a book."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two Deelathon examined the volume with</seg><seg type="columnLine">great interest and then the man handed it back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss FitzGerald with a questioning look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a book," she said.

At a gesture from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader, the Deelathon seated themselves on the grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we followed their example, for an hour, nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the boom of the waterfall and the soft, sweet</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice of the American girl reading to those gods</seg><seg type="columnLine">and goddesses, the words of the great American</seg><seg type="columnLine">essayist, could be heard. At first she stopped at</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervals and looked up, but the Deelathon would say</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly, "Read!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And she continued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, when she had read fully half of the book,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tall man put up his .hands to check her and rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Friends from the sea," he said, "we, the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Thon, welcome you, the speakers of a strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">harsh language, until this moment unknown to us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We ask you to forgive our seeming inhospitality, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course you realize that it was impossible for us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to address you in your own language until we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard it spoken. Therefore I asked this beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">maiden to read from her record, which she calls a</seg><seg type="columnLine">book.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But enough of this matter of speech which doubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less you already know, by the Thon.

I am Toron, maker of Zeeths, and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is my companion, Torona," and he laid his hand</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gently upon the head of the girl who had asked Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">FitzGerald for the book.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To say that we were dumfounded at this fluent</seg><seg type="columnLine">address from a being who, only an hour previously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had said, "Us mean no harm," would be putting it</seg><seg type="columnLine">very mildly. For a few moments we were too as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonished to reply. The Professor was the first to</seg><seg type="columnLine">regain his wits. He rose, bowed courteously, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said: "Strangers, who call yourselves the Deelathon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we thank you for your welcome. I am Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smithton and this is Captain Clinton. We, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">many others, were driven into this harbor by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible storm, and escape has been cut off. There-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore we seek a way inland."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But have you no Zeeths?" asked Torona.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am afraid not," replied the Professor smiling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We do not even know what a Zeeth may be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You do not know?" exclaimed the Deelathon</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, her thonmelek rippling with color.

In less than ten seconds the Zeeth was hover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing above the deck, having come to a dead stop in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">headlong flight, as suddenly as it had started. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">it descended with infinite care until its suspended</seg><seg type="columnLine">cups rested on the after promenade deck where a</seg><seg type="columnLine">space was cleared by the passengers for its recep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the crystal windows swung inward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">next moment Toron stepped upon the deck, followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the girl Torona, whom he had called his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They raised their hands in the Deelathon greeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smiling at the amazed throng of men and women</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that peculiarly radiant smile which is so char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VISITATION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">225</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">acteristic of all these people, they cried: "Zeloma!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Welcome!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now, as you doubtless know, Benedict (said Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Clinton) in the ages before the Visitation, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people of the world and especially of the so-called</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilized areas, were governed in their actions not so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much by reason or intelligence as by custom. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarded as a sign of the most depraved savagery</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wear clothing for the purpose for which it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">designed, namely, warmth, and people wore the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">extraordinary garments, oftentimes hideously ugly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply because they were, as we used to say, "the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion." Early in the twentieth century there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident a healthy tendency to get away from this</seg><seg type="columnLine">bondage of fashion and return to the sensible use of</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing for warmth alone, but it proved to be sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply another phase in the cycle of unreasoning cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom and by the year 1940 the pendulum had swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the other extreme, with the result that people</seg><seg type="columnLine">were again loading themselves with unnecessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">garments as cumbersome and ugly as those of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Victorian Era. The natural outcome of this prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tice was an extraordinary attitude of false shame</seg><seg type="columnLine">with regard to the human body, which is quite in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comprehensible to us today. Nor was this modesty</seg><seg type="columnLine">without its basis in reason, for the imperfections of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the average human body illustrated the meaning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old Greek saying that it was forbidden to walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">the streets of Athens naked, not because it was inde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent but because it was ugly!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  You will easily understand, therefore, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight hundred or more passengers who had not pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viously seen the Deelathon, regarded our story of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">god-like people who wore no clothes, with mingled</seg><seg type="columnLine">feelings of curiosity and disgust. The ladies, espe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cially, listened with raised eyebrows to Miss Fitz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gerald's enthusiastic descriptions of the physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfections of the Deelathon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having due regard to this state of mind I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">some doubt as to the sort of welcome which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be accorded to the visitors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My misgivings were soon dissipated. No sooner</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the Deelathon uttered their words of greeting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">than old Lady Gibson, mother of Sir Charles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very epitome of British respectability, stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward and slipping her arm around Torona's</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist, kissed her on both cheeks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear, you are very welcome to the Shah of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Iran and you too, Sir," and the little old lady looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up nodding and smiling into the radiant face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall Deelathon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Lady Gibson's impulsive action broke the ice and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a moment Toron and Torona were surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with passengers vying with each other to do honor</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the beautif ul visitors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Presently Torona raised her head for silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "My dear companion, Toron," she said, "has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in consultation with the Klendeela and he. has a</seg><seg type="columnLine">message for you. But first I want to thank you all</seg><seg type="columnLine">for your greeting. You Deela Rana, or as you would</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, People of the Sea, are very strange to us with</seg><seg type="columnLine">your unhappy faces and your burden of clothes--</seg><seg type="columnLine">though perhaps that is why you are unhappy. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure it would make me so! But I know we of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deelathon must also seem strange to you, and so we</seg><seg type="columnLine">thank you for your friencPiness.

And she</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw her arm around Miss FitzGerald and kissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They stood there side by side, the American girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Deelathon maiden.

Beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">as was Torona, with a beauty almost unearthly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Margaret was more lovely in my eyes. As you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">have guessed, Benedict, Margaret FitzGerald was</seg><seg type="columnLine">she who afterwards became your great-grandmother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ND then Toron spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Friends," he said, "Torona, my companion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">has told you that you seem strange to us, and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is true, for it is almost beyond belief that any beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">exist who know not the Thon.

Since your Zeeth-which-floats-on-the-sea, will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not float in the air, like our Zeeths, we want to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you that with the greatest of our Zeeths we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">raise your vessel into the air and transport it across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reef at any time you desire. The Klendeela</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinks, however, that you should not leave us until</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have entertained you and, if the Thon permits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made known to you the meaning of that Thon which</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems so mysterious to you. To this end they have</seg><seg type="columnLine">commanded me to ask some few of you to return</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me. Smithton, and you Clinton and the maiden</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the book, and her brother and some few others</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom you may select."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You bring us good news, Toron," I replied, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we accept the invitation of your council.

There you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain as long as seems fit to you, visiting us at</seg><seg type="columnLine">your pleasure and returning to your ship each night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When you desire to leave us, we will lift your ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the sea and you can return whence you came."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The idea of lifting thirty thousand tons of steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">plates and girders bodily into the air might well</seg><seg type="columnLine">have caused more than a qualm of doubt in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds, but such was the complete confidence with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the Deelathon inspired us that I assented to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this amazing proposal without hesitation. The tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous speed of which the Zeeth was capable and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the perfect control with which it was handled re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved all doubt that we might have felt of the abil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity of the Deelathon to carry out this titanic engi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neering feat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having arranged the time at which they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">return in the morning, Toron and Torona saluted us</seg><seg type="columnLine">and entered their Zeeth, which rose from the deck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">226</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and travelling in a tremendous parabola, disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared behind the black columns of basalt. ■</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was little sleep that night for any one. The-</seg><seg type="columnLine">insomnia was produced not at all by alarm at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospects of the morrow, but by the fact that every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one was speculating on the meaning of these strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">events. All felt that we stood on the brink of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">great adventure which was to have a permanent ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect upon our lives. That the Deelathon meant us</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything but good never entered our minds. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lady Gibson remarked to Margaret:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My dear, when that glorious creature Toron</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at me I felt as though I must tell the truth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If I had told even the tiniest white lie, I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have jumped in the sea and drowned myself to hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">my shame!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next morning every passenger and member of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crew was on deck early. At the appointed time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Zeeth soared into view, and accustomed as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were becoming to marvels, the size of this tremen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dous sphere staggered us. It measured fully three</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet around the equator and from either</seg><seg type="columnLine">pole hung huge cables of the same reddish metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was used universally among the Deelathon for</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineering purposes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the Zeeth was hovering above the Shah I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered the anchors to be hauled in and we floated</seg><seg type="columnLine">free. The Zeeth sank slowly until the inverted</seg><seg type="columnLine">cups which terminated the cables hung suspended</seg><seg type="columnLine">level with the mastheads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had anticipated that it would be necessary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spend several days rigging steel cables under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shah in order to provide a cradle to support the</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense weight of the vessel. I had mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">this to Toron the previous day, but he had smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and assured me that no preparations were neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great globe hung poised in the air above the'</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship and then a most amazing thing happened. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight tremor passed through the vessel and it be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to rise slowly towards those inverted cups.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inch by inch rose the great liner, the water cascad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from her bottom plates, until the keel was clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the surface and we hung in mid-air, supported</seg><seg type="columnLine">by some invisible force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cups from which this force apparently em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anated were still separated from the deck by fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred feet and yet the Shah hung securely</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a level keel, so that in the saloon, where dinner</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been laid, not even a drop of water was spilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the filled glasses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly we rose until we hung above the level</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cliffs and then the Zeeth with its enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">burden began to move towards the land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS soon as we became accustomed to our strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation, the rails were crowded with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">throng eager to catch a first glimpse of the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">land. We beheld a rolling park-like country, dotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there with groups of palms and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees. In the far distance we could faintly discern</seg><seg type="columnLine">another wall of black cliffs and beyond them rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">range on range of snow-capped peaks which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">rightly supposed were the mighty Andes. A wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, like a silver ribbon, wound its way from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant snow fields. In the centre of the level area,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which might have been .fifty miles in diameter, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">river broadened into a gleaming lake and then con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued on its placid way, amplified by numerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">tributaries, until it plunged over the cliffs into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Pit of the Shining Pool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we drew nearer, we caught sight of innumer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able buildings, not crowded together into towns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but scattered among the groves of trees. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings, which were of every imaginable size,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all of the same general design, consisting of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ellipsoidal roof of the same glassy crystal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the Zeeth was constructed, supported on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular colonnade of marble pillars. Hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zeeths of all sizes darted here and there through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air and as their occupants caught sight of us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flocked towards us and followed our course until</seg><seg type="columnLine">we seemed to move in a cloud of fairy bubbles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many of the houses were built on the top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">basaltic columns bordering the river and we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see groups of the Deelathon standing or sitting on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the verge of the cliff, watching our progress with</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbed interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we drew nearer to the lake we observed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing on a slight elevation, a very large build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, which we rightly took to be the meeting place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Klendeela or council. This was built on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same circular plan as the dwellings, but was of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vastly greater size.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the Shah of Iran hung above the centre</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lake and the Zeeth gradually sank until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shah was resting once more in her native element.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That afternoon a small Zeeth shot out from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore and landed on the deck. It contained our</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends Toron and Torona, bringing with them a</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendid Deelathon whom-Toron introduced to us</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Rethmar, the head of the Klendeela.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Klendeela is assembled and would be hon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ored by your presence," said Toron. "You, Clinton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the wise man, Smithton, and the fair maiden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Margaret, and her brother, Fred."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We answer the summons of the Klendeela gladly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toron," I said, "because we fully trust you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">are anxious to learn more of your country."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That wish shall be granted," replied Toron. "In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meantime, while you are in consultation with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Klendeela, many of our people will come to your</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship in pleasure Zeeths and take as many of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends as care to go, to their homes; for all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deelathon are delighted to offer hospitality to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitors from the sea."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Torona explained that we were to cross the lake</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their Zeeth and land on the farther shore, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which point we would walk to the assembly hall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order that we might have an opportunity to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the country on our way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rethmar reentered the Zeeth, beckoning me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a smile to follow him. I approached the circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening, not without trepidation, but I was hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared for what took place. I set my foot on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the door, while Rethmar extended a hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">to help me. ,Next instant, I seemed to be falling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All sense of material existence vanished and in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirl of confusion I seemed to be floating in</seg><seg type="columnLine">space. Then I felt the reassuring clasp of Reth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mar's hand and gradually I regained my composure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to find to my astonishment that instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting on the bottom of the Zeeth, I was actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VISITATION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">227</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">poised in space at the centre of the globe, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible means of support.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Rethmar drew me to the side and, slipping</seg><seg type="columnLine">a broad, flexible belt around my waist, fastened it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a catch of some sort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I now perceived that there was one of these belts</seg><seg type="columnLine">midway between each of the crystal windows at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tached to the metal band which encircled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">equator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now another surprise awaited me. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the Zeeth was made of some crystal, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">viewed from without, the globe was quite opaque,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that it was impossible to see the occupants.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When viewed from the interior, however, the glassy</seg><seg type="columnLine">material was so perfectly transparent that it sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply seemed non-existent and one was conscious only</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the equatorial band and polar bosses, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspended in air, without support.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rethmar, having observed the state of mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">aberration which possessed me upon my first entry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated across the Zeeth to the open window and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke to Toron in his own tongue, and I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toron warning the others not to be alarmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Smithton was the next and I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly forbear laughing as the somewhat corpulent</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of the astronomer floated lightly upwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the guidance of Rethmar, who coolly passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the belts around the Professor, leaving him</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspended horizontally above my head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why! Good Heavens, Captain!" sputtered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor. "Wonders upon wonders! Do you real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ize what our extraordinary sensations indicate?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I can't say that I do, except that I feel as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I were having a nightmare and can't wake</seg><seg type="columnLine">up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">«TT7'ELL, well, well!" ejaculated the Professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> W "These people are a thousand years ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us in science, as well as in mental development.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They have overcome gravitation. This transparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance of which the globe is composed is opaque</seg><seg type="columnLine">to gravitation, with the result that it not only has</seg><seg type="columnLine">no weight, but nothing within it--ourselves for</seg><seg type="columnLine">example--has any weight either. Marvellous!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the others entered the Zeeth, each of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shipmates expressing wonder at the unexpected sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation of floating in mid-air. When we were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">secured in place by the equatorial strapsr Toron</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Torona stepped into the Zeeth. The girl sailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly across the globe and slipped one of the belts</seg><seg type="columnLine">around her, but Toron remained floating in the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">and closed the crystal window behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I began to look around for some machinery by</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the Zeeth could be moved, but could see noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing except a small handle in the centre of each win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow. Toron began to turn these handles, propelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself from one to another by slight touches</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the walls of the globe, and I perceived that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the handles were connected to the long needles which</seg><seg type="columnLine">projected from the centre of the windows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a slight shock and I looked downward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The deck of the Shah of Iran was falling away with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous speed and the country opened out until</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could see for many miles in every direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toron manipulated some more of the handles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Zeeth began to move rapidly towards the shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, of course, we were all accustomed to riding</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the old-fashioned airplanes, which had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought to great perfection during the second quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of the twentieth century, but the sensation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more comparable to that of riding in a Zeeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">than falling downstairs is to be compared to sliding</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a snow slope on skis. There was no roar or</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibration of machinery, simply swift, effortless mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and the absolute transparency of the globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and our own lack of weight added to the illusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we were flying through space at our own voli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we flew towards the great building which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen that morning, Toron said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I heard your remark, Smithton, and you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite right in your explanation of the cause for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Zeeth's lack of weight. The globe is composed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of elathongar, an artificial crystal, which, as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, is opaque to gravitation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah! Quite so!" said the Professor, "but I still</seg><seg type="columnLine">fail to understand what force propels the Zeeth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since opacity to gravitation would simply cause it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rise upward from the earth's surface."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The propelling force is contained or rather pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced by the rods attached to these handles. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are acted upon by the Thon-" replied Toron. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">by turning them on their axes the force is up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, or in either direction, as we wish."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Thon again!" exclaimed the Professor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What is this Thon, Toron?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Deelathon smiled gravely. "That I am not</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted to tell you--yet!" he replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now we sank gently to a landing on a grassy</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain near the shore of the lake. We alighted, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed by Rethmar, started up a winding path. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">first we were hampered by the sudden transition</seg><seg type="columnLine">in weight from nothing to one hundred and sixty</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds or thereabouts, but the novelty soon wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">off and we looked about us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everywhere we saw the simple and yet beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwellings of the Deelathon and everywhere we saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same ellipsoidal roof of elathongar supported</seg><seg type="columnLine">by pillars of stone. Later, during our stay ii^ this</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange land, we received and accepted many invi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tations to visit the homes of the Deelathon and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered that both floors and roof were universal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly made of this gravity-shielding crystal, thus re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducing the effort required to accomplish any work</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a minimum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The force of gravity could be adjusted to any</seg><seg type="columnLine">degree desired by means of a sliding panel arrange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, but during our social calls_ these were gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erally kept closed so that we simply reclined in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air and talked! Some of the passengers spent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night in the Deelathon houses and after the perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">relaxation of literally "sleeping upon air," found</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty in sleeping at all on an ordinary bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PRESENTLY we entered a great avenue of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stately palms at the end of which gleamed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white pillars of the assembly hall. Guided by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rethmar we walked up a noble stairway, flanked</seg><seg type="columnLine">by mighty columns and stood in the centre of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendid amphitheatre surrounded by rows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows of marble seats or couches. As we entered we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were again conscious of loss of weight, so that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to float rather than walk across the crystal</seg><seg type="columnLine">pavement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">228</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hundreds of Deelathon, both men and women,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reclined on the seats, but as we entered they all</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose to their feet. There was a rustling sound and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ripple of colored light as .their thonmeleks flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">erect upon their heads. Their hands rose in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deelathon salute and there was a unanimous shout</seg><seg type="columnLine">of:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Zeloma, Deelarana!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rethmar led us to seats at one side of the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">auditorium and then floated to the centre and ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed the assemblage in his own language. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he resumed his seat, Toron rose and began to speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">in English.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Friends from across the sea," he said, "the Klen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deela has asked me to speak for them because I</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone can talk your language freely, thanks to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">maiden Margaret.

When we attempt to pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">far beyond this rock, our Zeeths sink to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.* Neither is it possible for us to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">our country on foot, for we are hemmed in on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side by the sea and on the other by several rows</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unclimbable cliffs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toron escorted us back to the ship and left us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I called the passengers together and having told</seg><seg type="columnLine">them of our meeting with the Klendeela, asked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">volunteers to give the strangest course of lectures</seg><seg type="columnLine">that has ever been delivered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEXT morning and day by day for a week we</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed the lake to the assembly hall where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Klendeela gathered to listen in a silence un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken save by the voice of the lecturer and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rustling of those strange rainbow-tinted frills</seg><seg type="columnLine">which seemed to respond to every emotion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Malone of Yale spoke on ancient history and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Calthorp of Harvard on modern history and</seg><seg type="columnLine">social conditions. Professor Smithton lectured on</seg><seg type="columnLine">pure science and Fred FitzGerald on applied sci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence and mechanics. Dr. Ronald, the ship's sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geon, gave an outline of medicine and I spoke brief-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly on navigation. General Thornton of the U.

Dr. Maxwell of Leland Stanford</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke on psychology and Bishop Brander of Wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ington lectured on comparative religion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus the days passed while those god-like crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures listened with absorbed attention to all We</seg><seg type="columnLine">had got over the wonder of their being able to un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand us. We had become accustomed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange sensations incident to ,the use of the gravi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation shields. But our amazement at the beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">and health and radiant happiness of these marvel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lous beings remained unabated. Could Carlyle</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seen the Klendeela before writing his Sartor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Resartus, he would have hesitated before ridiculing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the picture of a Parliament without clothes!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once only was there any interruption to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady flow of words. It was during the latter part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Professor Smithton's lecture on physics. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">explaining some of the more recent discoveries of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scientists when there was a rustle of thon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meleks, a flash of color and the members of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Klendeela leaped to their feet amid a babble of</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices. In the confusion we could hear the word</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thon" again and again. The excitement sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sided as quickly as it had arisen and after a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">words of apology from Rethmar, the Professor pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded with his discourse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Margaret FitzGerald and I spent all the after-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> *During the Year of the Visitation this difficulty was</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcome and Zeeths now travel over every part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VISITATION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">229</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">noon with Toron and Torona, sometimes reclining</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their Zeeth and watching the glorious landscape</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfolding below us, sometimes wandering through</seg><seg type="columnLine">groves of cinnamon and nutmeg trees, sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting in the crystal dwelling of our Deelathon</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toron talked freely on all subjects and willingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">told us everything we asked relating to the social</seg><seg type="columnLine">and economic life of the people. One subject alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">he avoided, and that the thing we most desired to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know--the nature and meaning of the Thon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were amazed at the perfection of the Deela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thon government and their commercial arrange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, but we were astounded at the extreme sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicity of the social machinery by which all their</seg><seg type="columnLine">activities were controlled. Early in our friendship</seg><seg type="columnLine">I asked Toron if we were correct in supposing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Torona was his wife. Toron looked puzzled for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an Instant and then replied:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes and no, Clinton. When I first met you I</seg><seg type="columnLine">selected the word 'companion' as better suited to</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain our relationship than 'wife.' I feel a mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in your word which is entirely foreign to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">word."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But Torona is not related to you, Toron?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, except as my companion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have chosen each other as mates?"

What you</seg><seg type="columnLine">call a ceremony is a form of words designed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the listeners believe a falsehood or else to</seg><seg type="columnLine">impress upon them something they are not sure of.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therefore, of course, we need no ceremonies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not quite see where the "of courae" came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, but I let that go and followed another line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then there is nothing to prevent you from sep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arating from your companions, as you call them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at any time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing at all!" replied Toron, smiling radiantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Torona.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then divorce must be exceedingly common</seg><seg type="columnLine">among you, Toron," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toron and Torona both burst out laughing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As common as it is for the rose to divorce it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self voluntarily from the tree," said Torona, "or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the silver pathway on the lake to divorce itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the moon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toron laughed again at the blank expression on</seg><seg type="columnLine">our faces and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't you see, Clinton, and you, Margaret, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all your ceremonies and divorces are necessary be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause you are not sure of yourselves.

In fact, as you will learn later, it is im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible for us to make a mistake. Therefore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we choose a companion, it is forever."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another time, as we were hovering over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooded country in Torona's little Zeeth, Margaret</seg><seg type="columnLine">commented on the curious fact that we had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen any sign of burial grounds nor indeed had we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">so much as heard the word "death" mentioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again Toron looked puzzled and then, as was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">custom, replied by asking a seemingly irrelevant</seg><seg type="columnLine">question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How old are you, Clinton?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thirty-six," I answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Years?" was Toron's curious question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," I replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I understand Margaret's question now," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toron, his face bearing an expression as near sad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness as it ever could. "Friends, does it surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">you that I, Toron, have seen over eight hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">summers and Torona over six hundred and fifty!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Surely, you jest, Toron!" I exclaimed. "No</seg><seg type="columnLine">man can ever live to such an age!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And why not?" asked Toron.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because--Oh! because it's contrary to nature.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sickness and old age sap the wells of life and death</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes, generally before a hundred years have</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And we wondered at their unhappy faces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Toron!" exclaimed Torona. "Why, Margaret, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">are many among the Deelathon who have lived not</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight hundred but eight thousand years. We know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you mean by sickness, but no such thing ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ists among us. Neither have we anything which</seg><seg type="columnLine">corresponds to your idea of old age. True, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave our bodies, not because they are worn out, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">because our appointed time has come. Oh friend!</seg><seg type="columnLine">how can you do more than just taste the cup of life</seg><seg type="columnLine">in so brief a space of time as one century?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND then came the afternoon when we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">summoned to meet the Klendeela for the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Our speakers had concluded their addresses</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Professor Smithton summed up their lectures</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an eloquent speech in which he extolled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glories of the civilization of which we were the rep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">resentatives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a brief interval there was silence and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rethmar rose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Friends, accept the thanks of the Klendeela for</seg><seg type="columnLine">your kindness.

Tomorrow, if it shall please you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will take you and all your company, both men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and women, to the Thontara and there, in the pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence of that undying wonder, we will reveal to you</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secret of the Thon, which makes us what we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Glory of the Thontara</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I NEED not tell you in detail, Benedict, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">what excitement we awaited the coming of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day upon which we were at last to learn the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning of the mysterious Thon. Everyone on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shah of Iran had come to love and admire these</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange people with their gentle, courteous ways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their radiant, happy faces, their wonderful health</seg><seg type="columnLine">and almost divine beauty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun rose in a clear sky for the first time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a week, as though to celebrate the beginning of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new era for mankind. Hundreds of Zeeths soared</seg><seg type="columnLine">up from among the trees on the lake-shore and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovered over the steamer. One by one they dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">230</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to the deck and rose again with their quota of</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the ship was deserted and the fleet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystal spheres swooped away seaward, to land</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a grassy plain near the brink of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">waterfall. Rethmar led the way to the edge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs, at the point where the river gathered itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the final plunge, and then we perceived a flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of steps cut in the solid rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We started down, each man or woman escorted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a friendly Deelathon; a company of over two</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand. Rethmar and the professor went first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then Margaret and Torona, followed by myself ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">companied by Toron. As my turn came and I ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached the top of the steps, I noticed that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not terminate at the edge of the river, but en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered instead, a hole in the rocks directly under the:</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall. I should have hesitated, but I caught sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Margaret disappearing into the gloom and plucked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up my courage to proceed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later I stood on a small platform. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">my left was the cliff. On my right, and so close</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I could have touched it, was a descending wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water, thundering into the abyss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other four had disappeared and I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioningly at Toron. For answer, he took my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand and led me forward to the edge of the plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form and then I realized with a thrill of horror</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we stood on the top of one of the basalt col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umns and that the flight of steps continued spirally</seg><seg type="columnLine">down it, being carved out of the solid rock. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no railing of any kind and the idea of walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down that fearsome stairway with nothing but</seg><seg type="columnLine">space and darkness below me and with millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tons of water rushing by, turned me sick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced again at Toron and met his smile of</seg><seg type="columnLine">encouragement. My fears departed and with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand in mine, we started down. Round and round</seg><seg type="columnLine">we circled, now passing close to the wall of water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose roar grew ever louder as we descended; now</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing through little tunnels which had been cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the pillar and the cliff. Looking up, I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see a seemingly endless line of figures circling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty column and looking for all the world like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the processionary caterpillars on the trunk of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pine tree, and once when I glanced hurriedly down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, I caught a glimpse of Margaret's dark hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the gleam of Torona's pink body in the gloom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, with a sigh of relief, I stepped from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of the column to the floor of a great cave,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the famous Cave of the Winds under Niagara</seg><seg type="columnLine">Falls. Margaret and the Professor, with the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deelathon men, were awaiting us and we stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching that silent line of figures creeping slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward, until we were once more united in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great cavity under the waterfall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought our ordeal was over and that this must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the Thontara of which Rethmar had spoken. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wondering how it would be possible for him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reveal any secret to us in a place where the bellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the waters would drown any attempt at speech.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But as the thought entered my mind I saw Rethmar</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing the Professor forward and they began to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">descend another flight of steps, cut like the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the solid rock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following Margaret and Torona, I found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this stairway ran sharply down into a tunnel which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to lead us directly under the fall. The pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage was so low that I could touch the roof with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hand and feel the living rock trembling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tremendous impact of the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still we descended and I saw a faint flicker of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light below me, growing ever brighter and brighter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A hundred more steps brought us to the bottom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and passing through an arched opening, we stood at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last in the Thontara.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the glory of the sight that met my eyes, I ut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered an involuntary cry of amazement and delight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We stood on the edge of a great circular depres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion, which I judged to be about a thousand feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in diameter. Surrounding this depression was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad shelf of black basalt on which we were stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and filling the entire area within this shelf,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a mass of colored light which surged and rip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pled like a sea of rainbows. I have spoken of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">varied hues which were visible on the surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crystal Zeeths. This was the same but intensi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied a thousand-fold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As my eyes became accustomed to the light I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that we were standing on the border of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast circular floor of crystal, so exquisitely trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent that it was like gazing into a bottomless pit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lucent flame. It was long before I could turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes from that sea of fire and look upward, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">when at last I did so, I was greeted by a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I WAS looking at the under side of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome of water which occupied the centre of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pool below the waterfall! This living roof of</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid, seeming as frail as a bubble and yet weigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing under normal conditions no one knows how</seg><seg type="columnLine">many thousand tons, was bereft of its weight by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screening effect of the crystal and hung in mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, motionless and yet in constant motion under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tremendous force of the cataract, its under sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face reflecting, as though in a mirror, the splendor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sea of colored light below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While I had been absorbing the beauty of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural kaleidoscope, the rocky shelf had been filling</seg><seg type="columnLine">with our great company until we were all assembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Thontara. Rethmar and the Professor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone to the farther side and I saw the Deelathon</seg><seg type="columnLine">raise his hand in salute and prepare to speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The roar of the waterfall was almost inaudible</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was replaced by a soft hissing produced by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rapid movement of the liquid roof. As Reth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mar began to speak, his voice •penetrated to every</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of the immense space, reflected from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome by some strange acoustic effect like that some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times heard in old cathedrals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Friends from beyond the sea," he said, "we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought you to this place which we call the Thon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tara, because it seemed the most fitting spot in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which to reveal to you the secret of the Thon. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot have failed to understand that this Thon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is so mysterious to you, is regarded by us as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greatest gift in the possession of man. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">language alone would reveal this to you. We call</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves the Deelathon, 'People of the Thon.' This</seg><seg type="columnLine">living frill upon our heads is the Thonmelek, 'Mir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror of the Thon.' And this glory that you behold</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the Thontara, 'Place of the Thon/ Now, there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VISITATION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">231</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, before revealing to you the meaning of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">word, we ask you to tell us what you have guessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Thon to be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Truly, we have wondered, Rethmar," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor. "Some thought it was the god you wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. Miss FitzGerald imagined that it stood for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Intuition and I guessed it might be Truth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In a measure you are all right," said Rethmar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and yet you have but touched on the fringe of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter. Listen and I will reveal to you all, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret of this mystery. The Thon is the Power of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Life. It is the essence which separates the living</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the dead, the animate from the inanimate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man from the animal and the plant from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone. Through the Thon, we, the Deelathon, are</seg><seg type="columnLine">what we are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We hear your words and they are good, Reth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mar," said the Professor, "but we do not yet under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand how the Thon can benefit us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen again," said Rethmar. "You have told</seg><seg type="columnLine">us of the outer world in which you live and we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">grieved at your story. You claim credit for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conquest of Nature, but it is Nature which has con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quered you. You boast of the perfection of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilization, but you are the slaves of that civiliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion you have created. There is hardly anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">in science which you have told us that we have not</seg><seg type="columnLine">known for centuries, but we use our knowledge in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of permitting our knowledge to use us. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of your fancied attainments, you are in bond-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age to three masters: sorrow, sickness and death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet the key to unlock your bonds is all around</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Nay, more. You, Smithton, have told us that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have known the Thon for forty years and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">not recognized it for what it is!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I!" exclaimed the Professor. "I told you that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You told us," repeated Rethmar, "at the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting of the Klendeela, that forty years ago one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of your wise men* discovered a power that pene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated the densest metals, a power of which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not discover the origin, a power which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">called the Cosmic Ray. ^ This, Friends, is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thon!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Make no mistake!" he went on. "We do not wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship the Thon. One of you has told us how in an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient times men worshipped the Sun, the Source</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Light. But we worship the one God, whom no</seg><seg type="columnLine">man may know. As for the Thon, we know not</seg><seg type="columnLine">whence it comes, we only know it fills all space and</seg><seg type="columnLine">permeates all things. We know that it is a form</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wave motion like light, but whereas light is re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flected by material things, the Thon is reflected by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mind and spirit of all that lives. Therefore, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have called it the Power of Life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have spoken with pride of your elaborate</seg><seg type="columnLine">system of laws, your multiplex religions, your so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cial ceremonials, your great battles in which mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions grapple to the death. Friends, are you so</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind that you cannot see that all these things are</seg><seg type="columnLine">bred of misunderstanding, misunderstanding of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourselves, of each other, of the living universe of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which you are a part? Can you conceive of fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing those you call your enemies if each side could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the other's viewpoint as clearly as his own?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> *Dr. Robert A. Milliken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">&lt;ct HAVE said that the Thon is a form of vibra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion which responds to the life-form or spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of living things. By virtue of the Thon, one mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">beholds another, just as the material eye beholds</seg><seg type="columnLine">other material bodies by virtue of reflected light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus it is that misunderstanding is impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">among us. Thus it is that we are able to under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand you when you speak your own language.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus it is that we need no such laws and ceremonies</seg><seg type="columnLine">and social machinery as that of which you boast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And thus it is that we enjoy perfect health and</seg><seg type="columnLine">happiness because we see, not only the outer shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">-as you do, but also the living mind that resides</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the shell, as you would say."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "But tell us, Rethmar," said the Professor, "if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you thus see the mind within the body, why is</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech necessary, since your thoughts must be Vis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible to one another?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "First let me say, Smithton, that the mind is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not within the body, but the body within the mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As to your question, it is a reasonable one and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves do not fully understand why it is not as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you say. It seems, however, that the spoken word</seg><seg type="columnLine">is necessary as the vehicle of thought, with us as</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you. But note the difference; when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak, your thought must go through many trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lations before reaching the mind of the hearer, los-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing some of its sense with each translation. First</seg><seg type="columnLine">you must mentally select the words best fitted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">express your idea. Then your organs of speech</seg><seg type="columnLine">must convert those words into vibrations of sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which in turn must act upon the ears of your hearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">and be turned into the nerve-force which reacts</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the brain. Here the word-sounds must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">converted into word-pictures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Is it any wonder that the thought of the speaker</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaches the brain of the listener in a mangled con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition? And it matters not whether the words be</seg><seg type="columnLine">true or false, the hearer cannot distinguish between</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. But with us, the spoken word is simply the</seg><seg type="columnLine">means by which the speaker reveals his thought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hearer. No matter how imperfectly the words</seg><seg type="columnLine">may have been selected, the hearer sees by the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flected rays of the Thon, the actual thought of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaker. I use the word 'sees,' but of course we</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not see the Thon with the eye, but with an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangible organ of the mind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It comes to us as a great surprise," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor, "that the Thon of which we have heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much, should be the medium of a sixth sense and</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be none other than the Cosmic Ray, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we are familiar. We can easily realize that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a people who live under such conditions must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the happiest people in the world. But when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer us the gift of the Thon, Rethmar, you seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to forget that we lack this special faculty which</seg><seg type="columnLine">enables you to visualize the mental images produced</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Thon. You may tell a blind man of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, but you cannot make him see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, Smithton! Smithton! do you still fail to</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand?" said Rethmar, and his voice rang out</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a bugle call to every one of the great circle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">listeners. "This special faculty, as you call it, is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exclusive possession of the Deelathon. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">common to all mankind.

To you, your</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness of the Thon is as natural and com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monplace as your consciousness of light or sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but to us it came as an overpowering revelation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Speaking for myself, for a space my mind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazzled as the eyes of a blind man are dazzled when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he first receives his sight.

A moment later our arms were around</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other and in the presence of that great com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany we gave and received our first kiss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in the light of the Thon we realized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">literal truth of the poet's words:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Our Spirits rushed together,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">At the meeting of the lips."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE is little more to be told.

Who will solve the mystery?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF men on earth today, I alone can give the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete solution. I know what happened to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woodrow Wilson. For I was one of the fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand troops on that vessel when she left; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was on her when she grounded in the Victoria</seg><seg type="columnLine">Desert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We sailed out of Newport News aflame with en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thusiasm and confident that with our knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and abilities, once we reached the plains about Bag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dad, the seat of war, the struggle would be over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">our America triumphant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For we were picked men, young but tried work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers in scientific fields. I had specialized on atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure until at that time, I thought I knew all</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was to know. Remember, in extenuation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my conceit, that I was then but twenty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Distinctions of rank not then having been abol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished, I found myself quartered with three other</seg><seg type="columnLine">sergeants, in a small cabin on the main-deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Woodrow Wilson was one of a fleet of forty-,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven vessels, but by far the largest and fastest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unescorted, for our government had not then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single fighting ship, we were twenty miles out be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore we picked up the first scout-plane. From then</seg><seg type="columnLine">on we knew we would find our route patrolled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">these giant air-cruisers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I suspect that Captain Blucher was under orders</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drive the ship at top speed the entire distance;</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly he showed no concern about keeping with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other units of the fleet. We left harbor at six</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the morning; by noon not a single transport was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in sight; by night we were far south of the latitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Carolina Capes, miles out and driving south-</seg><seg type="columnLine">east through a solitary sea. Our speed was sixty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven knots, a clip our internal combustion turbo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrics could maintain for forty days without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop for fuel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I came up on deck that evening there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, no plane, no land in sight. This pleased me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was lonesome and wanted to be off alone and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ELECTRONIC WALL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">237</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My room-mates were fine fellows. My closest</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend on board, "Slim" Essinger was my bunkmate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Slim" was a psychologist; he really was an expert</seg><seg type="columnLine">on mind, mind-control and mind-reading. Even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">those days mental science was well begun. So there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no need for me to be lonesome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I was. Not only lonesome but sad and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed as well--sorrowing for Lonnie Dove. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted Lonnie, every cell of my being called for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. I could almost still feel her kisses, fresh on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my lips. But I wanted more, much more. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">her physical presence for which I yearned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I then knew love, I was wholly, hopelessly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">love with her. I failed to recognize in the passionate</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire to hold her in my arms, the physical basis of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my love. Now I can see that the "purity" of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">love was but the obsession of a closed mind, physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">calling to the physical as the primitive in man</seg><seg type="columnLine">surges perilously close to the surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I yearned to whisper my longings, to hear in</seg><seg type="columnLine">response, her breathing of "I love you, I love you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oh for loneliness for her and me; a desert isle, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern at the bottom of the sea, anywhere that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be together; together and alone. Alone--</seg><seg type="columnLine">yes, even in my thoughts of her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. I found a sheltered corner by the rail on the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck. There I stood and dreamed, I do not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how long. Certainly not more than an hour, for,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although darkness had fallen, taps was not yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was alone, even the officer in charge had left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bridge for the shelter of the pilothouse. I leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a stanchion gazing off across the sea to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon still sharply cut in the lingering light of</seg><seg type="columnLine">early evening. Above, not a cloud in the sky. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">something in the air ahead and high up attracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wandering attention. Were it not for what hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened afterward, I might question the truth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision. I had time to sense that it wasn't one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our planes, for it was moving toward us at terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. It impressed me as being round, not at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the shape of a plane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then we plunged into fog. At the time I failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to realize the peculiarity of this. Subconsciously I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had noted the broad sea, the clear sky; no sugges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of vapor. Yet of a sudden I glanced up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I could look down the ship was enveloped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It wasn't particularly dense. I could see to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow and to the stern, and to the water below. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted that the officer on watch came out on a run</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the port end of the bridge. I saw his hand rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a lever and at once there boomed out the siren</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the fog signal. Foolish, I thought, if enemies</seg><seg type="columnLine">are about. Yet if enemy aircraft were near, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">scouts would know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I remember rather rejoicing about the fog; in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my present mood it was welcome; it shut me in with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my thoughts of Lonnie. A pleasant shiver of lone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liness passed over me. I gazed down at the rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, which suddenly seemed to be getting farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">and farther away. I rubbed my eyes to brush away</seg><seg type="columnLine">the webs; even then came a whirring roar and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel quivered from stem to stern. I heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer shout into a speaking tube, and the noise died</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once. I had enough of sea experience to recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nize the noise for what it was, the racing of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">propellers. Often in heavy seas, they are rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">out; then it is the engineer's duty to throttle down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engine before the machinery can jerk itself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces by the high speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With amaze written in every line of his figure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the officer stood looking toward where the sea ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be. But no longer was it visible. "What in</seg><seg type="columnLine">blankety blank has happened?" With quick decision</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw him seize an iron pin from the rack and hurl</seg><seg type="columnLine">it outward, listening. And the pin--didn't drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">It merely shot out a short distance, then as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">tied to a cord, came dashing back, striking the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">and coming to rest on the hull a few feet below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck. I was dumbfounded. As for the officer, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped out his watch, examined it in the light of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small lamp on the bridge, and swore. Later "Slim"</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me that it is a result of nervous shock, moti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vated exactly as that which in a woman leads to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time the bugles were sounding "as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembly," and the decks were filling with officers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers. Something had happened and until it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">known how serious it might be, no chances were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being taken. I hastened off to my station, assigned</seg><seg type="columnLine">before boarding the ship, and there met my squad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS far as I could see the men were calm, taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">it as a special drill. There was no sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger. The boat was still, even the vibrations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engines were absent; we rode on an even keel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and save for the fog which hemmed us in, might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been lying at our dock. All perfectly normal--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet, a something above us; and an iron belaying</seg><seg type="columnLine">pin clinging to the side of the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doubtless conferences among officers were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">held in all parts of the ship. My position with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">squad, at the forward doors of the upper deck, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most beneath the starboard bridge, enabled me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear much that was said by Captain Blucher and</seg><seg type="columnLine">others of the ship's officers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "-pumps won't work," the officer of the watch</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was saying as he and the Captain came out on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is he asking for time to repair them?" the Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sir.

The Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">was short; pumps were in the engineer's depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment; MacDee was responsible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The ashes are back?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What? . . .

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed down, then beckened to his First Officer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Steen, look down. You see the sea? No?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fog hides it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sir." The mate leaned far out and pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down.

"I must see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain," he said. I saluted and passed him up on</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the bridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" I saw the Captain turn to meet him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have to report, sir, that since we entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fog, no messages have been received."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Broken down?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sir.

The Captain was turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">away as the explosive utterance unconsciously burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth, forced by his load of responsibility--Ms to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet the emergency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night was a busy one for the ship's crew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As for the troops, it was not long before the ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion relaxed and events were accepted as a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course; about midnight they were sent back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My squad was one of those kept on guard duty</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that I was able to see many of the efforts made</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ascertain where we were, and what was happen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Captain Blucher and our commander, General</seg><seg type="columnLine">Waksheh, exhausted every means. Even when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailors sent down by rope to investigate came up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reported that they could pass under the hull,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was not a sign of the sea, the officers still</seg><seg type="columnLine">persisted with rockets and every other thinkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of communication, to reach one of our air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft. The story the men told of being unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the ship, at first was given scant attention. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe that one could not drop from the deck rail</seg><seg type="columnLine">was asking too much. But after the chief officers</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves had gone over and reported on return</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had walked about the ship's bottom with</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet up and heads down, and could jump down no</seg><seg type="columnLine">further than one could leap up from the deck, every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one agreed that something far outside the pale of</seg><seg type="columnLine">human understanding had occurred. I recalled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">belaying-pin, and the Captain's exclamation, "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashes are back!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One unusual accident occurred during the night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A sentry, thinking he saw something off in the fog,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired at it.

The small-arms experts un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitatingly pronounced it the very bullet dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged from the soldier's rifle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That only made the mystery the greater, for many</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds had elapsed after the report of the gun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the officer was wounded. After more figur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the experts announced that if the gun had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed straight up, the bullet was due to fall again</seg><seg type="columnLine">at about the time the officer was struck. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded well, but the soldier swore positively that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had not pointed the gun away from the vessel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but toward the heavens. Captain Green was sar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">castically as positive that he had not held his leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">out at right angles from his body, the only position</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in which it might be struck and broken by a falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We did not appear to be in the slightest danger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The ship rode on an even keel without motion of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort. There was no breeze and the fog hung about</seg><seg type="columnLine">us without movement. Of sounds, other than those</seg><seg type="columnLine">originating on the ship, we heard none. The gulls</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had followed us from Newport News had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The radio was tried again and again, with no</seg><seg type="columnLine">results save that the private sets on board picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the signals without difficulty. Toward evening of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second day, the staff officers decided to try tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathy, which was new at that time and therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">created much opposition. Those favoring the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt argued that there was nothing to lose, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">telepathy being in "Slim" Essinger's department,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was sent for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SO great was the advance in mental science up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the breaking out of the War of 1938, that be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore we sailed, some of the younger and more pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gressive men in the War Department made prepara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion for the use of thought transference. All offi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cers, both those retained at Washington, and those</seg><seg type="columnLine">despatched, were carefully tested. The minds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all were tuned as to rhythmicity, synchronism and</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmony. In the trials even when the distance be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween attuned minds had been three thousand miles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">reception and dispatch of thought had been a suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess. At the test both radio and wires were at hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">for checking the accuracy; here--no matter what</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Slim" might say, it would be through him, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He didn't say a thing. The effort ended in failure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He tried to send, but reported that he sensed oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sition; and he could get no return.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some hours later we four sergeants were sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the edges of our bunks speculating on where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were. We had been a little south of the Bermudas</seg><seg type="columnLine">when flie engines stopped. I contended that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">-winds would blow us back on the Carolina coast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Slim" was arguing that we'd drift south when sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly he stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ran," he called to me. "Take me to General</seg><seg type="columnLine">Waksheh. Something is coming through." In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">days when telepathy was being mastered, concen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tration was a prime requisite. That "Slim" might</seg><seg type="columnLine">utilize every faculty, I tucked his hand under my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm and started for the General's quarters. "It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">very faint. I don't get it plain, yet," "Slim" told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me as we set out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saluted and when the General asked what I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to report, explained that "Slim" was getting a mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage by telepathy. General Waksheh turned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to the human instrument, waiting in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity, I imagined. In a few minutes my friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to talk. Sharp and distinct were his words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the voice was not that of "Slim" Essinger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> •"Order every man on board out on deck. Fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. No action is contemplated against your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves or the ship. You will be unharmed. Gather</seg><seg type="columnLine">every man; my message is for all." Then in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own tones he added to me, "Lead me out on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It sounded like an enemy. Yet it was but a ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">geant talking. Many an officer on the General's</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ELECTRONIC WALL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">239</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">staff looked his horror. But the General was one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who foresaw the change from the control of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">oligarchy of wealth and position, to a real demo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracy, and he could concede the possibility of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">"non-com" having an idea. Besides, if "Slim" was</seg><seg type="columnLine">faking--time enough to consider that, later. But in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unusual position in which we were, even a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand such as this was worth heeding. We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered to the upper decks. Even Captain Green</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his broken limb, was carried up on a stretcher.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dismiss every fear from your mind," were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first words to us as we stood assembled. The Voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">that spoke was loud and distinct carrying to every</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the decks. Yet in the softness and sweet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the tone *was an authority and friendliness</seg><seg type="columnLine">that begot confidence. The Voice went on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No harm is to come to anyone on this ship. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the contrary, each has been signally honored, as fit</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the most important duty that can devolve upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of humanity. The journey you are being</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken on will last approximately three hundred of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your hours, from the time your trip began. Within</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty hours the fog will clear. When you realize</seg><seg type="columnLine">your position, take joy in the view and have no fear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No man will have seen the like before, so remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">our promise to you. We come not as enemies but as</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends. Again I ask, have confidence in us. Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">reward will be great. You now are to return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">your duties and your places. I have nothing more</seg><seg type="columnLine">to communicate at this time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS I consider what was told us, and the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">really offered, I marvel at the confidence we</seg><seg type="columnLine">manifested in the promises. I can account for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">only by believing that the Voice was hypnotic; this</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of the human voice is not yet established to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the satisfaction of science, yet I venture that within</seg><seg type="columnLine">another generation, or by 2150 at the latest, it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be acknowledged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mathematically inclined on board began</seg><seg type="columnLine">working out destinations. Postulating a speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">equivalent to the Woodrow Wilson's best, they told</seg><seg type="columnLine">us that in three hundred hours we would have trav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">elled nearly around the world. Checking on a chart</seg><seg type="columnLine">with this distance as a radius, got us nowhere, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less we wertf. being led on the grand tour with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">destination, San Francisco.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Others speculated on the "view no man had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">before." As our world had bepn pretty well ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plored by the year 1938, it didn't seem to mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">much unless the old time hollow globe theory</seg><seg type="columnLine">was correct and we were being led up to the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">pole and down inside our earth--as preposterous a</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposition, it seemed, as to suppose that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens above were solid with doors and windows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as in the cosmogony of the Jews of Moses' time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, and to suppose that we were being hauled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up through an open port into the vault above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Friendly curiosity was in possession of our ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even officers of the old school of the first World.</seg><seg type="columnLine">War, and its peculiar ideas of men's relationships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were animated by a democratic courtesy formerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">not noticeable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1 Twenty-four hours passed. The fog still held.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All had been intent for a happening for the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">few hours. The watch became less close as time</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on. Four hours later and a rush of feet on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the planking above our heads apprized us that some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was going on. My own conclusion, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that the fog was lifting. Shouting to "Slim,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come on. It's clearing," I dashed out on the main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everyone was crowding the rail to look out across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea. And--there was no sea. We were alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a great void. In the distance glared a fiery ball,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I knew for the sun. Of the earth or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon, I could see nothing. Yet that is not entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">true, for off at one side was a small round object</seg><seg type="columnLine">which seemed about an inch in diameter and near</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a bright speck. The telescopes on board re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved the larger into our earth, for they revealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the continents distinctly, and the speck into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's satellite--our moon. But just then we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">paying no attention to the planet we had left. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands were raised to point overhead, while their</seg><seg type="columnLine">owners cried, "Look." "There it is." "What is it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a multitude of other exclamations,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It" was the round thing.of my evening experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence. Though I had secured but a glance, I recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized it immediately; and now it was revealed in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">its details. It was slightly greater in diameter than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the length of our ship; nine hundred and sixty-three</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet triangulation revealed as the correct length</seg><seg type="columnLine">from pole to pole. It revolved slowly on an axis</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed by these poles which indeed were projections</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as one might expect to find on a globe built to</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolve on a fixed support. As we afterwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned, these were the work of the inhabitants of</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Paulo" as they called their world. The real pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose of these projecting parts had nothing to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the turning of the globe, but were electrically</seg><seg type="columnLine">combined with an electronic element not yet mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered on earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The poles were a coppery red, a rarified and per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fected element akin to our copper. A median belt</seg><seg type="columnLine">or equatorial region was also constructed of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same material, segmented, with an opening like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">insect's eye, in the center of each segment. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe itself was a shimmering white, shading into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yellow of the spectrum; it had an appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as .a mirror in constant violent motion might</seg><seg type="columnLine">present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly turning, at a distance of not over a thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand feet, the orb hung above us. As though we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the sun and it the earth, its axis had an incli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation somewhat greater than that of our world to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the central body. The purpose of this inclination</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to cut lines of force most effectively, as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were sent from the little world to our ship. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">this that saved us. Out there in space our ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">would almost instantly have been stripped of heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and air. The Woodrow Wilson would have become</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gigantic tomb floating in space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Floating" did I say? Hardly that. Depending</seg><seg type="columnLine">from both poles of the odd planetoid, were lines or</seg><seg type="columnLine">filaments, supporting above our bow and stern, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell-shaped objects of the coppery mineral. About</seg><seg type="columnLine">each of these clung, and continued to cling, all dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing our trip, the haze or fog that had enveloped us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As these never varied from their positions with</seg><seg type="columnLine">reference to the ship, our first conclusions were that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they supported it. Yet logic told me, and doubtless</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others-#-I know "Slim" noticed it--that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be. Ships are built with the idea that</seg><seg type="columnLine">240</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the pressure of water helps stiffen them and hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">their plates or planks in place. A great liner lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the water and placed on supports, one at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">end, would crumple and collapse. Tremendous truss-</seg><seg type="columnLine">work would be needed if the weight at the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to be supported. Yet here was the Woodrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wilson apparently held; and she did not break. Sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral possibilities offered an explanation. One was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that out here in space, millions of miles from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, the attraction of gravitation, which on earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">causes the ship to break, was wanting. Such force</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gravity as our ship knew was in itself--or would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been were not "Paulo" present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ANOTHER explanation: while we could not see</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, there might be lines of attraction, lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erally billions of them, between our craft and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling sphere, so that it would be supported not</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely by the two nuclei at the ends with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible lines of force, but by these others. Both, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">found, were at work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In addition, repellant rays were forcing us away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a push equal to the pull of the attraction. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">equilibrium was cleverly maintained. Also, our ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was surrounded by an invisible sheathing of elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trons, the Electronic Wall, saving our lives. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Electronic Wall served many purposes. It main-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained for us the atmospheric pressure--that of air</seg><seg type="columnLine">at sea-level on the earth--to which we were accus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomed, and without which we could not have existed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was an insulating medium, preventing our heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">content from being dissipated. It shut in our air</seg><seg type="columnLine">of oxygen and nitrogen and it insulated us against</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain undulations--not of light--but such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio. This, of course, explained why we could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">get messages either to or from the Government's</seg><seg type="columnLine">stations. Apparently it also isolated thought rays.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even to communicate with us, the inhabitants of</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Paulo" found it necessary to drop through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wall a minute wire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Wall, and our being insulated from gravity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">save our own, explained the curious happenings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first night--the pin, which came back and clung</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ship's side; the ashes which would not stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">dumped; the men walking head down on the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ship; and the breaking of Captain Green's</seg><seg type="columnLine">leg. As the rifle was discharged away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, no matter in what direction, the bullet had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">return over the same path, with the same velocity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Captain's limb got in the way, that was all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tooled ball above us was an inhabited world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a purposeful world. Over the wire they sent their</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts and "Slim" received them. Through him</seg><seg type="columnLine">we learned something of who they were, and of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">history. We never saw them. I am sure that at</seg><seg type="columnLine">times they visited us on the Woodrow Wilson, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they never passed beneath a microscope's lens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their form and shape are unknown. We do know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had minds and intelligence, and as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">told us, they were, considering the proportionate</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of their world and of ours, as large as we were.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This would seem to be a working out of nature's</seg><seg type="columnLine">laws and would make them 1/586 of an inch in</seg><seg type="columnLine">height. Time for them, we found, was correspond-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly increased, or shall I say diminished? , This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was their chief difficulty in communicating with us;</seg><seg type="columnLine">in comparison with our mental processes, they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thought with incredible rapidity; about 600 thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one of ours. Their ingenuity found a way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach us--mechanical, it is true, depending by an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alogy, on a reversal similar to the method used by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Michelson in measuring the velocity of light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their world, they told us, was infinitely old, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">by our standards. Their records went back for eoiis</seg><seg type="columnLine">on eons beyond our surmised time ages. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed to have witnessed the birth of the sun's</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetary system. Their account but verified the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chamberlain planetesimal theory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long, long ages ago these people--if I may call</seg><seg type="columnLine">them such--passed through our periods of develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment; savagery, barbarism, slavery, serfdom, cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">italism, socialism, into a pure freedom wherein the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one purpose and delight is to know the truth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to serve. If they are to be believed, they live with</seg><seg type="columnLine">no thought for themselves but only that they may</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear succor to inhabitants of other worlds in other</seg><seg type="columnLine">systems and universes. Thus had our ship been</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized; as yet they concealed the purpose from us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Baade, a clipping on whose reported discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery begins this history, had indeed sighted "Paulo."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its movement as observed, led him to deduce a path</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to that of a parabola with aphelion, far beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the othermost planet. Happening to pass within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strong gravitational field of the earth, he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was captured, and hereafter would travel in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an approximately circular orbit about the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was wrong. "Paulo" is free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Baade could not conceive that a ball so small</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be the home of intelligent beings, who con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolled, absolutely, its movements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long, long ago they had discovered the secret of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atom and its electrons, which one hundred years</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago we were just finding. And beyond the electron,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far below the electron as the electron was beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atom, they found other forces. They utilized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the electronic and other energy to the fullest extent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also, gravitation, its causes and effects had long</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased to be a mystery to them, and had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead a servant. With such forces--we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">comprehend some, but not all concerning which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">hinted--what wonder their world had no fixed orbit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They drive it as they will at speeds unimaginable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neither Dr. Baade nor other scientists,; look as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">might, would ever find it in the same position again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Luck alone, had given the worthy Doctor his sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of "Paulo."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, they explained, long ago they had used</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the electronic energy of their world, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">before they had discovered how to control it. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they ran short, they drove their orb to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun or some other similar body, and took on a load</seg><seg type="columnLine">of energy by absorption. "Paulo" and its people</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never die.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were imiriune to extra-"Paulo" effects of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat and cold. Their knowledge enabled them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheath their world with the substance in which elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trons have no movement, but are packed in, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proton one against another. This material by earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">standards, weighs sixty million tons to a cubic inch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mathematics verifies this. In a ball imagined of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such size that an electron is as./ large as an orange</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the proton is a small pea, the radius of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">electronic orbit is about one hundred and fifty miles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Plenty of room for weight when packed full.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ELECTRONIC WALL1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">241</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We found that they blanketed us with the elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tronic fog and rendered it opaque, as a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindness; that we might not be fear-smitten and</seg><seg type="columnLine">worried. They knew our psychology; as we did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the earth fall away beneath us, when it did come</seg><seg type="columnLine">into view it seemed unreal and we regarded it as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hallucination, or a part of a bad dream. Likewise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our being gathered to hear the Voice, was psycho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">logical.

No one was ill; health</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ship never was better. On discovering that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had a man with a broken leg, they sent in new</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays; the bone was knit or built up and in two days</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Green left his couch as well as ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But where are we going?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'T'HE query was on everyone's lips. We did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">A believe we were being carried at a speed great</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to take us to a system outside the solar. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only guess at our rate of travel, but knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun was always with us. Our navigators took</seg><seg type="columnLine">sights but could give no figures as to position or</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed. They were without a fixed point on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">to base a comparison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To what body were we bound? We knew it could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be the earth's moon, Jupiter, Saturn or Mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cury, for all on board had some astronomical knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge. Neither did Neptune nor Uranus seem pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibilities. All were in such physical condition that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we knew earth's inhabitants could not exist on them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While we might be headed for one of the larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">asteroids, or one of the large satellites of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet, majority opinion on board had seized on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus or Mars as our destination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what for?" Sergeant Graham, one of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">room-mates was arguing. "What use will we be on</seg><seg type="columnLine">either of these planets?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe they need more fighters on Mars," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Slim." "I guess a rebellion is going to give the</seg><seg type="columnLine">king his."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps the Venusians want us to teach them</seg><seg type="columnLine">the correct way to hold a harp and sing in har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mony," Sergeant Vessick added.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why suppose the Martians are fighters and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Venusians, love-birds ? Because we named those</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets that doesn't give their ' inhabitants charac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teristics we associate with those names, does it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I, too, had a theory. "Why may we not be needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as teachers for a race lower in accomplishments</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ours, on whom the inhabitants of 'Paulo', have</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken pity?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All guesswork, of course," "Slim" insisted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There are hundreds and thousands of possibilities.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But granting we are to teach, are we to show them</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to make modern weapons, how to prepare poi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son gas? Shall we educate them into the lying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypocritical selfishness we call civilization? Shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">we show them what war is?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps. Supposing they don't know any of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things we do, what will we teach them if not how</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to make them, and how to sell them, so as to get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">profit?" Sergeant Vessick elaborated at some</seg><seg type="columnLine">length; we all entered the discussion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Time passed. There was no day; there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. Watches continued to click off time, but ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the heavens burned a brilliant orb and all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black vault, above, below, and round about, glit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered points of light, some large, some tiny. "Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred hours," the Voice from "Slim's" lips had</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. In that time we could travel to-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some argued that "Paulo" with us in tow could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not travel at as great a speed as did any of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets. But suppose we did: Mercury with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">1,736 miles a minute gave for three hundred hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">of travel, the distance from the earth to Mars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the other hand, others argued that it was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as reasonable to suppose we were travelling at</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice, or ten times that speed. Certain stars have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been determined to be moving at as high a rate as</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten thousand miles a minute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why the careful preparation of the little globe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if not that it may take on almost infinite speed?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">They contended. And why not? Even at a speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of two thousand miles, ten hours before landing we</seg><seg type="columnLine">still would be so far away from our destination that</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably we hardly would realize our approach to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But by the fifth hour from the end of the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">set by our captors, a luminous speck in the sky did</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem somewhat brighter and larger. By the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour it had grown to gigantic dimensions and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next hour it looked as though we were rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">headlong to destruction. Yet we seemed neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">worried nor anxious. Such was the confidence with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the inhabitants of "Paulo" had inspired us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The time limit expired and still we had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the new sphere. Gigantic it lay beneath us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all were scanning it. Glancing up, I noted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a change had come over the tiny world above us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its revolution had ceased and from the ports in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">equatorial girdle extended huge masts, jointed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently telescopic. I jumped to the conclusion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">later verified by "Slim's" unknown informant on</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Paulo," that these were necessary for controlling^</seg><seg type="columnLine">the electronic anti-gravitational force. The method'</seg><seg type="columnLine">is simple; protons, positively charged, are detached,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the electrons, with their negative pull; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">combined push and pull, when controlled, counter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acts gravitational force which is itself protonic in</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was but a short time after this that the trum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pets sounded "Fall in." We gathered on the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">decks where "Slim" awaited us on the bridge, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Voice's final message.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">«TX7E have now brought you almost to your des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">* ▼ tination.

"One hundred days--" I sighed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">regret at such a period of time, so vast, "until I</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer my all to her." And I sensed she was thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same: "Until I can serve him." For already</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mayalovan had reached the stage where service was</seg><seg type="columnLine">synonymous with living.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We found we could communicate with one an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. Even as the earth in 1938 was approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knowledge of thought transference, so in Maya-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lovan this method of communication was an achieve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of past ages. No need' for us to learn the</seg><seg type="columnLine">language of Mayalovan, nor for them to learn ours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thoughts are but pictures, the same in any lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly dragged the hours until the end of the hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred days. During the period of acclimatization</seg><seg type="columnLine">much had happened. No sooner had we left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woodrow Wilson than "Paulo" whirled it aloft and</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, dropping it uninjured, as we later learned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the south pole of Mayalovan. There it rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">until--but I proceed too swiftly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TTTE learned much of Mayalovan. Earth's as-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ▼	* tronomers have slowly been unravelling its</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysteries by deductive processes, which being based</seg><seg type="columnLine">on hypotheses true in the world, did, not, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">apply on Mayalovan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mayalovan has life outside the human; it is en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely of the plant kingdom. Even the bacilli of</seg><seg type="columnLine">decomposition are wanting. Cell life, such as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could determine, was wholly confined to human be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings and to the vegetable kingdom. The green car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pet, to which we descended on leaving the ship, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peculiar moss developed into bearing a nourish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing fruit; this we could see grow and increase in</seg><seg type="columnLine">size as we watched; for in the unprotected open, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">grows, bears fruits, and dies in a single day, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ELECTRONIC WALL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">243</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">peating this over and over during the summer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leaves and stalk, too, are edible. It goes without</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying that Mayalovan is vegetarian. But what of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that? Food is not for sensuous enjoyment; rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">for rebuilding expended bodily tissues. On Maya-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lovan we make no great feasts and eat only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">measured requirements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The polar caps are not as supposed; they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither clouds, nor snow, nor solidified carbon diox-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ide. Instead they are great treble-walled sheets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a light, durable, non-conducting metal, in Mayalo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">van called "amnia." These sheets are put up as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the winter comes on and taken down with the advent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of summer, in a manner that never varies. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate, of gigantic size compared with those used on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, uptilts by mechanical means, slips into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">groove in the soil's surface, and in the hot sun of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the daytime, the fields of moss thrive and grow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Machines and devices undreamed of on earth are</seg><seg type="columnLine">in common use, all made of "amnia," which is con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered the perfect metal. Planting, harvesting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveyance--all are mechanical.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Water, so necessary to plant life, and almost gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Mayalovan, is carefully stored in great "am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nia" tanks in the interior of the planet. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">pumped out as needed through thousands of open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, following artificial channels to the fertile parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mayalovan. On its return it descends through</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocky channels and over precipices until it finds a</seg><seg type="columnLine">conductor-pit. On every stage of its journey it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully guarded. The air is sucked through great</seg><seg type="columnLine">vents and denuded of its vapor. The statement is</seg><seg type="columnLine">made on Mayalovan that our-water will last for</seg><seg type="columnLine">ninety million years before it is all used up. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">bother about one's descendants ninety million years</seg><seg type="columnLine">hence ? Ah, that is what the service concept means.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not for one's self, but for others," born and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">born.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the water is stored in the interior recesses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet, there, too, well-lighted, warmed and ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tilated by artificially renovated air, are the homes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mayalovan. On the surface only old ruins, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost disintegrated, show. To these I must except</seg><seg type="columnLine">the covers which top the vents of the inlets and out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lets. These invariably are domes, resting on</seg><seg type="columnLine">threaded pillars. In preparation for the cold nights</seg><seg type="columnLine">these pillars, gigantic screws, are drawn down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock the covers into place. On mornings when it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm enough for human life on the surface, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are raised and one may visit where one wishes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Should one chance to remain out after the set clos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing time, he is not condemned to death. In each</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome-base is a door giving admittance to a tempera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture-lock, from which one descends to the city below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One thing which I failed to note, so entranced</seg><seg type="columnLine">was I with Ahlovah's beauty, was the feathery</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing-like growth on the back of my.wife's arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">from elbows up over her shoulders, meeting on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of her head. This has something the appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of the wings with which the humans of earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">endow their angels. These of Mayalovan are not</seg><seg type="columnLine">for flying. Rather they are a development from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair for receiving and discharging thoughts. Ahlo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vah tells me they are of no great antiquity, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared on Mayalovan humans within the last hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred thousand years. I have not developed any such,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although Ahlovah cheers me by saying she can feel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the fibrils coming. Our children have them as fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Ahlovah and the other women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the expiration of the hundred days, what a</seg><seg type="columnLine">marriage feast did old Mayalovan witness! How</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly sped the years since then. The happiness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">good deeds well done, and the pleasure of knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquired not for self but for all! Ahlovah and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been rewarded. We have four children, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls and two boys. Beautiful children! And when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I say "beautiful children," I am thinking not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my own. I mean all those descended from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who sailed from Newport News on the Wood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row Wilson on that April day nearly one hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of us men of earth, I can say truthfully not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">regrets that he did not return when opportunity</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered. We have a reward beyond price in the love</seg><seg type="columnLine">we give and get. The birth of children on Mayalo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">van is a reward and privilege given mankind to 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry on the great scheme of the universe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But enough. I could talk forever on Mayalovan</seg><seg type="columnLine">and our wondrous life there. To return now to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third of my references, that of the visualaud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sept. 15, 2038. The first clipping I used to intro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duce and substantiate the history of our doings with</seg><seg type="columnLine">4 Paulo." The second forms the background for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation of the events which befell the Woodrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wilson and her crew and passengers, up to the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of the ship, as chronicled by the visua-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laud referred to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No need of wild theories to explain its being</seg><seg type="columnLine">found in the sand wastes of Australia. The truth is</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple. It was picked up again from Mayalovan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and used as a vehicle to return me to this world;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my mission done, "Paulo" again will pick it up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and return me to my loved ones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am here to serve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">\\TE&gt; on Mayalovan, had hoped that after all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">▼	▼ these years we would be left undisturbed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete our cycle of love and knowledge. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">recently we discovered--for even we mortals of</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth have acquired telepathic powers--that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth was heading straight for another world con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flict which would actively involve every human be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, resulting in death, the torture of living death</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hopeless despair for nearly everyone. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">humanists on "Paulo" brought the word.

It was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">until I had passed the entire evening in his company</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was fully aware of his bodily peculiarities.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps the most striking characteristic was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarthy, coppery hue of his flesh that was not unlike</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of an American Indian. His chest and should-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers seemed abnormally developed, his limbs and feat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures extremely slender in proportion. Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar individuality was the wearing of a skull-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cap pulled well down over his forehead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Stearns caught my eye, and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly nod indicated his desire that I meet the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrival.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Glad to see you, Mr. Gregory," he said warmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he clasped my hand. "I want you to meet Mr,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martell, a stranger in our towfl, but a kindred spirit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that he is interested in Astronomy and particu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larly in the subject of my lecture this evening."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I extended my hand to Mr. Martell and imagined</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he responded to my salutation somewhat reluc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tantly. Immediately I knew why. The texture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skin was most unusual. For want of a better</seg><seg type="columnLine">simile, I Shall say that it felt not unlike a fine dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponge. I do not believe that I betrayed any visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise, though inwardly my whole being revolted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The deep, close-set eyes of the stranger seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching me for any manifestation of antipathy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I congratulate myself that my outward poise</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was undisturbed by the strange encounter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The guests assembled, and I discovered to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">chagrin that I was seated next to the stranger, Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell. Suddenly the lights were extinguished pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratory to the presentation of the lantern-slides.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The darkness that enveloped us was intense. Su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preme horror gripped me when I presently became</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious of two faint phosphorescent lights to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. There could be no mistaking their origin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were the eyes of Martell and they were re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garding me with an enigmatical stare. Fascinated,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	gazed back into those diabolical orbs with an emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion akin to terror. I felt that I should shriek and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then attack their owner. But at the precise mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment when my usually steady nerves threatened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">betray me, the twin lights vanished. A second later</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lantern light flashed on the screen. I stole a</seg><seg type="columnLine">furtive glance in the direction of Martell. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting with his eyes closed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The planet Mars should be of particular interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us," began Professor Stearns, "not only because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its relative proximity to us, but because of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that there are visible upon its surface undeni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able evidences of the handiwork of man, and I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclined to believe in the existence of mankind there</seg><seg type="columnLine">not unlike the humanity of the earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The discourse proceeded uninterruptedly. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">audience remained quiet and attentive, for Profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor Stearns possessed the faculty of holding his lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teners spell-bound. A large map of one hemisphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mars was thrown on the screen, and simultan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eously the stranger Martell drew in his breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply with a faint whistling sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor continued, "Friends, do you observe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the outstanding physical difference between</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars and Terra appears to be in the relative dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribution of land and water? On our own globe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrestrial parts lie as distinct entities surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the vast aqueous portions, whereas, on Mar3 the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land and water are so intermingled by gulfs, bays,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">capes and peninsulas that it requires careful study</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ascertain for a certainty which is which. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">my opinion, and I do not hold it alone, for much dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussion with my worthy colleagues has made it obvi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous, that the peculiar land contours are due to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that water is becoming a very scarce commodity</seg><seg type="columnLine">on our neighboring planet. Much of what is now</seg><seg type="columnLine">land is merely the exposed portions of the one-time</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean bed; the precious life-giving fluid now occupy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing only the lowest depressions. We may conclude</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the telescopic eye, when turned on Mars, sees</seg><seg type="columnLine">a waning world; the habitat of a people Struggling</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperately and vainly for existence, with inevitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">extermination facing them in the not far distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">future. What will they do? If they are no farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced in the evolutionary stage than a carrot or</seg><seg type="columnLine">a jelly-fish, they will ultimately succumb to fate, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they are men and women such as you and I, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will fight for the continuity of their race. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclined to the opinion that the Martians will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">die without putting up a brave struggle,-which will</seg><seg type="columnLine">result in the prolongation of their existence, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not in their complete salvation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Stearns paused. "Are there any ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was about to speak when the voice of Martell</seg><seg type="columnLine">boomed in my ear, startling me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In regard to the map, professor," he said, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe that gulf which lies farthest south is not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulf at all but is a part of the land portion sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounding it. I think you credit the poor dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet with even more water than it actually has!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is possible and even probable that I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">erred," replied the learned man, "and I am sorry</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed if that gulf is to be withdrawn frOm the</seg><seg type="columnLine">credit of the Martians, for their future must look</seg><seg type="columnLine">very black."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just suppose," resumed Martell, leaning toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lecturer with interested miem "that the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tians were the possessors of an intelligence equal to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of terrestrials, what might they do to save</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves from total extinction? In other words</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bring it home to us more realistically, what would</seg><seg type="columnLine">we do were we threatened with a like disaster?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That is a very difficult question to answer, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one upon which merely an opinion could be ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured," smiled Professor Stearns. " 'Necessity is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mother of invention', and in our case without</seg><seg type="columnLine">the likelihood of the existence of the mother, we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly hazard a guess as to the nature of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">offspring. But always, as Terra's resources have</seg><seg type="columnLine">diminished, the mind of man has discovered substi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tutes. There has always been a way out, and let us</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope our brave planetary neighbors will succeed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">solving their problem."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us hope so indeed," echoed the voice of Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT the time of my story in the winter of 1894-</seg><seg type="columnLine">1895, I was still unmarried and was living in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a private hotel on E.

To my neighbors I paid little or no attention,</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbed in my work during the day and paying</seg><seg type="columnLine">court to Margaret Landon in the evenings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FATE OF THE POSEI'DONIA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">247</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was not a little surprised upon one occasion, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stepped into the corridor, to see a strange yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar figure in the hotel locking the door of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment adjoining my own. Almost instantly I</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized Martell, on whom I had not laid eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the meeting some weeks previous at the home</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Professor Stearns. He evinced no more pleasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">at our meeting than I did, and after the exchange</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a few cursory remaiks from which I learned that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was my new neighbor, we went our respective</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought no more of the meeting, and as I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">not blessed or cursed (as the case may be) with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural curiosity concerning the affairs of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">about me, I seldom met Martell, and upon the rare</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasions when I did, we confined our remarks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ever convenient topic, the weather.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Between Margaret and myself there seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing an inexplicable estrangement that in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased as time went on, but it was not until after</seg><seg type="columnLine">five repeated futile efforts to spend an evening in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her company that I suspected the presence of a rival.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Imagine my surprise and chagrin to discover that</seg><seg type="columnLine">rival in the person of my neighbor Martell! I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">them together at the theatre and wondered, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all due modesty, what there was in the ungainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure and peculiar character of Martell to attract a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful and refined girl of Margaret Landon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">type. But .attract her he did, for it was plainly evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent, as I watched them with the eyes of a jealous</seg><seg type="columnLine">lover, .that Margaret was fascinated by the person-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ality of her escort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In sullen rage I went to Margaret a few days</seg><seg type="columnLine">later, expressing my opinion of her new admirer in</seg><seg type="columnLine">derogatory epithets. She gave me calm and digni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied attention until I had exhausted my vocabulary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">voicing my ideas of Martell, then she made reply</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Martell's defense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aside from personal appearance, Mr. Martell is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a forceful and interesting character, and I refuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">to allow you to«dictate to me who my associates are</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be. There is no reason why we three can not all</seg><seg type="columnLine">be friends."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Martell hates me as I hate him," I replied with</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoldering resentment. "That is sufficient reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">why we three can not all be friends."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think you must be mistaken," she replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtly. "Mr. Martell praises your qualities as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighbor and comments not infrequently on your</seg><seg type="columnLine">excellent ^virtue of attending strictly to your own</seg><seg type="columnLine">business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I left Margaret's presence in a down-hearted</seg><seg type="columnLine">mood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So Martell appreciates my lack of inquisitive-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, does he?" I mused as later I revitwed mentally</seg><seg type="columnLine">the closing words of Margaret, and right then and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there doubts and suspicions arose in my mind. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-absorption was an appreciable quality as far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martell was concerned, there was reason for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">esteem of that phase of my character. I had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered the presence of a mystery; Martell had</seg><seg type="columnLine">something to conceal!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was New Year's Day, not January 1st as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had it in the old days, but the extra New Year's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Day that was sandwiched as a separate entity be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween two years. This new chronological reckoning</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been put into use in 1938. The calendar had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">previously contained twelve months varying in</seg><seg type="columnLine">length from twenty-eight to thirty-one days, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the addition of a new month and the adoption</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a uniformity of twenty-eight days for all months</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the interpolation of an isolated New Year's Day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world's system of chronolgy was greatly simpli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied. It was, as I say, on New Year's Day that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose later than usual and dressed myself. The buzz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing monotone of a voice from Martell's room an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noyed me. Could he be talking over the telephone</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Margaret? Right then and there I stooped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the performance of a deed of which I did not think</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself capable. Ineffable curiosity converted me</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a spy and an eavesdropper. I dropped to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees and peered through the keyhole. I was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">warded with an unobstructed profile view of Martell</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated at a low desk on which stood a peculiar cub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical mechanism measuring on each edge six or</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven inches. Above it hovered a tenuous vapor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it issued strange sounds, occasionally inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted by remarks from Martell uttered in an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known tongue. Good heavens! Was this a new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fangled radio that communicated with the spirit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">world? For only in such a way could I explain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar vapor that enveloped the tiny machine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Television had been perfected and in use for a gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eration, but as yet no instrument had been invented</seg><seg type="columnLine">which delivered messages from the "unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">bourne!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I crouched in my undignified position until it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">with difficulty that I arose, at the same time that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martell shut off the mysterious contrivance. Could</seg><seg type="columnLine">Margaret be involved in any diabolical schemes?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The very suggestion caused me to break out in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold sweat. Surely Margaret, the very personifica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of innocence and purity, could be no partner in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any nefarious undertakings! I resolved to call her</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. She answered the phone and I thought her</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice showed agitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Margaret, this is George," I said. "Are you all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She answered faintly in the affirmative.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "May I come over at once?" I pled. "I have some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing important to tell you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To my surprise she consented, and I lost no time</seg><seg type="columnLine">in speeding my volplane to her home. With no in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">troductory remarks, I plunged right into a narrative</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the peculiar and suspicious actions of Martell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ended by begging her to discontinue her asso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciation with him. Ever well poised and with a girl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish dignity that was irresistibly charming, Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garet quietly thanked me for my solicitude for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-being but assured me that there was nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fear from Martell. It was like beating against a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brick wall to obtain any satisfaction from her, so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to my lonely rooms, there to brood in soli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude over the unhappy change that Martell had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought into my life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once agap I gazed through the tiny aperture.

The subtle mist that had previously hov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered above it was wanting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day upon arising I was drawn as by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnet toward the keyhole, but my amazement knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">no bounds when I discovered that it had been plug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">24-8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ged from the other side, and my vision completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">barred!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well I guess it serves me right," I muttered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my chagrin. "I ought to keep out of other people's</seg><seg type="columnLine">private affairs. But," I added as an afterthought in</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeble defense of my actions, "my motive is to save</seg><seg type="columnLine">Margaret from that scoundrel." And such I wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prove him to be before it was too late!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE sixth of April, 1945, was a memorable day</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the annals of history, especially to the inhabi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tants of Pacific coast cities throughout the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Radios buzzed with the alarming and mystifying</seg><seg type="columnLine">news that just over night the ocean line had receded</seg><seg type="columnLine">several feet.

How little we then realized that the rela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive importance of gold and water was destined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be reversed, and that man was to have forced upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a new conception of values which would bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him a complete realization of his former erron-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eous ideas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> May and June passed marking little change in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drab monotony that had settled into my life since</seg><seg type="columnLine">Margaret Landon had ceased to care for me. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon early in July I received a telephone call</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Margaret. Her voice betrayed an agitated</seg><seg type="columnLine">state of mind, and sorry though I was that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled, it pleased me that she had turned to me in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her despair. Hope sprang anew in my breast, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I told her I would be over at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was admitted by the taciturn housekeeper and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ushered into the library where Margaret rose to</seg><seg type="columnLine">greet me as I entered.

She extended both hands to me in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture of spontaneity that had been wholly lacking</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her attitude toward me ever since the advent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martell.

According</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his story the Pegasus wag winging its way across</seg><seg type="columnLine">mid-ocean last night keeping an even elevation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">three thousand feet, when, without any warning, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine started straight up. Some force outside of</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself was drawing it up, but whither? The rescued</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanic, the only one of all the fated ship's pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sengers, possessed the presence of mind to manipu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">late his parachute, and thus descended in safety be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the air became too rare to breathe, and before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he and the parachute could be attracted upwards.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stoutly maintains that the plane could not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen later without his knowledge. Scouting planes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">boats and submarines sent out this morning verify</seg><seg type="columnLine">his seemingly mad narration. Not a vestige of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pegasus .is to be found above, on the surface or be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low the water. Is this tragedy in any way connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the lowering of the ocean level ? Has some one</seg><seg type="columnLine">a theory? In the face of such an inexplicable</seg><seg type="columnLine">enigma the government will listen to the advance-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of any theories, in the hope of solving the mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tery;. Too many times in the past have the so-called</seg><seg type="columnLine">level-headed people failed to give ear to the warn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings of theorists and dreamers, but now we know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that,the latter are often the possessors of a sixth</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense that enables them to see that to which the bulk</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mankind is blind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was awed by the fate of the Pegasus. I had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">two flights in the wonderful machine myself three</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago, and I knew that it was the last word in</seg><seg type="columnLine">luxuriant air-travel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How long I sat listening to brief news bulletin 9</seg><seg type="columnLine">and witnessing scenic flashes of worldly affairs I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not know, but there suddenly came to my mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and persisted in staying there, a very disquieting</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought. Several times I dismissed it as unworthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any consideration, but it continued with unmiti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gating tenacity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After an hour of mental pros and cons I called up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the' hotel office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is Mr. Gregory in suite 307," I strove to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep my voice steady. "Mr. Martell of 309 is ill at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house of a friend. He wishes me to have some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his belongings taken to him. May I have the key</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his rooms?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a pause that to me seemed intermin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, then the voice of the clerk. "Certainly, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gregory, I'll send a boy up with it at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt like a culprit of the deepest dye as I entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martell's suite a few moments later and gazed about</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I knew I might expect interference from any</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter at any moment so I wasted no time in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">general susvey of the apartment but proceeded at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once to the object of my visit.' The tiny machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I now perceived was more intricate than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FATE OF THE POSEIDONIA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">249</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had supposed from my previous observations</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the keyhole, stood in its accustomed place</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the desk. It had four levers and a dial, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to manipulate each of these in turn. I com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menced with the one at my extreme left. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment apparently nothing happened, then I real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized that above the machine a mist was forming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At first it was faint and cloudy but the haziness</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly cleared, and before my startled vision a scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented itself. I seemed to be inside a bamboo</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut looking toward an opening which afforded a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of a wave-washed sandy beach and a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">palm trees silhouetted against the horizon. I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine myself on a desert isle. I gasped in aston-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishment, but it was nothing to the shock which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow. While my fascinated gaze dwelt on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene before me, a shadow fell athwart the hut's</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance and the figure of a man came toward me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I uttered a hoarse cry. For a moment I thought I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been transplanted chronologically to the discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery of America, for the being who approached me</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore a general resemblance to an Indian chief. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">his forehead tall, white feathers stood erect. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was without clothing and his skin had a reddish cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">that glistened with a coppery sheen in the sunlight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wherp had I seen those features or similar ones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">recently? I had it! Martell! The Indian savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a natural replica of the suave and civilized</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martell, and yet was this man before me a savage?</seg><seg type="columnLine">On the contrary, I noted that his features displayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a remarkably keen intelligence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger approached a table upon which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be, and raised his arms. A muffled cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped my lips! The feathers that I had supposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">constituted his headdress were attached perma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nently along the upper portion of his arms to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">point a little below each elbow. They grew there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This strange being had feathers instead of hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I do not know by what presence of mind I man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged to return the lever to its original position, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did, and sat weakly gazing vacantly at the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where but a few seconds before a vivid tropic scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been visible. Suddenly a low buzzing sound was</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard. Only for an instant was I mystified, then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that the stranger of the desert-isle was en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deavoring to summon Martell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Weak and dazed I waited until the buzzing had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased and then I resolutely pulled the second of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the four levers. At the inception of the experiment</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same phenomena were repeated, but when a cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rect perspective was effected a very different scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">was presented before my startled vision. This time</seg><seg type="columnLine">I seemed to be in a luxuriant room filled with costly</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnishings, but I had time only for a most fleeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance, for a section of newspaper that had inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cepted part of my view, moved, and from behind its</seg><seg type="columnLine">printed expanse emerged a being who bore a resem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blance to Martell and the Indian of the desert island.</seg><seg type="columnLine">JIt required but a second to turn off the mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">connection, but that short time had been of sufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">duration to enable me to read the heading of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper in the hands of a copper-hued man. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Die Miinchener Zeitung.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Still stupefied by the turn of events, it was with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain degree of enjoyment that I continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment with the devil-machine. I was startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the same buzzing sound followed the discon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">necting of the instrument.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was about to manipulate the third lever when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">became conscious of pacing footsteps in the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall. Was I arousing the suspicion of the hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">officials ? Leaving my seat before the desk, I began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move about the room in semblance of gathering</seg><seg type="columnLine">together Martell's required articles. Apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied, the footsteps'retreated down the corridor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were soon inaudible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Feverishly now I fumbled with the third lever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no time to lose and I was madly desirous</seg><seg type="columnLine">of investigating all the possibilities of this new kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of television-set. I had no doubt that I was on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">track of a nefarious organization of spies, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked on in the self-termed capacity of a Sherlock</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holmes. • «,.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The third lever revealed an apartment no less</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumptuous than the German one had been. It ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to be unoccupied for the present, and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample time to survey its expensive furnishings</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had an oriental appearance. Through an open</seg><seg type="columnLine">window at the far end of the room I glimpsed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosque with domes and minarets. I could not as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain for a certainty whether this was Turkey or</seg><seg type="columnLine">India. It might have been any one of many eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands, I could not know. The fact that the occupant</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this oriental apartment was temporarily absent</seg><seg type="columnLine">made me desirous of learning more about it, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">time was precious to me now, and I disconnected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No buzzing followed upon this occasion, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">strengthened my belief that my lever manipulation</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded a similar buzzing that was audible in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">various stations connected for the purpose of ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complishing some wicked scheme.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fourth handle invited me to further investiga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. I determined to go through with my secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">research though I died in the effort. Just before</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hand dropped, the buzzing commenced, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceived for the first time a faint glow near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lever of No. 4. I dared not investigate 4 at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, for I did not wish it known that another than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martell was at this station. I thought of going on</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dial 5, but an innate love of system forced me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to risk a loss of time rather than to take them out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of order. The buzzing continued for the usual dura-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of time, but I waited until it had apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased entirely before I moved No. 4.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My soul rebelled at that which took form from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the emanating mist. A face, another duplicate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martell's, but if possible more cruel, confronted me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely filling up the vaporous space, and two</seg><seg type="columnLine">phosphorescent eyes seared a warning into my own.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A nauseating sensation crept over me as my hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept to the connecting part of No. 4. When every</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestige of the menacing face had vanished, I arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakly and took a few faltering steps around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. A bell was ringing with great persistance</seg><seg type="columnLine">from some other room. It was mine! It would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise to answer it. I fairly flew back to my room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rewarded by the sound of Margaret's voice with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a note of petulance in it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why didn't you answer, George? The phone</seg><seg type="columnLine">rang several times."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Couldn't. Was taking a bath," I lied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Martell is better," continued Margaret. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor says there's no immediate danger."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a pause and the sound of a rasping</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice a little away from the vicinity of the phone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then Margaret's voice came again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">250</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Martell wants you to come over, George. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wants to see you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell him I have to dress after my bath, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll come," I answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE was not a moment to spare. I rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">back into Martell's room determined to see this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing through. I had never been subject to heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacks, but certainly the suffocating sensation that</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed me could be attributed to no other ciuse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A loud buzzing greeted my ears as soon as I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the door of Martell's suite. I looked toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the devil-machine. The four stations were buzzing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once! What was I to do? There was no light</seg><seg type="columnLine">near dial 5, and that alone remained uninvestigated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My course of action was clear; try out No. 5 to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction, leave Martell's rooms and go to Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garet Landon's home as I had told her I would.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They must not know what I had done. But it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">inevitable that Martell would know when he got back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his infernal television and radio. He must not</seg><seg type="columnLine">get back! Well, time enough to plan that later;</seg><seg type="columnLine">now to the work of seeing No. 5.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I turned the dial of No. 5 (for, as I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated before, this was a dial instead of a lever) I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was conscious of a peculiar sensation of distance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It fairly took my breath away. What remote part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the earth's surface would the last position reveal</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sharp hissing sound accompanied the manipu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lation of No. 5 and the vaporous shroud was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow in taking definite shape. When it was finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">at rest, and it was apparent that it would not change</seg><seg type="columnLine">further, the scene depicted was at first incompre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hensible to me. I stared with bulging eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bated breath trying to read any meaning into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">combinations of form and color that had taken shape</seg><seg type="columnLine">before me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the light of what has since occurred, the facts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which are known throughout the world, I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">lend my description a little intelligence borrowed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it were, from the future. At the time of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I write, however, no such enlightenment was mine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it must have been a matter of minutes before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest knowledge of the significance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene entered my uncomprehending brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My vantage-point seemed to be slightly aerial, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was looking down upon a scene possibly fifty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">below me. Arid red cliffs and promontories jutted</seg><seg type="columnLine">over dry ravines and crevices. In the immediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreground and also across a deep gully, extended a</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparatively level area which was the scene of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sort of activity. There was about it a vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion of a shipyard, yet I saw no lumber, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">great mountainous piles of dull metal, among which</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved thousands of agile figures. They were men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and women, but how strange they appeared! Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">red bodies were minus clothing of any description</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their heads and shoulders were covered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">long white feathers that when folded, draped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper portions of their bodies like shawls. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were unquestionably of the same race as the desert-</seg><seg type="columnLine">island stranger--and Martell! At times the feath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers of these strange people stood erect and spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">out like a peacock's tail. I noticed that when spread</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in this fan-like fashion they facilitated locomotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced toward the sun. far to my right and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered if I had gone crazy. I rubbed my hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">across my eyes and peered again. Yes, it was our</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminary, but it was little more than half its cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomary size! I watched it sinking with fascinated</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze. It vanished quickly beyond the red horizon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and darkness descended with scarcely a moment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervening twilight. It was only by the closest ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servation that I could perceive that I was still in</seg><seg type="columnLine">communication with No. 5.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently the gloom was dissipated by a shaft of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lrght from the opposite horizon whither the sun had</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared. So rapidly that I could follow its</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement across the sky, the moon hove into view.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But wait, was it the moon? Its surface looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely unfamiliar, and it too seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrunk in size.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Spellbound, 1 watched the tiny moon glide across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavens the while I iistened to the clang of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal tools from the workers below. Again a bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">light appeared on the horizon beyond the great metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulks below me. The scene was rapidly being ren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered visible by an orb that exceeded the sun in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter. Then I knew. Great God! There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">two moons traversing the welkin! My heart was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounding so loudly that it drowned out the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metal-workers. I watched on, unconscious of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passage of time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Voices shouted from below in great excitement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Events were evidently working up to some impor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant climax while the little satellite passed from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of vision and only the second large moon occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pied the sky. Straight before me and low on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon it hung with its lower margin touching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs. It was low enough now so that a few of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger stars were becoming visible. One in par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticular attracted my gaze and held it. It was a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluish-green star and I noticed that the workers</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused seemingly to gaze in silent admiration at its</seg><seg type="columnLine">transcendent beauty. Then shout after shout arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">from below and I gazed in bewilderment at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectacle of the next few minutes, or was it hours?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A great spherical bulk hove in view from the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my line of vision. It made me'think of nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much as a gyroscope of gigantic proportions. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be made of the metal with which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers were employed below, and as it gleamed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deep blue of the sky it looked like a huge satel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lite. A band of red metal encircled it wifch points of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same at top and bottom. Numerous openings</seg><seg type="columnLine">that resembled the port-holes of an ocean-liner ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared in the broad central band, from which ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended metal points. I judged these were the "eyes"</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the machine. But that which riveted my atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was an object that hung poised in the air below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mighty gyroscope, held in suspension by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious force, probably magnetic in nature, evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently controlled in such a manner that at a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">point it was exactly counter-balanced by the gravi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tational pull. The lines of force apparently traveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the poles of the mammoth sphere. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">object that depended in mid-air, as firm and rigid as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though resting on terra-firma, was the missing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pegasus, the epitome of earthly scientific skill, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the clutches of this unearthly looking marauder it</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like a fragile toy. Its wings were bent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FATE OF THE POSEIDONIA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">251</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted, giving it an uncanny resemblance to a bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the claws of a cat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In my spellbound contemplation of this new phe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomenon I had temporarily forgotten the scene be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, but suddenly a great cloud momentarily blotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the moon, then another and another and another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in rapid succession. Huge bulks of air-craft were</seg><seg type="columnLine">eclipsing the moon. Soon the scene was all but ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">literated by the machines whose speed accelerated</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they reached the upper air. On and on they sped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in endless procession while the green star gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">serenely on! The green star, most sublime of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">starry host! I loved its pale beauty though I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">not why. Darkness. The moon had set, but I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that still those frightfully gigantic and ominous</seg><seg type="columnLine">shapes still sped upward and onward. Whither?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tiny moon again made its appearance, serving</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reveal once more that endless aerial migration.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was it hours or days? I had lost all sense of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage of time. The sound of rushing feet, suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded by a pounding at the door brought me back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my immediate surroundings. I had the presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mind to shut off the machine, then I arose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">assumed a defensive attitude as the door opened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">many figures confronted me. Foremost among them</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Martell, his face white with rage, or was it</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Officers, seize that man," he cried furiously. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not give him permission to spy in my room. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">lied when he said that."

And watching him, I could not help but</seg><seg type="columnLine">observe that he too was taking note of me, running</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes, with a curious touch of greed in them, over</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, from my broad shoulders to my sun-tanned</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, and up to my freckled face again. "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now," said he, as we lit our cigarettes, "I will tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you of the business in hand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must tell you, then, that I am an old man, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very old man." He paused momentarily. "And it</seg><seg type="columnLine">happens that I have money that I must presently be</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving, and never a child have I to leave it to." I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of the confidence game, and resolved I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be on the alert for the vestiges of my five hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds. He proceeded to enlarge on his loneliness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the trouble he had to find a proper disposition</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his money. "I have weighed this plan and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan, charities, institutions, and scholarships, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">libraries, and I have come to this conclusion at last,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">--he fixed his eyes on my face--"that I will find</seg><seg type="columnLine">some young fellow, ambitious, pure-minded, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor, healthy in body and healthy in mind, and, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">short, make him my heir, give him all that I have."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He repeated, "Give him all that I have. So that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">will suddenly be lifted out of all the trouble and</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle in which his sympathies have been edu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated, to freedom and influence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tried to seem disinterested. With a transparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypocrisy I said, "And you want my help, my pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessional services maybe, to find that person."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled, and looked at me oyer his cigarette,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I laughed at his quiet exposure of my modest</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What a career such a man might have!" he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It fills me with envy to think how I have accumu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated that another man may spend-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But there are conditions, of course, burdens to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be imposed. He must, for instance, take my name.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You cannot expect everything without some return.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I must go into all the circumstances of his life</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I can accept him. He must be sound. I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">know his heredity, how his parents and grandpar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ents died, have the strictest inquiries made into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">private morals."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This modified my secret congratulations a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And do I understand," said I, "that I-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he said, almost fiercely. "You. You."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I answered never a word. My imagination was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing wildly, my innate scepticism was useless to</seg><seg type="columnLine">modify its transports. There was not a particle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratitude in my mind--I did not know what to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor how to say it. "But why me in particular?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">said at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had chanced to hear of me from Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haslar, he said, as a typically sound and sane young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and he wished, as far as possible, to leave his</seg><seg type="columnLine">money where health and integrity were assured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HpHAT was my first meeting with the little old</seg><seg type="columnLine">A man. He was mysterious about himself; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not give his name yet, he said, and after I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had answered some questions of his, he left me at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Blavitiski portal. I noticed that he drew a hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful of gold coins from his pocket when it came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">paying for the lunch. His insistence upon bodily</seg><seg type="columnLine">health was curious. In accordance with an arrange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment we had made I applied that day for a life pol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">icy in the Loyal Insurance Company for a large sum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was exhaustively overhauled by the medical</seg><seg type="columnLine">advisers of that company in the subsequent week.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even that did not satisfy him, and he insisted I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be re-examined by the great Doctor Henderson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Friday in Whitsun week before he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a decision. He called me down, quite late in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening--nearly nine it was--from cramming chem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical equations for my Preliminary Scientific Exam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ination. He was standing in the passage under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeble gas-lamp, and his face was a grotesque inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">play of shadows. He seemed more bowed than when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had first seen him, and his cheeks had sunk in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice shook with emotion. "Everything is</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfactory, Mr. Eden," he said. "Everything is</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite, quite satisfactory. And this night of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">nights, you must dine with me and celebrate your</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE STORY OF THE LATE MR. ELVESHAM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">255</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">--accession." He was interrupted by a cough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You won't nave long to wait, either," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiping his handkerchief across his lips, and grip-,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping my hand with his long bony claw that was dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged. "Certainly not very long to wait."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We went into the street and called a cab. I re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">member every incident of that drive vividly, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swift, easy motion, the vivid contrast of gas and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">oil ar.d electric light, the crowds of people in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">streets, the place in Regent Street to which we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">went, and the sumptuous dinner we were served</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with there. I was disconcerted at first by the well-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dressed waiter's glances at my rough clothes, both-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ered by the stones of the olives, but as the cham-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pagne warmed my blood, my confidence revived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">At first the old man talked of himself. He had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">already told me his name in the cab; he was Egbert</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Elvesham, the great philosopher, whose name I had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">known since I was a lad at school. It seemed in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">credible to me that this man, whose intelligence</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had so early dominated mine, this great abstrac-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion, should suddenly realize itself as this decrepit,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">familiar figure. I dare say every young fellow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">who has suddenly fallen among celebrities has felt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">something of my disappointment. He told me now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the future that the feeble streams of his life</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would presently leave dry for me, houses, copy-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rights, investments; I had never suspected that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">philosophers were so rich. He watched me eat and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drink with a touch of envy. "What a capacity for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">living you have!" he said; and then with a sigh,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a sigh of relief I could have thought it, "it will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not be long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Ay," said I, my head swimming now with cham-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pagne; "I have a future perhaps--of a passing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">agreeable sort, thanks to you. I shall now have the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">honor of your name. But you have a past. Such</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a past as is worth all my future."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He shook his head and.smiled, as I thought, with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">half sad appreciation of my flattering admiration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"That future," he said, "would you in truth change</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it?" The waiter came with liqueurs. "You will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not perhaps mind taking my name, taking my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">position, but would you indeed--willingly---take</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my years?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "With your achievements," said I gallantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He smiled again. "Kiimmel--both," he said to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the waiter, and turned his attention to a little paper</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">packet he had taken from his pocket. "This hour,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said he, "this after-dinner hour is the hour of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">small things. Here is a scrap of my unpublished</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wisdom." He opened the packet with his shaking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yellow fingers, and showed a little pinkish powder</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on the paper. "This," said he--"well, you must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">guess what it is. But Kiimmel--put a dash of this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">powder in it--is Himmel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  His large grayish eyes watched mine with an in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scrutable expression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was a bit of a shock to me to find this great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">teacher gave his mind to the flavor of liqueurs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">However, I feigned an interest in his weakness,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">' for I was drunk enough for such small sycophancy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He parted the powder between the little glasses,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ancl, rising suddenly, with a strange, unexpected</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dignity, held out his hand towards me. I imitated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his action, and the glasses rang. "To a quick suc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cession," said he, and raised his glass towards his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not that," I said hastily. "Not that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused with the liqueur at the level of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chin, and his eyes blazing into mine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To a long life," said I.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hesitated. "To a long life," said he, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden bark of laughter, and with eyes fixed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another we tilted the little glasses. His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked straight into mine, and as I drained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff off, I felt a curiously intense sensation. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first touch of it set my brain in a furious tumult;</seg><seg type="columnLine">I seemed to feel an actual physical stirring in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">skull, and a seething humming filled my ears. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not notice the flavor in my mouth, the aroma</seg><seg type="columnLine">that filled my throat; I saw only the gray intensity</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of his gaze that burnt into mine. The draught,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mental confusion, the noise and stirring in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, seemed to last an interminable time. Curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous vague impressions of half-forgotten things</seg><seg type="columnLine">danced and vanished on the edge of my conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. At last he broke the spell. With a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive sigh he put down his glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's glorious," said I, though I had not tasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stuff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My head was spinning. I sat down. My brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">was chaos. Then my perception grew clear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute as though I saw things in a concave mir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror. His manner seemed to have changed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">something nervous and hasty. He pulled out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch and grimaced at it. "Eleven-seven! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-night I must--Seven-twenty-five. Waterloo!*</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must go at once." He called for the bill, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled with his .coat. Officious waiters came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our assistance. In another moment I was wishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him good-bye, over the apron of a cab, and still</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an absurd feeling of minute distinctness, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though--how can I express it?--I not only saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">but felt through an inverted opera-glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That stuff," he said. He put his hand to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead. "I ought not to have given it to you. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">will make your head split to-morrow. Wait a min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute. Here." He handed me out a little flat thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a Seidlitz powder. "Take that in water as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are going to bed. The other thing was a drug.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not till you're ready to go to bed, mind. It will</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear your head. That's all. One more shake--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Futurus!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gripped his shrivelled claw. "Good-bye," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, and by the droop of his eyelids I judged he</seg><seg type="columnLine">too was a little under the influence of that brain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisting cordial.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He recollected something else with a start, felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">in'his breast-pocket, and produced another packet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time, a cylinder the size and shape of a shav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-stick. "Here," said he. "I'd almost forgotten.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't open this until I come tomorrow--but take</seg><seg type="columnLine">it now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was so heavy that I wellnigh dropped it. "All</seg><seg type="columnLine">ri'!" said I, and he grinned at me through the cab</seg><seg type="columnLine">window as the cabman flicked his horse into wake-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulness] It was a white packet he had given me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with red seals at either end and along its edge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If this isn't money," said I, "it's platinum or lead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ♦One of the principal London railroad stations.</seg><seg type="columnLine">256</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I STUCK it with elaborate care into my pocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with a whirling brain walked home through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Regent Street loiterers and the dark back</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets beyond Portland Road. I remember the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensations of that walk very vividly, strange as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were. I was still so far myself that I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice my strange mental state, and wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether this stuff I had had was opium--a drug</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond my experience. It is hard now to describe</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peculiarity of my mental strangeness--mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubling vaguely expresses it. As I was walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">up Regent Street I found in my mind a queer per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suasion that it was Waterloo Station, and had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd impulse to get into the Polytechnic as a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">might get into a train. I put a knuckle in my eye,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was Regent Street. How can I express it?</seg><seg type="columnLine">You see a skilful actor looking quietly at you, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulls a grimace, and lo!--another person. Is it</seg><seg type="columnLine">too extravagant if I tell you that it seemed to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if Regent Street had, for the moment, done that?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, being persuaded it was Regent Street again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was oddly muddled about some fantastic rem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iniscences that cropped up. "Thirty years ago,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought I, "it was here that I quarrelled with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother." Then I burst out laughing, to the as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonishment and encouragement of a group of night</seg><seg type="columnLine">prowlers. Thirty years ago I did not exist, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">never in my life had I boasted a brother. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff was surely liquid folly, for the poignant re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gret for that lost brother still clung to me. Along</seg><seg type="columnLine">Portland Road the madness took another turn. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to recall vanished shops, and to compare the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street with what it used to be. Confused, troubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking is comprehensible enough after the drink</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had taken, but what puzzled me were these curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously vivid phantasm memories that had crept into</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind, and not only the memories that had crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, but also the memories that had slipped out. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped opposite Stevens's, the natural history</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealer's, and cudgelled my brains to think what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to do with me. A 'bus went by, and sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly like the rumbling of a train. I seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be dipping into some dark, remote pit for the recol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lection. "Of course," said I, at last, "he has prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ised me three frogs tomorrow. Odd I should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Do they still show children dissolving views ? In</seg><seg type="columnLine">those I remember one view would begin like a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghost, and grow and oust another. In just that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way it seemed to me that a ghostly set of new sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sations was struggling with those of my ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">self.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went on through Euston Road to Tottenham</seg><seg type="columnLine">Court Road, puzzled, and a little frightened, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely noticed the unusual way I was taking, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">commonly I used to cut through the intervening</seg><seg type="columnLine">network of back streets. I turned into University</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street, to discover that I had forgotten my number.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only by a strong effort did I recall 11 A, and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">then it seemed to me that it was a thing some for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten person had told me. I tried to steady my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind by recalling the incidents of the dinner, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the life of me I could conjure up no picture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my host's face; I saw him only as a shadowy out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line, as one might see oneself reflected in a win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow through which one was looking. In his place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, I had a curious exterior vision of myself,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting at a table, flushed, bright-eyed, and talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ative.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must take this other powder," said I. "This is</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting impossible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tried the wrong side of the hall for my candle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the matches, and had a doubt of which landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">my room might be on. "I'm drunk," I said, "that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain," and blundered needlessly on the staircase</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sustain the proposition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the first glance my room seemed unfamiliar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What rot!" I said, and stared about me. I seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bring myself back by the effort, and the odd</seg><seg type="columnLine">phantasmal quality passed into the concrete famil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iar. There was the old glass still, with my notes</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the albumens stuck in the corner of the frame,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my old everyday suit of clothes pitched about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. And yet it was not so real after all. I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">an idiotic persuasion trying to creep into my mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it were, that I was in a railway carriage in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">train just stopping, that I was peering out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">window at some unknown station. I gripped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed-rail firmly to reassure myself. "It's clairvoy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance, perhaps," I said. "I must write to the Psychi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal Research Society."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I put the rouleau on my dreSsing-table, sat on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my bed, and began to take off my boots. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if the picture of my present sensations was</seg><seg type="columnLine">painted over some other picture that was trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show through. "Curse it!" said I; "my wits are</seg><seg type="columnLine">going, or am I in two places at once?" Half-un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed, I tossed the powder into a glass and drank</seg><seg type="columnLine">it off. It effervesced, and became a fluorescent am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber color. Before I was in bed my mind was al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready tranquillized. I felt the pillow at my cheek,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thereupon I must have fallen asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T AWOKE abruptly out of a dream of strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">A beasts, and found myself lying on my back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Probably everyone knows that dismal, emotional</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream from which one escapes, awake indeed, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely cowed. There was a curious taste in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth, a tired feeling in my limbs, a sense of cu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneous discomfort. I lay with my head motion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less on my pillow, expecting that my feeling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangeness and terror would pass away, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should then doze off again to sleep. But instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that, my uncanny sensations increased. At first</seg><seg type="columnLine">I. could perceive nothing wrong about me. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a faint light in the room, so faint that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very next thing to darkness, and the furniture</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood out in it as vague blots of absolute darkness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stared with my eyes just over the bedclothes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came into my mind that some one had entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room to rob me of my rouleau of money, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">after lying for some moments, breathing regularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to simulate sleep, I realized this was mere fancy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nevertheless, the uneasy assurance of something</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong kept fast hold of me. With an effort I raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head from the pillow, and peered about me at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark. What it was I could not conceive. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the dim shapes around me, the greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lesser darknesses that indicated curtains, table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fireplace, bookshelves, and so forth. Then I began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to perceive something unfamiliar in the forms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness. Had the bed turned round? Yon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der should be the bookshelves, and something</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrouded and pallid rose there, something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not answer to the bookshelves, however I</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE STORY OF THE LATE MR. ELVKSHAM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">257</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at it. It was far too big to be my shirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown on a chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Overcoming a childish terror, I threw back the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed-clothes and thrust my leg out of bed. Instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of coming out of my truckle-bed upon the floor, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found my foot scarcely reached the edge of the mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tress. I made another step, as it were, and sat up</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the edge of the bed. By the side of my bed</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be the candle, and the matches upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken chair. I put out my hand and touched--</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing. I waved my hand, in the darkness and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came against some heavy hanging, soft and thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">in texture, which gave a rustling noise at my touch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I grasped this and pulled it; it appeared to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtain suspended over the head of my bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was now thoroughly awake, and beginning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize that I was in a strange room. I was puz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zled. I tried to recall the overnight circumstances,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I found them now, curiously enough, vivid in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my memory: the supper, my reception of the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">packages, my wonder whether I was intoxicated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my slow undressing, the coolness to my flushed face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my pillow. I felt a sudden distrust. Was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">last night, or the night before? At any rate, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">room was strange to me, and I could not imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">how I had got into it. The dim, pallid outline was</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing paler, and I perceived it was a window,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the dark shape of an oval toilet-glass against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weak intimation of the dawn that filtered</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the blind. I stood up, and was surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a curious feeling of weakness and unsteadiness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With trembling hands outstretched, I walked slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the window, getting, nevertheless, a bruise</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the knee from a chair by the way. I fumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">round the glass, which was large, with handsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">brass sconces, to find the blind-cord. I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">find any. By chance I took hold of the tassel, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the click of a spring the blind ran up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I found myself looking out upon a scene that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was altogether strange to me. The night was over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast, and through the flocculent gray of the heaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds there filtered a faint half-light of dawn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just at the edge of the sky the cloud-canopy had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood-red rim. Below, everything was dark and</seg><seg type="columnLine">indistinct, dim hills in the distance, a vague mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of buildings running up into pinnacles, trees like</seg><seg type="columnLine">spilt ink, and below the window a tracery of black</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes and pale gray paths. It was so unfamiliar</seg><seg type="columnLine">that for the moment I thought myself still dream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. I felt the toilet-table; it appeared to be made</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some polished wood, and was rather elaborately</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnished--there were little cut-glass bottles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a brush upon it. There was also a queer little ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject, horse-shoe shape it felt, with smooth, hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">projections, lying in a saucer. I could find no</seg><seg type="columnLine">matches or candlestick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned my eyes to the room again. Now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind was up, faint spectres of its furnishing came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the darkness. There was a huge curtained</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed, and the fireplace at its foot had a large white</seg><seg type="columnLine">mantel with something of the shimmer of marble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I leant against the toilet-table, shut my eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and opened them again, and tried to think. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole thing was far too real for dreaming. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclined to imagine there was still some hiatus in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my memory, as a consequence of my draught of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that strange liqueur; that I had come into my in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heritance perhaps, and suddenly lost my recollec-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of everything since my good fortune had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced. Perhaps if I waited a little, things</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be clearer to me again. Yet my dinner with</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Elvesham was now singularly vivid and recent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The champagne, the observant waiters, the powder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the liqueurs--I could have staked my soul it</seg><seg type="columnLine">all happened a few hours ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then occurred a thing so trivial and yet so</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible to me that I shiver now to think of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment. I spoke aloud. I said, "How the devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">did I get here?" . . . And the voice was not my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not my own, it was thin, the articulation</seg><seg type="columnLine">was slurred, the resonance of my facial bones was</seg><seg type="columnLine">different. Then, to reassure myself I ran one hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the other, and felt loose folds of skin, the bony</seg><seg type="columnLine">laxity of age. "Surely," I said, in that horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice that had somehow established itself in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat, "surely this thing is a dream!" Almost as</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly as if I did it involuntarily, I thrust my</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers into my mouth. My teeth had gone. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger-tips ran on the flaccid surface of an even</seg><seg type="columnLine">row of shrivelled gums. I was sick with dismay</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disgust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt then a passionate desire to see myself, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize at once in its full horror the ghastly change,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had come upon me. I tottered to the mantel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt along it for matches. As I did so, a barking</seg><seg type="columnLine">cough sprang up in my throat, and I clutched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick flannel nightdress I found about me&gt; There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no matches there, and I suddenly realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that my extremities were cold. Sniffing and cough-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, whimpering a little, perhaps, I fumbled back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bed. "It is surely a dream," I whispered to my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self as I clambered back, "surely a dream." It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a senile repetition. I pulled the bedclothes over</seg><seg type="columnLine">my shoulders, over my ears, I thrust my withered</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand under the pillow, and determined to compose</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself to sleep. Of course it was a dream. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning the dream would be over, and I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">wake up strong and vigorous again to my youth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and studies. I shut my eyes, breathed Regularly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, finding myself wakeful, began to count slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the powers of three.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the thing I desired would not come. I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not get to sleep. And the persuasion of the inex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orable reality of the change that had happened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me grew steadily. Presently I found myself with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes wide open, the powers of three forgotten,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my skinny fingers upon my shrivelled gums.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was, indeed, suddenly and abruptly, an old man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had in some unaccountable manner fallen through</seg><seg type="columnLine">my life and come to old age, in some way I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been cheated of all the best of my life, of love, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle, of strength, and hope. I grovelled into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pillow and tried to persuade myself that such</seg><seg type="columnLine">hallucination was possible. Imperceptibly, stead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily, the dawn grew clearer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT last, despairing of further sleep, I sat up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed and looked about me. A chill twilight ren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered the whole chamber visible. It was spacious</seg><seg type="columnLine">and well-furnished, better furnished than any room</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had ever slept in before. $. candle and matches</seg><seg type="columnLine">became dimly visible upon a little pedestaf in ja re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess. I threw back the betJcJgthes, and, shivering</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the rawness of th^^j^H^rning, albeit, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was summer-time, I got	lit the candle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">258</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, trembling horribly, so that the extinguisher</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattled on its spike--I tottered to the glass and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw--Elvesham's face! It was none the less hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible because I had already dimly feared as much.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had already seemed physically weak and pitiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me, but seen now, dressed only in a coarse flannel</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightdress, that fell apart an3' showed the stringy</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck, seen now as my own body, I cannot describe</seg><seg type="columnLine">its desolate decrepitude. The hollow cheeks, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">straggling tail of dirty gray hair, the rheumy</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleared eyes, the quivering, shrivelled lips, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower displaying a gleam of the pink interior lin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and those horrible dark gums showing. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">who are mind and body together, at your natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, cannot imagine what this fiendish imprison-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment meant to me. To be young and full of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire and energy of youth, and to be caught, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently to be crushed in this tottering ruin of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I wander from the course of my story. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time I must have been stunned at this change</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had come upon me. It was daylight when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did so far gather myself together as to think. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">some inexplicable way I had been changed, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">how, short of magic, the thing had been done, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not say. And as I thought, the diabolical in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">genuity of Elvesham came home to me. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain to me that as I found myself in his, so he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be inv possession of my body, of my strength, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is, and my future. But how to prove it? Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I thought, the thing became so incredible, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me, that my mind reeled, and I had to pinch</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, to feel my toothless gums, to see myself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass, and touch the things about me, before I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could steady myself to face the facts again. Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all life hallucination? Was I indeed Elvesham, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he me? Had I been dreaming of Eden overnight?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was there any Eden? But if I was Elvesham, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should remember where I was on the previous</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, the name of the town in which I lived,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what happened before the dream began. I strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled with my thoughts. I recalled the queer double-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of my memories overnight. But now my mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clear. Not the ghost of any memories but</seg><seg type="columnLine">those proper to Eden could I raise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This way lies insanity!" I cried in my piping</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. I staggered to my feet, dragged my feeble,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy limbs to the washhand-stand, and plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">my gray head into a basin of cold water. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">towelling myself, I tried again. It was no good.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt beyond all question that I was indeed Eden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not Elvesham. But Eden in Elvesham's body!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had I been a man of any other age, I might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">given myself up to my fate as one enchanted. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">in these sceptical days miracles do not pass cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent. Here was some trick of* psychology. What a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drug and a steady stare could do, a drug and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady stare, or some similar treatment, could sure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly undo. Men have lost their memories before. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">to exchange memories as one does umbrellas! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed. Alas! not a healthy laugh, but a wheez-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing,, senile titter. I could have fancied old Elve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sham laughing at my plight, and a gust of petulant</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger, unusual to me, swept across my feelings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I began dressing eagerly in the clothes I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying about on the floor, and realized when I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed that it was an evening suit I had assumed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	opened the wardrobe and found some ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes, a pair of plaid trousers, and an old-fash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ioned dressing-gown. I put a venerable smoking-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cap on my venerable head, and, coughing a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my exertions, tottered out upon the landing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was then, perhaps, a quarter to six, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinds were closely drawn and the house quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent. The landing was a spacious one, a broad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">richly-carpeted staircase went down into the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the hall below, and before me a door ajar</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed me a writing-desk, a revolving bookcase,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the back of a study chair, and a fine array of bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">books, shelf upon shelf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My study," I mumbled, and walked across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing. Then at the sound of my voice a thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck me, and I went back to the bedroom and put</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the set of false teeth. They slipped in with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease of old habit. "That's better," said I, gnashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and so returned to the study.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The drawers of the writing-desk were locked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its revolving top was also locked. I could see no</seg><seg type="columnLine">indications of the keys and there were none in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pockets of my trousers. I shuffled back at once to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bedroom, and went through the dress-suit, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterwards the pockets of all the garments I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">find. I was very eager, and one might have imag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ined that burglars had been at work, to .see my</seg><seg type="columnLine">room when I had done. Not only were there no</seg><seg type="columnLine">keys to be found, but not a coin, nor a scrap of</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper--save only the receipted bill of the overnight</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A curious weariness asserted itself. I sat down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stared at the garments flung here and there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their pockets turned inside out. My first frenzy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had already flickered out. Every moment I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to realize the immense intelligence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans of my enemy, to see more and more clearly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopelessness of my position. With an effort I rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hurried hobbling into the study again. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">staircase was a housemaid pulling up the blinds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She stared, I think, at the expression of my face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	shut the door of the study behind me, and, seiz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a poker, began an attack upon the desk. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">is how they found me. The cover of the desk was</seg><seg type="columnLine">split, the lock smashed, the letters torn out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pigeon-holes and tossed about the room. In my</seg><seg type="columnLine">senile rage I had flung about the pens and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">such light stationery, and overturned the ink.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moreover, a large vase upon the mailtel had got</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken I do not know how. I could find no cheque-</seg><seg type="columnLine">book, no money, no indications of the slightest use</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the recovery of my body. I was battering mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly at the drawers, when the butler, backed by two</seg><seg type="columnLine">women-Servants, intruded upon me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'T'HAT simply is the story of my change.

The bank will not rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ognize my signature, for I suppose that, allowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the feeble muscles I now have, my handwriting</seg><seg type="columnLine">is still Eden's.

It seems that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elvesham kept the name of his solicitor secret from</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his household. I can ascertain nothing. Elve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sham was, of course, a profound student of mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">science, and all my declarations of the facts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case merely confirm the theory that my insanity is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outcome of overmuch brooding upon psychol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ogy. Dreams of the personal identity indeed! Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">days ago I was a healthy youngster, with all life</seg><seg type="columnLine">before me; now i am a furious old man, unkempt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and desperate, and miserable, prowling about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great, luxurious, strange house, watched, feared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and avoided as a lunatic by every one about me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And in London is Elvesham beginning life again</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a vigorous body and with all the accumulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge and wisdom of threescore and ten. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">has stolen my life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What has happened I do not clearly know. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the study are volumes of manuscript notes refer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring chiefly to the psychology of memory, and parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what may be either calculations or ciphers in</seg><seg type="columnLine">symbols absolutely strange to me. In some pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sages there are indications that he was also occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pied with the philosophy of mathematics. I take it</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has transferred the whole of his memories, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">accumulation that makes up his personality, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">this old withered brain of his to mine, and,' simi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larly, that he has transferred mine to his discarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenement. Practically, that is, he has changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies. But how such a change may be possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">is without the range of my philosophy. I have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a materialist for all my thinking life, but here, sud-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, is a clear case of man's detachability from</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One desperate experiment I am about to try. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sit writing here before putting the matter to issue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This morning, with the help of a table-knife that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	had secreted at breakfast, I succeeded in breaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">open a fairly obvious secret drawer in this wrecked</seg><seg type="columnLine">writing desk. I discovered nothing save a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">green glass phial containing a white powder. Round</seg><seg type="columnLine">the neck of the phial was a label, and thereon was</seg><seg type="columnLine">written this one word, "Release." This may be--is</seg><seg type="columnLine">most probably--poison. I can understand Elve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sham placing poison in my way, and I should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that it was his intention so to get rid of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only living witness against him, were it not for this</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful concealment. The man has practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved the problem of immortality. Save for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of chance, he will live in my body until it has</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged, and then, again, throwing it aside, he will as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sume some other victim's youth and strength.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When one remembers his heartlessness, it is ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible to think of the ever-growing experience that</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . .

His dead body lay between the desk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chair. The latter had been pushed back, prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably by his last convulsions. The story was writ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten in pencil, and in a crazy hand, quite unlike his</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual minute characters. There remain only two</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious facts to record.

My part shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">be to listen, to believe and to obey."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Attend, then, to what I am about to relate," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied Professor Montesquieux, for such was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">name. "You of course know that Biela, an officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Austrian army, accidentally discovered a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">comet on the evening of February 27th, 1826. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">comet was carefully observed by contemporary as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tronomers, and it was soon assigned a period rang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing between six and seven years. Between 1826 and</seg><seg type="columnLine">1845 it made two regular appearances, but in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> latter year it was seen tc separate into two distinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True to its old period, the comet returned in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1852; but this time its components were over a mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion miles apart. Then it disappeared. But in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1872, after it had twice failed to reappear, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from the very region of the cometary path one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the most brilliant meteor showers ever recorded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in astronomical history. Klinkerfues of Berlin as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed this display to be due to a direct encounter</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the disintegrated comet and the earth;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but, strange to say, the mysterious visitor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly afterwards observed to be retreating to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards Theta Centauri in the southern heavens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now the question was, what had become of Bie-</seg><seg type="columnLine">la's comet? Where had it gone? Astronomers with</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the most crude and elementary mathematical</seg><seg type="columnLine">science at their command, naturally were obliged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accept a simple answer. In fact, all they had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say was that the comet had conveniently disinte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grated. This explanation was simplicity itself, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">who would be the wiser? Assuredly not the public;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for were not the public always delighted with that</seg><seg type="columnLine">which least taxed their power of comprehension?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Consequently, the memory of Biela's comet has</seg><seg type="columnLine">died, except in the minds of a few observers who</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand the meaning of the late November</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteor showers, which occur at regular periodic in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tervals coinciding with the former period of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">comet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Montesquieux paused, Bourget asked: "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">these showers do not explain everything? Do they</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer no proof of the comet's disintegration?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, my friend," resumed the professor rapidly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I perceive that you are but little acquainted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deeper mysteries of cometary geometry, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though your intentions are excellent. Proof indeed!</seg><seg type="columnLine">What does the November meteor shower prove ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept that this miserable</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragment of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">comet continues to follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">the path of its ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">ellipse, showering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth with a few in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">finitesimal particles dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing perihelion ? But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you that is not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">real comet; for the prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cipal part of Biela's</seg><seg type="columnLine">comet never disinte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grated! And our learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">geometricians, with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">play circles, their hyperbolas, their parabolas and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their curved planes, what do they know about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laws of cometary geometry? Do they think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature must necessarily follow their childish lines?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I,	Alphonse Montesquieux, denounce them all.

A real mathematician would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have perceived this during its last appearance in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1852, when the two nuclei were already over a mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion miles apart. But Biela's comet is at last com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing back, and it will strike the earth exactly upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">M'OST of us have heard about comets, but very few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of us have ever seen one. As is well known, there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">has been a great deal of superstition about comets in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">past, and the most dire things have been predicted, when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one of them approached the earth sufficiently near to be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">come visible to the naked eye. In the past, comets have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been associated with pestilences, wars, and other great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">calamities, much of this, of course, being based upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">superstition. The present story by our new author is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">excellent for any one who wants to brush up his knowl-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">edge of comets in general with a quantum of good fic-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion thrown in for good measure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">m</seg><seg type="columnLine">262</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the vernal equinox, six months from today!

Taking into account the speed of the earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbital revolution around the sun and the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the approaching comet must intercept the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">restrial orbit before reaching perihelion, I find that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a collision is inevitable. The earth, which has re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volved unmolested in space for perhaps a billion</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, is at last to receive a sudden visitor!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the result of this collision," inquired Bour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">get, "will be what? Many astronomers have held</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a comet's mass is not sufficient to cause serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">damage to the earth. But even if we were to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim this news from the press, we should be doubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, for as we have demonstrated this evening, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">highest telescopic power is inadequate to reveal the</seg><seg type="columnLine">comet's presence, even though we know its right as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cension and declination with certainty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True," replied Montesquieux thoughtfully, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nublic would not remember the 'wonder comet*</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 1843, which Boguslawski observed to possess a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail 600,000.000 miles in length and traveling at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate of 100,000 miles per second, thus approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speed of light itself.

Do you know what would have happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">if this comet had crossed the terrestrial orbit</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-two hours sooner? The earth travels nine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen miles per second or 68,400 miles per hour. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">period of twenty-two hours therefore represents ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proximately 1,500,000 miles--a narrow margin to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say the least--but with my comet, or Bielas' comet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whichever you prefer to call it, there will be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">such escape. And do not think that comets are so</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmless as optimistic astronomers teach: The</seg><seg type="columnLine">density of comets, like that of planets, varies with</seg><seg type="columnLine">age and chemical constitution. The coming comet</seg><seg type="columnLine">possesses a nucleus of considerable density, as its</seg><seg type="columnLine">attractive power and gravitational resistance clear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly prove. All comets contain carbon, hydrogen, ni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trogen and oxygen, but the relative proportions in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which these elements are compounded are not</seg><seg type="columnLine">known; consequently there can be no certainty re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garding the effect of cometary gases upon terres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trial atmosphere and organisms. My opinion* how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, is that these elements, combined with a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance which I strongly suspect to exist within</seg><seg type="columnLine">comets, would be absolutely fatal to organic life</seg><seg type="columnLine">based upon amorphous carbon.

If the result be as I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect, I will see that he is immediately confined in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an asylum for the insane, where he may propound</seg><seg type="columnLine">his theories in safety, without danger to the public</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE week later the National Academy of Sci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence was in session. True to his determina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, Dr. Beauvais had called together the leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomers and mathematicians of France, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Montesquiex had been granted fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes in which to present his theory to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned assembly. The last speaker was just fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishing his paper; when he was done, it would then</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the professor's turn to speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Beauvais was fully prepared. Upon his right</seg><seg type="columnLine">was seated Henri Vali6re, director of the Paris</seg><seg type="columnLine">Observatory; upon his left was Ren6 Beauchamp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leading mathematician of France. In an ante-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber of the building a selected group of mental</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">specialists was waiting. Professor Montesquieux,</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompanied by Jean Bourget, was seated in a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spicuous position in the upper end of the hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At length the speaker concluded. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence. The president rose, fixed his eyes upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the professor, and proceeded in his most majestic</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone: "Alphonse Montesquieux, you have applied</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a hearing before this assembly. You have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">granted fifteen minutes in which to state your case.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Proceed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Montesquieux arose, and without wast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing time upon formalities, began:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen: Assuming two celestial objects</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose common parent moved in an ellipse to be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">results of an internal explosion, what orbits would</seg><seg type="columnLine">they be most likely to follow? You will remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, in mathematical researches* upon the orbits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">asteroids, it was universally assumed by astronom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers that in case the minor planets were the remain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing fragments of the ultra-Martian planet required</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Bode's law, their orbits would, at some time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the past, have intersected the point where the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plosion occurred. However, as investigation proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">that such intersections had occurred only in rela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively few cases, the existence of the hypothetical</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet was considered disproved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the point which I wish you to consider, I ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peal to the same inexorable law of celestial me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanics. When Biela's comet divided in 1845, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same principle was involved. In 1852, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'•omet reappeared, it was evident that the orbit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">each nucleus had been changed; for the twin comets</seg><seg type="columnLine">were already 1,200,000 miles apart. Further proof</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this orbital change was furnished by the earth's</seg><seg type="columnLine">collision with the disintegrated cometary fragment</seg><seg type="columnLine">in 1872. We may assume, however, that as regards</seg><seg type="columnLine">celestial distances, the orbit of this minor nucleus</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued virtually the same, showering the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its debris at regular periodic intervals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what became of the major nucleus? And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">above all, what would have been the nature of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbit? Some of you already know that, so far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">celestial phenomena are concerned, I conceive both</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parabola and the hyperbola to be physical and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mathematical impossibilities. Cometary geometry</seg><seg type="columnLine">allows of only one orbit,--the ellipse, so long as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nucleus is free from serious gravitational perturba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Now, in accordance with the theorem first</seg><seg type="columnLine">adduced, it follows that the divided fragments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Biela's comet must eventually pass through a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon point of intersection. Let A'A represent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter of the original ellipse; let X be the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the orbit where the comet divided into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragments B and C, and you will find that C, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">has the more elongated orbit, must finally intersect</seg><seg type="columnLine">the path of B at X'. X', gentlemen, is the precise</seg><seg type="columnLine">point in space this planet will occupy at the vernal</seg><seg type="columnLine">''nuinox next March. A collision is inevitable. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mathematical proofs of this catastrophe are here</seg><seg type="columnLine">available for your inspection, and I strongly urge</seg><seg type="columnLine">that suitable measures be taken to discover a means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of protecting humanity against the poisonous gases</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the impending collision will produce. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">time is up. I thank you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this point, ProfeaSor Montesquieux walked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the president's chair, handed him the report which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had prepared, and quickly resumed his 'seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The impression produced upon the assembly by</seg><seg type="columnLine">264</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the discourse they had just heard would be difficult</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to describe; but upon every countenance the same</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">expression was visible. Stupefaction, wonder and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">amazement were written clearly upon the face of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">each member. Dr. Beauvais slowly took up the pa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">per, and, after a momentary glance, handed the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sheet to the mathematician at his left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This learned gentleman, after scrutinizing the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">professor's calculations with a puzzled air, leaned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">confidentially toward the president. "Mad," he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whispered, "these insane scribblings can be nothing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">else than the creations of a madman. I refuse to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">consider the matter further. If your measures are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">prepared, I advise that you proceed with them im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mediately."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The professor had made a fatal error, which could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hardly have been avoided even if it had been fore-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seen. Being a mathematical genius, he had for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">years scorned the applied mathematics of his time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and had evolved a new and revolutionary system</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the realm of pure mathematics. Consequently,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his symbols, although relatively simple, were in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">telligible only to himself and Bourget. Indeed, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">conclusion which he had reached by the new method</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could not have been deduced or even expressed by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ordinary mathematical symbols. It was, therefore,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">k hardly surprising that a mathematician of the old</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'school should utterly fail to grasp the meaning of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the calculation. Professional pride, however, would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I not permit this fact to be recognized, and so like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">*	many another innovator, Montesquieux was to pay</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dearly for his temerity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The president's features assumed a determined</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">expression. Rising and beckoning to the professor,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he said: "Monsieur Montesquieux, this matter must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be discussed privately and at greater length. Will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you have the kindness to follow me into the ad-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">joining room?" Without suspecting the plot which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had been laid against him, the professor rose from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his seat and followed Dr. Beauvais out of the hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Two .hours later the name Alphonse Montesquieux</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was officially registered in a secluded institution</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for the insane which was located a few miles out-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">side of Paris.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">III.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">IN the latter part of February the astronomical</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">world was on the "qui Vive." On the twentieth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the month an English amateur astronomer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">named Huntington, had observed, while walking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">home during the late hours of the evening, a sight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which caused him to stop short and gasp for breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In the constellation Cassiopeiae, within three degrees</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the spot where Tycho Brahe's famous temporary</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">star had appeared in 1572, was a brilliant nova, al-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ready of the second magnitude. Realizing that his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">long desired opportunity to make his name known</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in astronomical history had arrived, the young man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had rushed to the nearest telegraph station and hur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">riedly written the following message to the Green-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wich Observatory:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           LONDON, FEBRUARY 20, 1931</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "SECOND MAGNITUDE NOVA JUST AP-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> PEARED NEAR KAPPA CASSIOPEIA."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                    HUNTINGTON.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">That night telegraph lines and cables were kept</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">busy by communications among observatories all</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the world. Telescopes and spectroscopes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately turned upon the nova. And then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">startling thing occurred. When the first large</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescope was directed toward the new star, the as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tronomer rubbed his eyes in bewilderment; for in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of showing as a mere bright point of light as</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars generally do, the diameter of this strange ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject increased tenfold when viewed through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescope. An examination of the nova's spectra re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed another puzzling peculiarity. The majority</seg><seg type="columnLine">of novae are either of solar type A or B--that is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, white or blue stars of small density. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectrum lines of Nova Cassiopeiae seemed to indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate a solar type of class F or G, although there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were many features which did not correspond with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the composition of these stars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was the new visitor comet, planet or star? This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the question which astronomers were every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where endeavoring to answer. Although some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spectrum lines suggested a cometary nucleus, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite coma or tail had been visible, and in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sequence this explanation was abandoned. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory of a new planet was entirely too fantastic</seg><seg type="columnLine">for consideration. Consequently, the nova must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new type of star, closely analogous to Nova Persei</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 1901, which was surrounded by a luminous ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">nebula. When, a few days later, the object was ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served to be increasing in size and encircled by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nebulous halo, this explanation was greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">strengthened, for did not the nebula in Nova Persei</seg><seg type="columnLine">expand in radius almost three seconds of arc per</seg><seg type="columnLine">day? This theory was universally accepted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire scientific world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the meantime some amateur astronomer of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">religious turn of mind had started the rumor that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the celestial visitor was nothing less than the Star</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Bethlehem returned to announce the coming of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Millennium, which millions of eager souls had so</seg><seg type="columnLine">long been anxiously expecting. It was, in fact, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">famous star seen by the Magi 1931 years before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and which had been observed in 945, 1264, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again in 1572 by the astronomer Tycho Brahe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the sensational always travels fastest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes the best news, this wild rumor was given</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide circulation. Religious sects founded upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speedy approach of the Millennium were in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest excitement. In such communities all work</seg><seg type="columnLine">was abandoned, ascension robes were prepared, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">frenzied prayer and exhortation became the order</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the day. Crowds of wild-eyed men and women</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to roam the streets, chanting weird psalms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and entreating passers-by to repent, fast and pray</seg><seg type="columnLine">in preparation for the approaching Day of Judg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE effect of all this upon the public mind soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">became noticeable. Even conservative persons</seg><seg type="columnLine">were at last becoming nervous, for the nova was</seg><seg type="columnLine">undeniably increasing in size and brightness. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of the cold, large crowds of people could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen watching the strange star on every clear eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning. Nearly three weeks had passed since the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery of the nova on February twentieth. Within</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few days it had passed from a second magnitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">star to a brilliance far exceeding that of Sirius.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Astronomers were frankly puzzled. Each night</seg><seg type="columnLine">they expected to find a decrease in the nova's mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST COMET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">265</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nitude, in accordance with the usual fluctuations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">novae. However, instead of declining, its brilliance</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily increased. To obtain an accurate parallax</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the star required some little time, and although</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few rough attempts had already been made, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">results were far too startling to admit of serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">consideration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In London, the sky had been heavily overcast for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several days, and the interest created by the phe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomenon had almost disappeared in the ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">course of human affairs. Only the astronomers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were aware of the nova's progress, and they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no desire to arouse what they considered needless</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiety in the public mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But on March sixteenth, a most extraordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing happened. A sudden wind had sprung up</seg><seg type="columnLine">early in the morning, and as all London was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its daily occupations, a rift occurred among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying cloudbands. And there, in broad daylight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining brightly in the northern heavens, was Nova</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cassiopeiae! City dwellers do not often waste their</seg><seg type="columnLine">time in contemplation of the heavens, and for a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments the sight was unnoticed. But a laborer</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was obliged to lift his gaze in order to view</seg><seg type="columnLine">some work being carried on in a building over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, was the first to see it. For a moment he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not move, staring blankly. Slowly, without uttering</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sound, he pointed toward the north. His com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions, attracted by his strange attitude, gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him and looked in the direction he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing. Many who doubted the testimony of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own senses, rubbed their eyes and looked again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Star was still there, its radiance causing it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear a veritable miniature sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The news spread quickly, as if carried by a hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den electric current. Entire streets were block-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aded; in many sections of the city all traffic had</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly come to a stop. The cries of excited and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hysterical women mingled with the clanging of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tram-cars and the roar of motors. The windows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great buildings were filled with thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads. On the morning of the sixteenth business</seg><seg type="columnLine">was paralyzed, and it was not until well into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon that order was restored and men could</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue their work. And even then, things were</seg><seg type="columnLine">far from being normal. A strange feeling of un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">easiness was in the air, and among the authorities</seg><seg type="columnLine">some concern was felt lest the morning's excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment might result in a panic during the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In order to allay the nervousness of the public</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much as possible, a statement was drawn up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and signed by the Astronomer Royal of England.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This proclamation, of which several thousand copies</seg><seg type="columnLine">were immediately posted in conspicuous places, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed the people that although the size and bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liance of the new star were certainly unusual, many</seg><seg type="columnLine">novae had been known to act strangely in the past</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was no cause whatever for alarm. It also</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced that the object must be at least two or</seg><seg type="columnLine">three hundred light years distant, so that the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw probably left its starting point during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">days of Queen Elizabeth. In short, everything was</seg><seg type="columnLine">explainable upon purely natural grounds, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, therefore, no possible danger to fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the exception of a few sensational sheets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this notice was printed by the evening papers, to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether with other remarks of the same nature.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thus reassured, and the clouds having reappeared,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">people went home to their dinners feeling rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheepish over their previous anxiety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But another surprise was in store for them; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that evening the sky completely cleared, and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold ! the nova's light exceeded even that of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon. The city was illuminated almost as brightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as during the murky London day. Despite the as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">surances of the astronomers, the effect was ghastly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That night millions of the city's inhabitants stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazing at the strange phenomenon and speaking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another in subdued and frightened tones. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect of the proclamation had worn off. The people</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not so certain of the astronomers' infallibility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What had occurred in London had happened in</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly every other city in the world. Paris, Vienna,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berlin, Leningrad, Rome and New York had all</seg><seg type="columnLine">been shaken by the sight of the new star. Observ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atories, colleges and weather stations had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooded with inquiries. Each day the press con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained some new note of reassurance from the au-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The authorities, however, were ir- longer very</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of themselves. In all of this time, no one had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of Biela's comet or Professor Montes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quieux's prediction; but now that the date of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vernal equinox was almost at hand, an astronomer</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the French Academy who had heard the profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sor's warning, voiced the opinion that the nova</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be the predicted comet. This suggestion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was at first ridiculed, gradually gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, and by the nineteenth of March, two days</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the vernal equinox, the scientific world</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew with certainty that the visitor was actually a</seg><seg type="columnLine">comet approaching perihelion at a rapidly increas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was at first intended that the news should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">confined to scientific circles and not be made pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lic, but as such news usually does, it soon leaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and was made known to an already badly</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened world. Business was suspended. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening of the nineteenth and the morning of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twentieth saw the most startling scenes ever wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nessed among civilized people. Sleep was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of. Even the necessity of eating and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinking was forgotten. Churches, newspaper of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fices and centers of learning were filled and sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by fear-stricken mobs, eagerly snatching</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the most wild and impossible rumors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Early on the morning of the twentieth, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">French Academy had hurriedly assembled at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice from its president. As the scientists took</seg><seg type="columnLine">their seats, their faces appeared drawn and hag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gard; yet there was no sign of fear. These men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who realized more fully than the crowd outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">real nature of the peril, were nevertheless calm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">attentive. Dr. Beauvais slowly rose to address the</seg><seg type="columnLine">assembly. His face was pale and deep circles were</seg><seg type="columnLine">around his eyes, but his calm and self-assurance</seg><seg type="columnLine">were perfect. Never had he appeared more worthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the high position which he held.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen," he began, "at this, which is per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps our last meeting, I have only one sentiment to</seg><seg type="columnLine">express,--regret.

Jean Bourget</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been the professor's constant companion dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the latter's retirement, and the two had spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">many pleasant hours in perfecting the new mathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matics and watching the approach of Nova Cassi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">opeiae after it had become visible. The professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had, moreover, followed the trend of events through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the columns of the daily press, and while he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally moved to compassion at the panic caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the approaching collision, he was nevertheless in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensely interested in the results which this collision</seg><seg type="columnLine">would produce. This sense of agreeable expectation</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the approach of an impending catastrophe is pe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culiar only to the genuine man of science, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be wholly unintelligible to the man of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. The professor would have gladly given his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life or done anything else in his power to avert the</seg><seg type="columnLine">collision and save humanity, but as he could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing further, and as the catastrophe was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">fault of his own, he felt a lively professional curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">osity in the coming event.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Montesquieux had expected a last mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment visit from his scientific colleagues of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Academy, and in consequence he was not surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he saw several motor cars draw up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">driveway outside and his old enemy Dr. Beauvais</seg><seg type="columnLine">step out of the foremost machine. In view of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">victory and the approaching destruction of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, the professor had lost all feeling of rancor to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward his old enemies; indeed, he experienced a sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of professional pity for their ignorance. It was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore, with a smile of welcome that he met Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beauvais at the door of the apartment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Alphonse Montesquieux,"'' said the president</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply, "can you forgive me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," replied the professor with some emotion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I do forgive you most freely. The fault was mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much as yours, for had I been less stubborn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">put my calculations in more understandable form,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the present situation might never have occurred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, it is now too late for regrets. Let us lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">no part of the mighty spectacle about to be pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented to our eyes. I have a small telescope in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalled here which will serve for any observations</seg><seg type="columnLine">we may care to make. Paris, I understand, is panic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken. Undisturbed observation would there be</seg><seg type="columnLine">an impossibility. Let us remain here undisturbed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where science may observe. If the disaster is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete, our observations may be of great value to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the future."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The setting sun was just disappearing oyer the</seg><seg type="columnLine">western horizon, its golden rays showering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth for perhaps the last time in its history. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the disappearance of the sun, twilight did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">ensue. Instead, a weird, phosphorescent brilliance</seg><seg type="columnLine">took its place. The awful proximity of the come-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary mass was now fully apparent. It occupied over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a quarter of the entire sky. In the center, the disk</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the nucleus could be clearly discerned, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing coma shot out by the expulsion of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed nothing less than the fiery breath of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragon of antiquity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor had calculated the comet's speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">when near perihelion at not less than 100 miles per</seg><seg type="columnLine">second. His observations showed that the nucleus</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now approximately 2,500,000 miles distant from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ecliptic, its course being in a direct line with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth's position at the vernal equinox. As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">comet was traveling at the speed of 6,000 miles per</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute or 360,000 miles per hour, it would strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth's orbit in about seven hours. The earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving at the rate of 68,400 miles per hour, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">traverse the remaining 478,000 miles separating it</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the equinox in exactly the same time. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">collision, therefore, would be due at one o'clock in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning, when the vernal equinox would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been reached.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scientists watched through the long hours in</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost unbroken silence. Awe and interest were</seg><seg type="columnLine">mingled upon their faces, yet even now there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">little fear. Trained in the observation of nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">for years, they were not to be terrified by her man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ifestations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By midnight the whole northern sky seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be on fire. The few first magnitude stars which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been visible in the early evening, had long since</seg><seg type="columnLine">faded from sight, and the earth was now illumin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated by a ghastly radiance apparently exceeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">even that of sunlight. The atmosphere had at first</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt sultry, and this had given place to steadily in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creasing heat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a small church located a short distance away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bells were tolling. Inside devout peasants were</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying paralyzed with fear. Heroic priests, upheld</seg><seg type="columnLine">by their faith, were administering the last sacra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments. But there was little response. As usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">happens in cases of extreme fright, panic had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded by temporary paralysis of the nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">system.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At five minutes to one, Professor Montesquieux</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his companions witnessed the most striking</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectacle ever recorded in the history of the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sky was now one complete ball of flame. Due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the intense heat and noxious cometary gases, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air was suffocating. Swarms of red and yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteors were everywhere striking the earth. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes later the professor was blinded by a thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand brilliant streaks of light, and the heavy build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing reverberated as if it were undergoing a severe</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombardment. Suddenly a terrific concussion was</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt. The scientists were thrown violently to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. In the mind of Professor Montesquieux,</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything turned red and then changed to black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. He lost consciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">■fr^HEN he awoke the first object of which he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	* was aware was the bandaged head of Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beauvais, who was leaning over him in eager solici-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude. The room was illuminated by the feeble rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a flickering wax candle. The majority of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were still reclining where they had been thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the shock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the comet?" inquired the professor as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he was able to speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The earth," replied Dr. Beauvais solemnly, "is</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOST COMET</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">267</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">saved. By an act of Providence the central nucleus</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the comet missed the terrestrial surface by a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance which could not have exceeded 300 miles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The concussion we felt a few moments ago was due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to debris emitted by the coma. The danger is now</seg><seg type="columnLine">past. Much damage has undoubtedly been done, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing has occurred that cannot be repaired with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a few month's time. And there, my friend," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued, suddenly pointing to a broken window,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"is the last I hope we shall ever see of this mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">comet." And high in the southern heavens, its tail</seg><seg type="columnLine">now clearly visible, was Biela's fast retreating</seg><seg type="columnLine">comet, plunging headlong into space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a few moments the professor was lost in med-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itation. Finally he spoke. "Gentlemen," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly, "I have made a serious and unforgivable</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistake. This deviation in the comet's path is</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly accounted for by the perturbation caused in</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing the Jovian orbit. How this could have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">overlooked in my calculations I cannot conceive;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I offer both you and the world my most humble</seg><seg type="columnLine">apology. And to think of the untold suffering and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">panic I might have prevented had I but foreseen</seg><seg type="columnLine">this. But let the blame and the humiliation both</seg><seg type="columnLine">be mine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">- "But my dear Montesquieux," interrupted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">president impatiently, "what madness is this? Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you not realize that your prediction has justly en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titled you to be considered the foremost mathema-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tician of the world ? Think of the glory this will re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flect upon France. Alphonse Montesquieux, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">French Newton! The new mathematics will revolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionize the world 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," replied the professor gravely, "I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed. Although I rejoice in the escape of human-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity, I cannot return to the world. The world soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgets, and in reaction from its panic it will claim</seg><seg type="columnLine">revenge. I should soon be ridiculed and perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">even be accused of having caused the panic by my</seg><seg type="columnLine">false predictions. No, my friends, I cannot return.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I intend to stay where I am. You were right in</seg><seg type="columnLine">placing me here, and I shall remain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the professor kept his word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The End.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FATE OF THE POSEIDONIA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By CLARE WINGER HARRIS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> (Concluded)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">superb figure stood and gazed into the deep velvety</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue of the sky, the others following the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their leader's gaze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Involuntarily I too watched the welkin where now</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even a moon was visible.

A face filled the entire vaporous</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen, the beloved features of Margaret Landon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was speaking and her voice came over the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance like the memory of a sound that is not quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">audible and yet very real to the person in whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind it exists.

I was going in to New York on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">8:15 A.M. train and was sitting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend Murchison and, as a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, we were talking radio. I had just told</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murchison that he was a lunkheaded noodle and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">for two cents I would poke him in the jaw, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">even a pin-headed idiot ought to know that a tube</seg><seg type="columnLine">set was better than a crystal set. To this Murchison'</seg><seg type="columnLine">had replied that that settled it. He said he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">always known I was a moron, and now he was sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you had enough brains to fill a hazelnut shell,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "you wouldn't talk that way.

Radio fans are</seg><seg type="columnLine">always disputing over the relative merits of crystal</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tube sets, but I knew I was right. I was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to decide whether to choke Murchison with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my bare hand and throw his lifeless body out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car window, or tell him a few things I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanting to say ever since he began knocking my</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube set, when this Remington Solander, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting behind us, leaned forward and tapped me on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shoulder.

If they don't care and</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintain," he said, giving me a hard look, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">million and a half is to go to the Home for Flea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bitten Dogs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"They'll care and maintain, all right!"- I laughed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I think so," said Remington Solander gravely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I do think so, indeed!

It was a big lot of money</seg><seg type="columnLine">for drawing one clause of a will, and I began to smell</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rat right there. But, I may say, the proposition</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remington Solander made to me was one I was able,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after quite a little talk with &amp;y fellow trustees of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the cemetery, to carry out. What Remington Sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ander Wanted was to be permitted to put a radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud-speaking outfit in his. granite tomb--a radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud-speaking outfit permanently set at 327 meters</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave-length, which was to be the wave-length of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his endowed broadcasting station. I don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how Remington Solander first got this remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea, but about that time an undertaker in New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York had rigged up a hearse with a phonograph so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the hearse would loud-speak suitable hymns on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way to the cemetery, and that may have sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested the loud-speaking tomb to Remington Sol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ander, but it is not important where he got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea. He had it, and he was set on having it car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Dissemination of Religion from the Cemetery</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a? A AHINK," he said, "of the uplifting effect of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it! On the highest spot in the cemetery</seg><seg type="columnLine">JL will stand my noble tomb, loud-speaking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all directions the solemn and holy words and music</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have collected in my fourteen volumes. All who</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter the cemetery will hear; all will be ennobled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and uplifted."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was so, too. I saw that at once. I said so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So Remington Solander went on to explain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the income from the five hundred thousand dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be set aside to keep "A" batteries and "B"</seg><seg type="columnLine">batteries supplied, to keep the outfit in repair, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. So I tackled the job rather enthusiastically.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't say that the five thousand dollar fee did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not interest me, but I did think Remington Solander</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a grand idea. It would make our cemetery</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand out. People would come from everywhere to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see and listen. The lots in the new addition would</seg><seg type="columnLine">sell like hot cakes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I did have a little trouble with the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">trustees. They balked when I explained that Rem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ington Solander wanted the sole radio loud-speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">rights of our cemetery, but some one finally sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested that if Remington Solander put up a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">and artistic iron fence around the whole cemetery</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might be all right. They made him submit his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourteen volumes so they could see what sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter he meant to broadcast from his high-class</seg><seg type="columnLine">station, and they agreed it was solemn enough; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all solemn and sad and gloomy, just the stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a cemetery. So when Remington Solander</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed to build the new iron fence they made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">formal contract with him, and I drew up the clause</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the will, and he bought six lots on top of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high knoll and began erecting his marble mauso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Building of the Monument and the Death</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Tenant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    OR eight months or so Remington Solander</seg><seg type="columnLine">M was busier than he had ever been in his life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">JL He superintended the building of the tomb</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he had on hand the job of getting his endowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio station going--it was given the letters WZZZ</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and hiring artists to sing and play and speechify</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fourteen volumes of gloom and uplift at 327</seg><seg type="columnLine">meters, and it was too much for the old codger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The very night the test of the WZZZ outfit was made</seg><seg type="columnLine">he passed away and was no more on earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His funeral was one of the biggest we ever had</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Westcote. I should judge that five thousand peo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">SOLANDER'S RADIO TOMB</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">271</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pie attended his remains to the cemetery, for it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become widely known that the first WZZZ program</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be received and loud-spoken from Remington</seg><seg type="columnLine">Solander's tomb that afternoon, the first selection</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the program--his favorite hymn--beginning as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the funeral cortege left the church and the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gram continuing until dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I'll say it was one of the most affecting occasions</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have ever witnessed. As the body was being car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried into the tomb the loud speaker gave us a ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon by Rev. Peter L. Ruggus, full of sob stuff, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">every one of the five thousand present wept. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the funeral was really finished, over two thous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and remained to hear the rest of the program, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">consisted of hymns, missionary reports, static and</seg><seg type="columnLine">recitations of religious poems. We increased the</seg><seg type="columnLine">price of the lots in the new addition one hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars per lot immediately, and we sold four lots</seg><seg type="columnLine">that afternoon and two the next morning. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">big metropolitan newspapers all gave the Westcote</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cemetery full page illustrated articles the next Sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, and we received during the next week over</seg><seg type="columnLine">three hundred letters, mostly from ministers, prais-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing what we had done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Increased Sales on Lots</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT that was not the best of it. Requests</seg><seg type="columnLine">for lots began to come in by mail. Not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">people in Westcote wrote for prices, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">people away over in New Jersey and up in West-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chester Country, and even from as far away as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poughkeepsie and Delaware. We had twice as</seg><seg type="columnLine">many requests for lots as there were lots to sell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we decided we would have an auction and let</seg><seg type="columnLine">them go to the highest bidders. You see Rem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ington Solander's Talking Tomb was becoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">nationally famous. We began to negotiate with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the owners of six farms adjacent to our cemetery; we</seg><seg type="columnLine">figured on buying them and making more new addi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions to the cemetery. And then we found we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not use three of the farms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The reason was that the loud speaker in Reming-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton Solander's tomb would not carry that far;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was not strong enough. So we went to the execu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors of his estate and ran up against another snag</seg><seg type="columnLine">---nothing in the radio outfit in the tomb could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">altered in any way whatever. That was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">will. The same loud speaker had to be maintained,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same wave-length had to be kept, the same makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of batteries had to be used, the same style of tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to be used. Remington Solander had thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all that. So we decided to let well enough alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">--it was all we could do anyway. We bought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">farms that were reached by the loud speaker and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had them surveyed and laid out in lots--and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing happened!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Cemtery Ruined by Jazz</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">YES, sir, I'll sell my cemetery stock for two</seg><seg type="columnLine">cents on the dollar, if anybody will bid that</seg><seg type="columnLine">much for it. For what do you think happened?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Along came the Government of the United States,</seg><seg type="columnLine">regulating this radio thing, and assigned new wave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengths to all the broadcasting stations. It gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remington Solander's endowed broadcasting station</seg><seg type="columnLine">WZZZ an 855-meter wave-length, and it gave that</seg><seg type="columnLine">station at Dodwood--station PKX--the 327-meter</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave-length, and the next day poor old Remington</seg><seg type="columnLine">Solander's tomb poured forth "Yes, We Ain't Got</seg><seg type="columnLine">No Bananas" and the "Hot Dog" jazz and "If You</seg><seg type="columnLine">Don't See Mama Every Night, You Can't See Mama</seg><seg type="columnLine">At All," and Hink Tubbs in his funny stories, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, one day an Irishman and a Swede were walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down Broadway and they see a flapper coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards them.

I expect old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remington Solander turned clear over in his tomb</seg><seg type="columnLine">when those programs began to come through. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know our board of trustees went right up in the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there was not a thing we could do about it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The newspapers gave us double pages the next Sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day--"Remington Solander's Jazz Tomb" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Westcote's Two-Step Cemetery." And within a</seg><seg type="columnLine">week the inmates of our cemetery began to move</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. Friends of people who had been buried over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred years came and moved them to other</seg><seg type="columnLine">cemeteries and took the headstones and monuments</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them, and in a month our cemetery looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like one of those Great War battlefields--like a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shell-holes. Not a man, woman or child was left</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the place--except Remington Solander in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">granite tomb on top of the high knoll. What we've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got on our hands is a deserted cemetery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They all blame me, but I can't do anything about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. All I can do is groan--every morning I grab</seg><seg type="columnLine">the paper and look for the PKX program and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I groan.

The miraculous happens--the rock opens. Then a shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">is heard, and they discover a German scientist, von Hetsdorp, who is</seg><seg type="columnLine">there to find the secret of life for Germany. He realises that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">all could do more than he alone, so he tells them what he has learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the place and they tell what they know of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Von Hetsdorp tells them that the rock remains open for at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">three hours and they go within to investigate.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ebon shadow had vanished from above and down</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the room was pouring the silvery light.

At any rate, I decided, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would speak about it to O'Keefe once we were alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">again--and then giving myself up to the urge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">buoyant well-being I shouted like a boy, stripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and joined the two in the pool. The water was</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm and I felt the unwonted tingling of life in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every vein increase; something from it seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulse through the skin, carrying a clean vigorous</seg><seg type="columnLine">vitality that toned every fibre. Tiring at last, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">swam to the edge and drew ourselves out.

She leaned her chin upon her hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarded us, whole fountains of questions brimming</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How is it, Larree, that you have two countries</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Goodwin but one?" she asked, at last unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep silent longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was born in Ireland; he in America.

"I am tired of men like Lugur and Rador.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But they are strong," she added, swiftly. "Lu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gur can hold up ten in his two arms and raise six</seg><seg type="columnLine">with but one hand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We could not understand her numerals and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised white fingers to illustrate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is little, 0 lady, to the men of Ireland,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied O'Keefe. "Lo, I have seen one of my race</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold up ten times ten of our--what call you that</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift thing in which Rador Drought us here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Corial," said she.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold up ten times twenty of our corials with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">but two fingers--and these corials of ours-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Coria," said she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And these coria of ours are each greater in</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight than ten of yours.

"Say Muna then.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In many ways they are, I gather, 0 heart's delight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one and the same."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the doubt in the blue eyes was strong in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed. She shook her head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None of our men can do that!" she answered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at length. "Nor do I think you could, Larree."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, no," said Larry easily. "I never tried to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">that strong.

He took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pencil and on a white cloth made a hasty sketch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an airplane. "In a--a corial like this--" She re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garded the sketch gravely, thrust a hand down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">her girdle and brought forth a keen-bladed poniard;</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut Larry's markings out and placed the fragment</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That I can understand," she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MOON POOL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">279</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Remarkably intelligent young woman," mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered O'Keefe.

His voice rang strong.

He took a vase of crystal from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table, placed it on the threshold that led into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the garden. "Use it on this--and I will show you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will use it upon one of the ladala--" she be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The exaltation dropped from him; there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of horror in the eyes he turned to her; her</seg><seg type="columnLine">own dropped before it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It shall be as you say," she said hurriedly. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew the shining cone from her breast; levelled it</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the vase. The green ray leaped forth, spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the crystal, but before its action could even be</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun, a flash of light shot from O'Keefe's hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his automatic spat and the trembling vase flew into</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragments. As quickly as he had drawn it, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust the pistol back into place and stood there</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty handed, looking at her sternly. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">anteroom' came shouting, a rush of feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yolara's face was white, her eyes strained--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">her voice was unshaken as she called to the clamor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing guards:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is nothing--go to your places!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when the sound of their return had ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">she stared tensely at the Irishman--then looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">again at the shattered vase.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is true!" she cried, "but see, the Keth is--</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I followed her pointing finger. Each broken bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of crystal was vibrating, shaking its particles out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into space. Broken it the bullet of Larry's had--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not released it from the grip of the disintegrat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing force. The priestess' face was triumphant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what matters it, 0 shining urn of beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">--what matters it to the vase that is broken what</seg><seg type="columnLine">happens to its fragments?" asked Larry, gravely</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and pointedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The triumph died from her face and for a space</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was silent; brooding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Next," whispered O'Keefe to me. "Lots of sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">280</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">prises in the little box; keep your eye on the open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and see what comes out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had not long to wait. There was a sparkle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of anger about Yolara, something too of injured</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride. She clapped her hands; whispered to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">maid who answered her summons, and then sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">back regarding us, maliciously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have answered me as to your strength--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but you have not proved it; but the Keth you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered. Now answer this!" she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She pointed out into the garden. I saw a flower-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing branch bend and snap as though a hand had</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken it--but no hand was there! Saw then an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other and another bend and break, a little tree</seg><seg type="columnLine">sway and fall--and closer and closer to us came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail of snapping boughs while down into the gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den poured the silvery light revealing--nothing!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now a great ewer beside a pillar rose swiftly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">air and hurled itself crashing at my feet. Cush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ions close to us swirled about as though in the vor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tex of a whirlwind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And unseen hands held my arms in a mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutch fast to my sides, another gripped my throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I felt a needle-sharp poniard pierce my shirt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch the skin just over my heart!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Larry!" I cried, despairingly. I twisted my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head; saw that he too was Caught in this grip of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the invisible. But his face was calm, even amused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep cool, Doc!" he said. "Remember--she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wants to learn the language!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now from Yolara burst chime upon chime of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mocking laughter. She gave a command--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands loosened, the poniard withdrew from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart; suddenly as I had been caught I was free--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unpleasantly weak and shaky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you that in Ireland, Larree!" cried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">priestess--and once more trembled with laughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A good play, Yolara." His voice was as calm</seg><seg type="columnLine">as his face. "But they did that in Ireland even</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Dalua piped away his first man's shadow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And in Goodwin's land they make ships--coria that</seg><seg type="columnLine">go on water--so you can pass by them and see only</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea and sky; and those water coria are each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them many time greater than this whole palace</seg><seg type="columnLine">of yours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the priestess laughed on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It did get* $ie a little," whispered Larry. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't quite up to my mark. But, God! If we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could find that trick out and take it back with us!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not so, Larree!" Yolara gasped, through her</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter. "Not so! Goodwin's cry betrayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HER good humor had entirely returned; she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like a mischievous child pleased over some</seg><seg type="columnLine">successful trick; and like a child she cried--"I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">show you!"--signalled again; whispered to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">maid who, quickly returning, laid before her a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal case. Yolara took from her girdle some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that looked like a small pencil, pressed it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot a thin stream of light for all the world like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric flash- upon its hasp. The lid flew open.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Out of it she drew three flat, oval crystals, faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose in hue. She handed one to O'Keefe and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look!" she commanded, placing the third before</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own eyes. I peered through the stone and in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly there leaped into sight, out of thin air--six</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinning dwarfs! Each was covered from top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">head to soles of feet in a web so tenuous that</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it their bodies were plain. The gauzy</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff seemed to vibrate--its strands to run together</seg><seg type="columnLine">like quicksilver. I snatched the crystal from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and--the chamber was empty! Put it back</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and there were the grinning six!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yolara gave another sign and they disappeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even from the crystals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is what they wear, Larree," explained Yolara,</seg><seg type="columnLine">graciously. "It is something that came to us from</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the Ancient Ones. But we have so few"--she</seg><seg type="columnLine">sighed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Such treasures must be two-edged swords, Yo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lara," commented O'Keefe. "For how know you</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one within them creeps not to you with hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager to strike?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is no danger," she said indifferently. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am the keeper of them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She mused for a space, then abruptly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now no more. You two are to appear be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the Council at a certain time--but fear noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. You, Goodwin, go with Rador about our city</seg><seg type="columnLine">and increase your wisdom. But you, Larree,</seg><seg type="columnLine">await me here in my garden--" she smiled at him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">provocatively--maliciously, too. "For shall not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who has resisted a world of goddesses be given all</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to worship when at last he finds his own?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">She laughed--whole-heartedly and was gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And at that moment I liked Yolara better than ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had before and--alas--better than ever I was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the future.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I noted Rador standing outside the open jade</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and started to go, but O'Keefe caught me by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait a minute," he urged.

Within was a small cube of black crystal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through whose sides I saw, dimly, a rapidly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volving, glowing ball, not more than two inches in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter. Beneath the cube was a curiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped, slender cylinder winding down into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower body of the Nautilus whorl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watch!" said Rador. He motioned me into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehicle and took a place beside me. The driver</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched the lever; a stream of coruscations flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ball down into the cylinder. The shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">started smoothly, and as the tiny torrent of shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">particles increased it gathered speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The corial does not touch the road," explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rador. "It is lifted so far"--he held his forefinger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thumb less than a sixteenth of an inch apart--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"above it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And perhaps here is the best place to explain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">activation of the shells or coria. The force utilized</seg><seg type="columnLine">was atomic energy. Passing from the whirling ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ions darted through the cylinder to two bands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a peculiar metal affixed to the base of the ve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hicles somewhat like skids of a sled. Impinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon these they produced a partial negation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity, lifting the shell slightly, and at the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time creating a powerful repulsive force or thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">that could be directed backward, forward, or side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise at the will of the driver. The creation of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy and the mechanism of its utilization were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">briefly, as follows:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   [Dr. Goodwin's lucid and exceedingly com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> prehensive description of this extraordinary</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> mechanism has been deleted by the Executive</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Council of the International Association of Sci-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ence as too dangerously suggestive to sci-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> entists of the Central European Powers with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> which we were so recently at war.

They formed a gigantic abutment, a titanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">salient. It had been from the very front of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">salient's invading angle that we had emerged; on</seg><seg type="columnLine">each side of it the precipices, faintly glowing, drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and vanished into distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The slender, graceful bridges under which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">skimmed ended at openings in the upflung, far</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls of verdure. Each had its little garrison of</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldiers. Through some of the openings a rivulet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the green obsidian river passed. These were</seg><seg type="columnLine">roadways to the farther country, to the land of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladala, Rador told me; adding that none of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lesser folk could cross into the pavilioned city unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">summoned or with pass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We turned the bend of the road and flew down</seg><seg type="columnLine">that farther emerald ribbon we had seen from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great oval.'

It was more massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">and about it hovered a spirit of ancientness lacking</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the other spans; also its garrison was larger and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at its base the tangent way was guarded by two</seg><seg type="columnLine">massive structures, somewhat like blockhouses, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween which it ran. Something about it aroused'</seg><seg type="columnLine">in me an intense curiosity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where does that road lead, Rador?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To the one place above all of whichnI may not</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you, Goodwin," he answered. And again I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We skimmed slowly out upon the great pier. Far</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the left was the prismatic, rainbow curtain be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the Cyclopean pillars.

All flippancy was gone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rarely did his sense of humor reveal itself in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his answers. He was like a cautious swordsman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fencing, guarding, studying his opponent; or</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather, like a chess-player who keeps sensing some</seg><seg type="columnLine">far-reaching purpose in the game: alert, contained,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchful. Always he stressed the power of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface races, their multitudes, their solidarity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their questions were myriad. What were our</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupations? Our system of government? How</seg><seg type="columnLine">great were the waters? The land? Intensely in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terested were they in the World War just ended,</seg><seg type="columnLine">querying minutely into its causes. In our weapons</seg><seg type="columnLine">their interest was avid. And they were exceedingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute in their examination of us as to the ruins</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had excited our curiosity; their position and</seg><seg type="columnLine">surroundings--and if others than ourselves might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be expected to find and pass through their</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this I shot a glance at Lugur.

I wondered if the German</seg><seg type="columnLine">had told him as yet of the girl of the rosy wall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Moon Pool Chamber and the real reasons for</seg><seg type="columnLine">our search. Then I answered as briefly as possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">--omitting all reference to these things. The red</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwarf watched me with unmistakable amusement--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I knew von Hetzdorp had told him. But clearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lugur had kept his information even from Yolara;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as clearly she had spoken to none of that epi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sode when O'Keefe's automatic had shattered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keth-smitten vase.

"The war's over, but wait till that fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low hears it. He'll blow up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just wait until you hear Yolara lisp a pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">little thing I taught her," said Larry as we set back</seg><seg type="columnLine">for what we now called home. There was an impish</seg><seg type="columnLine">twinkle in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I did hear.

All of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were flower-crowned with the luminous, lovely</seg><seg type="columnLine">blooms--old and young, slender, mocking-eyed girls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwarfed youths, mothers with their babes, gnomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">oldsters--on they poured, silent for the most part</seg><seg type="columnLine">284</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and sullen--a sullenness that held acid bitterness</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as their subtle, half-sinister, half-gay malice</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed tempered into little keen-edged flames, oddly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">menacingly defiant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were many of the green-clad soldiers along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way, and the garrison of the only bridge span I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see had certainly been doubled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wondering still, I turned from my point of ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servation and made my way back to our pavilion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoping that Larry, who had been with Yolara for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the past two hours, had returned. Hardly had I</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached it before Rador came hurrying up, in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner a curious exultancy mingled with what in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any one else I would have called a decided nervous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come !** he commanded before I could speak.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Council has made decision--and Larree is</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaiting you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What has been decided?"

"And why is Larry awaiting me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And at his answer I felt my heart pause in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat and through me race a wave of mingled panic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and eagerness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Shining One dances!" had answered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green dwarf. "And you are to worship!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What was this dancing of the Shining One, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which so often he had spoken?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whatever my forebodings, Larry evidently had</seg><seg type="columnLine">none.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great stuff!" he cried, when we had met in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great'antechamber now empty of the dwarfs. "Hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">it will be worth seeing--have to be something</seg><seg type="columnLine">damned good, though, to catch me, after what I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen of shows at the front," he added.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And remembering, with a little shock of appre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hension, that he had no knowledge of the Dweller</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond my poor description of it--for there are no</seg><seg type="columnLine">words actually to describe what that miracle of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terwoven glory and horror was--I wondered what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larry O'Keefe would say and do when he did behold</seg><seg type="columnLine">it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rador began to show impatience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> . "Come!" he urged. "There is much to be done--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the time grows short!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He led us to a tiny fountain room in whose min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iature pool the white waters were concentrated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearl-like and opalescent in their circling rim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bathe!" he commanded; and set the example by</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripping himself and plunging within. Only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute or two did the green dwarf allow us, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked us as we were about to don our clothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN, to my intense embarrassment, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning, two of the black-haired girls entered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing robes of a peculiar dull-blue hue. At our</seg><seg type="columnLine">manifest discomfort Rador's laughter roared out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took the garments from the pair, motioned them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave us, and, still laughing, threw one around me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its texture was soft, but decidedly metallic--like</seg><seg type="columnLine">some blue metal spun to the fineness of a spider's</seg><seg type="columnLine">thread. The garment buckled tightly at the throat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was girdled at the waist, and, below this cincture,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell to the floor, its folds being held together by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-dozen looped cords; from the shoulders a hood</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembling a monk's cowl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rador cast this over my head; it completely cov-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ered my face, but was of so transparent a texture</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I could see, though somewhat mistily, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Finally he handed us both a pair of long gloves</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the same material and high stockings, the feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which were digitated--five-toed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And again his laughter rang out at our manifest</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The priestess of the Shining One does not alto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether trust the Shining One's Voice," he said at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last. "And these are to guard against any sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">--errors. And fear not, Goodwin," he went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindly. "Not for the Shining One itself would</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yolara see harm come to Larree here--nor, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him, to you. But I would not stake much on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great white one. And for him I am sorry, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him I do like well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is he to be with us?" asked Larry eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is to be where we go," replied the dwarf</seg><seg type="columnLine">soberly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grimly Larry reached down and drew from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">uniform his automatic. He popped a fresh clip into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pocket fold of his girdle. The pistol he slung</seg><seg type="columnLine">high up beneath his arm-pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The green dwarf looked at the weapon curiously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Keefe tapped it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This," said Larry, "slays quicker than the Keth</seg><seg type="columnLine">--I take it so no harm shall come to the blue-eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">one whose name is Olaf. If I should raise it--be</seg><seg type="columnLine">you not in its way, Rador!" he added significantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dwarf nodded again, his eyes sparkling. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust a hand out to both of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A change comes," he said. "What it is I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, nor how it will fall. But this remember--Rador</seg><seg type="columnLine">is more friend to you than you yet can know. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now let us go!" he ended abruptly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He led us, not through the entrance, but into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sloping passage ending in a blind wall; touched a</seg><seg type="columnLine">symbol graven there, and it opened, precisely as had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rosy barrier of the Moon Pool Chamber. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as there, but far smaller, was a passage end, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">low curved wall facing a shaft not black as had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">that abode of living darkness, but faintly lumines-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent. Rador leaned over the wall. The mechanism</seg><seg type="columnLine">clicked and started; the door swung shut; the sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the car slipped into place, and we swept swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the passage; overhead the wind whistled. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few moments the moving platform began to slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. It stopped in a closed chamber no larger than</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rador drew his poniard and struck twice upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall with its hilt. Immediately a panel moved away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealing a space filled with faint, misty blue radi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance. And at each side of the opened portal stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">four of the dwarfish men, grey-headed, old, clad in</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowing garments of white, each pointing toward us</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short silver rod.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rador drew from his girdle a ring and held it out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the first dwarf. He examined it, handed it to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one beside him, and not until each had inspected</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring did they lower their curious weapons; con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainers of that terrific energy they called the Keth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought; and later was to know that I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We stepped out; the doors closed behind us. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">place was weird enough. Its pave was a greenish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue stone resembling lapis-lazuli. On each side</seg><seg type="columnLine">were high pedestals holding carved figures of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MOON POOL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">285</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">same material. There were perhaps a score of these,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in the mistiness I could not make out their out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines. A droning, rushing roar beat upon our ears;</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled the whole cavern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I smell the sea," said Larry suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The roaring became deep-toned, clamorous, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">close in front of us a rift opened. Twenty feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">width, it cut the cavern floor and vanished into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue mist on each side. The cleft was spanned by</seg><seg type="columnLine">one solid slab of rock not more than two yards wide.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It had neither railing nor other protection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The four leading priests marched out upon it one</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one, and we followed. In thg middle of the span</seg><seg type="columnLine">they knelt. Ten feet beneath us was a torrent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue sea-water racing with prodigious speed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween polished walls. It gave the impression of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast depth. It roared as it sped by, and far to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right was a low arch through which it disappeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was so swift that its Surface shone like polished</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue steel, and from it came the blessed, our worldly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar ocean breath that strengthened my soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazingly and made me realize how earth-sick I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whence came the stream, I marvelled, forgetting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the moment, as we passed on again, all else.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Were we closer to the surface of earth than I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, or was this some mighty flood falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">through an opening in sea floor, Heaven alone knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">how many miles above us, losing itself in deeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">abysses beyond these? How near and how far this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was from the truth I was to learn--and never did</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth come to man in more dreadful guise!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The roaring fell away, the blue haze lessened. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of us stretched a wide flight of steps, huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">as those which had led us into the courtyard of Nan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tauach through the ruined sea-gate. We scaled it;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it narrowed; from above light poured through a still</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrower opening. Side by side Larry and I passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TirE had emerged upon an enormous platform</seg><seg type="columnLine">▼ V of what seemed to be glistening ivory. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched before us for a hundred yards or more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then shelved gently into the white waters. Op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posite--not a mile away--was that prodigious web</seg><seg type="columnLine">of woven rainbows Rador had called the Veil of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shining One. There it shone in all its unearthly</seg><seg type="columnLine">grandeur, on each side of-the Cyclopean, pillars, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though a mountain should stretch up arms raising</seg><seg type="columnLine">between them a fairy banner of auroral glories.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beneath it was the curved, scimitar sweep of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pier with its clustered, gleaming temples.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before that brief, fascinated glance was done,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there dropped upon my soul a sensation as of brood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing weight intolerable; a spiritual oppression as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though some vastness was falling, pressing, stifling</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I turned--and Larry caught me as I reeled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Steady! Steady, old man!" he whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first all that my staggering consciousness could</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize was an immensity, an immeasurable uprear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that brought with it the same throat-gripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertigo as comes from gazing downward from some</seg><seg type="columnLine">great height--then a blur of white faces--intoler-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able shinings of hundreds upon thousands of eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huge, incredibly huge, a colossal amphitheatre of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jet, a stupendous semi-circle, held within its mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">arc the ivory platform on which I stood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It reared itself almost perpendicularly hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of feet up into the sparkling heavens, and thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on each side its ebon bulwarks--like mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strous paws. Now, the giddiness from its sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatness passing, I saw that it was indeed an am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phitheatre sloping slightly backward tier after tier,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the white blur of faces against its black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, the gleaming of countless eyes were those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">myriads of the people who sat silent, flower-gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed, their gaze focused upon the rainbow curtain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sweeping over me like a torrent--tangible, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">palling !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Five hundred feet beyond, the smooth, high re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining wall of the amphitheatre raised itself--</seg><seg type="columnLine">above it the first terrace of the seats, and above this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividing the tiers for another half a thousand feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward, set within them like a panel, was a dead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">black surface in which shone faintly with a bluish</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiance a gigantic disk; above it and around it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluster of innumerable smaller ones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On each side of me, bordering the platform, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">scores of small pillared alcoves, a low wall stretch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing across their fronts; delicate, fretted grills</seg><seg type="columnLine">shielding them, save where in each lattice an open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing stared--it came to me that they were like those</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalls in ancient Gothic cathedrals wherein for cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turies had kneeled paladins and people of my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">race on earth's fair face. And within these alcoves</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gathered, score upon score, the elfin beauties,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dwarfish men of the fair-haired folk. At my</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, a few feet from the opening through which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had come, a passageway led back between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fretted stalls. Half-way between us and the mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive base of the amphitheatre a dais rose. Up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform to it a wide ramp ascended; and on ramp</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dais and along the centre of the gleaming plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form down to where it kissed the white waters, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad ribbon of the radiant flowers lay like a fairy</seg><seg type="columnLine">carpet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On one side of this dais, meshed in a silken web</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hid no line or curve of her sweet body, white</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh gleaming through its folds, stood Yolara; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite her, crowned with a circlet of flashing blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones, his mighty body stark bare, was Lugur!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> O'Keefe drew a long breath; Rador touched my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm and, still dazed, I let myself be drawn into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aisle and through a corridor that ran behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alcoves. At the back of one of these the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwarf paused, opened a door, and motioned us with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Entering, I found that we were exactly opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the ramp ran up to the dais--and that Yolara</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not more than fifty feet away.

Her eyes were ablaze with</seg><seg type="columnLine">little dancing points of light; her body seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">palpitate, the rounded delicate muscles beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">translucent skin to run with joyful little eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Larry whistled softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">.

And upon the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, before Yolara's arms fell, there issued, appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently from the air around us, a peal of sound that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been the shouting of some playful god</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurling great suns through the net of stars. , It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the deepest notes of all the organs in the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">combined in one; summoning, majestic, cosmic!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It held within it the thunder of the spheres rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the infinite, the birth-song of suns made</seg><seg type="columnLine">manifest in the womb of space; echoes of creation's</seg><seg type="columnLine">supernal chord! It shook the body like a pulse from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart of the universe--pulsed--and died away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On its death came a blaring as of all the trumpets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of conquering hosts since the first Pharaoh led his</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarms--triumphal, compelling! Alexander's clam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ouring hosts, brazen-throated wolf-horns of Caesar's</seg><seg type="columnLine">legions, blare of trumpets of Genghis Khan and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden horde, clangor of the locust levies of Tamer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lane, bugles of Napoleon's armies--war-shout of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's conquerors! And it died!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fast upon it, a throbbing, muffled tumult of harp</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds, mellownesses of myriads of wood horns, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subdued sweet shrilling of multitudes of flutes, Pan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dean pipings--inviting, carrying with them the call-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of waterfalls in the hidden places, rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">brooks and .murmuring forest winds--calling, call-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, languorous, lulling, dripping into the brain like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very honeyed essence of sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And after them a silence in which the memory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the music seemed to beat, to beat ever more faintly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through every quivering nerve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From me all fear, all apprehension, had fled. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">their place was nothing but joyous anticipation, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">supernal freedom from even the shadow of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow of care or sorrow; not now did anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter--Olaf or his haunted, hate-filled eyes;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Throckmartin or his fate--nothing of pain, nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of agony, nothing of striving or endeavor or de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spair in that wide outer world that had turned sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly to a troubled dream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more the first great note pealed out! Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more it died and from the clustered spheres a kale-</seg><seg type="columnLine">idoscopic blaze shot as though drawn from the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jestic sound itself. The many-colored rays darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the white waters and sought the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">irised Veil. As they touched, it sparkled, flamed,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wavered, and shook with fountains of prismatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">color.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The light increased--and in its intensity the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver air darkened. Faded into shadow that white</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosaic of flower-crowned faces set in the amphi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">theatre of jet, and vast shadows dropped upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-flung tiers and shrouded them. But on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirts of the rays the fretted stalls in which we sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the fair-haired ones blazed out, iridescent, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">jewels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was sensible of an acceleration of every pulse;</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wild stimulation of every nerve. I felt myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">being lifted above the world--close to the threshold</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the high gods--soon their essence and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">power would stream out into me! I glanced at Larry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes were--wild--with life!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked at Olaf--and in his face was none of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">--only hate, and hate, and hate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The peacock waves streamed out over the waters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleaving the seeming darkness, a rainbow path of</seg><seg type="columnLine">glory.

I felt O'Keefe grip my arm; Yolara</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw her white arms out in a welcoming gesture; I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard from the tiers a sigh of rapture--and in it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">poignant, wailing undertone of agony!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Over the waters, down the light stream, to the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ivory pier, flew the Shining One. Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">its crystal pizzicati drifted inarticulate murmurings</seg><seg type="columnLine">--deadly sweet, stilling the heart and setting it leap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing madly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a moment it paused, poised itself, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">came whirling down the flower path to its priest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ess, slowly, ever more slowly. It hovered for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment between the woman and the dwarf, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though contemplating them; turned to her with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm of tinklings softened, its murmurings infi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nitely caressing. Bent toward it, Yolara seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gather within herself pulsing waves of power; she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was terrifying; gloriously, maddeningly evil; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as gloriously, maddeningly heavenly! ' Aphrodite</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Virgin! Tanith of the Carthaginians and</seg><seg type="columnLine">St. Bride of the Isles! A queen of hell and a prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess of heaven--in one!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Only ijor a moment did that which we had called</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Dweller and which these named the Shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">One, pause. It swept up the ramp to the dais, rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, slowly turning, plumes and spirals lacing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlacing, throbbing, pulsing. Now its nucleus grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainer, stronger--human in a fashion, and all in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">human; neither man nor woman; neither god nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil; subtly partaking of all. Nor could I doubt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever it was, within that shining nucleus was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something sentient; something that had will and</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MOON POOL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">287</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">energy, and in some awful, supernormal fashion--</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligence!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another trumpeting--a sound of stones opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a long, low wail of utter anguish--something</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved shadowy in the river of light, and slowly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, then ever more rapidly, shapes swam through</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. There were half a score of them--girls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">youths, women and men. The Shining One poised</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, regarded them. They drew closer, and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of each and in their faces was the bud of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">awful intermingling of emotions, of joy and sor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row, ecstasy and terror, that I had seen in full blos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">som on Throckmartin's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Thing began again its murmurings--now</seg><seg type="columnLine">infinitely caressing, coaxing--like the song of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">siren from some witched star! And the bell-sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">rang out--compellingly, calling--calling--calling--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw Olaf lean far out of his place; saw, half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciously, at Lugur's signal, three of the dwarfs</seg><seg type="columnLine">creep in and take places, unnoticed, behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the first of the figures rushed upon the dais</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and paused. It was the girl who had been brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Yolara when the gnome named Songar was</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven into the nothingness! With all the quickness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light a spiral of the Shining One stretched out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and encircled her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At its touch there was an infinitely dreadful</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrinking and, it seemed, a simultaneous hurling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself into its radiance. As it wrapped its swirls</seg><seg type="columnLine">around her, permeated her--the crystal chorus burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth--tumultuously; through and through her the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiance pulsed. Began then that infinitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreadful, but infinitely glorious rhythm they</seg><seg type="columnLine">called the dance of the Shining One. And as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl swirled within its sparkling mists an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other and another flew into its embrace, until, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last, the dais was an incredible vision; a mad star's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Witches' Sabbath; an altar of white faces and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies gleaming through living flame; transfused</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rapture insupportable. and horror that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hellish--and ever, radiant plumes and spirals ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panding, the core of the Shining One waxed--grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing greater--as it consumed, as it drew into and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through itself the life-force of these lost ones!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So they spun, interlaced--and there began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulse from them life, vitality, as though the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">essence of nature was filling us. Dimly I recog-,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized that what I was beholding was vamDirism in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conceivable ! The banked tiers chanted. The mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds pealed forth!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a Saturnalia of demigods !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, whirling, bell-notes storming, the Shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">One withdrew slowly from the dais down the ramp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still embracing, still interwoven with those who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown themselves into its spirals. They drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it as though half-carried in dreadful dance;</seg><seg type="columnLine">white faces sealed--forever--into that semblance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who held within linked God and devil--I cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">. ered my eyes!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I heard a gasp from O'Keefe; opened my eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">.sought his; saw the wildness vanish from them as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he strained forward. Olaf had leaned far out, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he' did so the dwarfs beside him caught him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether by design or through his own swift, invol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">untary movement, thrust him half into the Dweller's</seg><seg type="columnLine">path. The Dweller paused in its gyrations--seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to watch him. The Norseman's face was crimson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes blazing. He threw himself back and, with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one defiant shout, gripped one of the dwarfs abotffc</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle and sent him hurtling through the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight at the radiant Thing! A whirling mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs and arms, the dwarf flew--then in mid-flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped as though some gigantic invisible hand had</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught him, and--was dashed down upon the plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form not a yard from the Shining One!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a broken spider he moved--feebly--once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice. From the Dweller shot a shimmering ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacle--touched him--recoiled. Its crystal tinklings</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed into an angry chiming. From all about</seg><seg type="columnLine">--jewelled stalls and jet peak--came a sigh of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credulous horror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LUGUR leaped forward. On the instant Larry</seg><seg type="columnLine">was over the low barrier between the pillars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing to the Norseman's side. And even as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran there was another wild shout from Olaf, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hurled himself out, straight at the throat of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dweller!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before he could touch the Shining One, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless--and never was the thing more horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">than then, with the purely human suggestion of sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise plain in its poise--Larry had struck him aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tried to follow--and was held by Rador. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was trembling--but not with fear. In his face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredulous hope, inexplicable eagerness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait!" he said. "Wait!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Shining One stretched out a slow spiral, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it did so I saw the bravest thing man has ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">witnessed. Instantly O'Keefe thrust himself be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween it and Olaf, pistol out. The tentacle touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and the dull blue of his robe flashed out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinding, intense azure light. From the automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his gloved hand came three quick bursts of flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight into the Thing. The Dweller drew back;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bell-sounds swelled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lugur paused, his hands darted up, and in it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the silver Keth cones. But before he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash it upon the Norseman, Larry had unlooped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">robe, thrown its fold over Olaf, and, holding him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one hand away from the Shining One, thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the other his pistol into the dwarf's stomach.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His lips moved, but I could not hear what he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Lugur understood, for his hand dropped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now Yolara was there--all this had taken barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than five seconds. She thrust herself between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three men and the Dweller. She spoke to it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the wild buzzing died down; the gay crystal</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinklings burst forth again. The Thing murmured</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her--began to whirl--faster, faster--passed down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ivory pier, out upon the waters, bearing with it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">meshed in its light, the sacrifices--swept on ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">more /swiftly, triumphantly and turning, turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its ghastly crew, vanished through the Veil!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abruptly the polychromatic path snapped out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The silver light poured in upon us. From all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">amphitheatre arose a clamour, a shouting. Von</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hetzdorp, his eyes staring, was leaning out, listen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Unrestrained now by Rador, I vaulted the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rushed forward. But not before I had heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green dwarf murmur:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is something stronger than the Shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">One! Two things--yea--a strong heart--and hate!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Olaf, panting, eyes glazed, trembling, shrank be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath my hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The devil that took my Helma!" I heard him</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisner. "The Shining Devil!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">288</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Both these men," Lugur was raging, "they shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">dance with the Shining One.

She rested her hand on Larry's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder. "He shall not dance. No--nor his friend!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have told you I care not for this one!" She</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to Olaf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Neither this man, nor this," said Larry, "shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">be harmed. This is my word, Yolara!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even so," she answered quietly, "my lord!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw von Hetzdorp stare at O'Keefe with a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">and curiously speculative interest. Lugur's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew hellish; he raised his arms as though to strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Larry's pistol prodded him rudely enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No rough stuff now, kid!" said O'Keefe in Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lish. The red dwarf quivered, turned--caught a</seg><seg type="columnLine">robe from a priest standing by, and threw it over</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. The ladala, shouting, gesticulating, fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with the soldiers, were jostling down from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiers of jet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come!" commanded Yolara--her eyes rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Larry. "Your heart is great, indeed--ray lord!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she murmured; and her voice was very sweet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This man comes with us, Yolara," said O'Keefe</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing to Olaf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bring him," she said.

Silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">Olaf strode beside me. Rador had disappeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Down the stairway, through the hall of turquoise</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist, over the rushing sea-stream we went and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the wall through which we had entered. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">white-robed ones had gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yolara pressed; the portal opened. We stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the car; she took the lever; we raced through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faintly luminous corridor to the house of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">priestess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And one thing now I knew sick at heart and soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truth had come to me---no more need to search</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Throckmartin. Behind that Veil, in the lair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Dweller, dead-alive like those we had just seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">swim in its shining train was he, and Edith, Stan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton and Thora and Olaf Huldricksson's wife!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">npHE car came to rest; the portal opened; Yolara</seg><seg type="columnLine">I leaped out lightly, beckoned and flitted up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridor. She paused before an ebon screen. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">a touch it vanished, revealing an entrance to a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue chamber, glowing as though cut from the heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some gigantic sapphire; bare, save that in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">centre, upon a low pedestal, stood a great globe fash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ioned from milky rock-crystal; upon its surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">were faint tracings as of seas and continents, but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if so, either of some other world or of this world in</seg><seg type="columnLine">immemorial past, for in no way did they resemble</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mapped coast lines of our earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Poised upon the globe, rising from it out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, locked in each other's arms, lips to lips, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">two figures, a woman and. a man, so exquisite, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifelike, that for the moment I failed to realize that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">they, too, were carved of the crystal. And before</seg><seg type="columnLine">this shrine--for nothing else could it be, I knew--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">three slender cones raised themselves: one of purest</seg><seg type="columnLine">white flame, one of opalescent water, and the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">of--moonlight! There was no mistaking them, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of a tall man each stood--but how water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame, and light were held so evenly, so steadily in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their spire-shapes, I could not tell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yblara bowed lowly--once, twice, thrice. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to O'Keefe, nor by slightest look or gesture</seg><seg type="columnLine">betrayed she knew others than he were there.

With appalling effort the red dwarf</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlled himself; he saluted the priestess iron-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ically, I thought; took his place at the further end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the oval. And now I noted that the figures be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween were the seven of that Council of which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shining One's priestess and Voice were the heads.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The tension relaxed, but did not pass--as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">a storm-cloud should turn away, but still lurk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TV/TY gaze ran back.

Half-smiling, half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abstractedly, he took it, touched his own lips where</seg><seg type="columnLine">hers had kissed; drained it. A nod from Yolara</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the maid refilled his goblet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At once there was a swift transformation in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irishman.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised her own glass--but within it was not that</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear drink that filled Larry's! And again he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drained his own; and, lifting it, full once more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the baleful eyes of Lugur, and held it</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him mockingly.

Of each pair one bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">clasped to breast a globe of that milky crystal in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sapphire shrine-room; the other a harp, small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped somewhat like the ancient clarsach of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Druids.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two by two they stepped upon the raised plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form, placed gently upon it each their globe; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">two by two crouched behind them.

A languor stole through me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The rosy lights upon'the tripods began to die away,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and as they faded the milky globes gleamed forth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brighter, ever brighter.

The song whispered away. A throb-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bing arpeggio dripped from the harps, and as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">notes pulsed out, up from the globes, as though</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">striving to follow, pulsed with them tips of moon-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fire cones, such as I had seen before Yolara's altar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Weirdly, caressingly, compellingly the harp notes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">throbbed in repeated, re-repeated theme, holding</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">within itself the same archaic golden quality I had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">noted in the singing. And over the moon flame</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pinnacles rose higher!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Yolara lifted her arms; within her hands were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clasped O'Keefe's.

It fell, a rippling, wondrous cas-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cade, veiling both her and O'Keefe to their girdles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--and now the shining coils of moon fire had crept</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to their knees--circling higher--higher.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   And ever despair grew deeper in my soul5</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  What was that!

From without came a blaring of trumpets,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the sound of running men,,loud murmurings. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tumult drew closer. I heard cries of "Lakla!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Lakla!" Now it was at the very threshold and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">within it, oddly, as though punctuating the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clamor, a deep-toned, almost abyssmal, booming</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sound thunderously bass and reverberant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Abruptly the JjUpings ceased; the moon fires</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shuddered, fell, and began to sweep back into the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crystal globes; Yolara's swaying form grew rigid,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">every atom of it listening. She threw aside the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">veiling cloud of hair, and in the gleam of the last</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">retreating spirals her face glared out like some</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Greek mask of tragedy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sweet lips that even at their sweetest could</seg><seg type="columnLine">never lose their delicate cruelty, had no sweetness</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. They were drawn into a square--inhuman</seg><seg type="columnLine">as that of the Medusa; in her eyes were the fires of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pit, and her hair seemed to writhe like the ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pent locks of that Gorgon whose mouth she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">borrowed; all her beauty was transformed into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nameless thing--hideous, inhuman, blasting! If</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was the true soul of Yolara springing to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, then, I thought, God help us in very deed!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I wrested my gaze away to O'Keefe. All drunk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enness gone, himself again, he was staring down</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her, and in his eyes were loathing and horror</seg><seg type="columnLine">unutterable. So they stood--and the light fled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONLY for a moment did the darkness hold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With lightning swiftness the blackness that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the chamber's other wall vanished. Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a portal open between grey screens, the silver spar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kling radiance poured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And through the portal marched, two by two,</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible, nightmare figures--frog-men, giants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taller by nearly a yard than even tall O'Keefe!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their enormous saucer eyes were irised by wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">bands of green-flecked red, in which the phosphor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">escence flickered. Their long muzzles, lips half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">open in monstrous grin, held rows of glistening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender, lancet sharp fangs. Over the glaring eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose a horny helmet, a carapace of black and</seg><seg type="columnLine">orange scales, studded with foot-long lance-headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">horns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They lined themselves like soldiers on each side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wide table aisle, and now I could see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">their horny armor covered shoulders and backs, ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the chest in knobbed cuirass, and at wrists</seg><seg type="columnLine">and heels jutted out into curved, murderous spurs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The webbed hands and feet ended in yellow, spade-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped claws.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They carried spears ten feet, at least, in length,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heads of which were pointed cones, glistening</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that same covering, from whose touch of swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">decay I had so narrowly saved Rador.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were grotesque, yes--more grotesque than</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything I had 'ever seen or dreamed, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were--terrible!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, quietly, through their ranks came--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl! Behind her, enormous pouch at his throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">swelling in and out menacingly, in one paw a tree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like, spike-studded mace, a frog-man, huger than</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of the others, guarding. But of him I caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a fleeting, involuntary impression--all my gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">was for her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For it was she who had pointed out to us the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way from the peril of the Dweller's lair on Nan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tauach. And as I looked at her, I marvelled that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever could I have thought the priestess more beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful. Into the eyes of O'Keefe rushed joy and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">utter abasement of shame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And from all about came murmurs--edged with</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger, half-incredulous, tinged with fear:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lakla!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lakla!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The handmaiden!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She halted close beside me. From firm little chin</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dainty buskined feet she was swathed in soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MOON POOL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">293</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">robes of dull, almost coppery hue. The left arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hidden, the right free and gloved. Wound</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight about it was one of the vines of the sculp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured wall and of Lugur's circled signet-ring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thick, a vivid green, its tendrils ran between</seg><seg type="columnLine">her fingers, stretching out four flowered heads that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed like blossoms cut from gigantic, glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So she stood contemplating Yolara. Then drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps by my gaze, she dropped her eyes upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">me; golden, translucent, with tiny flecks of amber</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their aureate irises, the soul that looked through</seg><seg type="columnLine">them was as far removed from that flaming out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the priestess's as zenith above nadir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I noted the low, broad brow, the proud little nose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tender mouth, and the soft--sunlight--glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">that seemed to transfuse the delicate skin. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly in the eyes dawned a smile--sweet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly, a touch of roguishness, profoundly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">assuring in its all humanness. I felt my heart ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pand as though freed from fetters, a recrudescence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of confidence in the essential reality of things--as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though in nightmare the struggling consciousness</seg><seg type="columnLine">should glimpse some familiar face and know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrors with which it strove were dreams. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">involuntarily I smiled back at her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE raised her head and looked again at Yolara,</seg><seg type="columnLine">contempt and a certain curiosity in her gaze;</seg><seg type="columnLine">at O'Keefe--and through the softened eyes drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly a shadow of sorrow, and on its fleeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings deepest interest, and hovering over that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">naive approval as reassuringly human as had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">her smile.	v</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She spoke, and her voice, deep-timbred, liquid</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold as was Yolara's all silver, was subtly the syn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thesis of all the golden glowing beauty of her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Silent Ones have sent me, O Yolara," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.

Beneath the insult and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the acid disdain, the blood rushed up under Lakla's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambered ivory skin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yolara"--her voice was low--"of no use is it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to question me.

Yolara spat the word. "No! Now by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thanaroa and by the Shining One, no!" Her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazed, her nostrils were wide, in her fair throat</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little pulse beat angrily. "You, Lakla--take you</seg><seg type="columnLine">my message to the Silent Ones.

"Three tal have you to take coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sel, Yolara.

It shone like a mirrored lakelet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of jet; on each side of it arose what at first glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed towering bulwarks of the same ebon ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidian; at second, revealed themselves as struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures hewn and set in place by men; polished faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">pierced by dozens of high, narrow windows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down each facade a stairway fell, broken by</seg><seg type="columnLine">small landings on which a door opened; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped to a broad ledge of greyish stone edging</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lip of this midnight pool and upon it also fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">two wide flights from either side of the bridge</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform..

In this murk, unlike all</seg><seg type="columnLine">others I had seen, I sensed movement, a quivering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tremor constant and rhythmic; not to be seen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet caught by some subtle sense; as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">it beat a swift pulse of--black light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The green dwarf turned the corial slowly to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge at the right; crept cautiously on toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">where, not more than a hundred feet from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrier, a low, wide entrance opened in the fort.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guarding its threshold stood two guards, armed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with broadswords, double-handed, terminating in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide luriette mouthed with murderous fangs.

The corial's flight was</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked as by a giant's hand. The shell swerved</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickeningly; there was an oddly metallic splinter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing'; it quivered; shot ahead.

Not until long after, were we to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it had been the dying hand of Serku, groping</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of oblivion, that had cast it after us as a fowler</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon an escaping bird.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Snappy work, Rador!"

All</seg><seg type="columnLine">this stuff that seems so strange and--and, well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of supernatural, is just a lot of tricks we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hep to as yet. Why, Olaf, suppose you took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fijian when the war was on and set him suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in London with autos rushing past, sirens</seg><seg type="columnLine">blowing, Archies popping, a dozen Boche planes</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping bombs, and the searchlights shooting all</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the sky--wouldn't he think he was among</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty-third degree devils in some exclusive circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hell? Sure he would! And yet everything he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw would be natural--just as natural as all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">w!!l ke once we the answer to it. Not that we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fijians, of course, but the principle is the same."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Norseman considered this; nodded gravely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ja!" he answered at last.

And one have I hope in for mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helma--the white maiden. Since I have turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old gods it has been made clear to me that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall slay Lugur and that the Heks, the evil witch</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yolara, shall also die. But I would talk with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white maiden."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," said Larry, "but just don't be afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what you don't understand. There's another</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing"--he hesitated, nervously--"there's another</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that may startle you a bit when we meet up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Lakla--her--er--frogs!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Like the frog-women we saw on the wall?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Olaf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," went on Larry, rapidly. "It's this way--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I figure that the frogs grow rather large where she</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives, and they're a bit different too. Well, Lakla's</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a lot of 'em trained.

The light too had changed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone were the dancing, sparkling atoms and the' sil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ver had faded to a soft, almost ashen greyness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ahead of us marched a rampart of coppery cliffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising, like all these mountainous walls we had seen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the immensities of haze. Something long</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifting in my subconsciousness turned to startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">realization. The speed of the shell was slackening!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The aperture containing the ionizing mechanism</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still open; I glanced within. The whirling ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fire was not dimmed, but its coruscations, instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pouring down through the cylinder, swirled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">300</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eddied and shot back as though trying to re-enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">their source. Rador nodded grimly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Shadow takes its toll," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We topped a rise--Larry gripped my arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look!" he cried, and pointed. Far, far behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, so far that the road was but a glistening thread,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a score of shining points came speeding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lugur and his men," said Rador.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't you step on her?" asked Larry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Step on her?" repeated the green dwarf,</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give her more speed; push her," explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Keefe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rador looked about him. The coppery ramparts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were close, not more than three of our miles dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant; in front of us the plain lifted in a long roll-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing swell, and up this the corial essayed to go--</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a terrifying lessening of speed. Faintly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind us came shoutings, and we knew that Lugur</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew close. Nor anywhere was there sign of Lakla</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor her frog-men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now we were half-way to the crest; the shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely crawled and from beneath it came a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">hissing; it quivered, and I knew that its base was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no longer held above the glassy surface but rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One last chance!" exclaimed Rador. He pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the control lever and wrenched it from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">socket. Instantly the sparkling ball expanded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling with prodigious rapidity and sending a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cascade of coruscations into the cylinder. The shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose; leaped through the air; the dark crystal split</seg><seg type="columnLine">into fragments; the fiery ball dulled; died--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the impetus of that last thrust we reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crest. Poised there for a moment, I caught a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of the road dropping down the side of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous moss-covered, bowl-shaped valley whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply curved sides ended abruptly at the base of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the towering barrier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then down the steep, powerless to guide or to</seg><seg type="columnLine">check the shell, we plunged in a meteor rush</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight for the annihilating adamantine breasts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliffs!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the quick thinking of Larry's air training</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to our aid. As the rampart reared close he</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw himself upon Rador; hurled him and him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self against the side of the flying whorl. Under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shock the finely balanced machine swerved</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its course. It struck the soft, low bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the road, shot high in air, bounded on through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thick carpeting, whirled like a dervish and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon its side. Shot from it, we rolled for yards,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the moss saved broken bones or serious bruise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick!" cried the green dwarf. He seized an</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm, dragged me to my feet, began running to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff base not a hundred feet away. Beside us raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Keefe and Olaf. At our left was the black road.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It stopped abruptly--was cut off by a slab of pol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished crimson stone a hundred feet high, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide, set within the coppery face of the barrier.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On each side of it stood pillars, cut from the living</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock and immense, almost, as those which held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rainbow veil of the Dweller. Across its face weaved</seg><seg type="columnLine">unnameable carvings--but I had no time for more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a glance. The green dwarf gripped my arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick!" he cried again. "The handmaiden has</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the right of the Portal ran a low wall of shat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered rock. Over this we raced like rabbits. Hid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den behind it was a narrow path. Crouching,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rador in the lead, we sped along it; three hundred,</seg><seg type="columnLine">four hundred yards we raced--and the path ended</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a cid de sac! To our ears was borne a louder</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first of the pursuing shells had swept over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lip of the great bowl, poised for a moment as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had and then began a cautious descent. Within</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, scanning the slopes, I saw Lugur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A little closer and I'll get him!" whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larry viciously. He raised his pistol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His hand was caught in a mighty grip; Rador,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes blazing, stood beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" rasped the green dwarf. He heaved a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder against one of the boulders that formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pocket. It rocked aside, revealing a slit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In!" ordered he, straining against the weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stone. O'Keefe slipped through, Olaf at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, I following. With a lightning leap the dwarf</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beside me, the huge rock missing him by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hairbreadth as it swung into place!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were in Cimmerian darkness. I felt for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket-flash and recalled with distress that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left it behind with my medicine kit when we fled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the gardens. But Rador seemed to need no</seg><seg type="columnLine">light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Grip hands!" he ordered. We crept, single file,</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding to each other like children, through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black. At last the green dwarf paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Await me here," he whispered. "Do not move.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And for your lives--be silent!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXIII</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dragon Worm and Moss Death</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a small eternity--to me at least--we</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited. Then as silent as ever the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwarf returned. "It is well," he said, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the strain gone from his voice. "Grip hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and follow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait a bit, Rador," this was Larry. "Does</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lugur know this side entrance? If he does* why</seg><seg type="columnLine">not let Olaf and me go back to the opening and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick them off as they come in? We could hold tfte</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot--and in the meantime you and Goodwin could</seg><seg type="columnLine">go after Lakla for help."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lugur knows the secret of the Portal--if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare use it," answered the captain, with a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">indirection. "And now that they have challenged</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Silent Ones I think he will dare. Also, he will</seg><seg type="columnLine">find our tracks--and it may be that he knows this</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, for God's sake!" O'Keefe's appalled be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wilderment was almost ludicrous. "If Kc knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that, and you knew all that, why didn't you let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me click him when I had the chance?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Larree" the green dwarf was oddly humble.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It seemed good to me, too--at first. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard a command, heard it clearly, to stop you--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Lugur die not now, lest a greater vengeance</seg><seg type="columnLine">fail!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MOON POOL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">301</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Command? From whom?" The Irishman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice distilled out of the blackness the very essence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bewilderment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought," Rador was whispering--"I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it came from the Silent Ones!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Superstition!" groaned O'Keefe in utter exas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peration. "Always superstition! What can you</seg><seg type="columnLine">do against it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind, Rador." His sense of humor came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his aid. "It's too late now, anyway. Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">do we go from here, old dear?" he laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We tread the path of one I am not fain to meet,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered Rador. "But if meet we must, point the</seg><seg type="columnLine">death tubes at the pale shield he bears upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat and send the flame into the flower of cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire that is its centre--nor look into his eyes!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Again Larry gasped, and I with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's getting too deep for me, Doc," he muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">dejectedly. "Can you make head or tail of it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No," I answered, shortly enough, "but Rador</seg><seg type="columnLine">fears something and that's his description of it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sure," he replied, "only it's a code I don't under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand." I could feel his grin. "All right for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flower of cold fire, Rador, and I won't look into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes," he went on cheerfully. "But hadn't we</seg><seg type="columnLine">better be moving?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come!" said the soldier; again hand in hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">we went blindly on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> O'Keefe was muttering to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Flower of cold fire!

Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckled and carolled, softly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> . "Oh, mama, pin a cold rose on me;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Two young frog-men are in love with me;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Shut my eyes so I can't see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sh!"

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">a remote corner of the estate, at some distance from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house, stood the building which young Sidelburg</seg><seg type="columnLine">used as his private workshop. It was remarkably</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-equipped, with an electric switchboard, giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large range of currents, both direct and alternate</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and at high and low voltage.

The two-dimensional eauivalent to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is that in two-space it is impossible to alter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third dimension, yet by compressing it in two di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mensions, the third will be increased while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">volume will remain constant."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though rather technical, this sounded perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">consistent to me; but in order to be sure of my com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete comprehension, young Sidelburg elucidated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">amplified, and illustrated the discussion of the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject of hyper-space, somewhat as follows:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suppose we start with a point and move it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">unit distance, say a foot, in any definite direction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is exactly what we do when we draw a line</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the point of a lead pencil. The line which re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sults is an object of one dimension, which is length.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If, however, we move our line at right angles to</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself for any distance, a plane having two dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions, length and width, is generated. For instance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I draw out this curtain, which looks like a mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">stick, or line, a flat surface or plane is formed. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if our plane is moved at right angles to both its</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensions, a three-dimensional solid or cube is pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced. We might illustrate this by the opening of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an opera hat or Japanese lantern. Let us continue</seg><seg type="columnLine">the process one step further, moving our solid cube</seg><seg type="columnLine">its own length at right angles to each of its three</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensions. Then we should have a four-dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional unit, which mathematicians call a hyper-cube</seg><seg type="columnLine">01* tesseract. As you doubtless know, I have worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the mathematical formulas of several other reg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ular four-dimensional objects. To these I have given</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">appropriate names such as polyhedrigons, sextaco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siahedragons, and hecatonicosiahedragons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here is another conception of a four-dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sioned object, based on the circle rather than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cube, and on rotation rather than movement at</seg><seg type="columnLine">right angles. Let us go back to our one-dimensional</seg><seg type="columnLine">line and rotate it about a point midway between</seg><seg type="columnLine">its extremities. What is formed? Clearly, a circle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which has extension in two dimensions. Next, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotate our circle (a plane), about one of its diam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eters (a line), as an axis, and we get a three-dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional solid, it may be a sphere. Now, the question</seg><seg type="columnLine">arises, what will happen if we rotate our sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a plane which passes through its center?</seg><seg type="columnLine">This would mean rotation through a fourth dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion, and a four-dimensional hyper-sphere would</seg><seg type="columnLine">result. Can you not easily imagine such a thing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I confessed that I could not conceive of rotating a</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid object about a plane and through a fourth di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," he continued, "such an idea is con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trary to our common-sense notions, since we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">constantly hedged about with three dimensional</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects and three-dimensional concepts.

Just as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two halves of a symmetrical two-dimensional ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject, such as a leaf will fit if folded over along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of the midrib, through the third dimension, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">the human body if rotated on a plane through a*</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth dimension, would fit part on part.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a simple matter to find out how you would</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear if you turned around through the fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimension.

By applying pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure to an object in the direction of its fourth di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mension, its four-dimensional extension will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">diminished, and all its other dimensions will be in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased.

Just as I built up a three-dimensional cyl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inder by piling together a large number of circles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I have constructed a hyper-cylinder, or four-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensional roller by joining together a large num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of spheres."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He then called my attention to certain parts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism which had interested me particularly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since they were the most distinctive features of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine.

Of course, it was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular in shape than either of these objects, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was composed of the six-inch spheres which I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentioned before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus Sidelburg continued: "Just as a solid is</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounded by surfaces, so a four-dimensional object</seg><seg type="columnLine">is bounded by solids. Bear in mind that in group-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing these spheres together they cannot be placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">side by side, one in front of the other, or one on top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the other, as any one of these methods of joining</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would simply be extending the object in one of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">three dimensions. They cannot be arranged next to</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other, but must be put through each other or</seg><seg type="columnLine">around each other. It doesn't matter much which</seg><seg type="columnLine">way you look at it, but perhaps the term 'around' is</seg><seg type="columnLine">easier to comprehend than 'through'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rollers were eight in number, and were ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged in the form of an octagon surrounding an</seg><seg type="columnLine">open space about six feet across. That is, the space</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jooked open. The youthful inventor explained that</seg><seg type="columnLine">owing to a considerable, but invisible extension of</seg><seg type="columnLine">each of the rollers in the fourth dimension, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">space was really full, except for a very small aper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture to admit the object to be compressed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At his suggestion, I tried to thrust my hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">through this space, which, as far as visible evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">was concerned, was totally vacant. Much to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishment, my hand encountered something pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pably hard and solid, nor could I force my arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the six foot opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By an ingenious arrangement of gears, operated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a powerful electric motor, the eight rollers could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be made to rotate in unison. The amount of open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing between them could be adjusted within a frac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of a centimeter by means of a very accurate</seg><seg type="columnLine">micrometer screw turned by a wheel about the size</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the steering wheel of an automobile. This wheel</seg><seg type="columnLine">coUld either be operated by hand; or, if any espe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cially large force were desired, could be put in gear</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the electric motor by the simple expedient of</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing over a handle very much like the controller</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a trolley car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having thus explained the theoretical and me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanical principles underlying his invention, Sidel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burg proceeded to test it. I could see that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very nervous and excited when the final moment ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rived which would determine whether he had wasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">an enormous amount of money and labor, or had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a revolutionary discovery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first object run through the press was a cyl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inder of steel about two feet long and three inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">in diameter. It was a waste piece sawn from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer bar which had formed one of the shafts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine. He placed it on the table in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rollers, adjusted it so that it came exactly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the octagon, and directed me to throw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch. With the jerky motion of a mechanism op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erated for the first time, the rollers began to rotate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he pushed the cylinder forward it seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught by invisible claws and sucked slowly into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sidelburg darted around to the other side, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathlessly waited for it to emerge. A cry of joy</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped his trembling lips: "Eureka! It works!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he seized the piece of metal and held it out</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me to inspect. It had expanded to more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice its original size, but except for the apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">decrease in density, still preserved the appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of steel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Think what this will mean to the construction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of aeroplanes, or any other machinery, for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter," Sidelburg enthused. "It will be an easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter to make steel which is lighter than alum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inum."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But will it have the same strength, volume for</seg><seg type="columnLine">volume?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Probably not.

Now I'm going to see what will happen</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I press it to the limit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started the machine once more, and as soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the rollers had taken hold on the steel rod he</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw over the controller handle, thus starting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism which pressed the rollers together with</seg><seg type="columnLine">great force. The severe strain which this put on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine was shown by the ripping, grinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise which it .emitted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The result was probably anticipated by Sidelburg,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but to me it was a considerable surprise to see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid chunk of metal swell up like an enormous toy</seg><seg type="columnLine">balloon, and go sailing away into space, carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it the canvas awning Which covered our out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">door machine shop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That illustrates another possibility," exulted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inventor. "Think of a dirigible balloon made of</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid steel! No expensive silk covering, no danger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous explosive gas, just a piece of expanded metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a propellor and rudder and elevating planes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">direct it in whatever direction you desire. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm going to try the effect on a living being. Jocko</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have the honor of being the first living subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go through the four-dimensional roller-press/'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jocko was the name of Sidelburg's pet monkey, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very droll creature which he kept chained to one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poles of his out-door laboratory. I had always</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarded its presence as but one of the many indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cations of Sidelburg's natural boyishness; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea that he was contemplating using it to experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment upon had never entered my mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After carefully adjusting the machine, the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">inventor picked up the baboon (I should judge that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it weighed about fifty pounds), and placed it on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform in front of the machine. He had some</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty in forcing the animal's head between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rollers, but I have no doubt that it would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been much harder had not Jocko become accustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the appearance and noise of moving machinery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we expected, Jocko appeared on the other side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat augmented in size; though the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">had purposely been adjusted so that only a slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">diminution in the fourth dimension or density would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take place. Since the monkey seemed in no wise dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbed by the operation, and gave no indication that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had suffered any pain, we decided to repeat the</seg><seg type="columnLine">process. The wheel of the micrometer was turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fraction of a revolution, and this was repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">several times, until Jocko had assumed the propor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of a good sized man. When placed upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, he behaved in a perfectly normal manner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except that his motions were extremely rapid, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he moved about it was with surprisingly long</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaps and bounds. Sidelburg explained that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was due to the removal of some of the inhibiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">effects of gravity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So elated was he with the manifest success of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">invention, that he forgot to chain Jocko again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the transformed animal was allowed to jump around</seg><seg type="columnLine">at will and enjoy his new freedom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then nothing would do but that Sidelburg must</seg><seg type="columnLine">try the machine on himself. In vain I pleaded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to await a time when the experiment could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">performed with other witnesses than myself. I told</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him I did not feel like bearing the responsibility</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone; and in answer to this he-hastily wrote and</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed a note absolving me of all blame in case any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing went wrong. This paper I have filed with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police authorities of Brookline.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Realizing at last that he was determined to experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment on his own body in spite of all my pleadings to</seg><seg type="columnLine">postpone the test, I grudgingly consented to assist</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. All the details of adjustment, however, I in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted that he should attend to himself. I merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited until he had taken his position on the plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form; and when he gave the word, threw in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The effect on Sidelburg was very much like that</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced on the monkey the first time it went</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the press,--namely a slight increase in</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulk. I believe I hinted before that he was rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">small in stature. His original height was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">five feet and four inches, and he couldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighed much more than a hundred pounds. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing through the machine, however, his height</seg><seg type="columnLine">was approximately five feet and eight inches; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one would have estimated his weight to be about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and fifty pounds. This, though, was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptive, for his weight couldn't have changed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you feel ?" was my first question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine. When I was going through, I had a kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of puffy sensation, such as you have when you fill</seg><seg type="columnLine">your lungs with a deep breath; but that's gone now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I feel perfectly normal, except that it seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">much easier to move." To illustrate this, he ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">out on the tennis court, which was close by, pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelling himself with enormous bounds, and jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the net. He cleared it by fully three feet! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have easily broken the world's record for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high jump.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've always wanted to be a big man," he cried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and now I can be as big as I wish. I believe I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">go through once more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again I begged him to wait, but with as little</seg><seg type="columnLine">success as before. He gave the micrometer wheel</seg><seg type="columnLine">an almost imperceptible twist, and stretched him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self out on the platform. I turned on the current</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the rollers began to revolve. So intent was I</seg><seg type="columnLine">on watching Sidelburg as his head slowly entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jaws of the marvelous machine, that I had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed the return of Jocko.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My first warning of danger was a harsh grating,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripping sound, exactly like that emitted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine the last time the steel rod went through it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	turned to the switch board, and was horrified to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see Jocko clinging to the handle of the controller,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which--doubtless in imitation of his master--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just pulled down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sidelburg's shoulders and chest were just emerg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from between the rollers. They were swollen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to enormous proportion. From his mouth escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shrill cry like that of a wounded fowl; and words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin, quivering, and very far away pierced my ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror-stricken brain. "Turn off the power--for God's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sa--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I	dashed to the switch-board.

I have found that most persons afflicted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a touch of science, have becopie addicts to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now Fact is all right in its place, a blessing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we do need, but fact does not concede to imagin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation even though imagination will concede to fact.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This makes the victim rather cold-blooded, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendency to be heartless. This last state is against</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature and, though man who has fought and won</seg><seg type="columnLine">against nature time and time again, has to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty careful because some way, or somehow, na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture crops up again and wins in the end; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist who lacks enough imagination, and who</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuffs his anatomy so full of fact that he hasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">room for anything else--wil soon be passe. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideal attainment, therefore, is one of a complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance of Fact and Imagination, slave to neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the two. but master of both; and if ever a pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lication can be offered to a p'erson as a means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">achieving this balance--it is Amazing Stories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In offering my criticism, I wish to say mildly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the story ''The Green Splotches" really de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serves no place in this magazine. This story treats</seg><seg type="columnLine">on something that is impossible: namely; "Plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">men that can talk." Where do they get their</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs? Why does not the story tell us how, or why</seg><seg type="columnLine">the^ Pta'nt Men picked the certain spot they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order to land? Funny that they would remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignorant of the fact that other people existed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in much better "specimens." We learned no secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their methods of communication iior of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolling their- great ship. And, as a whole, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story left us with much of a feeling of disappoint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Btent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the other hand, such stories as "Off On a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Comet," "A Columbus of Space" and even "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Island of Dr. Moreau" are all worthy of the high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est praise. (I am speaking of my own personal a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feelings) these stories were all very entertaining,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and 6ich one seemed unsurpassable until the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">one came out and took the honors away from it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jut the best story of all is "The Land Time For-</seg><seg type="columnLine">got" and its sequel "The People Time Forgot."</seg><seg type="columnLine">In. this story, one gets a little of the human</seg><seg type="columnLine">artgle which is so desirable; human feelings, hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man sufferings, of a real physical nature which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can all understand, rather than the "mental tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures of some ■?reat brain which we sympathize</seg><seg type="columnLine">with, but cannot understand." In bringing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two girls Lys and Ajor into the plot, Mr. Bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughs lends a something to the story that makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">it wdrth reading. We like to read of such things</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a land still infested with dinosaurs, petrodactyls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brontosaurus and those things because they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are real. They have lived and we have facts</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to satisfy the most critical of scientists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">However, Mr. Burroughs has created a situation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that I am sure our readers are not going to like</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it turns out the way it looks. He has ended the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second installment with the Americans leaving be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind good old Billings. Now that will never do.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the story ends like that, then for heaven s</seg><seg type="columnLine">sake write a sequel to it that will bring Billings</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of it--with the girl. Even I could get him out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it, so there is no question but that Mr. Bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughs can.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                         Edward J.

I think it is an excellent scien-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tific conception, and its literary execution is thor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">oughly workmanlike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   1 have one criticism on the story. The writer's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">conception of a plant organism having the intelli-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gence of human beings or a much higher one, pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vided a marvelous opportunity for a bit of sensa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion, which I think the author neglected. An in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">telligent plant would not necessarily have a form</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">resembling that of the human; in fact the proba-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bilities are that the form would be vastly different.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Putting' these beings into human form is a bit of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">anthropomorphism that is so characteristic of scien-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tiliction. We can't break away from it; we merely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">saw at our bonds and sever a thread at a time; we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">still put a human form on everything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Building up from the conception of a plant form,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with senses necessary to keeping in touch with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">environment, with manual ability and locomotive</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ability; and with the probability that the sensory</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">end-organs would be all close together (the face),</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we could build up a very fantastic and still very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reasonable being. Plant locomotion would not at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all be by means of legs; most probably by cilia or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flagella, which could be adapted to use on dry land;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or a circular shape adapted to rolling_ would be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">within bounds of verisimilitude, for it is used by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plants to distribute seeds. Instead of hands, ten-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drils or tentacle-like fingers would be much more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">probable. Why a mouth and larynx, when the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">critters do not eat? Nor talk?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   And so forth. Then, for one of these forms to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">appear in the skin of the Peruvian crook, would be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reasonable; for he would have reason to want to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">conceal his odd shape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Still, I enjoyed the story, and hope you can get</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more like it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                    Miles.
