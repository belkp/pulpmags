Here's the story of</seg><seg type="columnLine">just how it happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the big moments of my life had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come.

"Well, Bill, just listen to me.

I knew your</seg><seg type="columnLine">father and mother, and you've always had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good reputation. here, too. But let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask you just one question--how much</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you make?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Twenty-eight a week," I told him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't say a word--just wrote it</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on a piece of paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you any prospects of a better job</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a good raise some time soon?" he aslced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sir; I can't honestly say that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have," I admitted. "I'm looking for some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing better all the time, though."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looking, eh?

Wjhen he saw my</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion he grunted. "I thought so," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. Then he held up some figures he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">been scribbling at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I've just been figuring out your fam-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ily budget, Bill, for a salary of twenty-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eight a week. I've figured it several ways,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so you can take your pick of the one you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like best. Here's Budget No. 1: I figure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you can afford a very small unfurnished</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">apartment, make your payments on enough</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plain, inexpensive furniture to fix such an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">apartment up, pay your electricity, gas and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">water bills, buy just about one modest out-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fit of clothes for both of you once each</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">year, and save three dollars a week for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sickness, insurance, and emergencies.

I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bet that today I make more money than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old boy himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Here's a real tip. You may not be as bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">off as I was. But, think it over--are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied ?

O'Conor Sloane, Ph.D.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EARS ago, it was, the writer of these lines produced</seg><seg type="columnLine">a book which dealt with the subject of physics.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is one doctrine in the science, which under</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary conditions, such as we live under, holds</seg><seg type="columnLine">sway. It is the law of the conservation of energy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">If you lift a weight to the height of a foot, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">release it, so that it can fall back to its original plane, it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">exert the same amount of energy in its descent as you exerted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in lifting it. Your action created no energy. It may be put</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sense that you converted vital energy into potential</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy. If it was a pound weight, the energy involved was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot-pound. You can neither create nor annihilate energy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Force is far different, there is no conservation about it. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">exists as long as it is exercised, and then goes out of existence</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the exercising of it ceases.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The text of the book in question went on to say that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is no such thing of doctrine as that of the conservation of force.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is absolutely true. But one of the reviewers of the book</seg><seg type="columnLine">asserted that the author of the same said that there was no law</seg><seg type="columnLine">or doctrine of the conservation of energy. Apparently this</seg><seg type="columnLine">reviewer did not grasp the simple fact that force is one thing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This failure of comprehension of an essential difference led to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the publication of a curious little book, about the middle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last century. It was on the subject of the conservation of force.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was something seductive about the error. The book was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made up of quotations of celebrated authorities on the subject,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which for some time evidently had excited much discussion. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinions of the various authorities were decidedly of the hazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">order. Faraday was one of those cited. The problem had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">submitted/ to him, and it was interesting to see how he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">reconcile it in his mind, yet was not willing to assign it to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">true position as a falsity, pure and simple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This error in classical physics, as the science is now sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">picturesquely termed, is comparable to one of the older ones.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For centuries it had been held that a heavy body would fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster than a light one. It was Gallileo in Pisa who disproved</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, by dropping objects of different weights from the leaning</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower. But why had it never occurred to anyone before to try</seg><seg type="columnLine">the simple experiment?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another curious error was immortalized by Otto van Guericke</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">5</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with his famous hemispheres. He shows them in his book</seg><seg type="columnLine">between two teams of horses, one team pulling Against the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">in tug-of-war fashion. It is quite impressive, but the pull to</seg><seg type="columnLine">separate them would have been the same with a single team of</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses, if one of the hemispheres had been fastened to a post,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if the two teams had pulled against the post, he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">had double the pull on his hemispheres. But this fact seems to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been beyond his conception.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Recently, in one of the editorials in this magazine, the curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">phlogiston doctrine, held for many years as one of the funda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental laws of chemistry, was alluded to. It kept science in</seg><seg type="columnLine">abeyance, and prevented its theory being formulated, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lavoisier and Priestly proved that a pound added to a pound</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave two pounds just as truly in chemistry as in anything else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is pretty certain that no one now accepts the Epicurian</seg><seg type="columnLine">chaos, minute particles of matter going about through space</seg><seg type="columnLine">and eventually joining and thus starting the work of creating</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that we know of matter, solid, liquid and gaseous. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea antedates chemistry, for two thousand years ago wood was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood in the belief of all, and not the compound of carbon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydrogen, oxygen and some other elements as we now consider</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to be. This lack of knowledge applied to all compound</seg><seg type="columnLine">substances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Edgar A. Poe says that if we knew everything and had nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find out and discover, if there was nothing left for us to exer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cise our intellects upon, we would be very unhappy. But in spite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what Jeans, Millikan, Eddington and Einstein are doing, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not in any danger of the unhappiness announced by Poe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Changing of theories, abandonment of long accepted views are</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to be treated as mere errors. We do not know today how</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the truth some of our theories are. The old-time system</seg><seg type="columnLine">of scientific obstinacy, characteristic of Victorian science, has</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty well disappeared, and the best men are open to modification</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their scientific beliefs. A good instance of this was the sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">acceptance of the Einstein theories. It is they that are at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">root of a sort of division of science, especially physical and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cosmical. To the old working basis is assigned the title of</seg><seg type="columnLine">classic physics. In all this connection it is interesting to see how</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of flexibility, appears in enunciation of theories by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest of scientists, and how willing they are to let others be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve different from themsleves. It was far different in old times.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Across the void</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                 A Sequel to "Out of the Void"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          By Leslie F. Stone</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rpHE old-time evolutionists claimed that through sheer influence of surround-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">J- ings and conditions of existence man has evolved to what he is. What might</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have happened under absolutely different atmospheric influences remains to us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eminently problematical--particularly conditions that might be prevalent out-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">side our own galaxy, in worlds of which even our most powerful telescopes fail</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to give us an inkling.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">only because he had become the personage that he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eminent scientist and all that . . . had he perforce been</seg><seg type="columnLine">made to shut up like a clam to the goggling world. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his friends he was still the Wally of old, bubbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">with good fellowship and friendliness. But the years</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sat on him more heavily, made his short body</seg><seg type="columnLine">round and his head bald. Well, everyone wasn't lucky</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to keep both their figure and hair as Dick Dorr</seg><seg type="columnLine">had.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorr was answering Kington's questions slowly, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most wearily. "I haven't been in London, Wally, in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">these years because 1 have been farther away than you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would dare believe, and as for my letting you or any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one know--well that was just about an impossibility.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But wait, let me present my companions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the few moments consumed by the greeting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kington had failed to note the two who had followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorr into his chamber, but now, for the first time, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes sought out the woman and the youth framed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway. He saw a slender woman, gray-haired and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the ravages of the years on her sweet, calm face</seg><seg type="columnLine">that could never have been very beautiful; but whole-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some and gentle-eyed, it still was. Her eyes, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were strangely arresting, not because of the life in them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but because of the faded look of a light that had died</seg><seg type="columnLine">within them. She was clothed in what appeared to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">home-made dress and hat, and even the eminent recluse</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was, Kington was quick to note that her gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments were antiquated by at least two decades despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that they seemed newly made. Later, he was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that both Dorr and the youth were dressed in much</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same old-fashioned way--in ill-fitting, poorly</seg><seg type="columnLine">tailored clothing. Now he was trying to learn what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so strange about the young fellow who stood a little to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left and behind the woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the first place he was overtall--surely all of six</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet six inches or more--with a large powerful body that</seg><seg type="columnLine">still had something of the immaturity of youth in it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he was wearing large ungainly spectacles that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hid his eyes, and on his head was an enveloping cap</seg><seg type="columnLine">that covered hair and forehead and which he had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed on entering the house. Yet there was enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his face showing to tell that it was a handsome one</seg><seg type="columnLine">with regular features, almost unearthly in contour, deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate and esthetically at variance with the power of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">big adolescent body. And even in the lamp light that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted the windowless room, Kington noticed a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">quality of his complexion, a queer silvery tint that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to underlie the skin, but that shone forth as</seg><seg type="columnLine">color shines under the weave of an irridescent length</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cloth. The scientist thought he had never seen an</seg><seg type="columnLine">odder looking young man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is Elsie Rollins-weiti and her son, Ezra-weit,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Dorr by way of introduction that did little to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain the ill-assorted pair, in whom a slight family re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">semblance might be seen on second glance, but Dorr,</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently wishing to lose little time in either introduc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tions or explanations, gathered his one-time friend's</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to himself for the second time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Startling News</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"f | 'VHE tale I have to relate you, Wally, is a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">I one," he began, "but after you hear our needs</seg><seg type="columnLine">A you will not be surprised that I've come to you</seg><seg type="columnLine">first, aside from our relations of the past.

The odd speech</seg><seg type="columnLine">affected him strangely. In the first place he had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet gotten over the surprise of seeing Dorr again, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were these strangers, Dick's queer attitude and</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance, and now his queerer talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, Dick," he said, "I don't know what you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving at.

"Sorry, old chap, that I startled you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but you see I've lived with the thought for the past</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-five years now, and I can't realize that others</seg><seg type="columnLine">still can't grasp it easily."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, come, sit down--all of you--and tell me about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.

Janson had water for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the youth who took it gratefully. He had to remove his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark glasses that had become misted, and an exclamation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shocked surprise escaped Kington when he saw what</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spectacles had hidden.

The boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">complied and exposed a head covered with a thick mop</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hair that was as silvery as the small vase standing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kington's broad desk. At a glance it could be seen that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hair had never had other pigmentation, that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver as Kington's scrap of hair was black, and Dorr's</seg><seg type="columnLine">reddish bronze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He comes of this planet you're speaking of?" queried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kington, his eyes on the strange features. "Mars?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not Mars, but Abrui, as it is called by its inhabitants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a planet which has its orbit outside of Neptune!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kington started at that, and scanned Dorr's face</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely. "Gad! that hardly sounds credible, Dick. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">what a find! Why that is enough to make your name</seg><seg type="columnLine">resound to the heavens themselves. Yet let me think</seg><seg type="columnLine">--ah, yes, there have been astronomers who believed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that there are trans-Neptunian planets. Wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">it Forbes of Edinburgh, back in about 1880 who in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred from the study of the orbits of comets whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">aphelia are beyond Neptune that there are two remote</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of the solar system revolving at the distances</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 100 and 300 astronomical units in periods of 1000 to</seg><seg type="columnLine">5000 years ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sorry," observed Dorr, "I am no astronomer, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact remains that Abrui lies just about 49 astronomical</seg><seg type="columnLine">units from the sun with a period of 349^ years, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">3,557,000,000 miles from Sol, or again if you like better,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little over 5,691,200,000 kilometres. . . The last was</seg><seg type="columnLine">said with a laugh at the new system of French measures</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were in use since Dorr's time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Miles will do," remarked Kington drily, "three</seg><seg type="columnLine">billion and a half'seem too much as it is.

"There and back, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Good Lord! And here I was, tinkering with mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">theories.

But what's it all about?" said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kington.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some Past History</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN the next half hour Dorr told something of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed in the last quarter of a century, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Ezra Rollins' experiments to send a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket containing a man to the planet Mars, and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the subsequent taking off of the rocket with Dana Glea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son and Richard Dorr, the passing of Mars and of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing upon the more distant world of Abrui.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kington recalled the name of Professor Rollins, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had held an astronomical chair in one of the American</seg><seg type="columnLine">universities in 1915 or thereabouts, but who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed out of the country because of his belief that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could do the impossible. Rollins, it had been said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had disappeared into Africa followed by a band of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose names bore long strings of college degree initials</seg><seg type="columnLine">and who believed implicitly in their leader's views and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were with him during the building of the machine. Rol-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lins had straightway been forgotten by the world, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">what a sensation it would create when it was learned that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the professor had really succeeded in building his rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">and launched it with two persons into the Void.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That the rocket had not landed upon Mars was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprising but it did sound like a fabrication to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">that instead it had dropped upon another world, a ninth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and undiscovered planet in the solar system, which, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of depending upon distant Sol for light and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ergy, had a satellite sun of its own to provide those life-</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving necessities. It didn't seem possible that such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet could have escaped detection, but then Neptune</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself had not been discovered until 1787, and astrono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mers were not yet ready to agree positively that noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing lay beyond that distant globe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The reason for its not having been found in the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty years," explained Dorr, "is believed by Abruian</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomers to be due to the fact that during that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet is in the lag of Neptune, in its shadow, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">is only now dropping behind, for although Neptune's</seg><seg type="columnLine">year is shorter than Abrui, it is a larger planet and has</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken that many years to pass by. Even now, were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomers to search for Abrui, it would be a diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult search for its influence is so small in proportion to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of Neptune as to be negligible. And Tradr, Abrui's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, does not throw out rays as does Sol and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear no more than a pin-point of light, too small, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, to be detected against the myriad stars in its back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of Tradr, Abruian scientists have many opinions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The one theory generally accepted is that once the</seg><seg type="columnLine">satellite was a cold moon circling their planet, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it 'caught fire' from the great deposits of radium which</seg><seg type="columnLine">are ever 'burning' and now gives to the planet its light</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its heat. This theory is suggested to them by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that Abrui itself is rich in this element, and is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them what fire is to Earth. Thence, there is eldimun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ore which is not found on Earth, but which is ignited</seg><seg type="columnLine">in instantaneous combustion in the presence of radium,</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning with a pinkish glow. This, as far as the Abru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ians have been able to learn, burns infinitely. Tradr</seg><seg type="columnLine">glows pinkishly, and it is supposed without a doubt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore, that the satellite has also great deposits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eldimun. which upon catching fire, will burn far into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ages. It is hoped so by the Abruians."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, let me get this right," said Kington after Dorr</seg><seg type="columnLine">had finished his long tale. "In 1924 Professor Rollins</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent Dana Gleason, whom he had chosen for a passenger</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his rocket because of that person's capabilities, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing that in truth she was a woman, masquerading</seg><seg type="columnLine">all her life as a man, because of her dead father's dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like for the female sex. You, Dick, inadvertently dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered her sex, and at the last minute decided to ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">company her, rather than let the truth break the heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the old scientist, who had become your friend there</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Africa, and thus prevent realization of the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">life ambitions, also because you believed that you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could work together in his behalf?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait a minute, Wally, you put too much stress upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">my altruistic motives. I went especially because of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman I had discovered. I loved her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kington waved the aside away. "It matters not what</seg><seg type="columnLine">construction you wish to put on it . . . you might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">halted the whole thing if you had confessed the truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Rollins, and spent your life with her on good old</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "More likely I would have lost her altogether, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">10</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mean, Wally, if I had had the temerity to have exposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh well, whatever the intents or purposes were, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">count for nothing now. It was the action! Well, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue . . . your rocket passed Mars and then you</seg><seg type="columnLine">two thought you were headed out into Space when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed beyond Neptune. Instead, you struck Abrui!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now it happened that Miss Gleason was picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one, Moura-weit who was scouting about the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">when your shell exploded. He searched the ruins for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the complexion and coloring of a Gor, one of the bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barians who roved the land into which your rocket had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen. So he carried Miss Gleason off to his civilized</seg><seg type="columnLine">country while you in turn fell into the hands of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barbarians themselves. And each of you thought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other had died in the ruins of your vehicles, each tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up life anew as you found it. To the barbarians you</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in the light of a saviour, fitting an old prophecy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">theirs that expressed a hope for one to lead them back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the lands of which their enemy, the Tabora, or silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of Abrui, had despoiled them. Knowing you as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do, a man who can not listen to the plea of the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow without going to his aid, you took it upon your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to bring these poor, down-trodden bronze men back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their birthright, unaware that the woman you loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">now lived among the Gor's oppressors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That you managed to overthrow the Tabora with</seg><seg type="columnLine">your crude cannon and home-made gunpowder and res-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cued Dana Gleason from a marriage of convenience with</seg><seg type="columnLine">this overbearing Moura-weit, who saw in her the means</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his own ends, stacks of penny-novels, but it always</seg><seg type="columnLine">was your lot, Dick, to do the right thing!" And King-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton smiled as he recalled other times when Dorr had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done the right thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Laugh wrinkles showed around Dorr's brown eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and together the two laughed over old times. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">then that Ezra-weit broke into a flood of words that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were wholly unintelligible to the scientist and smiling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elsie Rollins-weiti, interpreted them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My son," said she, "understands English, only he is</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward in speaking it--but he wishes me to tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Dorr is too self-effacing; that before dealing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, you should know that without him Abrui could</seg><seg type="columnLine">never know such peace as exists on that world at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">present time. When Richard overthrew the Tabora,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he forced the conquering Gora to accept his terms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">namely, not to send the silver men back to the waste-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands from which they had come in the past, conquering</seg><seg type="columnLine">both Gora and Moata (golden men), but that the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">races of Abrui, the golden men who had been Tabora's</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaves, the silver men and the bronze men should live</seg><seg type="columnLine">at peace with each other on the shores of the single ocean</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sehti. Seeing the justice in his demands, the three na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions in turn forced Dick to become their Ur-Kirada</seg><seg type="columnLine">(over-king) so that he would be at their helm and teach</seg><seg type="columnLine">them how to live in accord. So at the present time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Richard Dorr, formerly of Earth, is no less than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">First Citizen of his adopted world!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING the time she spoke, a rare blush of red over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread the Ur-Kirada's face, but he joined in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh that came at his expense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman continued to speak in a voice that was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful and as colorful as her face was lacking in those</seg><seg type="columnLine">attributes. "And what's more, Mr. Kington, Dick taught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Abruians the art of being kindly, not only to nations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but to individuals also. With the downfall of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Taboran state, Moura-weit, who had had himself created</seg><seg type="columnLine">Urtor, or over-prince of Tabora with an eye to an Ur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kiradaship, became an outcast because he had failed tq</seg><seg type="columnLine">save them from the ignominy of defeat and was looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon as a traitor and a price was put on his head. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">people had been awakened to the fact that this ambitious</seg><seg type="columnLine">man sought power to meet his own selfish ends without</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought for the people themselves, and now they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanding his death and his dishonor. With the aid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ubca-tor, his one loyal henchman, a prince of the realm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick arranged for Moura-weit's escape from the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an interplanetary machine which was then but begun</seg><seg type="columnLine">and which was finished in secret, and so allowed the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">to flee the ire of his fellow-men. Then Dick told the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people of what he had done, begged them to pardon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moura-weit so that when he should return home he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be accepted as their friend instead of as their</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy.".</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kington was thoughtful after that but soon he spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. "And what of this fellow? What happened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him ? Is he safe at home in Abrui now, raising a thriv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. brood of Abruians?" he asked and did not see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spasm of pain that crossed Elsie Rollins-weiti's gentle</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That again," said Dorr, "is another story. And al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though Abrui has'forgiven the man his duplicity, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor him for his great work and discoveries made in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their behalf, he never returned to Abrui. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">only his wife and his son to return to his homeland when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he met an honorable death on Kal, the planet he dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered in the star-system of Alpha Centauri, which, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know, lies the closest of all the stars to our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">solar universe. This, Wally, is Moura-weit's wife," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed a hand over Elsie's hand which was lying in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">lap, "and the boy is Moura's son."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Concerning Abrui</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was Kington's turn to feel embarrassment, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that it was because of Dorr's own negligence</seg><seg type="columnLine">in not making a more fitting introduction that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made the faux pax. Now Dorr realizing his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">omissions went on to add; "Elsie is the niece of Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Ezra Rollins, the man who invented the rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sent Dana and me to Abrui. She was an orphan at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time when the professor left for Africa, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took her with him, then a child of ten, I believe. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine, as you know, was but a few miles from the plan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation Rollins purchased, and we became good friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Elsie was about fifteen when the rocket made its de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parture, and for the next five years she continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live with her uncle who had become a broken man when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he realized what he had done in sending us two off into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Space, possibly signing our death-warrant. Had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">known at the time that Dana was a woman, he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have lost his mind entirely. As it was, the five years</seg><seg type="columnLine">were spent by him in praying each night for a message</seg><seg type="columnLine">from us. He had the duplicate of the radio set we carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the rocket, which was destroyed when our' shell ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploded in Gora, and he hoped against hope to hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcome signal Dana had promised to use in announcing</seg><seg type="columnLine">our arrival on Mars.	/</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And although Dana, with a corps of engineers, built</seg><seg type="columnLine">one set after another and strove to send sound across</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, she never did succeed. Instead when Moura-weit</seg><seg type="columnLine">ACROSS THE VOID</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">11</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and his ally, Ubca-tor, departed in their space-flyer from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abrui, Dana commissioned them to deliver a document</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which she had described the world we had discovered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She also presented Moura with her own diary for proof</seg><seg type="columnLine">that truly he came from her. So Moura-weit came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth with his message to the old scientist, who in turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded that he be carried with his niece into Space,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that he might see the wonders of the universe at first</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand before he died."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gad!" exclaimed Kington, "and you--Mrs. Weiti,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have been in the Void--you traveled to Alpha Cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tauri, you say? Did the Professor go with you to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant world of Kal?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sadly Elsie shook her head. "No, he lived only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few months, and in that time we were still in the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fines of the solar-system. In fact, he never reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you had the courage to go across Space?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She nodded; "I would have followed Moura to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends of the Cosmos!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What a man he must have been, despite what you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me of his short-comings!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Moura-weit," she exclaimed, "left Abrui with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope of atoning for his sins, in turn to reap from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">universe knowledge that would improve the lot of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">world and through his efforts place its civilization on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinnacle; but in the meantime he sought solace in the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mensity of the Void. He saw himself apart now from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ambitious man he had been, and he had learned from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Richard Dorr the mistake of putting one's self above</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fellow men. The remainder of his life, therefore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was spent in expiating his past sin. All he did hence-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth was in behalf of Mankind. He went to the distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet Kal only for the honor it would bring to his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, and to save another from making the same mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes as he himself had made! Can you wonder that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was glad to follow such a man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A silence fell on the gathering after that eulogy, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">again Kington's inquiring mind brought them back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">present.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder," he asked, "if it would be asking too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">--for you to tell me something of that tremendous jour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney and what you discovered at its end ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman smiled a far-away smile, and some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wonders she had seen were mirrored in her gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. Then she shuddered as she recalled some of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific experiences that had deprived her of her love.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No 'one," she said, "has ever heard the entire story of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what actually took place, but I feel that it should be told.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps, sometime, when I can compose my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts. . . .?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kington recognized the uselessness of further urging,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he was never one to thrust demands upon those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not wish to comply. For the second time he fell to</seg><seg type="columnLine">studying Ezra-weit. He could not get accustomed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy's strange coloring. Dorr again took up the conver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation, for as he had already said, he had come to Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a definite purpose and he wished to lose no time</seg><seg type="columnLine">in getting down to business. He spoke now at length</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his adopted world, explaining many of its features</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his one-time chum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It has taken us almost twenty years to erase preju-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dice of race from Abrui, Wally, but at last the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">races, golden, silver and bronze men, dwell in harmony</seg><seg type="columnLine">side by side, and we hope in time, with the blending of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three, to develop true brotherhood of spirit. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have sent me as emissary back to my own world</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in hope that fellowship may be established between our</seg><seg type="columnLine">two great worlds! Much has Abrui to offer Earth in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way of barter, just as Earth can give fair exchange</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Abrui!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHAT fields you open up, Dick. It's--why--it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost beyond human conception," lamely ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served the renowned scientist. "Tell me something of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abrui's needs. You say that she has untold deposits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of radium? Our own progress in various lines of en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deavor suffer because we have so little. In what state</seg><seg type="columnLine">is it found--in uranium or some of the compounds?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is in a raw state and much of its sources are un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tapped ! To the Abruian, it is what fire is to us. Now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what Abrui needs most is iron and nickel, which are</seg><seg type="columnLine">sadly lacking, strange to say, although there is plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of lead, which is, of course, both the parent and the off-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring of radium, and although the Abruians are most</seg><seg type="columnLine">able in making use of that soft heavy metal alloyed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">other metals, they need iron for steel and lighter ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terials. Aluminum is unknown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "However, Abrui is far more interested right now to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn of your newest developments in the field of radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmission. Radio is a very new science on the planet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">introduced as it was by Dana, when she sought to send</seg><seg type="columnLine">out messages to the Professor. She failed to reach him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the Abruians seized upon the invention, for although</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are as far developed in most of the sciences as Earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more so in some, wire and wireless transmitting was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to them. Communication between nations and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities was carried on entirely by letter and messenger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although they have developed a science that the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Earth have as yet entirely overlooked. That is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">science of. mental telepathy. So efficient are the Abruians</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a man's mind is wholly open to his fellow-beings un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less he wills it differently. Also it is possible for them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to project their thoughts in picture form upon screens</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all to see, sometimes even to the next city, much in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same way as you are projecting by television today.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Moura-weit was perhaps the greatest exponent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this art, and that is what added so greatly to his power</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his people. He was able to detect the thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man in the next room or house, and he could alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw his thoughts forth for all to see, whereas it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult as a rule for two or three men with their com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bined efforts to do this thing. Ezra-weit is fast learn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to do likewise!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kington's eyes again went to the strange youth, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Dorr continued speaking, his attention reverted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speaker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So, you see, when Dana gave them the rudiments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio, the Abruians were wild with enthusiasm. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made great strides with it, but still they lack some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its essentials, mainly because of their lack of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper metals to bring about the proper changes. Nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">have they television, since that was not invented when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we left Earth twenty-five years ago. And it is to Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they look for furtherance of their own develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments in this great field. I am certain that our fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">men would be delighted to have an enlarged market for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their wares, while they could in turn find use for many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Abruian commodities in the world markets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Abruians, therefore, would like to propose a</seg><seg type="columnLine">commercial interchange. They will build a fleet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-flyers, modeled after Moura-weit's ship, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yodverl*, the plans of which he gave freely to his world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ^Meaning "Ship of the Void."</seg><seg type="columnLine">12</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Who knows but that in a few years we will have a pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">senger-line established whereby tourists from each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the worlds can visit the other planet? Does that not</seg><seg type="columnLine">pique your imagination, Wally?" and Dorr was grinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadly at the expression on the other's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Man alive!" the scientist exclaimed, "you are look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing upon the first passenger of the new service. Or per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps I'll go as supercargo, or even stowaway, if neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They all laughed together over the man's enthusiasm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was hard to picture this rotund little man as a stow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come," said he, "we must announce this great news</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the world! But wait--it is late--far past the lunch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eon hour, I fear. How inconsiderate I've been in keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing you talking while you must be starving. Now, now--</seg><seg type="columnLine">not another word until we've eaten!" As he spoke, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rang a bell and Janson appeared for orders, including</seg><seg type="columnLine">strict attention to the fact that no one, not even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">King of England, was to be admitted to the house for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remainder of the day. Janson proved his worthiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that moment by announcing that he had had the chef</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep a luncheon ready to serve for the last hour and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half. And he led the visitors to rooms above where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might prepare themselves for the mid-day meal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Girl-Element Is Injected</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TRUE to his word Kington would not allow a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single word spoken of the future until the meal</seg><seg type="columnLine">was eaten, but he in turn spent that time in enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining his guests with a panorama of the world's history</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the preceding twenty-five years, much of which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">digested with wonder and astonishment by the two self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">exiled Earthlings. Ezra listened avidly to the talk, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested, it appeared, in things of Earth than he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in those of his own familiar world. However, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was never too interested in what was said to forget his</seg><seg type="columnLine">attentions to his mother, whom he seemed to observe so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that her every wish was fulfilled without the need of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word. Too, he often asked a question in halting, care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully enunciated words when something was not quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear to him. Janson, struck by the youth's queer ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance, hovered around him as much as his duties of</seg><seg type="columnLine">serving would allow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the meal ended, Kington ushered his guests into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a drawing room, a large chamber excellently furnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the newest prevailing fashion, which considered bodily</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfort first. There were many deep, overstaffed</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs, well upholstered, with tables set conveniently at</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. Large windows admitted the afternoon sun and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the room a warm feeling. The host saw to it that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his guests were comfortable before he himself took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. Ezra found the cigarettes of his host to his liking</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Dorr puffed on a Havana cigar with enjoyment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have cigarettes on Abrui, now, made from a leaf</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was found to be almost a counterpart of the to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bacco leaf, except that it makes a poor grade of cigar,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man said by way of apology for the attention he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was giving his smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must have found it very difficult at times to ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">just yourself to the new world," observed Kington.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorr nodded and his eyes took a dreamy look as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">recalled some of those adjustments he had been called</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon to make.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have been wondering why you have neglected to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring your wife back with you, Dick ? Or does she pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fer the new world ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sigh escaped the man. "She does prefer the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, Wally, but she did want to come to earth. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, our people were adverse to both of us coming this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Perhaps they feared we should not wish to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to Abrui, so they trumped up a story that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed one of us while the other was gone! You see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dana has done more than I have done for the planet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It has her heart and she loves it more than she ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved Earth. She had, you know, a strange life here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being raised as a boy all her life by a father who hated</seg><seg type="columnLine">all womankind, so that when he died in the World War,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she really had nothing to hold her to Earth. Abrui truly</seg><seg type="columnLine">means home to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hence, when we decided that one of us were to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Earth Dana insisted that I go, since she believed I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do more than she could here, and I left her home</seg><seg type="columnLine">with our two children. I wanted to bring the boy, Duris,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Dana would not allow it. He must wait, instead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until Dana can come with Mural, too." And with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">air of "enough of that," Dorr plunged into business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, tell me, Wally, have I come to the right per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son when I called upon you to help us? Our ship lies</seg><seg type="columnLine">not more than sixty miles from here in a wild part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country, where I trust it will escape detection until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proper time. Aboard are twenty Abruian men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">women whom I thought it best to bring along--for</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof--if there are none to believe our spoken word.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I place ourselves and them in your hands."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may feel certain, Dick, that this duty you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed on my shoulders is indeed a trust. I shall do all</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can, even though it seems almost too great for me. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">program, however, lies with you. In twenty-four hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can have some of the greatest of the world's scientists</seg><seg type="columnLine">at your feet, and another twenty-four hours will bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ruling heads of every nation to the call when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth is out. What do you suggest? Shall we call only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chosen few before the news is given to the public?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next hour was spent in discussing plans. Elsie</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rollins-weiti sat quietly by listening to what was said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and then giving a good suggestion. Ezra, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid them little heed. Boyishly, his eyes had flown</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the room at the unfamiliar looking furnishings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ornaments and fittings, and when he thought the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">too engrossed to notice him, he got up from his chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wandered about inspecting various articles at close</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. So he had found the magnificent radio-set in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">far corner of the room that formed a small alcove.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Seeing that the adults paid him no attention, he sat on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small chair and studied the formidable array of dials</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the neat little television screen set in its center. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side was another smaller screen with two small dials</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath it with an individual amplifier, but he was diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent in inquiring of his host what that was for. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few tries on the main dials of the instrument, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned the combination and with its volume tuned low</seg><seg type="columnLine">so as not to disturb the others, he twirled the dials to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find what was on the air. One by one he found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">various broadcasting stations of the world and listened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to each program, news reports, music, lectures, orations</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drama, and in fact the whole gamut of the broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casting world. What interested him the most was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">television screen and as he watched the dancing, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">posturing, the moving figures of people, an exclamation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wonder escaped him now and then.</seg><seg type="columnLine">ACROSS THE VOID</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AN hour and a half passed in this fashion when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kington came to interrupt him. The conference</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the three had broken up, and it was time to get to</seg><seg type="columnLine">business. Excusing himself for interfering with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy, Kington turned the dials below the smaller machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had intrigued Ezra-weit. There was a moment's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause, thence a silvery bell sounded and a light flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the screen into which swam a face. It was the face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a venerable old man who smiled a greeting to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist facing him. Unobtrusively Ezra moved away</seg><seg type="columnLine">*from the machine to allow the two to speak without his</seg><seg type="columnLine">interference, joining his mother and Richard Dorr on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side of the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When the conversation was done, Dorr strolled over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to his friend at the machine. "I take it," he said, "that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this is your new type of telephone, eh? They predicted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it in my day. Rather clever, I should judge."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes," was the rejoinder, "we've done away entirely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the old style telephone and use the wireless or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">radio type instead. Every set is provided with its own</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">particular wave-length, and by dialing the wave-length</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">number of those we wish to speak with, the central</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">switchboard acts upon it as it did in the old days. Of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">course, if the 'line' is busy, a buzz indicates it. We</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">call the machine the Tele-Vis-Vox.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Wonderful, but tell me, how can you keep another</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from listening in? Or do you sacrifice your privacy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "There is what is called the jumbled sound control,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and once the two parties are connected, it is impossible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for another to 'listen in' as he will hear only distorted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sounds. Of course, for greater secrecy, code is some-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">times used. However, as once the wires were controlled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by licenced companies, the air is now controlled by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">various governments with an international governor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">presiding over all, and only registered stations are given</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">right of ways. A special bureau is maintained to keep</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the air free of 'listeners in,' or amateur broadcasters,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so at no time are we bothered with illicit traffic of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">air."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Kington had other parties to "call up" and Dorr</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stayed at his side as he addressed them. When they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were finished at the Tele-Vis-Vox, Kington called for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Janson, to whom he had orders to give. Mrs. Weiti</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was to be shown to a guest chamber where she might</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rest, and there was to be a dinner at eight o'clock for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seven persons, and on the pain of death no one was to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be admitted to the house until the master had returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ezra-weit was asked if he should like to accompany</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Kington and Dorr upon the round of business that they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had to attend, but the youth shook his head. He pre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ferred to stay in the house, or to be more exact, at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the radio.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was several hours before the two returned and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with them were three strange men and a woman. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were not strange to Ezra, however, for they had been his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">companions on the journey from Abrui. Each of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">three men were representative of the three different</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">races of their planet, the golden, silver and bronze pig-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mented races of Abrui. They were by name respec-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tively, Ulja-tai, Ubca-tor and Kalu-tor. The woman</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">who was Tabora, or silver-hued, was called Alba-tais.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The suffix to the name indicated that the first was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crown-prince, in direct line of the Kiradaship or king-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ship of his race. The other two were princes of royal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">blood but with no connection to the throne. The woman</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was a crown-princess, but as women never succeeded to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the throne on their world, her name merely denoted that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">she was the first-born daughter of the Taboran kirada.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ulja-tai was a Moatan, or golden man. Hair, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin and even the lips were golden-hued with only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vermilion red of his eyes and the black pupils to relieve</seg><seg type="columnLine">that monotony of color. He stood about six foot three</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches and was very slender of body, broad shouldered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and narrow-hipped. His features were fine and deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cately drawn, forming a severe thoughtful face with</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong lines of repression around the golden lips. Such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a face one would expect to find in a man of a race that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been held in slavedom for thousands of generations</seg><seg type="columnLine">and who now finds himself raised to a responsible posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. During their centuries of thralldom the Moata</seg><seg type="columnLine">had rigidly perserved their castes so that when freedom</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in the shape of Richard Dorr, each man of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">had slipped easily into his rightful place without con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ulja-tai was clothed in true Abruian style with tight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitting trousers that seemed molded to his limbs, a loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">blouse that was sleeveless and square-cut at the neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hung half-way down the thigh. Trousers and smock (</seg><seg type="columnLine">were of a silkish cloth in vermilion that exactly matched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shade of their wearer's eyes. A leather girdle, gold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored and encrusted with many precious glistening</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones, encircled the waist. The leather sandals were of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a suede as soft as doe's skin and were laced half way</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the calf of the leg. To the shoulders of the blouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">was attached a long cape that fell into deep folds to</seg><seg type="columnLine">within an inch of the heel and was full enough to allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its being drawn entirely about the body. The cape</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lined with the skin of some strange animal that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was yellow with vermilion stripes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ubca-tor, the silver man, was somewhat taller than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ulja-tai, standing easily six-feet six inches. Like Ezra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">weit he had the silver hair and skin of his race and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lavender eyes, but whereas Ezra's skin had more the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance of his earthly forebears with only' the sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestion of a silvery tint underlying the surface, Ubca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor was all silver, like a polished silver statue. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">features were also regular, and in his eyes there seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sorrow lurking, as if perhaps he were regretting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future. He was, in fact, the companion who had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Moura-weit in his exile and shared in all his ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventures to the time of the other's death. And still he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorrowed for his dead leader even as Elsie Rollins-weiti</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffered. He was dressed as the golden man, only his</seg><seg type="columnLine">costume was of a blue that blended well with his laven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The third Abruian, Kalu-tor of Gora, the bronze man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was by far the tallest of the three, standing a good five</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches above Ubca-tor's head, but the fact that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so heavily muscled made him appear squat beside his slen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derer companions.' To Kington, he looked more natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a man, since his bronze skin gave him the appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the American Indian to a certain extent, except that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his long silky hair matched his complexion and his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were practically hazel. Nor were his features as deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cately drawn as those of the golden and silver men. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was wisdom in his face and a kindly look in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All three Abruians were clean-shaven and all wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hair square cut at the chin with bangs on the fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. A close examination showed that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly beardless, nor was there any sign of old age</seg><seg type="columnLine">among them; no sagging muscles or graying hair to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impression of the years, only the deep cut lines about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mouth and the eyes themselves told that these were</seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not young men, the eyes expressing the story of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">years spent in gathering knowledge, understanding and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sagacity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman Alba-tais resembled the men in that last-</seg><seg type="columnLine">named feature. Wisdom lay deeply in her eyes, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were more orchid than lavender, but her body</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed nothing of age. She was as straight and upright</seg><seg type="columnLine">as any immature girl, although Alba-tais could have told</seg><seg type="columnLine">you that she was the mother of several children. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dressed identically like the men, except that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors of her suit varied. Her blouse was of deep rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her trousers a rich old ivory, and the jewels in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">gircHe were all black but glowing with the fire of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">diamond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elsie Rollins-weiti came down the stairs at the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the entrance of the party and greeted her fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low travelers warmly in their own tongue. Ezra had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready drawn Ubca-tor aside to show him the wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio set that Kington owned. Then Janson appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to announce dinner although for several moments he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was held speechless with surprise at the appearance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his master's guests. And for all that the servants were</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinated by the strangers, the dinner passed off fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After they had repaired to the drawing, room for</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffee and cigars, several more guests were admitted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house. These were four of Kington's confreres, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moran, the prime minister of England. The talk, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, resolved around Abrui and the benefits to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">derived from Earth by commerce with that distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. It was late when the five made their departure</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Kington's guests'were taken to their rooms. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a question as to where they could put the great bronze</seg><seg type="columnLine">man to bed, for although the others could manage to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make themselves fit in the accommodations at hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no bed to fit the Gor. He fixed it himself by</seg><seg type="columnLine">electing to lie on the floor, and with a mattress and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pillows he was made comfortable at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Mental Powers of the Abruians</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHAT occurred during the following weeks is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the common knowledge of the school children,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there is little need of giving for each day's</seg><seg type="columnLine">performances more than a cursory glance at what took</seg><seg type="columnLine">place in the city of London, when the extraordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">news of the arrival of the space-voyagers was given to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the public. The first day was spent in acquainting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists of the world with the news and of presenting</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with the proofs, namely the Abruians in evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and explaining to them what the Abruians had to offer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second day brought together some of the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads of the Earth's many nations, and then it was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ezra-weit, in company with several of his fellow-men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave mental demonstrations. Of these we will speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">more fully, for never before had the people of the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen such a phenomenon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the great hall where the meeting was being held a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large specially constructed screen was set upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform. It was opaque, and it had been demonstrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the benefit of any Doubting Thomas' that the screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no accompanying mechanisms. Thereupon the hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">was darkened, and taking their places before the screen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ezra and Ubca-tor sought to prove their mental powers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first it was difficult to distinguish the shape that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was taking form upon the screen; it seemed dimmed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">distorted, but slowly it cleared, the screen itself grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">brighter as the youth and the older man gained mastery</seg><seg type="columnLine">over it, and on it there was what appeared to be a round</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrestrial globe. It had a small satellite moon hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">not far above it, while another more distant and smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon shone as if from across a wide space. Those in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the auditorium realized it was not Earth, and Dorr who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken his place on the platform, explained in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">word, "Abrui!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It could be noticed that the world was different from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth. In relief they saw its mountains, plains and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">single ocean almost circular in shape with rough, ir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular shorelines and a large island continent in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">center, while far inland from the ocean, a hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty miles or so, were ranges of rough mountains almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">encircling the whole ocean. The low hanging globe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had at first been taken for a moon was now glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a warm rosy glow of its own, giving its light to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet, while the second moon so far and distant proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be old familiar Sol shining as a moon on this distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, less than a quarter the size it appeared from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That picture blurred now and another formed itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the audience was gazing down upon a landscape,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small portion of the world along an ocean shore. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">country was comparatively flat except for a few sand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dunes beside the water, but several miles inland hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">began and the country presented a pretty rolling aspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the majesty of purplish mountains far in the back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the scene shifted and it showed a country under</seg><seg type="columnLine">cultivation, large farmlands, small park-like forests and</seg><seg type="columnLine">large pasturages lay below. Some sort of cattle were</seg><seg type="columnLine">grazing and the shapes of men working with machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the field were projected for all to see. Another change</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a city sprawled across the screen. It was a unique</seg><seg type="columnLine">city built on the slope of a hill, one side of which was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer bluff with a drop of more than a thousand feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the serene river that came meandering through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">countryside. Atop the hill on what appeared to be its</seg><seg type="columnLine">crown, a mile in circumference were erected a half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen or so fine buildings of white stone which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more than one story in height, but architecturally</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented beautiful, graceful lines. The buildings were</seg><seg type="columnLine">grouped so as to form three sides of a square, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the buildings were spread beautiful gardens.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The open side of the buildings faced the hills' slope and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them a broad flight of steps dropped down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill to the very foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dorr did not speak this time but somehow all those</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the auditorium realized the fact that they were gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon Tunka, the capital of the Taboran nation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that upon the hill-top dwelt the ruler and his family.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And that here was also housed the parliamentary build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and the quarters of the royal guard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next they were looking down from the corona to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city that swept terrace after terrace down the hill to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain below. Ten wide terraces were to be counted on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were set lovely white houses with their gardens</seg><seg type="columnLine">and parks, each terrace being divided from the one be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low by a low wall covered with vines and greenery. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low the last terrace was a high wall, and on from it the</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses, smaller, less beautiful, were set. closer with</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller gardens and smaller parks, while only wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">avenues intercepted them. These houses spread all</seg><seg type="columnLine">ACROSS THE VOID</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">15</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">around the foot ot the hill until they met the shore of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river on either side of the promontory. And on either</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the bluff two bridges, causeway-like, but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw-bridges set in their center spanned the river to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet on the opposite side the wide undulating flats upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were dozens of long, low buildings, each a thous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feet by two thousand feet, one story in height, sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">metrically placed with wide avenues to separate them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the river were docks and large vessels resembling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whaleback grain and ore- boats of the G rejit Lakes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the United States stood in the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AGAIN those seeing this scene for the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood as readily as though Dorr had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained the meaning of all this. They grasped the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that only the members of the nobility were permitted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwell in the fine homes on the terraces, the commoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the city below, that the terraces themselves were di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided as to rank. The tors, or princes occupied the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">races just below the hill's corona, the weits, or baronets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perforce staying to the lowest terrace, while again the</seg><seg type="columnLine">commoners also lived according to their castes, separated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the avenues only.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fact that on Abrui money was unknown came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spectators in the assembly, even as the scenes had</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented themselves. They understood that on Abrui</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man was born to his rank as he was born to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">worldly possessions that were allotted him under govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental supervision according to his caste.* The com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moners provided the skilled and unskilled labor, the no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility the leaders and supervisors. Yet with it all caste</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not so iron-clad that a laborer might not through</seg><seg type="columnLine">his efforts lift himself upward among the leaders and</seg><seg type="columnLine">onto the terrace. Only he did not lift his family with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him unless his peers made special dispensation for them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once more the scene was changed, and the large island</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the single sea of Abrui swam into view. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Ora, the seat of learning of the planet, which being</seg><seg type="columnLine">neutral politically could not be prevailed upon by any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Powers to work in their behalf singly. Here a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fugitive, outcast or exile from one of the lands could</seg><seg type="columnLine">find sanctuary and he could not be extradited against his</seg><seg type="columnLine">will. Moura-weit had come here in his time and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble and Richard Dorr and Dana Gleason of Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">administered to their adopted world from their seat on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this island. And here came men and women from all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet to study and devote themselves to science.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abrui's greatest works were performed on Ora, Ora</seg><seg type="columnLine">which knew neither caste nor class and where each was</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted to follow what line of endeavor he chose for</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself as long as it was for the good of humanity. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple lines of the hundreds of buildings that covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island attested to the fact that here was simplicity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of understanding carried to the nth degree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were even more scenic views of the planet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were more cities like the first, seashore and moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain resorts, universities, mills, factories, mines, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great plantations that lay on the other side of the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain ranges. There was old Goraland of wastelands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">arid deserts, swamps and jungles, wherein Dorr had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the bronze men subsisting miserably before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced the Tabora to give up a portion of their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">fertile, well-watered lands to the Gors who, once civil-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> *Moura-weit had made himself Ur-tor (overprince) once, and had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">people thought he had gained that high position fairly his son would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been born a tor instead of a weit. On the retuVn of Mount's wife and</seg><seg type="columnLine">son the Taboranas had wished to dub them with princely rank, but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elsie Rollins-weiti refused, preferring to call herself weiti (Lady) instead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as her husband had called himself weit after his exile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ized, had become semi-barbarous under the conditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were forced upon them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were more scenes, but now with each succeed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing view, the screen was less clear, sometimes it blurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and grew indistinct. Then the screen became dark, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lights of the hall were switched on again. The show</seg><seg type="columnLine">was over. Ezra-weit and Ubca-tor had taxed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers and could project no more. People rose in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">seats and the acclaim was terrific. The names of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two were called loudly but they, having slipped behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stage, refused to appear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Richard Dorr took the platform to explain that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful demonstration they had just been shown was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the product of the minds of the two who had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to them, and although the performance might seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">miraculous to them, it was a daily occurrence upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abrui!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Yodverl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE following day Moura-weit's mighty Ship of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Void, the Yodverl, was brought out of hiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was docked upon the great airport atop the</seg><seg type="columnLine">World Air Lines Building. First, a small party of scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tists were taken aboard, then officials from over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, and at last the general public was permitted en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance, but that soon became impossible. Hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds and thousands of thousands had come flocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to London to view the ship at first hand and to allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">them all to visit it personally, would have necessitated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship's lying in dock for months to come. Thereupon</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the world had to be satisfied with viewing it through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the television.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pictures are preserved for us today; and there are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">accounts to be found in history books, but for fear that</seg><seg type="columnLine">some detail has been forgotten we shall outline its</seg><seg type="columnLine">features here. One thousand feet in length the Yodverl</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, cigar shaped and snowy white, constructed of forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">layers of that serviceable Abruian glass the shell was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger and more rigid than the diamond. It had that</seg><seg type="columnLine">unique quality, whereby those outside could not see</seg><seg type="columnLine">within, but those in the ship at various vantage points</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see outside as clearly as through ordinary plate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At each of the conical ends of the cigar were set the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great disks of the meteorite deflectors, machines that</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant so much to the safety of the ship in Space. Under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the port at the stern of the ship was set its airlock by</seg><seg type="columnLine">which voyagers could leave the flyer without affecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the atmosphere within the ship when on an alien un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried planet, but the main entrance, lay in one side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine, about fifty feet from the Yodverl's nose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This doorway was circular, and fitted so carefully as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to not be seen from the outside when closed, but opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon invisible and intricate hinges revealing a cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridor twenty-feet long, into which the door itself fitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly when not in use. The anteroom that this door</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealed was also the study and library of the flyer, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining thousands of Abruian and earthly books for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveler as well as the ship's log. Three doorways</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened from this chamber, the first leading into the pilot</seg><seg type="columnLine">room that took up the entire forepart of the ship being</seg><seg type="columnLine">set directly in its nose. Here were the controls that di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rected the flyer through space, although the motors</seg><seg type="columnLine">were located far aft. And here one had a clear, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">16</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">obstructed view of the heavens above, and out in space,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on either side and below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the floor forward, or rather in the curvature</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused by the nose of the ship, was set a great stellar</seg><seg type="columnLine">map that was highly interesting to the astronomer show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the solar system in miniature and a small area of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Universe round about in proper proportion as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">size and distance. To one side of the controls was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd arrangement of small round globes set in a circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">tank filled with a heavy liquid. Again these represented</seg><seg type="columnLine">the solar system, Sol, and the system of the ten planets</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to Abrui with their satellites and a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the largest asteroids. Intricate machineries controlled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the movements of the globes, which showed at all times</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exact position of each planet in its relation to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">star even to the slightest deviation caused by the action</seg><seg type="columnLine">of each planet upon another. This mechanism was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">valuable to the interplanetary pilot, as were dozens of</seg><seg type="columnLine">other instruments in the room, that would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting only to the astronomer; chronometers that</seg><seg type="columnLine">told solar and sidereal time on various worlds, instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments that felt out the dangers of space, instruments of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all sorts and descriptions without which space-naviga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion would have been virtually impossible. Practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the instruments to be seen were the inventions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moura-weit who had willed to his people all his effects.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And on studying his achievements, one has to concede</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was possibly one of the greatest men of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second door of the ante-room opened into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory where one was to find more intricate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">delicate instruments for various uses. Here was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venerian telescope whose complicated lenses made it</seg><seg type="columnLine">available for use within the twenty foot deep shell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Yodvcrl, and there were more intricate and delicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments for various uses. Here the scientist had</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed most of his works, his gravity nullifier, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteorite repeller, the ship's own gravitational field.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here he had accomplished the last steps of developing</seg><seg type="columnLine">solids from the ether stream, and here were to be found</seg><seg type="columnLine">three uncompleted machines that the inventor had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished at the time of his death. One of these appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a super-radio set, but was in truth the beginnings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the machine that is so useful to us of today, the Solid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Transformer, that sends solids from one locality to an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other by translating them into their atomic vibrations</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reassembling them again into their specific forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">at their destination. Luckily Moura-weit had left his</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes so that his son Ezra could succeed in completing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it for the use of the two worlds of Abrui and Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE third door leading from the anteroom opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the living quarters of the ship. In fitting out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel, Moura-weit had copied the appointments of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own home as exactly as he could, so on entering, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself immediately within the confines of a typical</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abruian home. The first chamber, the atol, was identi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal with the living room of the Earth home, for here the</seg><seg type="columnLine">family gathered when the day's work and fun was over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the Abruian atol serves more purposes than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing room of our homes. It was also the recreation</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, as well as the dining room, resembling the ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roman atrium in some respects. The room was thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet wide and forty long, and in its center was a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">swimming pool in the middle of which a tiny fountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">played. Potted flowers of Abrui grew around its edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on the mosaic tile floor were arranged wide comfort-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">able couches, and a number of Abruian metal three-</seg><seg type="columnLine">legged chairs, far more comfortable than our own. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls of the room were ten feet in height and were</seg><seg type="columnLine">also tiled, depicting a typical Abruian landscape scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a city on one hill'and.the two suns, Sol and Tradr,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the satellite, in the midday sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ceiling of the chamber was the clear white glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Abrui, the inner skin of the ship's shell. And here we</seg><seg type="columnLine">come across the strangest features of all of Abrui. Fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them is of little use because of their great deposits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">radium and radium also supplants electricity, Radium</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone spells power upon Abrui. Thus by treating the glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">roofs of their homes with a radium solution, the Abru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ians force their suij'to do double duty for them. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">radioactive quality of radium is such that during the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sunlight is absorbed by it, and at night becoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">flourescent it gives off the light thus received when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun sets, just as phosphorus gives off light when dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness sets in. * By imbedding tiny invisible wires through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass, it is possible to switch off this light when re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired by arresting the action of the radium particles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So in the case of the Yodverl, its entir,e one thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot length with it twenty-foot shell, was in truth a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great storage battery absorbing heat and light when in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun's glare, dispensing it with the coming of dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second room beyond the atol was called the dof,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was the inner private room of the family. The dof</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the atol had tiled walls picturing a more intimate</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene in a garden with the life-like figures of men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">women and children in their leisure moments. Flowers</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew about the walls so that they appeared to blend into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the picture itself, or rather it made the observer feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though the painted figures would soon turn to speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. Beside the two entrance doors at either end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber, one from the anteroom, the other opening to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long corridor beyond, there were also six doorways on</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side of the room, three on either side. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave access to the sleeping chambers. Four of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms were of small size, plainly, though neatly fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nished, with a wide sleeping couch, a chair, a chest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawers and a full length mirror. The walls were of</seg><seg type="columnLine">creamy tile, but it was the fifth room that proved most</seg><seg type="columnLine">interesting. Here two of the smaller rooms had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacrificed to the larger one, which was furnished in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful fashion, as though for a queen. One who</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew the story of the two lovers, understood im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately that Moura-weit, with loving hands, had fash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ioned that room for his wife Elsie Rollins, when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed him into the Void.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the dof a wide corridor ran for fifteen feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so with doors lining the walls. The first two doors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one on either side of the hall, proved to be bath-rooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">with everything installed for the comfort of the traveler,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the remainder of the doors were the entrances to</seg><seg type="columnLine">large storerooms, a small placard on each door naming</seg><seg type="columnLine">the articles contained therein in Abruian writing. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the corridor a doorway opened into the ship's</seg><seg type="columnLine">galley and kitchen. Here again had been a surprise for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first earthlings who saw it, for in truth the kitchen</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a revelation. Had the Abruians nothing more to</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer than their unique cooking and refrigerating units</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would have found a ready market on Earth, as in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed they did. No longer need the housewife of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet cry out against the drudgery of the kitchen as of</seg><seg type="columnLine">yore, she need only to drop the food in the neat radium-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ACROSS THE VOID</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">17</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">treated glass dish, and minutes thereafter see each in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividual portion cooked to a turn!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet one can imagine the wonder of the first to enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to see the unkitchenlike appearance of the ship's</seg><seg type="columnLine">galley with nothing more than the plain, clean walls of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">room no more than eight feet square in view, but which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the twist of a little switch on one wall revealed in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">its mechanical wonder. Its walls disappeared as if by</seg><seg type="columnLine">magic with row after row of shelves appearing instead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on which* were arranged dishes of all shapes and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs, all of glass, all snowy white. To one side stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">the refrigerator, enclosed entirely in glass holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">fruits and vegetables that had made the trip from Abrui</seg><seg type="columnLine">as fresh as the day they had been picked, and yet with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out revealing any machinery, nothing to keep the viands</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their excellent state of preservation. Again it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radium that gave a "cold-control" as well as the heating</seg><seg type="columnLine">devices. Frozen drinks, ice-cream, all could be produced</seg><seg type="columnLine">as easily as the cookery was performed. Only the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides of the dishes were so treated as we know so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">one could hold within the hand the dish as it cooked a</seg><seg type="columnLine">toothsome dinner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond the kitchen of the Yodverl lay the small stable</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which were housed the small herd of muti, Abruian</seg><seg type="columnLine">cows, resembling somewhat our deer, that were always</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried by the space-travelers to provide them with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh milk, since no amount of refrigeration will keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">the liquid fresh and its vitamines intact. To the Abru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ian, milk is as necessary to his diet as bread is to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earthman. At the present time the Yodverl was carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing eleven of the pretty deer-like creatures. The bull</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this particular herd was the descendent of the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitu to have been born on Moura-weit's first journey to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth twenty years before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mitu have never grown familiar to Earth since we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have sufficient bovines of our own breeding to meet our</seg><seg type="columnLine">demands, and besides the Earthmen have never felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">need of having to introduce the talking beasts of Abrui</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our world. As one knows, the Abruians had long</seg><seg type="columnLine">since discovered the language of their domesticated cow</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they have of most their beasts and therefore are able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to converse with them to a small extent. However, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mentality of the beasts is of a low degree, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">language is very simple and very little informative.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond the stable which was kept as neatly as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of the ship, another corridor continued on through</seg><seg type="columnLine">more storerooms to the air-lock and into the motor-room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the small radium motors were locked away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIII</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Results of the Great Conference</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER the preliminaries with the introduction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Abruians and their ship were gone through,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-	the greatest conference the earth had ever known</seg><seg type="columnLine">was held, and before the week was up, arrangements for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a commercial line to ply between earth and Abrui had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been completed. Once the Earth people had recovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their excitement and wonder, the business went</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly. What held up the signing of the articles for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">new commission was the refusal at first of the Abruians</seg><seg type="columnLine">to agree to sell to Earth a single one of their interplane-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary machines. However, it was Dorr who brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace to the conference by signing a treaty that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreeable to both parties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was agreed, therefore, that a committee made up</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of both Earthling and Abruian ambassadors were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have complete control over the building of the machines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowing but a limited number of the flyers to be built</seg><seg type="columnLine">at any time, and thus make it certain that neither world</seg><seg type="columnLine">could commandeer a single machine for its own pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose. To the World Court of Earth the plans and blue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prints of the machines were to be submitted, to be kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">under lock and key, so that if ever the Abruians were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">break their contract, the people of Earth would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the means of protecting their own planet. Men of both</seg><seg type="columnLine">worlds were to share in building the machines, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">improvements were incorporated in the ships themselves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">these changes were to be recorded on the blue-prints held</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Earth. Furthermore, five ambassadors from Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to take up residence with their families on Abrui</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the same numbers of Abruians were to do like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise on Earth, thereby knitting the two worlds more</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In later years, when bitter arbitration was to arise</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the two planets over their trade monopolies, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisdom of Dorr's treaty was to prove itself, but that, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, does not concern the present history. We do</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize the benefits of this inter-exchange between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two worlds today, and we ought to be thankful to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">far-sighted vision of that great statesman who made it all</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible. With affairs as they are, with the slow as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">similaton of the various races of both Earth and Abrui,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can see the day when the two great worlds will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">true brothers under the skin. Ezra-weit, son of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abruian, Moura-weit and of the woman of Earth, Elsie</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rollins, is a fair example of what the two great races</seg><seg type="columnLine">of each world have to offer. It may take many hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds, even thousands of years, but in the meantime we</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the increasing flow of tourists from both worlds, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">migrations and emigrations from one planet to the other,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the firm establishments of Earthmen on Abrui and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abruians on Earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There are no people more affable and deserving of</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendship than the Abruians, no people more kindly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more courageous or inventive. Looking about us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seeing all the improvements in our own everyday</seg><seg type="columnLine">life brought to us from Abrui, we can only be thankful</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the greatest scientist of all, Professor Ezra Rollins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who made this possible when he dispatched Dana Glea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son and Richard Dorr out into the Void!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But to return to the day we all recall. Twenty years</seg><seg type="columnLine">before this the advent of the Graf Zeppelin piloted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Hugo Eckner had created a furor throughout the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, but it could not compare in any way to the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement when the Yodverl left the World Air Lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">Port to return homeward with the good news of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">affiliation between Earth and that distant world, Abrui!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a bright summer's day when the great ship rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the blue sky with the ohs and ahs of the multi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tudes below accompanying it; its great length seeming</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fill the heavens as it reflected the bright glare of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun on the upturned faces. There were to be greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships in the service between the planets, many times</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger than the Yodverl which was to be their model. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, the first ships of the fleet, two thousand feet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">length, are now dwarfed by the gigantic leviathans that</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross the Void weekly, but to those watching the Yod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verl rising into the skies, it was thought great enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never before had there been such a celebration as</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. The Yodverl was carrying a number of the latest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in radio instruments and for seven hours after leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Earth's atmospheric blanket, the Abruians were</seg><seg type="columnLine">18</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">enabled to listen to the program broadcast in its honor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Today, when radio transmission is carried across the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tervening 3,557,000,000 miles of space, the seven-hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">program appears to us a poor feat, but to the Earth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">people it was then a fine tribute to their science and</seg><seg type="columnLine">taught that sound could travel through space, despite all</seg><seg type="columnLine">correctly worked-out theories to the contrary, and so lead</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ultimate success in that field.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Part II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LOVE OF MOURA-WEIT</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was some weeks later on the island of Ora on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet Abrui that there was a gathering of</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar faces. There was Dana Gleason and Rich-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ard Dorr, formerly of Earth, but now heart and soul of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abrui, Elsie Rollins-weiti, also of Earth and her son,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ezra-weit. And there was Walter Kington, late of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth, that planet's first ambassador to Abrui. Ubca-tor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was there also, but he kept himself far back in the deep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening shadows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were all seated in the lovely gardens of Dana</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gleason and Richard Dorr's home on the island con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tradr, the satellite sun, had just then sunk below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horizon in a burst of glory, but old Sol gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">silvery radiance to the scene. Neither Mercury, Venus</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor Earth could be picked out of the firmament. Because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their proximity to the sun, they were rarely ever seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Abrui, and then only pin points of light. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune were</seg><seg type="columnLine">more in prominence. Great Jupiter glowed like a tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-moon in the distance, Saturn with his rings was</seg><seg type="columnLine">brighter, but of them all the great green planet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Neptune lay like a monster sickle but a degree away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Sol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a discussion in the garden in which Dana</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gleason, a handsome matron with but a faint show of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray in her black hair, was apparently the leading factor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, Elsie," she was saying, "I quite agree with Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kington, Dick and Ezra that it is only right that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeat the tale of your adventures with your revered</seg><seg type="columnLine">husband, Moura. It really belongs to the history of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth and Abrui, for never has there been a greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure than Moura-weit in all time, and he belongs to us</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost as much as to you.

Slowly she glanced about the circle at</seg><seg type="columnLine">its various members. Her eyes lingered longest on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of her son, then crept beyond the group to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ubca-tor, Moura-weit's closest friend sat on a bench de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tached from the others.

You knew him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-	as a man who was set apart from other men be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause he was made of other things than men are made</seg><seg type="columnLine">of*, a man whose brain had delved into every science</seg><seg type="columnLine">and who took from the minds of his fellowmen all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he required for himself! Once, when he was young,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had made the mistake of being too ambitious, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his ambition was prepared to break any man or</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman who stood in his way, but he had learned in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard school where he had erred and the remainder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his life was spent in considering others instead of him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. Everything he did henceforth was done for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">good of humanity, expiation for his early sins And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">died because he sought to save another from making</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same hideous mistakes he himself had made. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed the outer void to accomplish that deed!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Moura came to the little bungalow on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">African veldt where Uncle Ezra and I had continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">to live quietly since that memorial night when Dana and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick had departed ostensibly for Mars, the wounds in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heart had not yet been healed. Moura was just learn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the truth about himself and was hurt by what he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered. In turn, I hated him thoroughly when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told us the part he had played in the lives of our friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his villainous attitude toward them, but I pitied him too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for in his eyes was all the suffering he had been through.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In bringing to the professor word from Dana and Dick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">word that they were safe and happy at last, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">forged the first links in the chain that bound him to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">new self!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moura had not wished to tell us his name after re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lating the story of the adventures of the two Earthlings</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Abrui in which he had figured so strongly as villain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had all but ruined their chances for happiness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all but ruined a world, but he was too much a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lie when Uncle Ezra asked his name, so he had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">us the truth. Again, he had no desire to carry us with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into space; he wished for no other companionship</seg><seg type="columnLine">as yet but that of his one true friend, the golden man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who preferred exile with him to freedom with his people</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Abrui. Yet he conceded to the old scientist's wishes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because he was able to appreciate what it meant for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old professor to have the chance to see at first hand the</seg><seg type="columnLine">universe he had known only through the telescope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were five of us in the Yodverl when it headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from Earth; Ubca-tor, Moura-weit, Urto, Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ezra and myself. The ship, as you know, is readily</seg><seg type="columnLine">piloted by a single man for once out of the confines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a world the controls are locked, the pilot only being</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary when the ship was passing through dangerous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> *On Abrui is the legend that Moura-weit was not born of flesh but</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the offspring of a group of scientists who believed the foundation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Life is Thought and through their combined efforts had brought forth a</seg><seg type="columnLine">child without the aid of flesh, endowing him with the power of their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">brains. And because of his extraordinary powers the Abruians liked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that Moura-weit was that child because of his seeming supernatural</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of invention and perception. In speaking here, his wife may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended to convey such a thought, # but it is more likely that she Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">referring merely to the fact he was in truth a superman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">ACROSS THE VOID</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">19</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">areas filled with meteorites or aerolites. At these times</seg><seg type="columnLine">all three of the Abruians took their spells, Urto could</seg><seg type="columnLine">manage the ship as well as Moura or Ubca.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Richard Dorr freed the golden men of Moata</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their slavery to the Tabora, Urto might have gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">free, too, being a prince in his own name, but like Ubca,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had preferred exile with Moura. Both of them would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have laid their lives down for him, if the need was ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">to arise. Urto did try to save Moura when he fell on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the planet, Kal, but though he died, he was unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save his master.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for myself I could not help but admire the man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">MoUra, even though I detested him for what he had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most done to my friends on Abrui. He was a handsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">man judging from both Earth and Abrui standards, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an arresting personality that forced one to like him re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gardless of what he had done or failed to do. (Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dana Gleason nodded affirmatively.) Later I was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what it meant to love him far more intensely than</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hated him, but that did not come immediately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had not wanted to go on this trip from Earth. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreaded it, fearful of what could happen out there in</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, but Uncle Ezra would have it no other way. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had told me I was free to stay home, but of course I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not allow him to go without me. He had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother and father to me, the only person who belonged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me, in fact. He was an old man already when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent the rocket to Mars, and the years during which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaited the message from Dana had aged him more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the years should have done. Now, I had the feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was not to return to Earth alive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sunward!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">YOU all know as much about the mechanics of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yodverl as the Interplanetary Commission are</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing for you to know, as much as I do, in fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I am not a scientist enough to understand it all fully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We do know that after years of study, Moura had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered that each planet, each sun, tosses off vibratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulses into space, vibrations that Moura carefully has</seg><seg type="columnLine">plotted for us, and which the simple radium motors of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Yodverl are attuned to as a magnet is attuned to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">lodestone and attracted to it as uerringly as the arrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">goes to the bull's eye. Magnetic streams we call them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Uncle Ezra had asked that first we visit Sol, as close</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it was humanly possible to go, and Moura had set his</seg><seg type="columnLine">intricate dials, allying his ship to the vibratory impulses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sun. As yet there were no gravity nullifiers on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Yodvcrlr so the ship had to depend wholly upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's attraction to draw us from Earth's bosom which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Moura explained to us, was not entirely dependable</seg><seg type="columnLine">as long as we were within Earth's blanket which tended</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shut away much of the impulses. Consequently, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip through the Earth's blanket was not overly pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant, for we went in jerks and starts that threw us from</seg><seg type="columnLine">our balance as Earth intervened continually, seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold us to her. Once it seemed as if Earth should</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely regain us as we went into a fall of several thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand feet, but Moura at the dials quickly switched them</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the sun to the moon gleaming there in the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. The change steadied us, and the meters told us</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were rising properly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moura suggested now that both Uncle and I retire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">couches in the atol so that we should not suffer too in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensely from space-sickness that would be brought upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">us by the change from Earth's gravitational pull to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">weightless condition. The Abruians were accustomed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">these changes, but we would feel its full force. Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ezra did not wish to leave the pilot room but I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">docilely enough, and I was glad to hide my face in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cushions in the attempt to forget what was happening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I must have fallen asleep for a while for when I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came aware of my surroundings, I felt horribly sick, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick that I wanted to die then and there. I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">open my eyes for the room would spin around and</seg><seg type="columnLine">around. Then I had the sensation as though I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">strapped down with heavy bonds and could not move a</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscle. This sensation persisted for a number of min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes, became certain reality, so again I essayed to open</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes to peer about. The room was steadier this time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sure enough I saw I was bound down to the couch</seg><seg type="columnLine">with heavy straps, one across my chest, the other across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thighs. What could it mean? Frantically looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, I saw on the couch near at hand that Uncle Ezra</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been dealt with in the same manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thoroughly frightened, I sought the answer. Had we</seg><seg type="columnLine">been made prisoners in our sleep? But why? Were we</seg><seg type="columnLine">not prisoners enough on this space-ship? Quaking with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear I did not know what I awaited. My vigil was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">for long. Urto appeared in the doorway. He carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tray on which he was holding two long rubber blad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders and he was smiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In astonishment, I watched him approach, for never</seg><seg type="columnLine">had I seen a man walk as he walked, strange, slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">slithering walk, in which he did not raise his feet from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor. He came in this fashion to the side of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">couch, and I shrank away from him as far as my straps</seg><seg type="columnLine">would allow, now certain that he must be drunk or out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his head, for he had taken one of his rubber bladders</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his tray, which he had set down on the floor care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully, then held it toward my face. I started to struggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he was saying something in a soothing voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He spoke but a few words in English and those were</seg><seg type="columnLine">unintelligible to me-until later, when I had learned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand him better. Now the situation was made</seg><seg type="columnLine">more horrible, for I thought I was in the hands of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">madman. While he sought to fasten the bladder over</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mouth and nose, I strove to evade it by turning from</seg><seg type="columnLine">side to side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the while he was seeking to soothe away my fears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to coerce me into submitting to his ministrations. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have screamed, but so intent was my struggle, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never thought to use my voice and at last he succeeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in accomplishing what he wished. When the open mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bladder was over my mouth and nose, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing for me to do but to try to breathe, and in breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, I was doing what he wanted me to do, I was taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">into my lungs the contents of the bladder. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweetish, clean odor that came to me; then the bladder</seg><seg type="columnLine">was empty and I was choking for air. Quickly Urto re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved it from my face and then busied himself in re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving the straps that held me down. Immediately I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was surprised at the feeling of well-being that filled me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All sickness was gone, and I felt as free and light as</seg><seg type="columnLine">thistle-down. Sitting up suddenly I was shocked to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself shooting from the couch straight into the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room and up until my head met the ceiling!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">URTO seemed to have expected just such a move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment on my part and I felt him grasp one of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet as he pulled me down to the floor again. Standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">shakily on my feet, I understood it all and began to laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">20</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">--to laugh until the tears came. Urto laughed in com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">radely fashion with me. First he had strapped me down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the couch so I would not go floating off from it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my present weightless condition, then he had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought to settle my stomach with the inhalation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixed gases in his rubber bag! And I, silly fool, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">misunderstood it all!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At that moment Ubca-tor appeared in the doorway</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and came with a dragging walk towards us to inquire</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">solicitously as to my condition. I told him how great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I felt, and as Urto turned to minister to Uncle Ezra</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">who had just opened his eyes, we watched the opera-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion. The old professor showed no surprise at what was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">done to him, and then he was on his feet exclaiming at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what a wondrous sensation it was to be without weight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Between the two of them, Ubca and Urto taught us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the first rudiments of space-walking. We were very</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">awkward at first, and more often than not had to reach</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for a support. Left alone, we might easily lose our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">equilibrium and go floating off to the ceiling, then to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">settle in the center of the chamber between floor and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ceiling with nothing near to cling to. For the first few</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">days the two of us kept the Abruians busy rescuing us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We had, instead, to learn to control our every move-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment, to walk slowly and not to make a too sharp turn</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or gesture. Later, we accomplished the feat of air-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swimming,so thatwith flaying arms and legs we could push</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ourselves through the weightless air to some destination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Presently, by taking our arms, Ubca and Urto led us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the pilot room where Moura awaited us. Looking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through the clear glass of the pilot room I was non-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plussed by what I saw. No one can picture that awful</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wonder of space, and when I saw Earth dwindled in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">size so that I could no longer make out the shape of its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">continents, I cried out in pain. There was the moon in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quadrant slowly moving on its way beside Earth, grow-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing smaller and smaller as we drew away: Later, as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the distance grew greater, Earth commenced to become</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slightly luminous, and the wonder and beauty of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aurora with its glorious streams more than several</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet in height was an inspiring sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And now the sun was shining full upon us, so brightly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it hurt the eyes to look at the great globe. Later, a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">black curtain had to be drawn around the walls of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pilot room, else the light and heat there would have be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">come intolerable. In the living quarters it was better</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">since the light shone through the walls above obliquely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and we received only the afterglow. Of course, only the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">forepart of the ship was receiving the full blast of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sun, and the radium treated shell was gathering the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">energy to store away for further use or to redistribute</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">so as to keep the ship at an even temperature through-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As you are aware, the energy from the sun does not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">•	actually come to us as heat. The waves merely carry</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'the energy, which becomes'heat only when it acts on or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">against a substance that is capable of translating it as such.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A black rough surface does not reflect the heat and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">waves will pass through a transparent object without</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">warming or lighting it. And but for the fact that there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were solids in our ship, we would have received neither</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heat nor light. As it was, the rear of the ship had none</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of this but felt the bitter cold and darkness of space so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it required an intricate system of heating and refrigera-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion to keep the ship comfortable throughout its length</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at all times. However, as we drew nearer and nearer Sol</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">less heat was needed and more frigeration was used in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stead, else we could not have stood the close approach to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Day after day slipped by as we neared Sol, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all filled with wonder at the great yellow body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here was no atmosphere to refract the rays and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to study the great sunspots by the hour, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">chart their courses, for this was a year of many magnetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">storms on the star. Above and all around us were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant stars of the galaxy, the Milky Way, the won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drous sash girdling the whole cosmos. The more bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant stars, Sirius, Capella, Vega, Canopus, Alpha Cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tauri, Betelgeuse and others sparkled and shone like</seg><seg type="columnLine">jewels, unblinkingly brilliant and glowing in all their</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural colors of red, yellow, green, violet, orange, steel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue and blue-white. Each constellation showed in all its</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect beauty and we could see clearly the component</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts of a number of the doube stars or binaries. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds of the Milky Way were glorious formations, mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing bright the otherwise black night, making us feel just</seg><seg type="columnLine">how small we of the almost insignificant planet Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of Abrui were. Here were the five of us daring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Infinite, sheltered by walls of glass, small atoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the worlds of immensity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Venus lay far to the right of us and we were barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to make out Mercury against the splendor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's corona, but soon Venus was passed by and gradu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally the diminutive Mercury detached himself from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">limb of Sol to allow us to see him more clearly and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think what life would be on that hot-cold little world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On leaving Earth, we were traveling at the leisurely</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate of one hundred and fifty miles per second. Moura</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared to travel any faster than that in approaching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun for of course Sol's power is tremendous and once</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were in his grip it was a question as to whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not we could have pulled out. As it was, we never</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully headed toward him, and upon coming within about</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty million miles or so of him we veered away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then commenced the journey around his great bulk using</seg><seg type="columnLine">his emanations now as a brake against him. The jour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney around the star was short, and throughout the trip,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship rocked as if in a heavy gale. The sight that</seg><seg type="columnLine">met our eyes when we dared to look for a short space of</seg><seg type="columnLine">time was a terrible one. After one or two glances</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the mirror Moura had rigged up in the pilot</seg><seg type="columnLine">room (it would have been impossible to look directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the sun and keep our eyes intact) I gleaned most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my knowledge of that sight from the copious notes</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle Ezra afterwards wrote. He had brought a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of note books as well as several astronomical in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struments with him, with which he had busied himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the entire trip, and for hours thereafter he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but write upon his new discoveries of the sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spots, mighty prominences, chromosphere, reversing</seg><seg type="columnLine">layer and photosphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As far as we knew, we were the first living beings to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have ever approached so close to Sol. Perhaps others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Mars or some of the moons of Jupiter or Saturn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come before us, but here there were no monuments</seg><seg type="columnLine">to man's achievements, and none to answer our ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. Had we not donned dark insulated clothing as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as the dark glasses, we could not have come through</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a whole skin for now the glare was coming through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ceiling of the living quarters and the heat was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">broiling .point. When we withdrew from the sun's di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rect rays, we found our skins badly burned with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, and for two days we were partially blinded. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">ACROSS THE VOID</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">21</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it was worth the experience to see the delight in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale eyes of the old scientist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SWINGING away from the sun now at a tangent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we headed for Mercury, which lay on an angle</seg><seg type="columnLine">from us at about thirty million miles. Uncle was</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to explore there and we all felt a need of a rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon terra firma no matter how uninviting it might be.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So far I have failed to mention some of the dangers we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to pass through in approaching Sol, dangers that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would no longer be present. But that was before Moura</seg><seg type="columnLine">had invented the meteorite deflector. In passing into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the area surrounding Sol, we found on the entire trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">there and outward to Mercury that every minute we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in danger of being struck by the space stones, free</seg><seg type="columnLine">agents torn from stars or surging through space by</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves and caught in the grip of Sol. They came</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunging toward him at terrific speeds to fall like peb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bles into the burning heart of the great star.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A lookout had had to watch continually so we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodge these 'stones,' two of which had been the size of</seg><seg type="columnLine">small moons, but on turning in the direction of Mercury</seg><seg type="columnLine">we ran into a swarm. Luckily there were no large ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the mass, none measuring more than six feet or so</seg><seg type="columnLine">in diameter with most of them from a few inches across</seg><seg type="columnLine">to about one or two feet. Ubca who was at the controls</seg><seg type="columnLine">dodged the larger fragments, and we could hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller ones ofttimes impinging against the Yodverl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides, but we did not worry about them for they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do no damage to our glass shell. However, we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad when we passed the swarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have already spoken slightly of the experience of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">weightless condition and its inconvenience in moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the ship, but that was really the least of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubles once we had learned to adapt ourselves to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">change. We had our humorous moments, too, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to laugh every time I attempted to sit in a chair for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it actually took physical force to draw oneself down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seat's level and hold oneself there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All furniture was fastened to its place on the floor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thence straps were added so that once seated one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">"stay put," for unless this precaution were taken after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment or so the "seatee" might find himself floating</seg><seg type="columnLine">away to the center of the room, there to retain the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">position of sitting with the difference of not having</seg><seg type="columnLine">the support of the chair. In sleeping, the same thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was applicable. One had to be strapped to the couch or</seg><seg type="columnLine">else awake to find the couch several feet below, if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had happened to move in his sleep. I do not think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that anyone (not even Moura, Ubca or Urto) can ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">become entirely accustomed to the vagaries of living</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the completeness of a weightless condition. I can't.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the matter of controlling liquids, more difficulties</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose. Liquids, as you know, take the form of a sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">when weightless, and are subject to their own forces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cohesion and surface tension and only striking a wetted *</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface will follow that and spread over it. For ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample, our weightless water in a partly filled bottle will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not occupy the bottom but will leave the center empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the liquid flows around the sides of the vessel. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">most difficult thing, consequently, is to empty the bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">once it is filled. And naturally it is impossible to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">water in an open vessel for as more surface becomes</seg><seg type="columnLine">wetted the water will spread out of its container, ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hering to every new surface it encounters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For this reason the water from the pool in the atol</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been drawn off on leaving Earth's gravity, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor and walls had been thoroughly dried. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Urto's business to look after this matter as well as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepare our meals, and in this he was unucually in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">genious. For instance, by using mechanical force, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was able to direct the water from the vats into rubber</seg><seg type="columnLine">bladders that he kept for that purpose; then he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">placc the bladders in the refrigerator until the water was</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid, so that it was possible to chip off the amount he</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed, remelting it in smaller wide-necked rubber tubes</seg><seg type="columnLine">or bottles. In cooking, he perforce used covered dishes</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We, on the other hand, had to drink the water from</seg><seg type="columnLine">these same rubber bottles by putting the mouth to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouths and, by pushing or squeezing its end, force the</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid into our throats. If perchance the water escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the bottle, it would assume its spherical shape and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to capture it again we had only to place a dish against</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and allow it to spread over the dish; as else, we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk up to it, grasp it with our lips and suck it into</seg><seg type="columnLine">our mouths! Once it was in the mouth, we had to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tongue to force it into the throat and there the me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanical action of the muscles of the throat, esophagus</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stomach would do the rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In bathing ourselves, we had only to liberate a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere from one of the rubber bottles, dip our face and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands into it, then soap could be lathered on, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">water added to rinse it and then all could be wiped away</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a towel. The same was true in bathing the body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although we had to be careful to keep it from spreading</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all parts of the room. For this we used a rubber bag</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was fastened both to the floor and ceiling, and into</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we enclosed both ourselves and the water. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had to be careful that the head did not become en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely submerged, else we would have drowned then</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So you can see that with all these difficulties we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gladdened over the prospect of descending upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet, Mercury, unenticing as it was!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MERCURY turns its axis once in each of its years</seg><seg type="columnLine">and therefore presents one side to the sun at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">times as it makes its single rotation about that star, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotation of eighty-eight days. The surface facing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun thereby attains a terrific degree of heat while its</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark face equals the cold of eternal night, since its at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mospheric blanket is too slight to carry any of the heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">received on one side to the other. And in that portion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the globe where the light and dark meet is the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">place where man can hope to put foot and survive. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ubca directed the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Uncle Ezra was of the opinion he might find life</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and he wanted to make his everlasting observations.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ubca discovered below us a fairly level piece of ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">to which we made our way. Never have I seen a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloomy, weird and gruesome landscape. The ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself was lividly white in the glare of our lights, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there appeared small purplish growths of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort. In that Uncle was right. He found life on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mercury, but only that simple specimen that was organic</seg><seg type="columnLine">but hardly lifelike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we had drawn near we could feel the pull of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mercury's gravity, slight though it was compared to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Earth. Its mass was but 0.22 against the 1.00 of Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">while its surface gravity was 0.31 instead of 1.00. Thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">a body belonging to Earth loses over two-thirds of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">22</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">weight upon landing on the smaller planet, but that slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitational power was enough to hold water down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">its level and we were to have the pleasure of seeing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pool fill up again. The water had more "buoyancy," as</seg><seg type="columnLine">ive may term it, than on Earth. A drop flung into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air went higher and did not fall so rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as the Yodverl was safely landed, we all</seg><seg type="columnLine">donned bathing suits and headed for the pool. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abruians are great swimmers, spending much of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">time in their pools, as you know, and it was a great in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">convenience to Moura, Ubca and Urto to be deprived</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their swims while in space. Uncle Ezra was for go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing outdoors immediately, but Moura forbade that. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">recommended that for the next twelve hours at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">we all take a complete rest, and since our eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies were sore from the treatment we had had from</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Sol, Moura's suggestion was properly given. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">Uncle Ezra saw the wisdom of this and submitted grace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully, though all the while he was aching to be out ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploring the gloomy terrain beyond the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Urto had retired directly to his kitchen and shortly</seg><seg type="columnLine">thereafter came forth bearing a tray of food, grinning</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadly, because at last things placed down stayed down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So after our plunge, we ate our first "Mercurian" meal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to drink water propeily and not have to hold the</seg><seg type="columnLine">food on our plates with the cutlery. A little later we</seg><seg type="columnLine">all retired for the most refreshing and wholesome sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had had in a week. At Moura's suggestion, I rubbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself down with his healing salve, so that when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">awoke, all the soreness of the sunburn was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On awakening we went for another swim. This time</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went into the kitchen to help Urto. In the days past</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had learned all of his culinary art and taught him some</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earthly tricks of cookery and thereafter I shared a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great deal of the work of keeping the ship in order, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not sit quietly with hands folded. Neither Moura</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor Ubca were averse to giving Urto aid in his tasks</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he sometimes shared the piloting of the ship with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. And he was a handy man in Moura's laboratory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact, except that he waited on us, there was never</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything to show that he was the servant. The only way</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which he actually differed from the others was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew scarcely a word of English, so it was difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me to converse with him, but as I had already taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the study of Abruian for the want of something</seg><seg type="columnLine">better to do, we were soon to overcome that handicap.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All three Abruians were glad to teach me the words of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their language.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, much to the relief of Uncle Ezra, Moura was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to go with him to investigate the planet. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no desire to go out into the desolate world nor had Ubca</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inclination, but Urto elected to accompany the others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the pilot room Ubca and I watched their progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the twilight, where only their torch lights illu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minated the way. The sun appeared as a great orange</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball on the horizon, never seeming to change its position</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Going out to the airlock the three had donned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hermetically sealed suits that were used for outside wear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made them look all the world like deep sea divers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After dressing the air was pumped from the lock and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sample of Mercury's atmosphere taken. It was found</seg><seg type="columnLine">too poor for human consumption, containing a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">small percent of oxygen. Mercury's thin atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">is due to the fact that the little planet's surface gravity</seg><seg type="columnLine">is insufficient to retain a viery extensive envelope. Uncle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ezra was aware of this truth since he knew the albedo*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of Mercury to be but 0.07, but he had wished to prove</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> this for himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   With this test completed, the outer door of the lock</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> was opened and the three stepped upon the bleak world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We saw them go stumbling over the rough uneven</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ground, now and then stooping to study something on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the ground. A stumble usually sent them flying several</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> feet through the air before they landed ludicrously on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> some part of the anatomy not intended for such usage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But since their decreased weight sat so lightly upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> them, they did not suffer a great deal from these falls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moura and Urto were careful that the professor did not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> stumble overmuch, and when he did they managed to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> keep him on his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> THEY were gone more than two hours, disappearing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> almost completely into the darkness. When they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> returned, they were laden down with specimens they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> had collected, samples of rock and ores that proved rich</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> in minerals. In the small area of no more than two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> miles circumference they had found iron, copper, tin,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> aluminum, platinum, uranium, not to mention commoner</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> minerals such as those of sodium, calcium, magnesium</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and others. The next day they went farther and came</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> back to report that Mercury was in truth a world rich in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> metal, a metallic world to be more exact. Moura pre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> dicted that in the future, men would come to Mercury</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> for the sole purpose of gathering its wealth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   What proved the most interesting to the expedition,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> however, were the living speciments they had found.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have mentioned that on landing we had noted clumps</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of what seemed to be living matter. Uncle Ezra had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> examined this formation and in Moura's laboratory a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> more extensive investigation was made. The thing looked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> like a mushroom at first with a purple head with soft</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> frilled edges that withered at the touch. The oddest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> part of it was the underbody, which appeared to be a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> root but was instead more like a snake, or rather a worm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And even now, after it had been uprooted, it wiggled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> slowly, and tried to move out of the reach of prying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> fingers. I had cried out in horror when I saw that hap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> pen. "What is it?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Uncle Ezra chuckled. "I am not enough of a natural-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ist to say for sure, Elsie, but I know I can make a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> guess. I think this thing is a zoophyte or in other words</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a plant-animal, a compound creature! You have read</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Darwin's 'Voyage of the Beagle' and you may recall</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> his mention of compound animals, corrallines, creatures</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> with worm-like bodies and plant-like heads able to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> move about and produce eggs. See, here you can make</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> out the deposits of eggs under these frills of the head,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and if you look closely you will see some of the eggs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that have developed into individual polyps, still adhering</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to the parent. They will do so until full grown. It's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a far cry from the Argentine swamp to Mercurian desert,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and what is most strange about the organism is that it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	lives in a bed of metal ore in which there is neither food</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> nor water!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Moura bent closer to examine the weird thing that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> wiggled again at his touch. "Poor thing," be observed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How tenaciously it has clung to its little bit of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This is possibly all that's left of this dead world. But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> now we shall give it a name for so valiantly surviving</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     *The albedo of a body is the ratio of light which it reflects to that which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  it receives. The amount reflected depending to a considerable extent upon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  whether or not the body is surrounded with a cloud-filled atmosphere. A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  surface having little or no atmosphere, consequently, has a low albedo*</seg><seg type="columnLine">ACROSS THE VOID</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">23</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the ages. Allow me to present the Rollinsphyte!" The</seg><seg type="columnLine">last was said in a jocose strain, but I saw Uncle Ezra</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoyed the thought that he was the discoverer of a life</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was to bear his name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ,We left him studying his find and wrent for a swim.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We stayed on Mercury a week before he could be pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vailed upon to leave and all the while his mind was upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his Rollinsphyte. "I can't figure out," he had said, "how</seg><seg type="columnLine">it subsists on such a meagre fare, nor what the poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing does at such periods when the sun shines on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">portion of the globe. Such heat must surely kill it or,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it manages to survive, how does it live when the Out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side Cold comes in?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why uncle," I exclaimed, "I thought Mercury does</seg><seg type="columnLine">not make but a single revolution during the year."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Of course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then how--what do you meant?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My child," began the professor in that slow drawl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing way he had of explaining his science to me, "surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are aware that whatever Mercury's period</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rotation is, its rate of rotation must es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentially be uniform. And since it moves in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its orbit so as to fulfill the laws of areas, its motion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolution is sometimes faster and sometimes slower</seg><seg type="columnLine">than average. The result is that the same side is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">always exactly facing the sun. Thus sometimes it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">23.7 degrees ahead of its mean position in its orbit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes that much behind, so that at such times the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun shines 23.7 degrees beyond where it ordinarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">should shine. That is how it happens that in these two</seg><seg type="columnLine">portions of the planet wherein twilight usually lies the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun actually does shine during the libration period. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">yearly, therefore, this part of the globe receives direct</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight, just as once again the dark and cold of Space</seg><seg type="columnLine">come through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How then does this little creature survive those two</seg><seg type="columnLine">intense periods? See, it is withering here in the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shook my head, but Ubca-who had become an inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested spectator, spoke up, "Perhaps, sir, that is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason for the worm-like appendage which allows the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow to migrate each season and so stay within the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fines of the twilight!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Uncle Ezra clapped his hands together in delight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Of course, how stupid of me not to consider just such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a possibility. And now, if you will be so good as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">help me, we shall see by what process it absorbs its</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual fare. Here is a specimen I took from. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that juncture I left them, not anxious to watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ugly little zoophyte any longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was glad when we left Mercury behind and headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the lovely blue-white world of Venus. It lay but</seg><seg type="columnLine">31,200,000 miles away and traveling now at the rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of five hundred miles per second it took us a little more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than seventeen hours to reach there. On the way we</seg><seg type="columnLine">again encountered a shower of meteorites and although</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could do little damage, Moura at the controls</seg><seg type="columnLine">steered out of their way, though occasionally we heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impact as the smaller ones struck our sides. In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we moved onward, our vision almost became obstructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the smaller particles that adhered to the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moura explained to me that, in moving through space,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we created a small attraction for any matter smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ourselves, much the same way as the planets at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted us to them, and in this case, farther away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun, they clustered about us since our attraction was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more immediate than was that of Sol. However, as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as we came into physical contact with Venus, she in</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn attracted them from us, the missiles dropping upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own broad bosom, freeing us from the discomfiture</seg><seg type="columnLine">they gave us. Then we sighted a small crack in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer glass on our port side, but so sturdy is the glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Abrui that little damage was done, and the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack need not be mended until we landed. Moura be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved the crack due to a flaw in the glass itself but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not worried, since the crack could go no deeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the six inches of its layer, and there were thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine more layers below it. Even were one layer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass peeled away, it would make no difference to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yodverl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Power of the Mind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOW we were slipping into the mists of Venus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">those grey-white clouds that hide the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world from the peeping Toms of the Universe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For what seemed hours we slid on a thirty-degree angle</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the planet moving no faster than two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles an hour, and we all but plunged into the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumbling waters of the great ocean of Venus over which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cloud banks swirled before we realized its being.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ubca had taken the controls and only his quick action</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved us from a bath in the sea. Then he brought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship to a stationary position no more than fifty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the water, and stare as we did, our eyes could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">pierce the mist to tell what lay beyond. They rose from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water in long feathery tentacles and made the scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of an eery ghostlike beauty. Above us we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the gleam of the sun among the clouds painting them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a variety of wild colors, the clouds acting as a multi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude of prisms and diffraction elements on the sunlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke it up into the seven hues of our sunsets. Not thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards away the sun had found a rift through which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone down upon the water turning it into a sheet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was here for the first time that I learned something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the full power of the Abruian mind. Staring about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">us into that partly illuminated world, I grew impatient</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to see land or at least something more tangible than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clouds, sun and water, and I wondered at the sudden</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lethargy that had come over the three men in the pilot</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ubca had brought the ship to a standstill and now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sat quietly in one of the metal chairs, half reclining with-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out saying a word, his eyes fastened upon the single beam</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of sunlight as if he had not a care in the world. Uncle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">, Ezra paid no heed to anyone, his eyes darting here and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there, making his endless observations. Soon he would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have something to tell us about the phenomenon of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ever present clouds of Venus. Never, on the whole</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trip, had he questioned anything he saw or had he grown</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">impatient when time grew heavy. He was a child, with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mouth agape, waiting for each new wonder to present</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">itself for him to put down in his notebooks. Him I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could look to for explanations of natural phenomenon,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but he would never have bothered to inquire into the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vagaries of the human mind. But it was Moura-weit's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">attitude that struck me as being the strangest of all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  One would have thought this a time for action, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">instead he was standing in the forepart of the room,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hands dropped listlessly at his side, eyes turned toward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the water without seeing it. He might have been con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">24</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sidering everything but the matter at hand. Yet for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all his passiveness, and that of Ubca's too, I felt a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tension in the air. I wanted to laugh, to scream, to wring</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">my hands. But for what? What was the matter with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">both of them? Was this the way Venus treated men?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Enfolding them in a state of suspended animation, sap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ping them of all desire for movement? Why, then,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was I not affected so? I even looked about fearfully,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">afraid that some ghouls might be approaching to take</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">control of the ship. Then, after what had seemed hours,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Moura-weit spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Land lies to the northward, tor, and 'they' are</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly," were his queer words. Ubca looked up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his staring, not at all surprised at the message. Im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately he was upon his feet, working at the levers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and twisting the dials. In navigating through a planet's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitational control the motors repelled the magnetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibratory impulses instead of attracting them. Study-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the compass, he found it already responded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus' magnetic poles. Moura turned and left the pilot</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, pausing a moment to say to Uncle Ezra, "Come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor, I have something of interest to show you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Left alone with Ubca, I hesitated before speaking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I had to force my voice from my throat. "Tell me</seg><seg type="columnLine">--what does this mean, tor? How can he know where</seg><seg type="columnLine">land lies? Only this morning you said you'd never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been to Venus before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ubca, looking up from his instruments, gave me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching look with his lavender eyes. Then he grinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadly. "You appear to forget, Miss Rollins, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power that lies in the mind of Sa Dak*. Perhaps you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have forgotten, or else never realized, that the Abruian</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind is all-powerful, that the brains of all men are</seg><seg type="columnLine">open to it. And Sa Dak has one of the most powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds ever known on Abrui! Nothing seems beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power of that tremendous brain!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, then, with such a mind, should we be surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he is able to seek out the minds of those dwelling on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this world' learn what there is to know of them, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse with them through the medium of the brain? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seen it happen before--on one of the Saturnian</seg><seg type="columnLine">moons. Only those people were unfriendly and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not descend there, for we wished no trouble. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt, Sa Dak has already advised these Buians, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venetians as you would call them, that we are coming,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they look for our arrival! Else, if they are not</seg><seg type="columnLine">too civilized, they will believe one of their number has</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a vision and think we are god-things!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly I nodded my head to what Ubca-tor had told</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, unable to voice an opinion. It was all too hard for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to believe, to understand. True, I had forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Moura had told us of the mental telepathic powers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his race but that somehow had left no impression</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon me. Now timidly I asked. "Is--is my brain open</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Moura's mind--and yours, too?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ubca nodded. "All of Abrui have that faculty, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Gors. But Sa Dak goes beyond that--he knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than you could realize, what you will do under</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain circumstances before you yourself are aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the trend of your thoughts, since his mind moves so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much more quickly than yours--or mine. It as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had a finger on the pulse!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">YOU can imagine my reaction to that discovery. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had now to realize that my brain had been as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">open book to these strange men! No privacy of mind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  *£a Dak, master in Abruian. Ubca-tor always referred to Moura so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">whatsoever! Blushing under Ubca's smiling eyes, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">excused myself to run in retreat to the little cell-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">room that was my own chamber, there to sit thinking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I had learned. I felt both anger and fright, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted never to see any more of the Taborans. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman can be happy in the thought that a man knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">what passes through her mind, the very idea of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing tortured me, embarrassed me. I believed I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could never face any of them again. Yet, strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough I did not resent Ubca-tor half so badly as I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moura-weit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ubca I had found was a gentle person and although</seg><seg type="columnLine">it appeared to me that he held himself somewhat aloof</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Uncle and myself I had recognized the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was of a self-effacing nature. So it was upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader that I vented my spleen, considering him at fault</seg><seg type="columnLine">for not reminding me that my every thought was read-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to him, for him to smile at perhaps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Heretofore, I had felt that I disliked Moura, merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the man he had been. During the two weeks on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yodverl, it is true, I found no occasion in which to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ercise my dislike, and in that time I had actually for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten the thought that I had disliked him. Instead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had been learning to admire him, to appreciate his</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindly attitude to us, his consideration and his attentive-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, for first of all Moura was a gentleman. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never before known a man of such force or greatness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mind, and I knew him for a genius. He seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me able to conquer anything. I remembered now, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">during those long hours aboard the spaceflyer, I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">even indulged myself in girlish dreams, wondering if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were possible for me, insipid person that I was, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspire admiration in such a man as Moura-weit. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">can not dwell in close quarters with one they think they</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate and resist such thoughts, especially when that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a handsome, virile man capable of bringing such</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts to a woman. And what a ninny he must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">found me to be, allowing me to live in my fool's para-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dise, while I was unaware that he knew everyone of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthless thoughts! How that galled me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had been kindly enough through the long days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing the perfect host, looking out for my comforts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">explaining this and that, but beyond it all there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no other contacts between us. Perhaps I had resented</seg><seg type="columnLine">that more than anything else! And now I could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of the counts I had against him, his villaincy to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward Dana and Dick, and his world, his carrying Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ezra off from Earth, bringing that delicate soul closer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his death by the strain and excitement this trip was</seg><seg type="columnLine">exercising on him. And here he had been making a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool of me, allowing me to believe my intimate thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">safely locked in my own bosom!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the next two hours I kept to my room, not ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turing forth for fear of meeting the creature of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate, wondering at the same time if the walls kept my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts safe, and knowing they did not. But then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew sensible and realized that he could have no interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in me as I dared suppose; that a plain colorless female</seg><seg type="columnLine">like myself had little place in his own thoughts. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet how miserable such a thought made me, too. Can</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone explain the intricacies of a woman's mind? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am certain that not even Moura could do that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Imagine then my wonder and chagrin when a knock</seg><seg type="columnLine">came at my door and there stood Moura. "We are com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into the sight of land, Miss Rollins," he said kindly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Won't you join us ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could not answer but walked past him and into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ACROSS THE VOID	25</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                                                             /</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot room and he did not speak again, but I knew he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had known my thoughts, that he had been interested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">what passed through my mind, and his coming at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment was his way of retribution for the terror he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused me. He could have dispatched either Ubca-tor or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Urto instead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FROM the pilot room I saw that a green world lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">below, a broad savannah in which a river wended</seg><seg type="columnLine">its way, behind was the ocean we had just crossed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moura took control of the ship and as though recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nizing a landmark veered the ship so that we followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river's course as it meandered through the lowlands. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side the grass stretched as far as the eye could see,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was surprised to notice that the clouds had lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were no closer to the ground than about three thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand feet or so. We were flying half way between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground and that ceiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not long, however, before we caught sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a city far ahead, lying in a bowl of low hills, and Moura</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the river that made a wide circle through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meadows, and he headed directly for the city itself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a thing of beauty, with tall fairy-like spires rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">high into the greyish clouded sky, every color of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rainbow and more, but the pastel shades instead of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear-cut hues of the spectrum. As we drew closer we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see that wide avenues and squares were set in be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the tremendous buildings and were filled with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of beings, but from the height at which we flew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could not as yet make out their forms clearly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now we hovered over the tallest building, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an azure blue, tall and slender, with the delicate spires</seg><seg type="columnLine">like arms reaching outward, arms that seemed a gesture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a people who were still seeking the truths, seeking to</seg><seg type="columnLine">encompass the heavens. Yet, as we drew nearer, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that for all its etherealness the building was substantial,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even ponderous, expressing great power--a power</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was beautiful because of its strength. Below were</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces upturned to us and slowly, majestically, Moura</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought his ship about and gently we began to drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venusward on an even keel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we dropped toward the great square before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">azure building it miraculously cleared itself of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, but I had to wonder at Moura in so trustfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">placing his ship and ourselves at their mercy. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely he must have understood the race in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent communion of his! He did not hesitate a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the descent, even though we were all struck by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the viciousness of the creatures below as we dropped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their level. And what creatures they were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twenty feet tall they stood with great ungainly bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">--night-marish manifestations so in variance with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty of their thoughts and their city. First our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship came to the level of their faces (we had to call</seg><seg type="columnLine">those hideous livid white expanses with the long ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phantine noses and square, staring lidless eyes a face)</seg><seg type="columnLine">but never had Earthly eyes seen such monsters. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes set in the faces, four feet long and three across,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were as large as saucers and each nose almost a yard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a half in length had what appeared to be a row'</seg><seg type="columnLine">of small fingers at the tip. There was no visible mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the ears were enormous things of flapping flesh.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then came the neck, two feet in length, flexible and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">boneless, upholding the broad long head and ending in</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders but three feet wide. The rest of the body was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear shaped, a bulbous thing of gray-green flesh. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inedquate shoulders dangled two small weak arms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flexible like the trunk, and having a row of small, deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate tapering fingers at their ends. The body was up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, until it reached the hips, where the pearshape</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubled its girth and there were two pair of heavy round</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs, the forelegs several feet longer than the hind ones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter being so bent at the knees it made one wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">how they walked. The feet themselves were circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">pads that hit the ground with a resounding smack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I think that even Moura, with all his composure, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shocked by the sight of these horrors, but he showed no</seg><seg type="columnLine">outward sign as he brought his ship to the ground. Still</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes did glitter strangely, and his lips were drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly around his teeeth. Of us all I think Uncle Ezra</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the calmest. In these beasts he merely saw a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">type of biological expression, and all the while he kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaiming at the awfulness of them, trying to class</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to Earthly standards. Nothing could be too strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him anymore. Ubca-tor was downright frightened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I felt a kinship to him for it. Only Moura and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Urto were able to hide most of their emotions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UBCA was the first to speak, but his words were un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligible to me for he spoke in Abruian, remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bering only his mother tongue in his fear. Moura, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways thoughtful, answered him in English so I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is nothing to fear, tor," he told Ubca. "True,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are atrocities in our eyes, but in communicating</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them I met a great mind that readily comprehended</seg><seg type="columnLine">what we were and why we were here, and he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately how to adjust his mind so that we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">communicate. He was of a benign personality, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could find nothing of violence or treachery in his make-</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. He told me he was expressing the attitude of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole race when he invited us to visit this city and</seg><seg type="columnLine">guided us the whole way. You must not judge these</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures by their outward aspect, nature does not con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sider appearance when she creates. . . . See . . . they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are clearing the way for the entrance of a personage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Come--we must go to meet--our friend."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At Moura's words we looked out into the square, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that the multitude of legs (which were alone in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our direct line of vision) were moving aside and clearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a broad path down which another of their kind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">approaching. He was perhaps more gigantic, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous than his fellows. We followed Moura into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">anteroom of our ship and he went over to touch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lever that would open the heavy door, when Ubca laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hand on his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have not yet tested the air, Sa Dak, how know</seg><seg type="columnLine">you that it is livable?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never impatient, Moura smiled broadly. "I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">already what the atmosphere's constituents are, tor. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend out there informed me hours ago!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ubca shrugged his shoulders sadly as if he believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moura had surely lost his mind, but when we felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush of warm, fresh vapor-filled air that came with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening of the doorway, we knew that "our friend" had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not erred. And how good the sweet air, laden with</seg><seg type="columnLine">moisture, was to us! There was perhaps in a slight de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gree more oxygen in the Venerian atmosphere, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to distress us. Instead it gave an added feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of well-being to our bodies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">26</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moura stood hesitating a moment in the doorway be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">, fore going to meet the monstrosity that had now come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a halt fifty feet from the Yodverl. Turning to us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moura suggested that after all we remain on the ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he went alone. Gladly I acquiesced, for I had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish for closer proximity to those creatures. Yet I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not help but fear for Moura. Ubca had expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accompany him, but so accustomed was he to taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other's orders that without question he stayed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind. He surprised me by flinging me a look that I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not define immediately, but from then on we were joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a fellowship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had a common fear between us for our leader.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, as new events shaped themselves, that brother-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood of ours became a strong bond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost sadly we watched the meeting of the two--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">handsome silver man of Abrui and the monster of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Venus. They came to a halt about ten feet apart and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my wonder nothing happened, but after they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood in that manner for fifteen minutes or so I realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were conversing through the medium of the brain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then came a movement from the beast as he lifted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">long nose or trunk and emitted a wholly unhuman shriek</seg><seg type="columnLine">which continued a minute or so, rising and falling in</seg><seg type="columnLine">volume, so that we were led to believe it was a form</seg><seg type="columnLine">of speech. When the cry ended, the creature with Moura</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his heels, turned and headed for the azure building on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right side of the square.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two disappeared into the building while we feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wondered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thereupon the great square was slowly deserted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Venerians, and soon not a single living soul could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be seen about. We could only continue to stare at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place wherein Moura had disappeared. Ubca called my</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to the sky above and we were treated to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene so beautifully weird that there was pain in it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun was dropping low beyond the cloud bands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">obliquely its rays fell upon the masses of vapor, throw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one color after another in awful affray before us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashing back and forth through the moving mists, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">our minds were stunned by the vivid changes. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, it all faded and the night fell and utter blackness</seg><seg type="columnLine">engulfed us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the light of the Yodverl's glass walls fell upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">us dispensing the store of the sun's energy that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered during the period we had stayed out in Space,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shone on us gently without the glare that an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">candescent light gives forth. Urto came to tell us that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had time for a dip in the pool before our evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal was ready. Upset because Moura had left him be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind, Ubca appeared distracted, but force of habit made</seg><seg type="columnLine">him get into his swimming togs and join me in the pool</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Uncle Ezra preferred to linger in the open to stare</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the darkness round about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We swam in the water without spirit. Ubca was fear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful for his beloved friend; I was fearful of what might</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen if the Venerians should in turn become hostile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet I, too, felt a strange loss that was occasioned by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moura's absence. It was as if his departure had taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">the color out of our beings, and we waited only for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his return to regain the vitality his going had drained</seg><seg type="columnLine">from us. I did not realize then how strongly his per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonality had already reacted upon me, how miserable</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was to become when he was not about even for a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">space of time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ^But I must go on with my story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Lesson in Mind Telepathy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER eating our supper, Uncle Ezra again left</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ubca and me to ourselves. All this time I had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-	been trying to recall all I had learned of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abruians, and now timidly I put my question to Ubca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor. "What is this power of your people that they read</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mind so easily, tor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ubca answered gravely enough, as though he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know already what lay behind my question. "It is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult thing to explain, Miss Rollins, but first must you</seg><seg type="columnLine">comprehend that everything, be it chemical, mineral,</seg><seg type="columnLine">organic or inorganic, is built up basically from vibration.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everything is a matter of vibration. Without it we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not have the atom, the molecule or the star. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">smallest bit of matter or the largest, all pulse with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">being. And if it was not for this natural phenomenon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could not ourselves live. Our sensations are a matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vibration; we see, hear and we feel--all because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A good example of it is given by your machines that</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadcast sound. Through space the sound is distribu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted upon 'wave lengths' of different frequencies so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you might hear them. Yet though the waves are there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinarily your ears can not hear them, can not pick</seg><seg type="columnLine">them up for you, without the medium of a certain me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanical receiver. The same is true of television. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same thing, you can not see the objects broadcast</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless the machine to gather them and translate them for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you is there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now we might say that the brain resembles radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">transcription to some degree. First the vibratory im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulses must be broadcast from some central station be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore your receiver can 'pick them up' and in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">way the objects around you must broadcast themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the varying degrees of wave-lengths before you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">either see, hear, feel or smell their odors; your brain is</seg><seg type="columnLine">therefore likened to your radio receiver, but for you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch the impressions made on the brain of another is as</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible as for you to try to listen to radio without</seg><seg type="columnLine">a machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You of Earth know that the various members of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body broadcast their wants and hurts to the brain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even now our scientists of Abrui seek to discover the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'wave-length' used by these organs. When that is dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered, medical science will take a great stride forward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We do know, however, that as with all animate or in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">animate articles the brain is one, for first the brain is</seg><seg type="columnLine">composed of chemicals, the same chemicals that compose</seg><seg type="columnLine">the divers solids around about us. The difference,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, lies in the fact that the brain is a more highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensitized plate. We might compare it to the difference</seg><seg type="columnLine">between a molecule of water and the great ball of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">star. The water contains only three parts of two dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent elements. A star contains all the elements nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">has devised--hundreds and thousands of different com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">binations to be had held together in that one great mass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And so it is with the brain; it is composed of many</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of cells, each cell apart from the other, doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">its individual work, but on the whole contributing its</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers to the common center.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the main duty of your brain is to translate to</seg><seg type="columnLine">your consciousness the needs of the entire body, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as your radio instrument translates to you the waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">ACROSS THE VOID</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">27</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that come from out of the ether. You believe that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">'pick up' your brain impulses the moment they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed by that wonderful mechanism of your body;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you 'receive' them as quickly as they are made, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">this is not true. Let us suppose that you are fdled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an emotion. It sweeps through the body, it causes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart to contract, the blood rushes to the head, the hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">grow cold, they perspire. Can you translate this emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion immediately, can you place it, understand it? No.</seg><seg type="columnLine">First you must consider it, you must ask your brain what</seg><seg type="columnLine">it means, then the brain tells you ... it is love, it is hate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is fear. This, then, is one of the first functions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brain--to translate into words for you the impres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions received, whether it is hunger, thirst, weariness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgust or sorrow. The very beauty of your emotions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the color of your hates, the longing of your desires are</seg><seg type="columnLine">all unintelligible, incomprehensible to you, until the brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathers these impressions, mixes them for you and trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lates them just as your ratlio set gathers, mixes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">translates sounds for you. You understand me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I nodded, "I think so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good! And now perhaps you can understand just</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the Abruian mind does, for it also is a receiver to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gather from your brain your impressions, and just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you yourself translate these things for yourself, so does</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Abruian accept the abstract and translate it for him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. This is telepathy. It is evident to us that our re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mote ancestors learned this method of communicating</seg><seg type="columnLine">with each other before they had speech, and their de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scendants are born with the faculty of gathering each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other's brain impulses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It does not matter to me what language you speak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for on receiving your thoughts, I receive them in the ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stract and my own brain unconsciously does the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">of translating them into understandable words for me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, in the matter of grasping these brain impulses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of yours, my brain has first to be attuned to the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave-length that yours makes use of. Each brain uses</seg><seg type="columnLine">a different wave-length, varying as much as the finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">prints of the race vary, and only for one aware of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">science it takes but a moment's hesitation to 'feel' out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and adjust his brain to another's. Once the frequency</seg><seg type="columnLine">on which a particular brain broadcasts is known, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other can 'hear' what passes through that brain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For several moments I sat in thought before speaking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It sounds highly technical, but still I do not grasp how</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are able to 'hear' as you say, what passes through</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind, especially since the impulses are of so low a</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequency."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "That is a matter I hardly try to understand myself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although I employ it all the time.

Yet, again, Sa</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dak is the one man against whom it is difficult to close</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brain.

"What must I do ?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "First you must learn the power of utter concentra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.

"You will note the shape of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flower, the shape of its white heart, its violet-black</seg><seg type="columnLine">petals.

Can you remember its every detail so accurately</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you can draw it upon paper months later and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">miss a slightest vein? If you can do that, Miss Rollins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then you can make your brain pliant and flexible enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that you are prepared for the next lesson to come."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taking the little flower from his fingers I looked at it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">twirled it about and stared at it in wonder, seeing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty of the task. I said nothing more about it, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I again had leisure, I commenced to learn this new</seg><seg type="columnLine">science.

"Oh, tell him we are in</seg><seg type="columnLine">conference and can't be bothered," he added.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strom snapped on the television and motioned for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack to look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ever see him before?" he whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The television showed a rather shabbily dressed old</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleman with long grey whiskers, and a diffident</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner. Short, stocky and broad-shouldered, he waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">patiently for Cherron to answer the phone, as he slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffed a cigar. The old gentleman suddenly turned on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own television. He saw Cherron and spoke before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack could dodge out of view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Cherron," he said in a deep voice, "I have some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing very important to discuss with you and the Food</seg><seg type="columnLine">Co. board. If you can spare me a few moments, I think</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can interest you enough so you'll hear me out. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentlemen are no doubt discussing the raise in power</seg><seg type="columnLine">rates, as everyone else is doing. Oh yes," at Jack's in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiring look, "the raise hit everyone and the city is</seg><seg type="columnLine">humming like a bee-hive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shall we let him come up?" Cherron asked the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">three. "He wants to talk to the Board," he added.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Might as well," spoke up one of the members, silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">until now, adding bitterly. "There won't be any Board</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the first of the month."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old gentleman presented himself at the door, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few moments following Cherron's invitation. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved aside the invitation to be seated and said smiling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If I can't interest you in three minutes, I'll bid you</seg><seg type="columnLine">good day, so there is no use in my sitting down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took a few thoughtful puffs at his cigar as if in</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt how to begin. He seemed to come to a decision,</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the cigar from his mouth and with twinkling eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "How would you gentlemen like to be the means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocking the Power Trust higher than a cocked hat?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The four men leaned forward, simultaneously waving</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to a chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Vondig, as he introduced himself, laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly as he accepted the chair, remarking, "I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would get you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Board members had been interested for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, but, as the impossibility of the thing seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike them, they again assumed their gloomy mien.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Professor," Cherron addressed him, "do you realize</seg><seg type="columnLine">what an utterly impossible thing you suggest? We</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised to hear you out, so go ahead. If there is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest merit in your scheme, we are with you heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">and soul, and to the limit of our collective purse. Right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys?" The other three nodded agreement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Before going further," Professor Vondig addressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, "what is the source of the Power Trust's invinci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility ?

As their big sign says--'Power is Life.'"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The four nodded agreement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then," he continued, "if some source of power were</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered, with millions of volts and an amperage al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most beyond calculation, something that could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlled by the trust, what would you gentlemen say ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">As one man, they chorused "Power Trust--finish."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Exactly," said the Professor, adding calmly, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">emitted a huge puff, "I have discovered that power."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm not a fanatic," he continued, his eyes twinkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">at their intent looks. "If you gentlemen will accompany</seg><seg type="columnLine">me on a little trip, I can demonstrate the truth of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">statement, incredible as it may seem. It will take about</seg><seg type="columnLine">six hours by my plane to get to our destination. Mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not as speedy a plane as some of the newer ones, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it will be safe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not take mine ?" Cherron asked. "It is big and</seg><seg type="columnLine">speedy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Electric?" asked the Professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cherron admitted that it was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It won't do, then," the Professor announced. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">get your power from the Power Company. They know</seg><seg type="columnLine">just where you are at all times, and I can't take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of being traced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your name sounds familiar, Professor," said Cher-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ron as the five men made their way to the field where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Professor kept his plane.

"Perhaps you can better understand my animus</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the Trust now. He died a pauper. They stole</seg><seg type="columnLine">his invention and beat him in every court in the land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may be wondering why I selected you four men</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of all the millions on the earth to assist me in smash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the Power Trust. I have looked up the records of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Food Company, Mr. Cherron. I learned that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys have been giving away almost as much food as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been selling. That is very poor business, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cherron," he chided; then in a different tone, "but darn</seg><seg type="columnLine">good humanity. A better recommendation than that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one could ask for. You fellows have been feeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot of people who were pauperized by Power.

My place is on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peninsula, in Lower California. I had to get out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the traffic lanes and use this old type plane to avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">publicity."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was difficult to make one's voice heard above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise of the humming propellers. The public air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port where the Professor had parked his plane was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very busy place at this time of day. It was four o'clock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quitting time for many of the busy millions, who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurrying to get home. Very few people lived in the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">nowadays. Planes rose from the field by the thousand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Straight up they rose, to the two-thousand foot level</seg><seg type="columnLine">required by law for local traffic. At that level hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge platform--the traffic police station. As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes reached that level they stopped, hanging sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended on their gyroprops*, until they got the signal</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the traffic station, then darted away toward their</seg><seg type="columnLine">destination. On the platform were a dozen speedy little</seg><seg type="columnLine">one-man fliers, propellers turning over lazily. In each</seg><seg type="columnLine">cockpit a speed officer sat at the controls, ready to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air. Occasionally one of the small planes would</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the platform, and like a darting dragon-fly over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take some traffic violator, to whom he would hand a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticket, or Whom he would proceed to ball out in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion approved by his kind the world over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the roofs of the city arose another swarm of</seg><seg type="columnLine">planes, to hang stationary a moment, then shoot away on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the various levels according to the directions of the busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky police.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> High above, on the five-thousand foot level, coursed</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge liners and long distance planes, while still higher,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at ten thousand, could be seen a lone trans-Pacific</seg><seg type="columnLine">freighter as it hung poised a moment before starting</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its long journey to China and Japan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All paying tribute to Wilson," said the Professor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a comprehensive sweep of his arm toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarming planes, as they climbed into his flier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Professor displayed his long distance signal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they swiftly rose to the level of the platform, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">they paused a moment. Presently a grinning police-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, who had recognized the Professor, motioned them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go on up to the level called for by the signal on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, and in a few minutes they were eating up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles, southward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Six hours later they descended by the light of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon, up on a shelving beach, on the Gulf of California.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is my home and shop," announced the Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor, indicating a large concrete building, looming in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moonlight further back from the beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The building appeared to be about a hundred feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">square, single story, and as they approached it, a slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">flagpole could be dimly seen emerging from the roof and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappearing in the hazy moonlight skyward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The four visitors looked around with lively interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Professor Vondig ushered them inside and turned on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An enormous insulated cable entered through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the roof, curving over to the largest switch'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> *Gyroprops was the name given to the helicopters, one embedded in each</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper wing surface. Their relative speed was controlled by a gyroscope in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a way that a sudden gust of wind would not tip the plane over when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was hanging stationary, supported by the gyroprops. .Any variation</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the level was automatically compensated for by the rise in speed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the helicopter on the lower wing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">board any of them had ever seen. In the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">board was a massive knife-blade switch, with copper</seg><seg type="columnLine">blades ten feet long and four inches thick. It appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be the master switch, as coils of wire ran from it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller switches, although the smallest ones were giants</seg><seg type="columnLine">compared to any the visitors had seen before. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the room was a large drum, like the ones used</seg><seg type="columnLine">in laying trans-oceanic cables. A gear and pinion was</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted on one end of the drum. Further out on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinion shaft appeared a pulley, from which a belt ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a gas engine, secured to the floor with heavy bolts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everything about the place was made on a vast scale.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As Cherron stated, "It looked like a giant's playhouse."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The northeast corner of the building, for twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet both ways from the walls was taken up with another</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine built -on the same gigantic lines, into which coil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wires entered from the switch board. The Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained that it was a new type of power broadcasting</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine of his own design.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The east wall was literally covered with rheostats,</seg><seg type="columnLine">voltmeters, ammeters and safety catches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A small room had been built on the southeast corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the plant into which the Professor led the way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying. "These are my living quarters, gentlemen. Be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated, while I explain to you the source of my power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This," laying a piece of rock on the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table around which they were seated, "is a piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">quartz^ which has very peculiar qualities. When sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected to an electric current this rock becomes what we</seg><seg type="columnLine">call gravitation-negative; that is, it loses its attraction</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the earth and tries to fly out into space."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Noticing the doubtful glances between the four guests,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he connected two wires, which he evidently had ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">for that purpose--one to each end of the stone. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">then 'turned a switch. Nothing happened. Calmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffing on his cigar, he next began regulating a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">rheostat. As the current increased, the stone began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to quiver, and presently, to their amazement, rose from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table and floated free, only held down by the trailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">wires.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a little smile of triumph, Professor Vondig</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned off the current. As the stone thumped back on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table, he seated himself and continued his explana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On this rock hinges my whole discovery. For years</seg><seg type="columnLine">we scientists have conjectured that all space outside our</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere envelope is a seething pool of electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy. Electrons are thrown off from the sun in</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous quantities. They can penetrate our atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere only for a short distance, however. I figured</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if a conducter could be carried out into space and</seg><seg type="columnLine">held there, then this infinite pool of energy could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">diverted to our uses. I tried carrying a wire upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">by means of a balloon, with indifferent results. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">balloon would not go high enough. While looking over</seg><seg type="columnLine">some old books in the Public Library, I came across an</seg><seg type="columnLine">account of experiments carried out by a man whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">name is now forgotten. He succeeded in producing</seg><seg type="columnLine">negative gravitation in a piece of quartz, by means of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric current. The kind of quartz was not mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the book, but it gave me the idea. For four years</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hunted quartz and experimented. At last I found it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gentlemen, by grinding this rock and mixing certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemicals with it, I can, by applying the proper voltage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave it a lifting power of one ton. Think of it; a piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of quartz, eight by ten inches, lifting a ton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">32</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That discovery alone is worth untold wealth. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">properly constructed car and this lifting power, inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stellar space could be navigated. If I should make this</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery public, however, it would go the road of</seg><seg type="columnLine">father's invention. Wilson would get it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The only way out for all of us is to break Wilson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and by the Living God, gentlemen, that is what I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">.. For an instant there was a trace of excitement in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor's voice, then his eyes twinkled again as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit another cigar and continued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What you no doubt mistook for a flag-pole, is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">copper cable, carried out into space and held there</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a ten foot cube of this quartz. The current coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">in over it is terrific--way beyond measuring with any</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument that I have been able to construct. All the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power from the Power Trust's thousands of plants can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal the output of this one cable. Gentlemen, I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">tapped the reservoirs of space. No machine designed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by man has ever been able to approximate the voltage</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a lightning flash. This power of mine is the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all the lightning. So much power that I dare not at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt to use more than a small fraction of the potential</seg><seg type="columnLine">output.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With that broadcasting machine in the corner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant and this power at my disposal, I can burn out any</seg><seg type="columnLine">generator of the Power Trust within thirty seconds. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is my intention, however, to install two more cables, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough broadcasting machines to take care of &lt;he load,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I destroy the plants, and that is why I need financial</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How long is that cable, Professor?" asked Cherron,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and what keeps it from breaking of its own weight?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The cable is nearly five hundred miles long," an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered the Professor. "Replying to your other ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, the first cable I tried to erect did break. I over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came that difficulty in this way: The quartz compound</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be melted by intense heat. It was necessary to erect</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large vat, at the factory where the cable was manufac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured. The vat was filled with the melted quartz, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cable was passed through it. As the cable emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the vat, a thin coating of the compound clung to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and cooling, formed a layer of quartz on the outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cable. The compound is even a better conductor</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the copper. Any current passing through the cable</seg><seg type="columnLine">also flows through the coating of quartz. In that way</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cable is self-sustaining. In fact, it couldn't fall even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the cube of quartz were to be broken loose by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteorite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The cable consists of a copper core six inches in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter; then the layer of quartz. Outside that comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">a four-inch layer of insulation. The cable is reinforced</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the outside by layers of steel wire. There is a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire imbedded in the insulation. I had to have a return</seg><seg type="columnLine">circuit to activate the quartz. After the first hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles had been paid out, the current from space started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to flow, and the small wire wasn't needed any longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, gentlemen, I promise you a demonstration.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At eleven o'clock tonight I plan to destroy that wave</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor just north of Golden Gate, that is, the generators</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the plant. It is ten minutes to eleven now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There won't be much to see," said the Professor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"at least not on this end. The other end at that station is</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the fireworks will be. That plant is automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there shouldn't be anyone around there to get in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jured. That is why I settled on it, to demonstrate with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It lacks ten minutes yet," he continued. "It will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">take a few minutes to warm up the transformers, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to plot the direction, so if you care to accompany</seg><seg type="columnLine">me," he said, rising, "you are welcome to do so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The four men followed him into the plant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Professor went to the huge switchboard, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed one of the switches, at which the trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formers started humming, with a deep musical note. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">next went to a desk and after figuring for a minute,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with dividers and slide rule, took his station by the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strument board on the eastern wall. Watch in hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim of face, slowly puffing on the ever present cigar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stood like a figure of fate, one hand on the control</seg><seg type="columnLine">lever of a rheostat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The four men stood by the broadcasting machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent, their eyes on the Professor's hand, resting on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rheostat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Could it possibly be true? their thoughts ran.

He hastily</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribbled a check and tossed it to the Professor, saying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"When that's gone, there's plenty more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> -Professor Vondig waved their checks away, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">contented little laugh and said, "I don't want your checks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. Here is my plan. One of you go to Dick Smith,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Copper Ltd., and order the cable. He has the speci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fications. He helped me financially on the first one. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor devil is almost gone to the wall now, or I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have to come to you for assistance. Just another</seg><seg type="columnLine">victim of Power, Dick is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, Dick is a friend of mine," Cherron stated. "Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">he in on this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Heart and soul," answered the Professor. "He has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been from the beginning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep things quiet. Order the cable, and go back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to your business.

You fellows arrange that with Dick. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't want any checks passed. Wilson controls the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks, and he might connect us with his plant disaster."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE month later P. G. Wilson sat in his palatial</seg><seg type="columnLine">office, fifty feet underground, in the basement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Power Building. No towers for that gentleman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Towers were too easily bombed. His father had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his reward in that manner, in the tower of this same</seg><seg type="columnLine">building, ten years ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The system of offices covered two acres, all under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, corridors patroled by armed guards, and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitors had to submit to search, before they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowed to enter Mr. Wilson's august presence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Wilson's fat repulsive face was very thoughtful</seg><seg type="columnLine">this morning. He had just received the financial state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the money expended for repairs on the Golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gate plant. The amount was staggering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A new radio, turned very low, was announcing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">current events at his elbow, but Mr. Wilson was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">paying much attention to it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently, he made up his mind. He pressed a button,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the head clerk's voice answered. "Jones," ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wilson, "prepare a letter to the International Power</seg><seg type="columnLine">Commission. Request an additional raise of two per cent</seg><seg type="columnLine">in power rates, to cover our loss in theGoldenGateplant."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mr. Wilson," a guard interrupted, "there's a boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">here with a personal message for you. Shall I admit</seg><seg type="columnLine">him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Always admit personal messengers, Dake," Wilson</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped. "I have to tell you that every day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Mr. Wilson."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here he is, sir," the guard said as he returned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading a ragged boy by the arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where'd you get this?" Wilson snarled at the boy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he read the letter the boy handed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A man give it to me, an' give me a dollar," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy beginning to cry at Wilson's glaring look.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What did he look like?" Wilson shot at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He--he had a crutch, an' one eye wuz-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One eye was what?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It had black cloth on it, an' clothes all ragged," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy finally stammered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let him go, Dake," said Wilson to the guard. "Who-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever gave him this was disguised; too late to catch him</seg><seg type="columnLine">now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wilson turned to the phone and after a short wait,</seg><seg type="columnLine">said "Hello!

Listen; I just received this</seg><seg type="columnLine">note, given by a party unknown to a street urchin to</seg><seg type="columnLine">deliver:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   'Piggy Wilson:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   You have forty-eight hours in which to lower the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> power rates fifty per cent.

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Piggy?" in an inquiring tone, from the phone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," Wilson answered, "that's what the boys used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to call me at school."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fits like a glove," murmured the Secretary, to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's that?" Wilson snapped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Mr. Wilson, we'll look into the matter at once.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll turn it over to the Secret Service."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll do nothing of the kind," growled Wilson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I want a five plane patrol, and a cordon of infantry</seg><seg type="columnLine">for each of my plants."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But Mr. Wilson, that is beyond my-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind all that. Get busy, or there'll be a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">Secretary before night," said Wilson, as he broke the</seg><seg type="columnLine">connection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No chance of tracing that note," mused Wilson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"written with a pencil, no finger marks on it.

I'll make 'em think it's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">joke, if I locate them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, turning his thoughts to more pleasant things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let's see," checking on his fingers. "Today we take</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Food Products, Inc., Copper Ltd., United Clothing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-" Running out of fingers, he seized a pencil and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">began to check on a pad, stopping occasionally to rub</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands unctuously--a trick descended from some</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient forebear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently he ceased figuring and with a pleased smile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">said aloud. "Another month, and those that want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, will work for me, or starve."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Six hours before the forty-eight hour ultimatum to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wilson was to expire, a plane landed on the beach in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of Professor Vondig's plant on the Gulf of Lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">California. Five men got out and made their way to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the plant. Four of them were former members</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Food Company Board, members no longer. Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son had taken the company over for a fraction of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">value. The fifth man was Dick Smith, of the defunct</seg><seg type="columnLine">Copper Ltd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see the Professor has his other cables up," re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked Cherron, as they approached the plant. Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigid cables now disappeared, stretching upward from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope Wilson thinks we're only bluffing and doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">give in," said Smith. "We should smash him anyway,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he continued, "look at all the misery he has caused."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm in favor of no mercy," contributed Strull. "That</seg><seg type="columnLine">fat monstrosity has never shown any to anyone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Professor thought it politic to give him a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be decent," said Cherron. "That way, we'll have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">government on our side. We won't be blamed for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">casualties that may occur. The Professor knows the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wilson family too well to issue that ultimatum, if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought there was any chance of Wilson's compliance</seg><seg type="columnLine">with our demands. What's worrying him is the pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible loss of life, although, God knows, most of the poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">devils that work for Wilson would be better off dead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We pushed the Food Plant to the utmost this past</seg><seg type="columnLine">month. We have food enough stored to last the nations</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a month, in a pinch. I gave a quiet tip to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">managers of other essential products plants. Most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them have been turned over to Wilson now. He held</seg><seg type="columnLine">mortgages on all of us through his banks. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">last month's output has been stored at strategic points,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an eye to relieving the situation as much as pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The five had now entered the plant and were met by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Professor with a hearty hand-clasp, and a puff of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigar smoke. The Professor's best friend told Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">Smith that the Professor always went to bed with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigar in his mouth. At least, no one had ever seen him</seg><seg type="columnLine">without one in the daytime.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All set, gentlemen," he greeted them. "I've in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalled a news broadcasting set. At twelve today, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ultimatum expires, we'll cut in on the World News</seg><seg type="columnLine">and broadcast a warning."</seg><seg type="columnLine">34</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The announcer for the World News was preparing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to broadcast an additional two per cent raise in power</seg><seg type="columnLine">rates, when his words were drowned by a deep powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Citizens of the World: At exactly one o'clock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pacific Standard time, every power plant generating</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the fifth band will be destroyed.

Grouped in the annex,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whidh the Professor had had erected during the past</seg><seg type="columnLine">month, they stood tensely before the screen that covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">one entire wall. Here all the passing events could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept track of and Wilson's activities closely watched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The annex was crowded with queer machinery. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other three walls were covered with switches, coils and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming dials. A dozen men were scattered about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, expert electricians, testing, regulating and chang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing adjustments, as the plant took over the enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">load, formerly carried by Wilson's wrecked power</seg><seg type="columnLine">plants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the men who watched the television spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think that Wilson will quit now, Professor?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rather difficult to say," replied the Professor. "Ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cording to World News all his men have deserted him</seg><seg type="columnLine">except the five hundred fliers. Rioting has broken out</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the deserters, and all the police reserves are out</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to protect the Power Company's property.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't want to destroy the other three bands if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be avoided.

"Wilson</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed Turbo for bucking him, and took over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole works on a mortgage. There are bombers, scouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and observation two-seaters in the bunch. Turbo was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filling a Government contract when he went broke."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In that case we can look for trouble, just as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they can transfer the weapons," said the Professor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's no television transmitting apparatus at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">old abandoned plant, so we'll have to mount guard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch for them. Well, I'm ready for them," he added.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just what are our defenses, Professor?" asked Cher-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ron. "They'll have machine guns, demolition bombs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat rays, and some of those bombers can mount one</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounders."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I saw you looking at that network that covers the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside of the buildings, Cherron. That is the only de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fense we'll need, I think. In case it fails, I have another</seg><seg type="columnLine">that won't fail. The explanation of it all is rather tech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nical, so we won't go into that now. I'm rather busy at</seg><seg type="columnLine">present," the Professor added, as he went over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">switchboard to instruct one of the men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here they come!" came the cry from the watcher on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof, at daybreak the following morning. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a magnificent sight. Five hundred planes in the form</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of a giant wedge, sweeping down on them. A great</seg><seg type="columnLine">bomber was at the apex of the wedge, with a white flag</seg><seg type="columnLine">on its left wing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Humming like a swarm of mammoth bees, they swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward and encircled the plant. At an altitude of three</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet they formed a great circle, a half mile in</seg><seg type="columnLine">diameter, where they hung stationary on their gyroprops,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plant below them in the center of the circle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE plane bearing the white flag dropped swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the beach and landed gently a short distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the door of the plant. As the bomber landed, P. G.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wilson stepped out and came quickly toward the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. With his face set and grim, Professor Vondig met</seg><seg type="columnLine">him at the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you the man responsible for these outrages?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">snarled Wilson as the two'men met.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Vondig bowed, and in his deep voice re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have that honor, Mr. Wilson.

"I'll give you</seg><seg type="columnLine">and your friends ten minutes to surrender this plant</seg><seg type="columnLine">or--" waving his hand upward--"I'll turn my wolves</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose and you will go to join him.

Wilson laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">nastily. "Professor Vondig," bowing sarcastically to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Professor, "you have surely picked a bunch of lame</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducks to assist you, and since I see who your associates</seg><seg type="columnLine">are, I withdraw my offer to arbitrate. As soon as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach my men, you may consider hostilities open and I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have the extreme pleasure of blowing the whole bunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of you to hell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen," with a nasty smile, "I bid you good day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and---good-bye." Wilson clenched his hands and with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out another word; returned to his plane and joined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cordon of planes over the plant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Vondig entered the plant, went to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch board and closed the circuit to the netting sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounding the building, then climbed the stairs to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower on the roof. He declined the assistance of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">five friends, saying, "It won't be necessary boys, I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle them alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the Lord Harry!" Cherron ejaculated, "he never</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed a puff on that cigar! "The Professor must be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve in his defenses," he continued, "but I don't know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With their heat rays and tons of bombs. . . . Well! we're</seg><seg type="columnLine">in for it, so let's shake, boys, and hope for the best."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The five men solemnly shook hands and waited with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense faces for the battle to start.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They hadn't long to wait. Suddenly a heat ray, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the planes, struck the beach.

All struggling was prevented by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, preliminary nitrous oxide anaesthesia. In a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">time life was suspended, all animation at an end. Later</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, the body lay on the operating table, the battery of</seg><seg type="columnLine">glistening instruments was suspended above it and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosed in a glass case. On one side sat the surgeon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in front of him was a table of push buttons.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now for the operation. My mirrors are working per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly.

He pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a button.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A small circular saw descended on the forehead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the American and started to cut its way through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frozen flesh and frontal bone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A MONTH later the two surgeons again sat in Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wing Loo's office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am feeling fine," said Dr. Hopkins. "I have spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">a part of each day with my right hand in my pocket and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my left hand performing imaginary operations, with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">nail file and manicure scissors as instruments, and, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as I can judge, that hand has lost none of its dex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terity by having a part of its controlling cerebrum re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed. If you have some simple operation to do, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should like to operate before I leave China, and in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation use first one hand and then the other.

And how is the poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow doing who contributed his brain to my welfare?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh! The tumor was a harmless variety, though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was causing pressure symptoms. As far as the man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned, I beg of you do not worry about him.

He smiled as he pushed the hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from his forehead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was a clever piece of surgery, Doctor. The scar is</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly perceptible, and when the hair grows longer, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one will know I have been operated on. I really did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">want it known. So few people have confidence in a man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">who has had brain surgery. We had a general with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain tumor, and I know the man was capable, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">War Department thought they could not trust his judg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Of course, you will keep this operation a pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessional secret?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly, Dr. Hopkins."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two men looked at each other.

First he used the right hand and then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">used the left. Wing Loo watched him, and at the end,</seg><seg type="columnLine">complimented him highly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your left hand was mechanically perfect, Doctor."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I felt so. Of course, I will continue to plan my</seg><seg type="columnLine">operations with the left side of my brain. That is where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speech centers are, you know. The orders will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveyed to the right brain and through those centers re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">layed to the muscles of the arm. The neurology of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">central nervous system is all very interesting, Doctor."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It certainly is," agreed the Oriental.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The following month Dr. Hopkins reeturned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago. On the long ocean voyage he had an unusual</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity to think. His final conclusions were that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was gloriously alive, very fortunate and extremely</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of years of more work; he also felt that in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways he had been a trifle foolish in China and that some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the statements made by Wing Loo had been a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">childish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The average Oriental is a queer mixture of savant</seg><seg type="columnLine">and youth," he said to hiniself. "At the same time, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very kind to me, and when I arrive at Chicago I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must send him a worth-while present. Perhaps a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete set of my writings bound in half morocco would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be appropriate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had been away from his office for months, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found a lot of work accumulated. There was a number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wealthy individuals who needed operations, but who</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to wait till the great Master could give them</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual care. As usual, he selected his cases, giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual preference only to those who could give him</seg><seg type="columnLine">either the greatest financial reward or the largest modi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cum of glory. When not operating, he lectured to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">classes or read scientific papers before medical societies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately on arriving in Chicago he had turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the resources of his surgical laboratory towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">duplication of the surgical innovations that he had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">used in China. Some of his technicians laughed at him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while others, long haired and wild-eyed, enthused over</seg><seg type="columnLine">being allowed to participate in such revolutionizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">studies. The greatest secrecy was preserved. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time came for an announcement to the world Dr. Hop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kins wanted all the glory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ANOTHER month passed and then a year and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">two years. The great Chicago surgeon was asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to operate on the daughter of the richest man in Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ica. It was not a difficult operation, simply the removal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a harmless tumor from the girl's neck. Hopkins de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided to do it in his private operating room, alone, under</seg><seg type="columnLine">local anaesthesia. Hours later the door of the operating</seg><seg type="columnLine">room was forced open and the poor girl found, dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the operating table, the head completely severed</seg><seg type="columnLine">40</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from the body. Dr. Emanuel Hopkins had disappeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prolonged and persistent search failed to obtain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest clue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His friends, remembering the brain tumor, placed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindest construction on it and told the world that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone suddenly insane and in this condition had com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted murder and suicide. A week later the murder</seg><seg type="columnLine">was forgotten in the interest aroused by the gangster</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder of twelve bootleggers from Detroit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was spring time in China. Dr. Wing Loo sat in</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep meditation as he slowly scratched the head of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">favorite Pekingese, the dog he had operated on years</seg><seg type="columnLine">before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some day he will come back," he said to himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My Tong brother in Chicago writes of a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder and an equally peculiar disappearance.

Dr. Hopkins came to the office and asked for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">interview. Only the card, handed in by the servant, told</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the man was the one-time great American surgeon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The writer who walked into the office was haggard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent and there was a look of furtive fear on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you have come back, my dear Doctor?" whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Oriental.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have come back," answered the man from Chicago.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Across the continent and the Pacific I have come back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to you. I have come back-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have said that three times!" interrupted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinaman. "Once would have been once too many. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can see that you have come back to me without being</seg><seg type="columnLine">told so often." The voice was sharp and cut like a knife.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the American looked at him and repeated the objec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionable phrase.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I say that I have come back to you. What did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">do to me and why did you do it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean the operation?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, I did just what you asked me to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No doubt.

There was something you did to me that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not prepared for."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chinaman shook his head, and rejoined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have to tell me more about it. I certainly have</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the least idea of what you are talking about. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that when you left China you were more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased with the results of my surgery. You told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you had remained perfectly ambidextrous, that your</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hand was as good as the right.

It seemed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest and the operation did me a world of good. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">reputation became greater than ever.

That part of me was working per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly, but whenever I used my left hand there seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a desire to operate poorly. I did not understand it</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first, but finally, I realized that it was not a desire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do poor work, but an obsession to mutilate, destroy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tear and cut and ravish. As soon as I realized it, I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came frightened. In my abdominal work I forced my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to use only the right hand, but now and then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would forget and the left hand would take the knife and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slash--and then there would be busy, silent moments and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid work with the haemostats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can you understand what I ,am saying?

Thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'd find it useful here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day he moved in with his personal equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment ; and when the last workman had left, we plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">into an orgy of haphazard research: if we happened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discuss some idea as we sat smoking our pipes late at</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, very likely I'd produce the reaction the following</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning or even drag Joel with me through the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">entry that connected our quarters with the laobratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper, and late though the hour might be, go about</seg><seg type="columnLine">proving the points of my contention with test tube and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bunsen burner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several months passed and I noticed that our nightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussions in which we took so much delight, most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time oblivious to the flight of the hours, had drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the field of physics and it struck me as odd that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joel, whether victorious or not in these tilts, invariably</seg><seg type="columnLine">withdraw for such little sleep as he seemed to fequire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a secret sense of glee. I saw this in the merest</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile that lingered about his lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One warm evening, seized by a common impulse, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked many miles with arms swinging freely, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we wished to lend emphasis to some argument.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our stroll brought us into the center of the city; we</seg><seg type="columnLine">approached this very building in which we live now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if drawn to it by the spirit that abode within its</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How different the scene here was then! To the east,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of where I write this, was a rising sky line, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">building mounting higher than the other. Boulevards</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran in all directions; there were lights, a second Broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, traffic, life, gayety. I shudder to think what has</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken the place of all this! There is no horizon before</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, the sky bends down and disappears in that bottom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less abyss!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Joel led me to a seat here in Logan Square where we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could watch the ceaseless stream of cars circling about</seg><seg type="columnLine">us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Disturbing Thoughts</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T'\OB, I love this business of transportation," Joel</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke.

Then it was that civilization</seg><seg type="columnLine">was born!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What about the discovery of fire?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To tell the truth, Bob," he conceded, "I don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">which came first. It doesn't matter, though, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 still think the same. Today, the United States, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen times more automobiles and ten times more ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air than the rest of the world put together, is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strongest power on earth. No one disputes that. Ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fective means of getting about spell good times and</seg><seg type="columnLine">national prestige.

He lowered his voice, for a stranger occupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other end of our bench. "War," he said, deliber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately, "will be on us at any time!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "War!"

"You think I'm mad or joking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't blame you, Bob.

It was a code</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown to me and it came in very faintly. During</seg><seg type="columnLine">the war, as you know, my chief duty was to decode the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy's messages. When the code came through at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same hour every night, I got busy and took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">message down on my teletypewriter. Out of mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity I applied myself to the unraveling of the mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sages. Any secret writing can be solved in time, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know; but this one had me nearly baffled. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work of a genius.

It was then that I wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush down to Washington."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fortunate you didn't," I answered. "It isn't pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant to be laughed at by a nation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid you're right," he agreed with a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">change of voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's probably a prank of some college boys playing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a laboratory set," I hastened to offer.

His instructions were brief after he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained the purpose of his call.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get the lowest cost figures, Rex," he said, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter Murch &amp; Co. as bidders on the job for one-half</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cost figures! Yes, one-half! Don't pad the</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures, either!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was an excited burst of talk from the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the line but Joel hung up with a laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He thinks I'm crazy.

"Where's your evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this, Bob?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All around us," I replied. "It's been there for</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless ages. Astronomers have measured this re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lease of energy among the stars often. Our universe</seg><seg type="columnLine">has wandered through the unmapped voids since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning of time. Its billions of stars have been send-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out heat and energy during that period. Our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet has never been without the light and heat of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun. For 20,000,000 years this throw-off of energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">has never been stopped!

The temperature on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface is about 6,000 deg. C. while in the center it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">from 16 to 18,000,000 degrees! You can see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the renewal from the outside sources would affect only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface conditions and those very slightly. No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joel, the answer lies in the atom!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If that's the case," said Joel, "why didn't this break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up of the atom long ago destroy the planets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's actually going on," I replied, "but it's such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long process that to set a date even in millions of years</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be short of the truth!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It doesn't seem plausible, Bob."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is when you know the power in an atom.

"Was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger on our bench last night Dr. Serge Grubsnig?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was startled enough to spill my coffee. Dr. Grubs-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nig? Vaguely my mind had been grappling with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger's identity. That explained why Joel had so</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly dropped his talk of war and hastened our de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parture from Logan Square. Dr. Grubsnig was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader of a secret organization of doubtful reputation;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had not only served a term in prison but had nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowly escaped detention in an insane asylum. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence in the city set me to thinking. Perhaps Joel's</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicions were not ungrounded. With the name of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this learned fanatic drawn into the plot, one might ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect any unpleasantness, including even war of a kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My fears were soon forgotten. In the absence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joel, I was besieged by newspaper reporters. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all agog about Joel's bid. The papers carried big</seg><seg type="columnLine">headliners. They were astonished at the lowness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bid; but not one authority doubted his ability to</seg><seg type="columnLine">build the subway, though the political machine, seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loss of a plum to an outsider, did raise a brief com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion to discredit him. Needless to say, Joel was</seg><seg type="columnLine">awarded the contract.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still there was no word from Joel. Having re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived no instructions to meet this situation, I did the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only thing a man could do under the circumstances.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When questioned by the reporters, I explained Joel's</seg><seg type="columnLine">absence carefully and told them that I was not in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">position to say either this or that. Of course this made</seg><seg type="columnLine">it mysterious. Pictures of Joel, together with his life</seg><seg type="columnLine">story, appeared in all the papers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Joel finally did materialize, I was greeted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a friendly clap on the back that shook me to the roots</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great, old man, great!" he exclaimed. "As a pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">licity man, you have no peer!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rats!" I returned. "I didn't do anything; just kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mouth shut, looked serious and remained out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach as much as possible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's an art, Bob, it's an art!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you want this publicity?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It won't hurt; but we'll discuss that later. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">men can't wait long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four men, burdened with a bulky case, had been wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing quietly. Under Joel's instructions, they placed what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I soon perceived was a microscope on the laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">table. As he told me later, Joel had secured the use</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the instrument for a short time from the Rochester</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm. Buying it was out of question; it had been built</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressly for the designer. If this device were free to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be used by the rest of the world, it would extend im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">measurably the scope of all microscopic study.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For one week Joel and I hovered about the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument. Its magnifying powers amazed us. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop of water became a storm-swept ocean filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">densely teeming life; a grain of sand was a whole moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain range glittering with diamond-like brilliance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came a time when we frankly pursued the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elusive atom and those primitive charges of electricity</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were to be diverted to man's use. Such preliminary</seg><seg type="columnLine">details as cropped up in connection with the subway</seg><seg type="columnLine">job, he relegated to my judgment. He failed time after</seg><seg type="columnLine">time in trying to divide the atom mechanically. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">other method seemed more likely to promise success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day several incidents impinged upon the quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the laboratory. I had dropped a tiny set-screw and</seg><seg type="columnLine">while kneeling on the floor under the microscope to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">48</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cover it, I glanced upward. A startled exclamation</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew Joel down to me. We traced the stamped letters</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the metal with our fingers to make sure,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dr. Grubsnig's!" I said, meaningly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 hat carried us back to our talk in Logan Square and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the stranger on our bench seemingly absorbed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passers-by. This time I aired no ridicule at Joel's</seg><seg type="columnLine">prophecies, although I still couldn't agree. My mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply wouldn't consider war. It was, however, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coincidence that the microscope should be Grubsnig's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had hashed over the entire evening's events, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought to ask a question. "Have you listened in</seg><seg type="columnLine">on your radio lately, Joel?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His face clouded over. He pushed a buzzer for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">butler.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "John," he asked, "did you tune in every night as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Dr. Murch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did the code come in as usual?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, no sir. That first night a signal in code was</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated every ten minutes for an hour as if the opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor were trying to attract someone's attention. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the radio was silent. Thinking maybe that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time had been changed, I tuned in several times every</seg><seg type="columnLine">night but with no result."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you translate the message?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm not a good hand at that sort of thing even with</seg><seg type="columnLine">your key, Dr. Murch," the man answered; "but I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">think it was about the code being known and that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be used any more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you, John. Leave the message on my desk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the man was gone, a deep silence fell upon us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Another coincidence," I said finally, "that the sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nals should stop on the night of our chat in Logan</seg><seg type="columnLine">Square! It appears now like the workings of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater minds than those of mere college boys! Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps this idea of war-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I didn't finish. The butler appeared again, quietly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a telegram.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something had happened. The borrowed instrument</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to be returned by Friday morning at the latest!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, that's the end of that," he said, regretfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This man Grubsnig suspects something. . . . We're</seg><seg type="columnLine">just learning the fine points of this marvel. We have</seg><seg type="columnLine">some photographic records and that's all.

What can we do in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leaned against the laboratory table wrearily. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to speak when Joel gave vent to a cry of pain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sprang away from the table.

"Just startled me." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated, stared at the wire and gave a shout. "Look</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, Bob," he warned, jubilantly. "I'm about to trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cend myself! Get the camera. Study the motions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your atom world. Quick! We'll make use of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">gyrations yet! Wait and see.

The time seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">too short. Joel's joyous mutterings to himself went un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed. While he struggled with strange electrical ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus and, to me, a meaningless confusion of wires,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stared through the triple lenses until my eye muscles</seg><seg type="columnLine">ached! I made many motion picture records of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">observations, but so far as progress was concerned, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw none. All that night we labored, neglecting subway</seg><seg type="columnLine">details and surveyors' reports. The laboratory perco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lator did double duty. When the first gray wisps of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn tinged the eastern sky, I tumbled full length on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the couches in the corner with a wavering im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression of Joel moving an improvised switch board</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a tangle of wires nearer to the microscope. I fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep with the drumming note in my mind: "Three</seg><seg type="columnLine">days! Three days!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hours later, the aroma of coffee and of frying bacon</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the butlet's skillful hands and the bright sun across</seg><seg type="columnLine">my couch brought me back to life again, Joel had</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared a section of the laboratory table and, spreading</seg><seg type="columnLine">filter paper for a table cloth, was setting up breakfast.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We ate perched on high stools, our legs twined about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rungs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm turning in," he said wearily. "There's an atom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one atom, of sand on the slide of the microscope which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want you to examine. It's hooked up with the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">power cable. I worked out the arrangement while you</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept. Experiment with it and jot down the results."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wiped his lips with a piece of gauze and sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">obKvion in sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several hours later I was prancing about the micros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cope, legs and arms, my whole anatomy in motion, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">except my eye, which remained glued to the eye-piece.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joel told me afterward that he had emerged from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">death-like slumbers and watched me for a long time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">amusement. Inarticulate sounds issued from my lips,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pagan prayers to the various gods mingled with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nameless words. Joel assured me my impatience, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">evoked by some cause invisible to him, was most enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining. Throwing aside his langour at last, he came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my side and scrutinized the switch board and its spag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hetti mass of wires.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those wires are not in their proper places," he ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served in surprise. His face wore a perturbed frown.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They're all mixed!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly," I returned. "Who cares? Your hook-</seg><seg type="columnLine">up didn't function. It merely disturbed our work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then some of the wires fell from their sockets and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not knowing your scheme, I did the best I could. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact," I grinned, "this strand from here to here," point-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, "was not actually on your panel! It was a stray</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire on the table and, thinking it had dropped with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, I found means to attach it in place. But, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I remarked before, who cares? Look!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stepped aside. Shaking his head in obvious disgust</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my mishandling, he placed his eye in position. Mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">while, above the hiss and the chatter of the current, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened impatiently to the astronomers' clock ticking</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the half seconds; I tried to curb my irritation, to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joel a full, undisturbed opportunity for observation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fifteen, twenty minutes dragged by, then he called</seg><seg type="columnLine">for measuring instruments. The butler appeared with</seg><seg type="columnLine">our lunch an hour later. What little Joel partook of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I fed to him a bite at a time while he continued with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a word peering at the atom. Paper and pencil</seg><seg type="columnLine">were requisitioned upon which figures rained in pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusion. At last he either tired or finished. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sigh he tore himself away from the lure of our atom</seg><seg type="columnLine">world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAUGHING DEATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" I asked, simply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A foozler's luck, a blundering success!" he returned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">frankly. "Between your methods and mine there may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be an abysmal gulf, but the two combined will yet bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">us out of the night! Why, man alive 1" he almost stut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered, waxing excited, "we've, practically already done</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deed. Let's sit down somewhere and review the</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracle.".</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt a trifle chagrined. "Look here, Joel," I ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected, "the gulf between our methods isn't so very</seg><seg type="columnLine">great. A live wire burning your hand gave you the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True, true," he admitted. '"I take it all back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In an alcove lit by soothing green lights we went</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully over the history of what we'd done. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked off each step, figured values needlessly to eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">decimal places and made sketches and diagrams. Sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral times we made sundry tests of our sanity. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared, too, that we couldn't long refrain from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">impetuous desire to shout the news from the house tops,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to write of it to the learned societies, to send transcripts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it to the scientific journals. Nothing could have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">so disastrous to the safety of the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's see," Joel was saying for the second time, "you</seg><seg type="columnLine">reported failure of my arrangement, then you deliber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately mixed wires--or it amounts to the same thing--</seg><seg type="columnLine">selected them probably by closing your eyes and reciting</seg><seg type="columnLine">ecnic, mcenie and so on. You threw in an extra one</seg><seg type="columnLine">just because it happened to be lying under your hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lo and behold! the trick's done! Or nearly so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You've sent a tremor through our atom world! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">atom was on the verge of being wrecked! As it is,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've probably started its transmutation into some</seg><seg type="columnLine">other element! Ye gods, man, we've got it! We've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He threw his papers toward the ceiling and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">blandly smiling under the white shower.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he said at my startled backward step, "I haven't</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone insane--yet! It's just celebration! I'm just be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing exultant, gay and so on. When young, dry old</seg><seg type="columnLine">fogies like ourselves do break out, we do it with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vengeance. Why, Bob, we've opened up the atom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliced it wide open. You were right. It's a little uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse, with a central sun, planets, stars, asteroids, all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even nebulae! Did you notice that pink haze on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer fringes? How it swirled and changed color?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I reached out and seized him by the arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put your brakes on a minute, Joel," I beseeched.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's exciting, I know, and fascinating: a strange lure</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to hold one to the eye-piece, a sort of psychic</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitational force. I seemed to be drawn irresistibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward as if from a great height toward that atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun! But, Joel, let's be calm. There's no use acting</seg><seg type="columnLine">prematurely like a pair of crazy loons. We nearly sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">these primitive forces off on a tangent but not quite.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We have to remember that!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bob," he replied, gathering up his papers, "I feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">confident of the solution. We can't expect to duplicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conditions in the sun; but by the use of the furnace</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which you thought I planned to make diamonds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can--well, we'll see!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the end of the evening meal he had produced a</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite outline of activity. A heavy, heat-resisting</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal cylinder was encased in a larger container of very</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick steel. Into this Joel introduced a number of atoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be fed into the chamber proper by means of a spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">and valve of minute design. Once a drop of perspira-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tion from my forehead drowned out two hours' work!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were moments before sunrise when I showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself to be completely, out of my mind. I recall mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing all our equipment to the great furnace and of cutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">atoms, but all else is hazy. Joel was a sweating ogre</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my weary eyes, the astronomers' clock sounded like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an infernal anvil as it measured time monotonously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My reeling mind had found a new refrain: "Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">days! Two days!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I awoke, Joel, I found to my surprise, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">chartered a plane and gone away with the microscope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the factory, as it developed later. A note contained</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief instructions for me: I was to turn on the current</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some minutes, turn it off and observe the results.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I asked myself several questions as I moved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">switches. Wrould one atom set off another, as a string</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged with gunpowder will burn rapidly from end</seg><seg type="columnLine">to end? And what about the energy generated? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang across the room and out into the entry, station-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing myself behind the heavy oaken door and keeping it</seg><seg type="columnLine">open just enough to see into the laboratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What would the the outcome? I waited, excited,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, but with no special fear. Minutes passed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pressure in the furnace mounted higher. The hiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chatter of the current became faintly audible. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a muffled roar, a tremor ran through the building:</seg><seg type="columnLine">the noise continued to swell in volume while the tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perature in the whole laboratory mounted rapidly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I remembered Joel's last instruction. I was nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a minute late. I raced into the room and threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main switch but the uproar didn't stop. I noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">now that the dying atoms were generating electric cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rent and that there was already enough to supply light</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the entire building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The report which I composed for Joel was brief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There wasn't much to write. I spent a long time after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward lingering and listening, but even a miracle will</seg><seg type="columnLine">pall in time and since the set did not need my attention,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	turned to other duties, among which was the making</seg><seg type="columnLine">of arrangements for the ceremony to mark the breaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ground for the subway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Saturday afternoon Joel returned with much clatter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and noise. The success of the atomic machine did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise him. He listened to my report and agreed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire program. I had detailed a gang of workmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">with several of his old type diggers to start the excava-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion after the ceremony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Metal Worms</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">«/ta HAT'S right, Bob," he approved. "We'll have to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> X use them to sink a shaft to the floor level of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subway before we can put our new outfit to work." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoyed my surprise, then walked to the nearest window.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What do you think of the new equipment?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were six cumbersome looking affairs on wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">caterpillar treads adorning our driveway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They scarcely suggest diggers," I replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he answered, "because they're really not dig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He led me out to the lawn for a closer inspection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These were pushed through the factory rather hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riedly," he said; "but then atomic machines will never</seg><seg type="columnLine">be complicated or hard to construct.

"They weigh</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighteen tons each." He came back to the atomic dig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers, "and they have just a few moving parts.

This cable was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">unreeled from a giant spool as the Metal Worm ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced.

No harm was</seg><seg type="columnLine">done, but the guards were increased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Metal Worm did well.

They brought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers's body up, and we stood with the crowd that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gathered. His profession had indeed been his life</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him. Without the one, the other was worthless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bob," said Joel, "I'm going home. If you're able,</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out what it all means," and he mingled with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving throng and was gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Unleashed Terror</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I CALLED Sergeant Hottinger. "There are ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions I'd like to ask," I said. "Did those two men</seg><seg type="columnLine">refuel the Worm?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They came out without the bag of sand, sir," he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied. "It's after midnight. The Worm should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been done a half hour ago. I'll call." He stepped into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field office and called the western end of the tube,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then beckoned to me and held the earpiece for me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear the muffled roar of operations still going on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sounds seemed louder than usual. "They are,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">the guard agreed. "The chap at the other end is wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," I said, cheerfully, "Dr. Murch planned to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tend the tube anyway. We've been relieved of a hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">task."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, sir. may I remind you that the heat suit is gone?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll take the wearer into custody, sir, if he shows</seg><seg type="columnLine">up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Correct. By the way, do you know what this sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plus power cable is for?" I asked, touching it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my foot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It draws off the extra power, sir. If it didn't do</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, the Worm would sort of run wild, set fire to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Any harm in that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir. In time it would spread and destroy every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, like dynamite."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the speed of the cable?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Five feet a minute, sir."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAUGHING DEATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">53</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I didn't wish to startle him too much. Captain Gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diner's case was still painfully fresh in my memory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," I said, quietly, "the cable isn't moving!" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid a restraining hand on his shoulder. "Take things</seg><seg type="columnLine">coolly," I advised. "If the cable is broken, it can easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">be mended."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not so easily, sir, if the break is near the Worm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We haven't the heat suit, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again he called the western end of the tube. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he returned, his face was pale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sergeant Harr reports, sir," he said, "that the cable</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been disconnected from the digger."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How did he find that out?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Flood lights from the top of the shaft, sir. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">couplings are lying right at the east side of the shaft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir. That would make it just about the time those two</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My worst fears were realized. The Metal Worm had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been unleashed. I repeated my misgivings to the police</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, but such matters were beyond him. The report-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er's pictures had revealed nothing of value. Fliers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent out for the hunchback of whom Joel had given such</seg><seg type="columnLine">an apt description. Eventually the hunchback was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged into one of the local police stations but before</seg><seg type="columnLine">any facts could be extracted from him, he had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from a self-administered dose of poison.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With Joel unwell and secluded in his quarters, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm of detail again centered about me. For hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sat beside the telephone. Police on their beat called</seg><seg type="columnLine">me frequently. Complaints were coming in that sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">was impossible in West Philadelphia. Windows rattled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their frames, lights flickered, the very house founda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions trembled. The collapse of a row of old houses</seg><seg type="columnLine">added to the din. What was about to happen?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toward dawn I found an engraved card on my desk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">How it got there I don't know. I must have dozed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was from the mad scientist and at the bottom an</seg><seg type="columnLine">extra line had been scrawled in a heavy hand. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">message was short:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   "Apologies for letting your machine run wild;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> but I did not know how to destroy it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What an ironic sense of humor!" I thought and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent the card to police headquarters. The handwriting</seg><seg type="columnLine">might help.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">New Evils</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN the morning such tubes as were ready were</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened for service. By noon I was convinced a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half million people would patronize our lines that</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. I rode in the first coach to Seventy-fifth Street</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the last mile of rails were actually just being set.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beyond was the extension of the tube which the run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">away Worm was digging. The tube was being gradu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally enlarged: the floor was dropping down, the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls were receding and the arched ceiling was rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher. Where would this end?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The new underground ways were immensely popu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar, especially with shoppers. A spell of hot, humid</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather was driving many more under. In the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">first hour after the opening, one of the houses had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">leased to a writer desiring quiet! By the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day fifteen had been hired, all under the Delaware</seg><seg type="columnLine">River. People were taken with the novelty of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meeting the chief housing engineer at the Paoli divi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion, I was informed that the schedule had jumped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">200 completed houses per day! I ordered the hiring</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of more men. I wasn't satisfied. The rail manager</seg><seg type="columnLine">* announced that the Pennsylvania was building shuttle</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines to connect with our tubes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well," I quite astonished him, "what's the matter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the Reading ? Go after it, too!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The opening of a subway was no longer an event.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As fast as mileage was laid, it was thrown open to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">service. Money poured in. Surface traction companies</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">started litigation; but our legal staff interposed obstacles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and delays. The State Governor helped in this. Matters</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shaped up well. I finished my tour and flew back to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">police headquarters for the latest news.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I found the devastation of the wheat lands was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spreading; cattle were still being decimated and food</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">prices were soaring. A new threat had appeared. Sud-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">denly the farmer's greatest enemy broke all bounds,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">here, there, everywhere. A strange, shaggy weed grew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like wildfire, choking out all useful vegetation and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'wherever this seemed to have had its start, the usual</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cards were found. No one could suggest a means to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">combat this latest invasion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "This war of yours," the police chief remarked, "is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a devilish, queer kind of war. When will the people be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">attacked directly?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   As if in answer, the police clerk came in with a cable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fron^London. The news had been repressed for some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time; but finally it had leaked out. The English Parlia-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment had been in the midst of a night session, voting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on the appropriation of thirty million pounds for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">construction of a new naval program. The vote was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">never completed. There wasn't a soul who could after-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ward render a coherent account of the incident. An</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">invisible pall had settled over the Houses of Parliament,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over the grounds nearby and over the Thames. Lords,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">commoners, boatmen, vagrants, guards had succumbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The victims of this silent attack came to life again,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but England was confronted with the strangest problem</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the history of any nation. It was suddenly bereft</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of its law-making bodies; it was without its legislative</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">head. The speakers of the two houses awoke and stared</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vacantly at the engraved cards that had come mysteri-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ously into their hands. The private asylums of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">country were quickly requisitioned to receive the af-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flicted. From street sweeper to lord, memory had de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">serted them; the past, with its burdens and its prob-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lems. was forever the past for them; they were as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">children in men's bodies!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The political malcontents surged into London and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seized control. Chaos reigned. The British army and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">navy were slashed in half. Enlistments stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Some thousands of miles away, the United States Cav-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">alry had been trekking painfully in a practice march</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">across the deserts north of the Rio Grande, and making as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">good time as could be expected in the deep and yielding</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sand when a like fate overtook them. An air squadron,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sent out to pick up the men wandering about dazedly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over the sandy wastes, was itself brought down by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">same evil vapor!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A Mexican revolution was nipped in the bud in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">same manner. Then London received a second visita-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion. In the midst of wild celebration and while a Red</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">army was being mobilized on the spot, the pall descend-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ed and blotted out the past for them all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And so it went on, this tale of vengeance from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">air. In India, punitive forces in a salt riot, were over-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">taken by the deadly wave; a secret army forming in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Japan abandoned its objective; elsewhere, a vast throng</seg><seg type="columnLine">54</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">honoring a modern Caesar and his dreams of empire</seg><seg type="columnLine">were scattered like lost children. In a short number of '</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, the world's armed forces had been reduced to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow of their former strength.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Numbered Days</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THESE occurrences were far from our city. Joel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">about again, accepted each outrage stoically and</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged once more into the worry we shared</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally. Every other problem, the tubes, housing, heat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, transportation, etc., had been handed over to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing staff of engineers. People were moving into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new homes slowly; but when the dreaded gas cloak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared more than death, at last found out our city and</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled upon a patriotic parade on Broad Street, making</seg><seg type="columnLine">several thousand its victims, the whole city and the city's</seg><seg type="columnLine">business made a mad rush to get underground, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">good weather and safety prevailed at all times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Freed of all other duties, we lived practically in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, flying back and forth from the laboratory to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">western end of the main tube. Here the fiery terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">was boring through the bowels of the Earth with fiend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish haste. During the first day of its freedom the dig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger behaved normally, cutting but one mile of tube.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We still worried, however.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If," said Joel, "that machine has been fueled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">capacity, it will run on like that for 197 years!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It would be the eighth wonder," I answered, "a sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way three times around the Earth!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the second day, the Metal Worm had cut three</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles instead of one; on the third, it had reached six</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles; on the fourth day, ten miles, on the fifth day, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at Downingtown, fifteen miles away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The city mayor, Joel and I were together when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surveyors brought in the last report. Our faces were</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanched with fear. We spoke in whispers without</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowing it. Joel's hand trembled as he made substitu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions in an equation. When the answer was ready, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">faltered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Utterly impossible!" he said at last. "Fantastic! It</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't be! Our days would be numbered!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We studied his calculations and found them to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">correct.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're meddling with celestial forces now," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned. "Nothing is impossible! And think what this</seg><seg type="columnLine">means! No matter how much or how fast the Worm</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunges onward, its energy will not be exhausted, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">you said, for nearly two centuries! However, we don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to worry about that distant date!" and I laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly. At last I'd caught an inkling of the end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mayor didn't understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it really true?" he asked Joel. "Will it really</seg><seg type="columnLine">have dug its way to the west coast in a month?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid so. Bob's right. My fear wouldn't let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me admit it. The Worm is using no extra fuel. It's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spreading action, faster and faster every day," said Joel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen," the mayor spoke with decision, "there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">just one thing left to do. We'll have to stop that</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine somehow!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Joel who laughed this time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't be done," he replied. "It's forever beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">human control. My heat suit's gone and with it the</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibility of making another."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What could we do? Wait, wait and hope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">On the sixth day, the tireless monster was at Lan-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">caster, on the seventh, striking to the south a tfifle, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed through York, destroying a mile of' city streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and buildings. At this point the subway had emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">as an open cut. The terrific heat thus liberated at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked everything in its way, burning farm crops, virgin</seg><seg type="columnLine">forests and such structures as happened to be in its path.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roaring infernos trailed its progress through valley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain and plain. It had long since ceased its use-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulness; its path was- a barren waste, a searing gash</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the land. Airplanes flew ahead, warning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people and thus lives and some property were saved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We no longer journeyed to the tube's end. Such</seg><seg type="columnLine">trips were useless now, even dangerous to us. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were those who held us to blame for having loosed this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearful menace. I began to wish I'd never taken up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Joel's experiments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By this time, the Worm had ripped its way through</seg><seg type="columnLine">several mountain ranges and was heading through west-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern Maryland. Panic seized the people and the press</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded more information from us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joel strode up and down the length of our den in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounting frenzy of fear and foreboding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll have to tell them," he groaned. "What will</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen after that-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shrugged his shoulders as the door opened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit the representatives of the press. They saw by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face that the tidings would be of the worst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Boys," he said, "use your judgment. Think of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">results!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Some fools," one of the reporters spoke, "are going</seg><seg type="columnLine">about making wild statements that the days of the Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">are numbered. If-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joel held up his hand. "They are numbered, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">none can tell the number." He passed his sheet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculations over for their enlightenment. "In less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">two months, as you can see by the figures, the Metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">Worm will have gone around the world and further.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By that time the gash will be over seven miles wide,</seg><seg type="columnLine">over three and a half deep. It will swallow whole cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">and towns." He strode away from them, heaping low</seg><seg type="columnLine">curses upon the one who had launched this remorseless</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapon against our planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," another said, "what will happen when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Worm reaches the Pacific?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joel waved his hands in despair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do I know? If you expect the ocean to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinguish that digger as it would a fire, it'll probably not</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it. Remember what happened to the Susquehanna ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The river had been drained and the water had van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished in vast clouds of steam. The Susquehanna Valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed doomed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You must have an idea, Dr. Murch, a rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look at your figures again," Joel interrupted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Three months, four or five and the Earth will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared!

Finally the more powerful nations mobilized</seg><seg type="columnLine">such military forces as still remained and with these</seg><seg type="columnLine">strove to cut off the sources of certain chemicals, in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">way hoping to thwart the enemy in his manufacture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">poison gases. A division of American infantry, as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembling at Camp Dix, New Jersey, for this purpose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was attacked on the second night by a new menace, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">greenish cloud that sank and clung to the ground. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">night 40,000 men started to laugh as men had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed before. It must have been a ghastly sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even in death from exhaustion which followed, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">insane mirth contorted the facial muscles into horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">masks. The same green vapor visited the other nations</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a great shudder ran through the world. Men</seg><seg type="columnLine">shunned military service; military discipline melted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Foreign engineers inspected our underground city,</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to their homelands and began projects of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own, much, much smaller and by the old, tedious and</seg><seg type="columnLine">expensive methods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Theirs is a vain task," I commented. "They need</seg><seg type="columnLine">help. Why couldn't we build a few more atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines, Joel?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started up from his desk where he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">brooding. He was almost angry--and scared! I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once that we would build no more Worms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My question stirred Joel to unexpected action. To-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, as I write this tale, I feel my burden lightened a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little for having been the indirect cause of this. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">very day orders were issued for the sealing in of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Metal Worms forever, each in a structure with walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">many feet thick. Mighty towers were erected and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enforced against earth tremors. A large fuel chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been added to each Worm to hold many tons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand. The rocket tubes were closed and the machines</seg><seg type="columnLine">became power producing units instead of diggers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That settles that!" sighed Joel. "Human hands will</seg><seg type="columnLine">never touch those machines again. Power will come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them, transmitted through the air, for thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of years, for eternity, as far as we're concerned. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">day during the coming ages man, if one of his type is</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, will need it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a prophetic utterance and today I live to real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ize it. In time it may prove our salvation, this power</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming from the air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The papers came out suddenly in special editions</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the entire face of the earth. The reporters had</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided. Page after page was devoted to Joel's predic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions and to such news of mankind's suffering that came</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the war of one man against the world. Strangely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no authority, no university, no government doubted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outcome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Panic and resignation reigned side by side. Public</seg><seg type="columnLine">and private business dwindled, transportation was dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted, food supplies were delayed, people starved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pestilence was eating away resistance, destroying</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage, changing men into savages wanting to live a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole life in the despairing weeks that were left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Metal Worm had plunged down into the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the Mississippi; in New Mexico it had emerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to disappear again under the western mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranges. Railroads, highways, communities were divided</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever by an unnatural canyon that grew ever deeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wider.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The passage of the Worm under the bed of the Pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cific was the forerunner of disastrous earth disturb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ances. California was rocked by a 'quake, cities fell in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruins and millions of their citizens died. In the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">peninsula, tidal waves swept over the narrow strip of</seg><seg type="columnLine">land and carried away the flimsy evidence of human</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitation. Pilots of trans-Pacific air liners veered</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their usual lanes to avoid the sheer banks of steam</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the ocean spumed up. Later a wild call for help</seg><seg type="columnLine">by wireless from Honolulu, a vain, heart-rending call,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was silenced as the sea opened up and sucked in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">city and the whole island group.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In Person</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE mourning nations had been put on a war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time ration to ward off immediate starvation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joel and I had not the desire to eat even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sketchy meals allowed us. The sound of hideous laugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter, the groans of the dying, the prayers of the hungry</seg><seg type="columnLine">were always with us. The point of living was out of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives. We strove, we gave, we planned but our efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were slowing down. The world was falling away be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sweeping across the Pacific, through Asia and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europe, the metal monster we had so proudly created</seg><seg type="columnLine">left a trail, the horror of which man could never sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vive. In consternation I saw a similarity between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembling and shaking of our Earth with the shudder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of that atom world we had viewed through the eye-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of the microscope. Like that atom world, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet, too, was doomed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Navigation of the Atlantic and tributary waters had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped. The ocean boiled in, mad, frothing, flinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scalding waters high in the humid air. Frogs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">superheated steam rolled over land and water. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">New Atlantis, the floating airport city, midway between</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europe and America, fell, drawn in by a maelstrom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">furious waters. The sea along the New Jersey coast</seg><seg type="columnLine">seethed in rising heat. The Metal Worm was coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">back!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're going backward," said Joel, "backward to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the age of steaming swamps, a slimy world of scorch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing heat, torrential downpours and everlasting fogs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thermometer was registering a torrid, suffocating</seg><seg type="columnLine">fierceness that parched our throats. Our windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">were wide open upon City Hall Plaza but only a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">enervating stirring of air came in, the fevered breathing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a dying planet!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was growing impatient. We had been summoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our central city office with a promise that was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best bait in the world for us.

Do you hear?" I rose and rushed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest window. Almost like an echo to my words, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy roar shattered the quiet of usual sounds. Build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings were twjsted and turned in grotesque ways and</seg><seg type="columnLine">toppling over and the streets were falling inward, out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sight. A broad crevasse had opened across the city,</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealing the cavern that was our underground city with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its crowded millions. There was a vast spread of flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Metal Worm flashed by somewhere in the depths.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our building quaked and swayed and the heat was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufferable. I closed the windows hastily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's following its original gash," I shouted above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">din.

Our handker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chiefs were already wet, but we went on using them with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out being aware of the fact. We gulped several glasses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ice water. That gave a temporary relief. I glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the clock. We had been waiting for nearly a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps it was just a joke, a hoax, our being called</seg><seg type="columnLine">here," I muttered, torn between the desire to stay with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joel and an equally powerful urge to escape this tower-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing pile of concrete and steel that teetered creakingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and forth on its foundation. We were alone in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the building and that did not add to my courage. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at this time, I think, that my hair began turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll wait a few minutes more, Bob," Joel answered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes on the far horizon, where billows of jet black</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled across the face of the sun. Lately the sun had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a rare and pale spectacle, appearing fleetingly amid</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dank clouds of steam.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a movement in the room behind us, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sharp intake of breath. We squirmed around in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">seats. My trousers clung stickingly to the leather</seg><seg type="columnLine">cushion. Perspiration was in my eyes and it trickled</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the bridge of my nose. A wild oath from Joel's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight lips. His eyes were blazing. My lips mumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">something, and heavy, throbbing cords were across my</seg><seg type="columnLine">throbbing forehead. I spat viciously. I wanted to bite,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangle, kill!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A taunting laugh mocked our efforts to free ourselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I choked, trying not to inhale the strange odor that</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled the room. Finally I fell back supinely into my</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. My limbs were leaden and hard to move, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind was awake, jubilant, ferocious. Joel turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head lazily in my direction and I saw that his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lit with unholy glee. "At last! At last 1" his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulging eyes seemed to cry out to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before us stood the madman, Grubsnig. His face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was set, his eyes burned with insanity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sorry to have kept you waiting, Dr. Murch--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you," looking at me; "but time, after all, is nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. No, don't try to speak. Your tongues are swollen."</seg><seg type="columnLine">His voice rasped sharper and I thought we faced death</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a new form at that moment. "You have upset my</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans. My world empire is falling about my ears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Your atomic machine was more effective than I gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">it credit for, but it must not be forgotten that you de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed it. Now, any time, any minute the end will</seg><seg type="columnLine">come. And you have done this to me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood near the electric fan and held a metal con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainer behind the moving blades. The stream of scented</seg><seg type="columnLine">air swept past us and out into the hall to which the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ajar. Wild ideas ran through my head. If we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could dislodge the fan, kick that metal thing from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, make him forget himself! Joel had the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts. His eyes were challenging the fiend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rave, rave, as I did," gnashed the latter. "It's</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as well that matters have come to the pass they have.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The human race was not worth saving. It's a petty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgusting manifestation: it must have its little schemes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its boundaries, its soldiers and its wars!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment he rocked on the balls of his feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought his fumes had got to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My world empire is not to be," he went on. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">good that I wanted to do will never be done. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">your machine has wrecked everything! Let me assure</seg><seg type="columnLine">you that my revenge will be sweet. I shall still have an</seg><seg type="columnLine">empire and with you as my subjects! Think of it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">just you and I, here alone and hating one another on</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever part of the Earth that is left, hating one</seg><seg type="columnLine">another until life ebbs away from your tortured bodies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, if we are to die now in this cataclysm, we'll die</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, still hating and hating, our blood turning into</seg><seg type="columnLine">wormwood in our veins, our hearts shriveling with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">venomous, malignant disease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm leaving little to chance.

Any who escape will die later of the pestilence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seeds of which have been sowed so well in what</seg><seg type="columnLine">rivers are left. When their work is done, my men will</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass out, too, for, unknown to them, I have inoculated</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with a special virus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, you are warm and you want to talk! That will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be music to my ears!" He adjusted something on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas tank. "Drink; your limbs will be lighter and talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">for your tongues will become normal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fervently we drank the ice water at hand. We could</seg><seg type="columnLine">move, sluggishly, with great labor--but we could move!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "False hopes," our captor taunted us.

Look,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like scurrying rats they go!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice boomed on. Our hot, aching eyes took in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the confusion below. Pride swelled up in me. Even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LAUGHING DEATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">this, the last day, men were not thinking of self. Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">timbers were being slung over the crevice that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main subway, precarious bridges were being hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riedly constructed that the milling mass of humanity</seg><seg type="columnLine">might surge over flame, smoke and steam, and escape to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the south, forever to the south, away from that horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">dementing, convulsive gayety that swept down from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the north, away from the long green streamers of gas</seg><seg type="columnLine">that reached here, there, everywhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above the rumble of the Earth was the drone of many</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships in the air, drawn, as if by some gigantic magnet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all in one direction. As hour after hour we sat through</seg><seg type="columnLine">that heat-steeped afternoon, this drone swelled in volume</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the very floor under our feet took on a new vibra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Our building still held as it swayed as if by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze, and the maddened hordes, which now fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way over the great bridges still springing up</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout the city, as they were elsewhere, wherever</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crack in the Earth was not too wide, surged in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide cirde about the base of our concrete pile--as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">one kind of death mattered much now from any other!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As dusk settled down, there was no let-up in the heat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sky flared with reds and oranges and in the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fires humanity still struggled onward, in all kinds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of conveyances, in the air, On the ground and on foot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Other races than the white began to appear, Blacks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spaniards, Indians, Orientals, a free mingling of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">races of the earth all urged by the same desire, all equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the time being. Elsewhere, on the face of the globe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gap was too wide, only here had Fate left a means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of escape, and before our eyes the peoples of the north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern half of the planet were pouring like tumultuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters into the southern half. Whole tribes and bands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and caravans marched parallel to the unnatural canyon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking a crossing and finding it here at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night wore on tediously; the hours were eter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nities. We sat and sat, now silent, now ranting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">raving, but the long vigil was beginning to tell on Joel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His storm of searing words was ebbing lower. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">mummies we sat and only when the hot breath of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night brought up new sounds, new earth tremors, did</seg><seg type="columnLine">we stir. Once a dark blot of humanity had stormed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearest bridge in numbers too great for the frail</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure and with loud, wild laughter the squirming</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass had dropped from view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toward dawn I noticed Joel slyly closing and opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands, one finger at a time, then moving his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning his head rather aimlessly but all very carefully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the same time I sniffed the air from the fan. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrill ran through me. The air was but faintly scented.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had Grubsnig left something to chance after all? In</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few minutes I was convinced of this. I could scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">restrain my elation. I let my head drop sleepily to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide the fact of my discovery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joel's head, too, was sunken on his chest and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">guttural oaths issued from his lips. In the midst of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them I caught his wink. My lips moved soundlessly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouthing the words, "One, two--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the third count, like wild cats, we sprang at our</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy. The ice cooler toppled over and we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawling over a piece of furniture that had been kicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our way. Fear had subdued the insane light in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grubsnig's eyes. He flung away the useless gas tank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung it at my head. It struck me, drew blood but did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not stop me. I wrapped my arms about his legs. Joel</seg><seg type="columnLine">was back of me. He beat my back with clenched fists,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a mad desire to get at Grubsnig himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We lurched, fell, were up, then down again, now in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaningless confusion of arms and legs. Other fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">niture crashed to the floor. To us the world has ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be. We were ak-ne. Our panting and heaving punc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuated the struggle. Joel cried and pleaded, "Leave--</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave him to me" over and over again but I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed Grubsnig, would have trampled upon him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a grasp of pain I let go and fell away. Joel seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whirling fan and cast it away from us. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen on us during the mad scramble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our quarry, however, was gone. Down the length</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the silent halls we pursued him, leaving a trail of</seg><seg type="columnLine">red. At the stairway the chase moved upward. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof, lit by the surrounding fires, a windmill plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">was standing, its engine purring silently, its windmill</seg><seg type="columnLine">blades moving slowly in the air stream from the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peller.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Head him off!" I cried to Joel. My voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarse. I don't thinlc he heard me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The plane was rising vertically from the roof.

A pause. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">called you up to say that I'm going away for a month</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a vacation, and you can use my laboratory for your</seg><seg type="columnLine">molecular work if you want to.

He was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much averse to taking favors from this man. Not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">did he dislike him, but also he feared him! Lately</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been a disquieting look in the fellow's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they rested on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, if he were to be away for a month, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a waste of opportunity not to use his equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. He accepted, thanking his rival rather awk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wardly. The illogical apprehensions that set him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering at the unexpected generosity--the unreason-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able suspicions that some motive lay behind the invita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion--were dismissed; and he prepared to gather up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">few effects spared him by the fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brainard, at the other end of the line, hung up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">receiver and rose wearily from his chair. His clothes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were muddy and torn; and on the back of one hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a long scratch that might have been caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the barbed wire of a storage yard fence. But his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips were shaped to a smile, as if at the thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some plan that was developing to his entire satisfaction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Willis dreaded meeting his host as he came over that</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening to install himself in the borrowed laboratory;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his nervousness was comfortably dissipated by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that Brainard had already gone, leaving a curt note</seg><seg type="columnLine">of welcome and a set of duplicate keys with the house-</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The servant, an elderly woman with thin lips and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurred gray eyes, handed over the note and the keys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and prepared to leave. She, too, was taking a vacation</seg><seg type="columnLine">while her employer was away. Willis would be abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely alone in the big house, half of which was Brain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ard's workshop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had planned, after a casual look at the laboratory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go back to his own home and return in the morning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But this he found himself unable to do. For, tempt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly laid out as punctiliously as though arranged by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own hand, were all the instruments he needed for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">continuation of his experiments. Brainard must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept up with his activities astoundingly, to have dupli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated his equipment at such short notice!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A touch led to a little more precise arranging, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its turn drew him into the beginning of one of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">heedless spells of concentration that had preceded many</seg><seg type="columnLine">a night of work. Soon he was moving swiftly about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chamber, oblivious to time and all else but the array</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just once he was momentarily interrupted. A slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraping noise came to his ears. Confused by the effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tearing his attention away from his work, he glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the room. There was nothing unusual to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Striding to the door, he locked it and slipped into</seg><seg type="columnLine">place a heavy bolt that worked from the inside only.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he fastened the front windows securely and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the long table, sure that there was no way '</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which he could be interrupted. The vague fear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brainard, that had been awakened again at the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the odd noise, was submerged in the fascination of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his experiment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On and on he worked over the task that would never</seg><seg type="columnLine">be completed by his hand.

He only</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that it was very late at night, that he had notified</seg><seg type="columnLine">a policeman at once, and that, in less than two minutes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had forced a way in and were exploring the house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No one was found, although the Witness insisted that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heard a slight noise as they approached the door of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory. This, however, was disregarded; after</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking in the door a thorough search of the big room</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved it to be empty of any living thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the floor was the body of Willis; and no medical</seg><seg type="columnLine">examination was necessary to tell that he was dead.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Obviously, also, he had been murdered; but in spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quickness with which they had entered, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to tell where the murderer had gone or how</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had managed to disappear so rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Careful not to touch the body, the officer gazed at it</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously. It lay, with eyes staring fearfully and head</seg><seg type="columnLine">battered in as though hit by a club, near an odd object</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was drawn up next to the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was a large glass box, about six and a half feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">long by four and a half feet square, a contrivance that</seg><seg type="columnLine">inexplicably suggested a plate glass coffin. A glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed that it was empty. He could look through it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and see the wall behind as clearly as though gazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a freshly polished window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Using the phone on the desk, he called headquarters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful not to leave the room for an instant until an</seg><seg type="columnLine">examination could be held. Then he settled back in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair to wait until Blair, or some one, could come with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night squad. In a short time after he phoned, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">squad arrived, with Blair in charge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each detective, it is said, has his own peculiar methods</seg><seg type="columnLine">of solving crime, just as artists have their own individual</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways of designing a picture. The method of big, slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">going Blair was apt to be dangerous to himself, in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he insisted on working absolutely alone in the scene of</seg><seg type="columnLine">violence; although in this case certainly no one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have foreseen danger to the most solitary of investi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gators !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He irritably accepted the presence of the coroner till</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body had been examined and removed. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">instructed his men to go over the house, and set himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the task of searching the laboratory. But first he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened the1'shattered door by propping a chair under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the knob to make sure he would be let alone while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">combed over the room for clues.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He read and reread the note from Brainard that</seg><seg type="columnLine">accounted for Willis' presence in another man's house.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knowing nothing of any enmity between the two men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw in the note and duplicate keys only a hospitable</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer from one scientist to another in time of need.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Methodically he began to search the place. Examina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the splintered door told him that the room had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been securely locked from the inside by the unfortunate</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist before he started the midnight experimenting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The windows were also tightly fastened and showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no signs of having been tampered with. The first</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery to be solved, it seemed, was how any one could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have entered the room while Willis was there at work!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He considered the chance that Willis might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked himself in with some other person, an assistant</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps. But that was proved impossible by the inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolt on the door. No one could leave the room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">relock the bolt from the outside. This fact also ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinguished the momentary idea that Brainard himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his own keys, could have entered and left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory that night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally dismissing the problem of entrance as some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that might later be solved by carefully sounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls and floors for a secret doorway, Blair set stolidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work to examine the contents of the room in search</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any chance hints that might present themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rows and rows of test tubes, drawing instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, and delicate electrical apparatus told him no</seg><seg type="columnLine">story. The desk drawers revealed nothing relevant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case. Puzzled, he stared absently at the huge glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">box that ranged along one wall beside the dark stain</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor where the body had been found.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The box, too, told no story. It was empty. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked through it the wall showed clear on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side; and as he came nearer he could see the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it with equal ease. He tried to lift the lid;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but, as he tugged at it, cautiously for fear of somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking it, he found that it did not move. This in itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">was mildly perplexing as he could see no evidence of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock or 'catch of any kind in the clear glass front.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Along the back ran a heavy steel strip, which reinforced</seg><seg type="columnLine">its hinges, but in the front there was no speck of metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The possible purpose of the box was beyond him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps it was designed for some sort of aquarium,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though why even the most scientific of fish tanks should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a lid over it was puzzling. Looking through it</seg><seg type="columnLine">he observed that there were spaces around the hinge</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolts near the top large enough to admit air in case</seg><seg type="columnLine">the contrivance really was used for an aquarium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, he could not see that any light was shed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the murder of Professor Willis by the presence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one more strange scientific instrument in a room full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of such things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shrugging indifferently, he turned away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty glass box. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next instant he received a smashing blow on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of the head, and fell in almost the precise spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the body of Willis had lain before him!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT six o'clock in the morning the detective, Rand</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy, was roused from his comfortable bed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a phone call from headquarters. Half an hour later the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wispy little man, with the graying hair and the peculiar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly blue eyes, was listening to a tale of two men struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in an empty room which in each instance had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been locked from the inside. The first, Professor Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lis, was dead. The second, Blair, was in the hospital</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a fractured skull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of the short, and not very helpful, account</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what had happened, Detective Hardy nodded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">went out into the bright morning sunshine. His first trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to the hospital where he asked to see Blair. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">he met with no success in his crusade. Blair did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognize him and was weakly delirious. Babbling sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tences poured from his lips, ranging from broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatches of childhood reminiscence to repetitions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">words uttered the day before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One occasionally repeated phrase, however, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">62</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy frown attentively. This was an unintelligible</seg><seg type="columnLine">reference to a glass box. There were no elaborations</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the theme, merely the words--the glass box--mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mured over and over again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Puffing absently at an unlighted cigarette, he left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospital and went to the Brainard home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The door was locked both times?" he asked Harris,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a younger man, dark and taciturn, with whom he often</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. From the inside," said Harris. "Willis had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened it with this bolt you see, and Blair had propped</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chair under the knob so tightly that we could hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">force the door open."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're sure it would have been impossible to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the room?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the ordinary way, yes. Perhaps there's a secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance," he shrugged. "But we've sounded walls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor and found no trace of such a thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you any theory at all of what might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harris hesitated. "Well," he said finally, "the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">was entered too soon after the murder of Willis for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murderer to have escaped. And the second time a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was knocked on the head here, the building was cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered by half a dozen of the force, and no one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have possibly left the laboratory."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you think whoever did it is still in the house?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hardly that," said Harris. "My idea is that Willis</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Blair weren't done in by anything human at all--</seg><seg type="columnLine">by some mechanical thing." He pointed to the racks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of apparatus that lined the walls. "I'm no scientist, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't know the meaning of much of this stuff. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it occurred to me that some one of these things might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">an innocent looking kind of death trap. That big glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">box, perhaps . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the words, Hardy turned to stare. The glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">box! He remembered Blair's repetition of the phrase</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his delirium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you suppose it's for?" he exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Haven't an idea," said Harris. "It's empty--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can't help thinking it has some significance. Both</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were struck down beside it, in the same spot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Possibly there's some kind of spring arrangement in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor there, and when a man stands on it his weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">is enough to release the force . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you tried it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No-o-" said Harris slowly, "I haven't. That would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a good deal like sitting in an electric chair to see if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the current is turned on!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Carefully avoiding the fatal spot in front of the box,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy walked around it, gazing at it intently. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">there been any mechanism inside, it could have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's test out your concealed spring theory," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harris started promptly for the spot in front of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">box marked with the dark stains on the floor. Hardy</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait a minute, young fellow. You're married,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a family. I'll stand there myself--and then, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're right, there won't be any widows and orphans in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Deliberately he walked over the section of the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">that might cover a deadly concealed spring, and waited to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see if he would be the third to fall with a cracked skull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing happened. Methodically he shifted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight from side to side; but no ominous, unguessable</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers were released.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That seems to rule the box out," he said, his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">casual. He sat down before the desk and stared at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open front windows where the sun was streaming in</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the bare wood floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After all," he said, thinking aloud, "it's not likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">that any mechanical force did for Willis and Blair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's far-fetched and complicated. No, I think a</seg><seg type="columnLine">human hand held the club, or whatever it may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been, that cracked the heads for them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But if that's the case," protested Harris, "the mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derer would still be in the house! He's had no time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escape. And all our work has proved that there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">no secret doors or compartments where he could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It does sound improbable," murmured the older</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. He turned again to gaze at the glass box that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been mentioned in the delirious babble of the sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ond man to be stricken down beside it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And suddenly, as he gazed, his eyes took on a colder</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue and his lips shaped themselves to a soundless</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistle. For, looking through the transparent glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls, he noticed a curious thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wooden baseboard that surrounded the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that presumably extended along the wall behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the box--could not be seen through the clear glass!</seg><seg type="columnLine">It came up to each end of the box and then disappeared!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The obvious conclusion was that, able to see through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the box and still unable to see any trace of baseboard--</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no baseboard there to be seen! And as it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a foot and a half broad, if a section of it had been re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved, it might provide the secret way by which some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one could enter the room in spite of door and window</seg><seg type="columnLine">locks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Help me shift this box away from the wall," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly to Harris. "I want to look behind it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The combined efforts of the two men could not move</seg><seg type="columnLine">it an inch. Panting, they gave it up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Call a couple of the boys from downstairs," com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded Hardy. But two were not enough. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">more had to be summoned; and the six of them ranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves at side and ends of the incredibly immov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able glass box.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It must be fastened to the floor!" exclaimed Harris.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, there it moved a little. It's just kind of heavy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was indeed heavy. The six of them were barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to slide it a few feet over the creaking, protesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor boards to a space in front of the sunny windows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as the box was moved away from the wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy stared in amazement. The baseboard was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched behind it. In spite of the fact that he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to see it through glass as clear as spring water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was undeniably there and undeniably untampered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with. Here was no secret way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Completely puzzled, he sat at the desk again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the box in its new place by the window. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, pouring warmly in, bathed it with light and reflected</seg><seg type="columnLine">from bevelled edges in rainbow colored strips. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to mock him, empty and innocent appearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then he made another discovery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About three feet above the lid there was an irregular</seg><seg type="columnLine">splotch of ink and a jagged dent in the plaster of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall between the two windows. As he looked straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the box, apparently seeing through its sides, he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same irregular ink stain. It seemed to be on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall directly behind the box instead of a yard above it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well--" breathed Hardy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rising from his chair he walked to the side of the box.</seg><seg type="columnLine">HIDDEN IN THE -GLASS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">63</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Gazing down into it he saw the floor. But it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor directly beneath it. Instead, he found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring at the tips of his own shoes a foot and a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the side!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While Harris watched him wonderingly, he walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the box, gazing through it from different angles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you opened this thing?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, no," said Harris. "I tried to, and it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened somehow, so I let it alone. No use of opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">it--you can look square through it now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," corrected Hardy. "You can look through it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right--but not squarely!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean, chief ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I mean that when I sit here at the desk and look</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it--I see a patch on the wall three feet above</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. And when I look down through the lid--I see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor a foot and a half to the side. In other words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harris, it's impossible to see into that box!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it's clear as window glass," argued Harris.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Clearer," Hardy agreed. "You'd think a speck of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust could be seen in it. But it couldn't be if you found</seg><seg type="columnLine">your glance being deflected off at right angles!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wondering, the rest stared at the coffin-like thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed in the sun. And all saw the same strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">phenomenon at the same instant--a thin wisp of bluish</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapor that began to curl out from the open spaces</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the hinge bolts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's smoke!" exclaimed Harris, sniffing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "From an empty box!" added another of the men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it seemed no longer empty. Gradually it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing opaque so that it was impossible to see through</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. The opacity deepened till it appeared suddenly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been filled with milk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now, apparently without the touch of a human</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, the lid was raised. It opened as rapidly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">evenly as though worked by some kind of machinery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man scrambled from the box, his clothes smolder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and his face purple from strangulation, and dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the windows. He was half out of one of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">before they could reach him. A sheet of glass--about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the size of a dinner plate but of uneven thickness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">irregular outline--fell from his hands and smashed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces on the sidewalk below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took four of them to subdue and handcuff him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with one glance at the gibbering thing that had once</seg><seg type="columnLine">been Professor Brainard, Hardy, picked up the phone</seg><seg type="columnLine">and got in touch with the city asylum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"t TIDING in an empty box!" exclaimed Harris as, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">l l little later, he and Hardy examined it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mystery of its weight was revealed at a glance:</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top and sides were not ordinary flat sheets of glass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but were shallow triangles each plane of which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pronouncedly curved. At the thickest points the glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls were nearly half a foot through, rendering the box</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormously heavy. This, too, explained why the lid had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be fastened down--its sheer weight made it</seg><seg type="columnLine">a difficult task for one man to raise it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inside the box was a screw jack arrangement, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">geared that the lid could be jacked up rapidly and noise-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly by any one lying inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy pointed to the curved under surface of the lid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The reason for the smoke," he observed. "We just</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to put the box in the sun's rays, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curved surface partly focused the heat like a burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass. It must have been uncomfortable in there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But--hiding in an apparently empty box!" marveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harris again. "And of course the chances were that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one would bother to open it when they could see at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once that it was empty. So simple . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Simple?" repeated Hardy, raising his eyebrows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, yes. It's just a kind of prism effect. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">principle of the periscope, you know. If you look into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glass prism your glance is deflected off at an angle."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But the sides of this box aren't prisms," Hardy</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed out. "If they were--you wouldn't have any</seg><seg type="columnLine">box left. You'd have a solid cube."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Same idea, I guess," said Harris.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In response, Hardy stepped into the box and lowered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lid over himself with the jack. Harris gave a start</seg><seg type="columnLine">of surprise. Though somewhat distorted by the curved</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass surfaces, the body of his chief was visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When Brainard was in it he was invisible," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hardy after he had clambered out. "When I'm in it</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can be clearly seen. There's more to this than meets</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eye, Harris--a few details that I'll bet a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists would give their ears to know. Maybe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer lies in that sheet of glass he threw out. . . ."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Puffing absently at a cigarette, he pulled the window</seg><seg type="columnLine">shades to cut off the sun lest the box set the wood floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">afire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh well, what's the difference," he said at last.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We've got our man. Let's get some breakfast."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A still unsolved riddle, the glass box gleamed blankly</seg><seg type="columnLine">after them as they left the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">What Do You Know?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">READERS of Amazing Stories have frequently commented upon the fact that there is more actual knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be gained through reading its pages than from many a text-book.

"Atomic Fire" is defi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nitely thought-provoking, based, as it is, on scientific possibilities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Illustrated by MOREY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  jAGGAR HO was scrutinizing carefully the</seg><seg type="columnLine">/l scene in the view-plate of the great reflecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">L 1 telescope of the University of Itlantos in</seg><seg type="columnLine">/ % Panenbu, the capital city of Aerth. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and then he would glance aside, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking a silvery stylus in his skinny, almost clawlike</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, he would draw queer little symbols and figures on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pad of white paper on the desk before him. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a concerned look in his immense eyes, and in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">furry, though oddly human face, there was an expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion which one of his fellow creatures may have inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preted as denoting awe, or even dread' To Aggar Ho</seg><seg type="columnLine">such emotions were almost impossibilities. For eons</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ancestors had been toying with the forces of nature,</seg><seg type="columnLine">curbing them according to their needs and desires, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">now it would have taken a great danger indeed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaken in any member of his race the remotest hint</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But though the danger which Aggar Ho read among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stars may have been colossal enough to make him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little afraid, his keen intellect remained unhampered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If it was within the scope of possibility for him to help</seg><seg type="columnLine">avert any coming calamity, certainly no silly emotions</seg><seg type="columnLine">would prevent him from doing so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To a man of the twentieth century, Aggar Ho would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seemed to be a creature of a nightmare. He wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a plain silver diadem to hold his bushy gray hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">in place and a breech cloth of some gray knitted material</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his hips. In consequence, his peculiar physique</seg><seg type="columnLine">was well revealed. Except for his chest, which housed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his huge lungs and was immense beyond all comparison</seg><seg type="columnLine">with anything human, his body was singularly frail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His arms and legs were spindly and attenuated. His</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">feet were flat and large. A thick polar fur covered him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from head to foot. His ears were very large and bat</seg><seg type="columnLine">like--adapted for hearing in a very rarefied atmosphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">where all sounds are faint. His great green eyes had</seg><seg type="columnLine">elongated pupils like those of cats. They stared out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from either side of his beak-like nose and made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">look for all the world like a crafty old owl. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a hint of fierce determination about them, a look</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had survived Aggar Ho's youth. Plainly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old scientist belonged to an age far distant from the year</seg><seg type="columnLine">1931. The appointments of the room--its dials, switches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its single radium lamp over the desk in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the telescope, and its big crystal dome which trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted the starlight all proved this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many strange things had happened to Aerth in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past ten million years. In 2089 A. D. the inhabitants</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mars, driven from their native planet by shortage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">air, water and sunshine, had descended to Aerth. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">their superior weapons and knowledge they quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">subdued the Aerthians. It was from these conquerors</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Aggar Ho was descended. The Martians had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been cruel masters. They had ruled Aerth wisely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficiently for ten million years, and had won the admira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and willing co-operation of the natives to whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were almost gods. The two races always remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinct from one another, for though inter-marriage</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not uncommon, no offspring came from such unions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As nature had worked on Mars, so it worked on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aerth. The planet's water supply slowly seeped into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocks far beneath the surface crust, or as vapor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaked away into space until now the oceans had van*</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished. The atmosphere was .gradually dissipated in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter fashion until at length it was so rare that a man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">64</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Aggar Ho and Sark Ahar walked over to the center</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the landing stage. Here, supported by a funnel-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shaped cradle was a big shiny sphere about seventy-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">five feet in diameter. There was a row of circular</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">windows running horizontally around its circumfer-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ence. Four cylindrical objects, looking like some kind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of searchlights, were set at equal intervals around its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lower hemisphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">6S</seg><seg type="columnLine">66</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the year 2000 would have gasped and died in it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few minutes. The sun, too, had grown old. Its deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">red light shone down upon vast stretches of parched</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert over which every now and then terrific dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">storms raced. The sky was always a deep cloud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less blue. In it a few stars twinkled even during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day. Except where the thin ribbon-like canals rati</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ruler-edged courses over the face of the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing water from the melting polar snow-caps, every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was dry and devoid of vegetation. The summers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were still quite warm but the winters were terrifically</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently Aggar Ho reached for a tiny lever at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of his desk and swung it from a vertical to a hori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zontal position. The picture in the view-plate before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him faded. Then he tapped a little brazen gong with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his stylus. In a moment, in answer to the tinkling sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mons, another creature entered the. room through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtained door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The new arrival was somewhat more human than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aggar Ho. He was heavier and much better muscled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His chest was large, but not so large as the Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist's, and the white fur on his body was not so long</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thick. His eyes were blue; there was a twinkle</seg><seg type="columnLine">about them which told plainly that their possessor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">brim full of clever good nature. The ancestors of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had all been natives of Aerth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Chief," he said, "what news from the stars?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Has the Black Nebula come close enough so that we may</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull its tail or has it suddenly vanished altogether?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Plainly the two men were on the most intimate of terms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aggar Ho looked up at his assistant. The grave ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression on his face did not change. "We can no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">joke about the Black Nebula, Sark Ahar, my son," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Unless something can be done, it will cause all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inhabitants of Aerth to be frozen to death in thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five days."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The glint in the young Aerthian's eyes grew hard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You have finished your calculations? You know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all this is true?" he inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is no chance for a mistake," returned Aggar</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ho. "Here are my figures," and he tapped the pad of</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper lying on his desk. "You may take them to your</seg><seg type="columnLine">work room and check them if you like. Ever since</seg><seg type="columnLine">we began to watch the Black Nebula six months ago</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have been afraid. We thought that it would miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">the solar system by several billion miles but tonight I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have plotted its course. It is going to envelope the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blot out its light and warmth! Microscopic obser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vations prove that it is a vast cloud of the heavy opaque</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas number 106. When it reaches the sun, it will form</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dense layer over its surface. Then there will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have thought of a way out?" asked Sark Ahar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. There is atomic energy. I have a theory</seg><seg type="columnLine">which with a good deal of careful experimenting may</seg><seg type="columnLine">result in its release. With the inexhaustible power</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained in the atoms of all substances at our command</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is no doubt that we could both heat and light our</seg><seg type="columnLine">world very adequately. Great spheres of white-hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">disintegrating matter supported on towers all along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">courses of the canals would free us forever from de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendence on the sun. But can we control such a mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">force? Once started anywhere on Aerth the process</seg><seg type="columnLine">of disintegration would probably continue until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet had become a globe of incandescent gas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We will find a way, Chief," said Sark Ahar.: "The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">space ship was delivered by the Fallef Company at noon</seg><seg type="columnLine">today. It is on the landing stage now. Are we going</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to start the experiment tomorrow?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AGGAR Ho and Sark Ahar stepped out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevator which had carried them to the landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform at the very pinnacle of the highest tower of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the observatory. Presently they had left the little cupola-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like structure at the top of the shaft. The platform was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flat, metallic square about two hundred feet each</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. A light, icy breeze swept through the morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky. It blew against the bodies of the two men rump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling their silky fur wrappings. There was an exhilarat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing tang in it. The altitude of the tower was fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">two thousand feet, and the view from its summit was</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnificent. Below them toward the west the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see the great city of Panenbu, with its countless</seg><seg type="columnLine">multicolored spires, gleaming under the morning sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shine, The streets were thronged with midgets going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work--still ignorant of the danger that threatened</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Toward the east beginning at the base of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great observatory building was a strip of cultivated land</seg><seg type="columnLine">about eight miles wide. It was faintly green with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earliest growth of a grass-like cereal called telth, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water coming down throughout the subterranean</seg><seg type="columnLine">conduits from the melting north polar snows had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived three weeks before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond the band of telth, the Aerthian wilderness</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched off to the far horizon. Except for the count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less dunes of yellow sand, it was almost as flat as a table</seg><seg type="columnLine">top. It was the bottom of what had once been the At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantic Ocean.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything in view was harshly clear cut, even in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great distance. Above arched the deep lapis-lazuli dome</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sky. Here and there in it a saucy star twinkled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Occasionally a torpedo-shaped aircraft would glide</seg><seg type="columnLine">noiselessly past the tower carrying a group of furry men</seg><seg type="columnLine">to some distant city. The sun would glint on its silvery</seg><seg type="columnLine">hull, and on the queer numerals mounted on its prow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aggar Ho and Sark Ahar walked over to the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the landing stage. Here, supported by a funnel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaped cradle was a big shiny sphere about seventy-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in diameter. There was a row of circular windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">running horizontally around its circumference. Four</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylindrical objects, looking like some kind of search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights, were set at equal intervals around its lower hemis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere. They pointed slantingly downward at an angle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of forty-five degrees with the platform. The globe was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a space-fiier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aggar Ho opened an oval door in the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft. The two men ascended a short flight of metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps to the central chamber of the ship. The room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was lighted by port holes set all around its walls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was packed with a bewildering outlay of scientific appa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ratus. At one side, before a large window, was the pilot</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat, and in front of it, a number of levers and a board</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing many dials and instruments. It was by means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these that the flier was controlled. The remainder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the floor space was occupied by machinery and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vices, and constituted a complete laboratory for explor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the inner secrets of atomic structure. In the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room, supported by a sort of tripod, was a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">object which looked like a big pressure kettle. Many</seg><seg type="columnLine">cables and wires led to it from a bank of cylindrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanks which were filled with a fluid that supplied an elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ATOMIC FIRE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">trical circuit of enormous voltage and amperage. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a work-bench running almost completely around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls of the laboratory, and on it were ranged many</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd instruments. There were queer microscope-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">devices for watching the electrons of atoms rotating in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their orbits; there were big glass globes for producing</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange rays; there were several electric furnaces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lathes and other machinery for turning out new ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus whenever it was needed. Besides there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitude of other things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Aggar Ho seated himself in the pilot's chair while</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Sark Ahar stood beside him. The old Martian shifted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a little lever on the control-board. A low musical hum</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">started from somewhere in the hulk of the ship; in spite</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of its faintness, it was somehow suggestive of an enor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mous and mysterious power. Now the space flier was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shooting upward. It swayed a little. The two men felt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their weight apparently increase; just as though they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were going upward on a fast elevator. The four re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pulsion-ray projectors, mounted on the bottom hemis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">phere of the craft, were sending powerful beams of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">energy downward and were raising the big globe from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Details on Aerth's surface were growing rapidly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">smaller and the field of view was broadening out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Panenbu, with its narrow encircling ring of vegetation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spreading out like a vast disc on the desert, was rapidly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">becoming a toy city. It seemed to drift toward the west,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for the fliers were hurtling eastward with terrific vel-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ocity. Limitless sandy plains were coming into view,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all gleaming and desolate under the morning sunshine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Panenbu disappeared beneath the horizon. Now and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">then thin ribbons of vegetation running from pole to pole</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would be seen, traced like tautly drawn strings across</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the wilderness. Now Aerth looked like a great relief</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">map, and now it began to take on a slight outward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">curvature. The scientist and his subordinate were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rapidly drawing away from their planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">.... "That was a fine start. Chief," said Sark Ahar. "The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ship is gaining altitude faster than I ever saw a space</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">craft do before at the outset. But I suppose you have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to expect such performance from any new invention of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Fallefs. Everything they produce is wonderful."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Aggar Ho turned toward his young assistant. His</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">face was screwed up into a grimmace which Sark Ahar</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">recognized as a disdainful smile. "It was I who in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vented the new repulsion-ray concentrator that makes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the rapid acceleration of this space ship possible. I sold</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Fallef the rights. Fallef's bungling assistants certainly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would never have thought of the idea." Aggar Ho</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">paused for a moment. Finally he said: "You may</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sleep now, Sark Ahar. In four hours I will call you to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">take charge of the craft."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The younger man climbed the spiraling metal star to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the upper compartment. Here was a little kitchen, a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">room full of supplies, and a chamber with four berths</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in it. Sark Ahar tumbled into one and was quickly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">asleep. Since he had assisted his chief in his work the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">night before he had, of course, not slept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Aggar Ho, seated before the control-board watching</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dials, meters, diminishing Aerth, and the star-shot sable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of empty space, mused softly: "He is a fine young</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Aerthian, Sark Ahar--a native, born of natives, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yet clever--very clever. Sometimes I almost think he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will become a scientist. But that would be odd. There</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hasn't been a man of great wisdom among their race</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for millions of years. They were a great people before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">my ancestors came but our superior knowledge robbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them of all initiative. It is too bad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE musical ringing of a little bell at his ear told</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sark Ahar that his rest period was over. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed out of his berth and joined Aggar Ho. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at a meter on the control board.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thirty thousand miles," he read aloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," returned the Martian. "By the time your four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours on duty is over, allowing for acceleration, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be eighty thousand miles from Aerth. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will stop. During our experiment on atomic energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will travel in an orbit that distance from the planet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The World Council has decreed it. They fear that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">may destroy Aerth if we work on its surface, and well</seg><seg type="columnLine">they may, for we are playing with a dangerous thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Call me when it is time. Good night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aggar Ho retired and the young Aerthian took his</seg><seg type="columnLine">place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sark Ahar stared at the star-strewn circle of blackness</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him. There was little to do but think, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlling of the ship was, for him, almost automatic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Except when now and then a small meteorite struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">impenetrable force-shield of the craft and made it sway</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little, there was no movement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The death of the world!--within a month! Aggar</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ho had predicted it and he, Sark Ahar, had checked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculations. The Martian as usual was right. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were wonderful, those Martians--especially Aggar Ho.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wasn't it he who had engineered the building of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great Than Taxa canal running a distance of more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten thousand miles over Aeath's surface? W'asn't it</seg><seg type="columnLine">he who had extended man's natural span of life to more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a thousand years? Aggar Ho was great, but here</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last was his defeat. What if he did release and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol atomic energy? There wouldn't be time to build</seg><seg type="columnLine">the towers and spheres he had talked about. Like every</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of his race, Aggar Ho had pluck--he'd fight against</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason. That was just what he was doing now. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was useless. The inhabitants of Aerth would freeze to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death unless someone thought of something else. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to think. But no, that wasn't sense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After an hour or so the moon came along and drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the flock of stars that had been shining at Sark</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ahar through the observation window. It was only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little more than half illuminated. The sun was toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left of it and wasn't visible from where the Aerthian</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat. The satellite seemed a little larger than when</seg><seg type="columnLine">viewed from the planet, and its empty plains gleamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an almost blinding intensity. Sark Ahar studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. His keen eyes could even make out a few big</seg><seg type="columnLine">craters. It was a funny world--the moon--all jagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cut up and deserted. Sark Ahar had been there</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice with his chief. Clad in oxygen helmet and heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">armor, he had enjoyed wandering through its empty val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leys and climbing into its lonely craters. Around Tycho</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were the remains of an extensive irrigation system</seg><seg type="columnLine">built by the last of the Lunarians to make use of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost vanished water supply. Those Moon Men had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become extinct before there were human beings on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aerth. What good was the moon now? It was just a</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless derelict of space, desolate and lifeless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Aggar Ho returned from his nap he ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">his subordinate to shut off the power. As he had pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicted, the craft was eighty thousand miles from Aerth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its'momentum would, of course, carry it a little beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">this point, but the gravitational pull of the planet would</seg><seg type="columnLine">68</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">drag it back; and during the course of the experiment</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would revolve as a little satellite of Aerth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately the two men set to work on their seem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly hopeless task. The cover was removed from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great caldron-like furnace and an odd set of metallic</seg><seg type="columnLine">plates was placed inside, together with a small quantity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mercury. Then the cover was replaced and the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhausted from the interior by means of a small electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">pump. For a whole day a current with titanic voltage</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strength crackled between the plates. Aggar Ho</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Sark Ahar, wearing thick goggles and hiding behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead shields, which alone saved their lives from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous emanations, watched the white-hot inferno</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a little quartz window set in the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnace. The whole ship fairly reeked with heat, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meters' registered an enormous consumption of</seg><seg type="columnLine">power. Finally Aggar Ho threw the great switches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The light slowly faded from the plates. The first at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt had been a failure. Mercury had refused to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">up its atomic energy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The plates were changed and another substance was</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed in the furnace--this time silicon. Another trial</seg><seg type="columnLine">was made--also without any hint of success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Day after day the same soul-searing work went on-</seg><seg type="columnLine">new elements, new compounds, new plates, new voltages</seg><seg type="columnLine">--all to no avail. And always that big black cloud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate that was going to blot out the sun crept nearer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer. The two experimenters watched its progress in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the view-plate of their radio vision instrument. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures were radioed direct from the observatory at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Panenbu. Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, twelve days--</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly the time of darkness crept closer. It was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pluck and self-control resulting from ages of scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tific race training that kept all Aerth from going mad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were thousands of scientists working on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem of saving Aerth, and almost all of them sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the means of doing so in atomic energy. None believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was any hope, even if the mighty power were</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered, but all kept doggedly on. Aggar Ho and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sark Ahar sighted several experimental ships like their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own, and they talked to the occupants of over nine</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred of them by radio. Never was the slightest hint</seg><seg type="columnLine">of success reported.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT last the day when darkness was to fall upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">. solar system came. Sark Ahar and Aggar Ho</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the approach of the shadow through the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows of their ship. To a casual observer there would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been nothing very awful about the thing. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only evidence of its presence was the apparent absence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stars in a small portion of the heavens. Gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the cloud crept on, other stars were blotted out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of these which had been hidden reappeared. To all</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearances the blackness was moving with utmost slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, but in reality it was tearing along at a terrific rate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Always it crept closer to the sun. Presently it touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the glowing red disc, and then for thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours the light of the old luminary was slowly fading.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For five hours after that a grayish, scarcely visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminosity continued to come from it, but at last even</seg><seg type="columnLine">that disappeared. On Aerth the lights of the scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities glowed as patches of dim radiance. Except for</seg><seg type="columnLine">these, the planet was entirely invisible. Only the icy</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars gleamed on unchanged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reports of the progress of things on Aerth came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two experimenters by radio:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sun motors stopped. Stored power will last for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several days," was the first report after the coming of</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To all appearances there was little panic. The people</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shut themselves in their homes and were waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">resignedly for their end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost all the experimenters had given up the quest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had returned to their native cities. Aggar Ho and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sark Ahar were among the few who remained out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">space. They were working like two demons just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been working for a month. They would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give up soon for their supply of power was low.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two days after the coming of the cloud the report</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the space-ship: "The atmosphere of the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">is freezing. It is falling like snow. In many places</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole communities have been frozen to death. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">stored solar energy may keep a few people alive for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short time, but the end cannot be far off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aggar Ho was fruitlessly examining the instruments</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the roaring ray furnace. There was a mixture</seg><seg type="columnLine">never before tried, between the plates. Presently he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned toward the younger man who was standing be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side him. The old Martian was slowly shaking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. Sark Ahar scrutinized his chief carefully. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see that his big eyes were watery and blood-shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that his rumpled fur looked unusually shabby. Lack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sleep and continuous labor had certainly done him no</seg><seg type="columnLine">good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You had better rest," said Sark Ahar. "I will watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the furnace. Perhaps when you awaken, the problem</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be solved."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aggar Ho smiled sadly. "Perhaps," he said, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, after a paUse, "Thank you, my boy." He tramped</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearily up the spiral stairs, his magnetic boots which</seg><seg type="columnLine">served to hold him to the steel floor in the absence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity making a clattering noise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he was gone Sark Ahar took a single perfunc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory look at the instruments, satisfying himself that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they registered nothing of importance. Then he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to the pilot seat at the side of the chamber and sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on it. He turned it around on its swivel so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could look toward the experimental apparatus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sark Ahar was extremely tired, but still he musn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep. He must watch for results--results that never</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually the monotonous crackling of the furnace</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the steady drone of the electrical machinery worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him. He grew drowsy. Nothing mattered to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fagged brain any more. The world was doomed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't have to watch those dials. He slumped far over</seg><seg type="columnLine">one arm of the pilot seat. His outflung hand bumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly against a tiny lever that gleamed brightly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship's control board under the cold light of a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass illuminating globe set in the ceiling. The catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lever was released and the 'pring that was at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tached to it made it snap into a jew position. A low</seg><seg type="columnLine">musical droning almost smothered by the noise of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnace set in. The ship gave a slight lurch. Its pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelling machinery was running at full capacity, sending</seg><seg type="columnLine">it hurtling across space. But Sark Ahar did not notice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was fast asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For hours he slept. Odd dreams flitted through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain. Devils and imps and what not danced and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimaced before his mind's eye. He saw the moon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he saw lurid flames suddenly leap out of it. Finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dreamed that he, a noted scientist, had invented a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ATOMIC FIRE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanical man--a great metal giant with fanged jaws,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taloned hands and flaming eyes. He dreamed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant had turned upon him--was going to kill him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt its hot claws around his throat and its fiery breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sark Ahar awoke with a start. His dream had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">part reality. The chamber was glowing like a white hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">inferno, and flickering black shadows of fantastic pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of apparatus were dancing on the walls. The light in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the illuminating globes had somehow died out. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">young Aerthian could hear a thunderous roar quite dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinct from the noise the furnace had once produced. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was louder and more terrible. The air all about was</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrifically hot. It scalded Sark Ahar's lungs. Ther^</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a vapor in it---a strange fiery gas. He could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, slender pencilings of it reaching over and under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick lead shields around the furnace like the tentacles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a luminous octopus. Luckily for him he was behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of those lead shields; if he had not been, the deadly</seg><seg type="columnLine">emanations would have killed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What had happened ? Atomic energy! Atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy at last! The words fairly shrieked through his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain. But what of it? It was too late to do anything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Besides, that terrific power couldn't be controlled. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost forgotten that. It couldn't be controlled!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He grabbed a long buckler-like sheet of lead which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hand-grip on one side of it. It was convex and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as tall as a mart* and resembled the shields which archers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a forgotten antiquity had used. It would protect</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from the dangerous rays.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He held it out in -front of him and peered through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glazed peep-hole which was on a level with his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The bottom of the furnace must have melted away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a dazzling mass of bluish incandescence vis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible beneath the lead shields around the caldron-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of apparatus. It was hissing and spitting like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">violently active chemical. The steel floor was burning!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And the atomic fire was spreading--consuming every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in its path! In a few minutes the whole ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a fiery mass of incandescence!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sark Ahar stared wildly about. What should he do?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Try to save himself, try to save Aggar Ho? It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">better to freeze than to burn to death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eyes fell on the dials of the control board.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though Aerth's satellite was now, of course, invisible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could tell by the delicate instruments that the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hurtling along at a terrific rate only five thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles from the moon! Its course was parallel to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunar surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A CRAZY idea, that marked him forever as a genius,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to Sark Ahar. How it was born no man</seg><seg type="columnLine">may tell. Quick as a flash he gripped the steering lever</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swung it around a full quarter turn. The space</seg><seg type="columnLine">flier lurched, then it swung inward and headed straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the moon, falling more and more rapidly every</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aggar Ho!" shrieked Sark Ahar, "Come down!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quick! You do not wish to burn!" Carefully manipu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lating his big protecting shield so that it was always</seg><seg type="columnLine">between him and the rapidly spreading conflagration at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the room, Sark Ahar made his way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiral stairway. He saw the old scientist descending.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get a lead shield in the upper store-room, Aggar</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ho," ne cried. "Else yon will be killed by the rays.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Come quickly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment the Martian was with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They followed another downward leading spiral and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found themselves in a cylindrical room that housed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny torpedo-shaped space-flier, Sark Ahar opened a</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular door in the side of the craft and thrust the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist unceremoniously inside. He followed closely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slamming the door behind him. He dropped into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot seat. A turn of a knob, and a door at one end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tubular chamber that housed the space-boat opened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a moment the little craft glided gracefully out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open, free from the blazing sphere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sark Ahar allowed the globe to get fully a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles ahead of him in its headlong rush moon ward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then at a safe distance he followed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned toward Aggar Ho, who was in the passen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger seat behind him, "I think I have saved Aerth, Chief,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. There was a broad smile on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Saved Aerth?" returned Aggar Ho. "What do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean? I see that we have released the power which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we sought, but that will do us no good now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watch for a little while, Chief," said Sark Ahar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the next minute and a half the sphere became a</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe of blue-white fire, and presently, after the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aerthians had followed it in its fall for about three</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand miles, it exploded, sending out its flaming frag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments cone-wise toward the moon. The lunar surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">two thousand miles below was dimly visible by their</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. The pieces of the space-ship glowed brighter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued their headlong descent. Still Sark Ahar</seg><seg type="columnLine">dove after them. In a few minutes the fragments</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed into the satellite, scattering themselves over</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain, crater and dead sea bottom. Nor did their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire die out! It increased in intensity fed by the fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand which covered most of the moon. It was spread-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing rapidly, enveloping everything in its path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sark Ahar was smiling. "Do you understand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aggar Ho had completely forgotten his habitual calm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I do!" he cried. "You meant to kindle an atomic fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the moon and make it take the place of our sun!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And you have succeeded!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two men returned to Aerth. Within three days</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon's surface had become entirely incandescent. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">week later Aerth was much the same as it had been for</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of years except that the spring crops had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed and almost half of the population had per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished. But nature quickly mends and forgets such</seg><seg type="columnLine">calamities. In the long course of cosmic history they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are common.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since the moon travels slowly in its orbit in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction that Aerth revolves, the days were, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trifle longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aggar Ho predicted correctly that in fifty years the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun would absorb its enveloping cloud, and would shine</seg><seg type="columnLine">with greater intensity than it had for countless ages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten thousand years afterward, throngs of eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">travelers still came to Panenbu to view a majestic work</seg><seg type="columnLine">of art which awoke in them admiration for a great man</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the past. At the pinnacle of what had once been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landing tower of the observatory stood a colossal</seg><seg type="columnLine">statue. Across its breast was ingraved the inscription:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is Sark Ahar, native Aerthian who saved Aerth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The End.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Too Many Boards</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By Harl Vincent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Author of "Barton's Island," "The Seventh Generation," etc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HY not take your medicine and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">it over with, Larry?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The words were gently spoken by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arthur Hovey, who sprawled lazily</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a divan in his friend's luxuriously</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointed apartment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Laurence Conover cut short his restless pacing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed a half-smoked cigarette in the already heaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">tray.

She flushed as prettily as ever when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she pressed his fingers, and he plunged headlong into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the subject of his chaotic thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Una," he blurted forth, "1 love you, and I want you</seg><seg type="columnLine">TOO MANY BOARDS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">73</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for my wife.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eugenics department was incorruptible. Besides, it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been done two days ago.

Suddenly he stopped in his tracks--he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been walking the floor again, he realized shamefacedly--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wrinkled his brow in thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Una regarded him kindly and sympathetically from</seg><seg type="columnLine">where she sat. She was as crushed as he, but, being a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, was more resigned. Her heart ached more for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larry than for herself, and she longed to pillow his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head on her knees and mother him. He was such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">big overgrown boy!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say!"

"Are you game to elope with me?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Elope? We can't. It is impossible to be legally</seg><seg type="columnLine">married in either Earth, Venus, or Mars. Where else</seg><seg type="columnLine">is there to go-?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mercury!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Larry!

It's just the opposite. I've a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">good friend, Chic Davis, who's captain of the Rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">III, one of the Tri-planetarian liners.

They've</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a real democratic government there and aren't members</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Alliance only because it's their own desire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain aloof.

The captain was enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining a much excited couple in his cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE was consternation in the despatching room</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Tri-planetarian Transportation Boardin Wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ington. The Rocket III had long since left her berth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the engineers in charge had observed her progress</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the chart for more than ten million miles. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tiny light-point of red that traveled so slowly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue-white representation of the earth's orb flickered</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went out. Frantic efforts to raise the ships hyper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">optophone failed utterly, and the chief despatcher made</seg><seg type="columnLine">haste to report the calamity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every available space-ship of the terrestrial govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment was pressed into service and the liners of the Tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetarian system already in transit were advised by</seg><seg type="columnLine">optophone to keep close watch for the wanderer. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">little hope was entertained of locating the vessel in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner. In the vastness of space even the largest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">liners was an infinitesimal mite, and, with its opto in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">operative, became but one of myriads of tiny bodies that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtled through the blackness at enormous speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The nature of the disaster which had overtaken the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rocket III could but be conjectured. Nothing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort had occurred during more than thirty years of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued interplanetary service. Great fear there was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">official circles that the vessel's fuel compartment had</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploded. Though such an accident was deemed highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">improbable, it was not beyond the bounds of possibility,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was an undoubted fact that something of a seri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous nature had happened to the mighty vessel of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Efforts were made to keep the news of the disaster</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the public, but, as is usually the case, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a leak. Within a very few hours the public and private</seg><seg type="columnLine">news optos throughout the world blared forth the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">credible tidings. Frantic relatives and friends of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than twelve hundred passengers and three hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of the crew besieged the various departments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the terrestrial government in Washington for con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmation or denial of the terrible news. In the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">levels of the great cities, the public squares were jammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with horror-stricken humanity, waiting in vain for</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite assurance from the news announcers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hour after hour the vigil was kept and eventually the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reports of the government scouting ships commenced</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming in. But these held forth nothing of hope. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was but one chance in many millions that trace of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost ones would ever be uncovered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the officials of the Board refused to give up their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel as lost, though hoping against hope. Its captain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Charles Davis, was the most resourceful and experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enced in the service. They could not conceive of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as unequal to any emergency which might have arisen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ON the planet Mercury an unusual conference was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in progress in the executive chambers, or Dairofa,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Luzan, the capital city of the realm. In the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaza before the palace there rested a space ship of</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange design, a small and sleek craft that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the subject of discussion throughout the city during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the twelve aka (about six and one-half earth days) since</seg><seg type="columnLine">its arrival from afar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The huge blood-red disc of the sun shone hotly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon, its almost horizontal rays making of the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">a motley of sweltering high lights and dark shadows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rose tinted mists hung low over all, effectually obscur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the heavens above. It was always thus in Luzan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun never leaving the horizon entirely, but circling</seg><seg type="columnLine">it once in every, eighty-eight earth days and alternately</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising to a point that exposed the lower rim of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous disc, then sinking to a point where the top-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most edge just peeped through the mists above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">undulating line of demarcation between land and sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly there came from above a fearsome sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a screaming roar that brought the populace to the streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the officials and their subordinates from the palace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once, twice, thrice, the sky was shot with a blinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">stab of light. A huge shape swung into view through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mists. Another and larger space ship! A moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">it poised at the edge of the plaza, then swooped to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing and rolled slowly to a lumbering stop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The assembled Mercurians stared agape when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main port was opened and the gangplank lowered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Never before had one of the huge liners of the Tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetarian Alliance made actual landing on the globe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Murmurs of surprised interest greeted the appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the only three visitors to disembark from the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel--a girl, a young woman of fragile and delicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">mold by Mercurian standards, and two men who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">likewise of terrestrial littleness in stature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AREFUL now, you two," Chick Davis warned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Una and Larry edged gingerly along the gang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plank, "it'll take you a little time to get used to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lesser gravity and rare air. Though you weigh less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a third of what you do on earth, the slightest effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">will exhaust you here. So, just take it easy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Una laughed nervously. "I feel as though I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">leap across the plaza," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You could--nearly," agreed the captain, "'but, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">your lungs are accustomed to the change and your heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the extra load imposed by the scarcity of oxygen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd better not try anything of the kind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say Chick," exclaimed Larry, "that's a terrestrial</seg><seg type="columnLine">government ship over there. Wonder what's up?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Probably they've been searching for us since our</seg><seg type="columnLine">optophone went out of commission. Guess I'll be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an argument after a bit. But they can't prove any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. That reminds me too--better find the trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and report our whereabouts." Captain Davis</seg><seg type="columnLine">winked and grinned as Larry turned a scared face to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They'll discipline you, Chick."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let 'em. I wouldn't have missed this for anything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've had a circus on this trip. And I guess I can square</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself."'</seg><seg type="columnLine">TOO MANY BOARDS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">75</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Una drew back suddenly in alarm, grasping Larry</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pointing a trembling finger. "Look!" she gasped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's John Mills!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was incredible, but true. On the platform facing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plaza there stood a group of Mercurian officials</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with them were four terrestrials. One of these,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pudgy human with ruddy countenance, was undoubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly John X. Mills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Larry groaned, then stiffened in anger. "Miserable</seg><seg type="columnLine">swine!" he snarled. "Been spying on me and learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">my plans ! I'll show him !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So quickly did he move in the direction of the tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umphantly leering financier that his leap carried him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance of thirty or more feet. He lost his balance</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sprawled ignominiously at the edge of the platform.</seg><seg type="columnLine">John X. Mills laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chick Davis was at Larry's side in an instant, and, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he helped him to his feet he hissed, "Keep your shirt on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you idiot! We're in a jam. Got to be diplomatic."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Una hurried to join them, her breath coming in pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful gasps. She wanted to cry. Larry grumbled sheep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishly as she made nervously ineffectual attempts to dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">his clothes with her handkerchief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Davis strode to the center of the platform</seg><seg type="columnLine">and faced the Dairo, president of the Mercurian high</seg><seg type="columnLine">council, speaking rapidly in Termarven, the universal</seg><seg type="columnLine">language which had been developed when interplanetar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ian communication was first accomplished in 1988.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your excellency," said Chick, "I am captain of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rocket III. A disarrangement of our electrical system</seg><seg type="columnLine">partially crippled the vessel and it was necessary for us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to land here to make repairs. Meanwhile I learned that</seg><seg type="columnLine">these two young people of our world were endavoring to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape persecution in their own land. They wish to</seg><seg type="columnLine">marry but cannot on account of one of our rigid laws--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Eugenics Act, with which you are undoubtedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar. I beg of you that they be permitted to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">their home here and to wed in accordance with your</seg><seg type="columnLine">laws. They freely renounce allegiance to the terrestrial</seg><seg type="columnLine">government."	*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I remember you, Captain Davis," replied the Dairo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You have visited us before, though you have never</seg><seg type="columnLine">honored us by landing your vessel. But I cannot ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cede to your request."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can not? There is no treaty. Mercury is inde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendent of the Tri-planetarian Alliance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True. But a minor agreement has just been signed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with representatives of your government. We have</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed that all terrestrials who might visit our globe</seg><seg type="columnLine">are returnable at the demand of your government and</seg><seg type="columnLine">are subject to your laws for so long a time as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain with us. However, if your ambassador agrees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will welcome this man and woman."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Larry understood Termarven but imperfectly and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared from one to the other of the speakers in uncer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainty. Una clung desperately to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Dairo indicated one of the four terrestrials, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pompous individual who bowed ceremoniously at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">acknowledgment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hjalmar Nordstrum, Captain," he said, in English,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"at your service."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You heard?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I heard. Captain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He lies!" croaked Mills. But Nordstrum frowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">him into silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Captain," said the ambassador, "it is impossible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grant your request. As you know, we have been trying</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for years to come to an understanding with the Mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curians and this mission of mine is the latest attempt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It has succeeded thus far, and the preliminary treaty is</seg><seg type="columnLine">an entering wedge that we can not afford to nullify by</seg><seg type="columnLine">an immediate violation of one of its provisions. I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">further remind you, Captain, that you are subject to</seg><seg type="columnLine">disciplining for landing your vessel here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll take care of that, Mr. Ambassador. But, may I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask you who was the instigator of this special mission--</seg><seg type="columnLine">who wrote this clause?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Why--why-" The ambassador flushed and John</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">X. Mills coughed warningly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ha! I thought so!" Chic Davis glared at Mills</seg><seg type="columnLine">belligerently, then disdainfully at Nordstrum. "No</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder the Mercurians have always refused to treat</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us, when our government sends such as you to deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them. Don't see why they listened this time."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sir! I'll have you broken for this! I--I--" The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambassador was sputtering with rage. Mills grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm and whispered in his ear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Larry was doing his best to comfort Una, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried her head on his shoulder. The Mercurians</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched silently, the Dairo stretched to his full seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet of dignified stature, arms folded across his broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I demand their arrest!" shouted Mills. "The girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Laurence Conover. They are fugitives from jus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tice. Attempting to evade both the Compulsory Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riage Act and the Eugenics Act. I'll appear against</seg><seg type="columnLine">them before the Boards."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ambassador nodded agreement and the remain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing two terrestrials advanced toward Una and Larry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashing badges of the Secret Service. Larry's muscle</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensed in his fury and Una gripped him more tightly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't dear," she whispered, "Please--for my sake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It'll only be worse for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chick Davis paused uncertainly, then turned on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels and rapidly made for his vessel, covering the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tervening distance with a peculiar shuffling lope that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was admirably adapted to the gravity conditions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Chick! Chick!" called Larry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But his friend continued on his way. Bitterly Larry</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him go. He'd deserted him, and in the time of</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest need. But, after all, what could he do?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Larry's muscle relaxed and Una sighed her relief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The officers were upon them and she had been horrified</seg><seg type="columnLine">at thought of the result of resistance on his part.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">" A MOMENT please," asked the Dairo. "Do I</seg><seg type="columnLine">A understand that these two are to be arrested and</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to Terra to stand trial?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is our law, your excellency," replied Nordstrum.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"A strange law it is that separates lovers so obviously</seg><seg type="columnLine">suited to one another. But I presume that your solons</seg><seg type="columnLine">know best. I do not profess to understand, but would</seg><seg type="columnLine">know more regarding the circumstances. Shall we re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tire to the Dairofa and discuss the case in detail?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As you wish, excellency." The ambassador was</seg><seg type="columnLine">chagrined, but could do naught but acquiesce. Mills</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidgeted and fumed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Larry pricked up his ears over the Dairo's speech. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sympathy of this president of the Mercurian council</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him renewed' hope. He would present his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">case. There still might be some way in which that</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed treaty could be abrogated. But that forlom</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope was quickly blasted when the Dairo addressed them</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his place at the head of the council table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">76</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The treaty stands," he said. "It has been officially</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed and sealed. But I feel that we are entitled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the facts of this unfortunate case. Our people will</seg><seg type="columnLine">question the justice of such a procedure as is proposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and apparently necessary. We must be prepared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfy them as to the wisdom of our judgment in carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on this and future negotiations with the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">planets."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We understand, honored Dairo," smiled the ambas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sador. His precious agreement was safe. "But I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask Mr. Mills to give to you the complete history of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair. I am unfamiliar with the details."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> John X. Mills cleared his throat. This would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat difficult, as he spoke no Termarven and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to tell his story to the interpreter. The members</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Mercurian council cast solemn yet kindly glances</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Una and Larry when Mills pointed an accusing fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger at the couple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These two--" he began. But there came an inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruption.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A page advanced hurriedly to the council table and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Dairo motioned Mills into silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Captain Davis," announced the page, "demands ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mittance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Dairo brightened. "Send him in," he ordered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The conversation was in the Mercurian tongue and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mills stood perplexedly silent. But Larry had caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the name of his friend and guessed at the meaning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interruption. He squeezed Una's hand joyfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Good old Chick! He hadn't left them after all. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow he felt that things would happen quickly now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Chick Davis advanced to the council table with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad grin on his face. He was accompanied by two</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrestrials, a man and a woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Larry craned his neck to see who they were. Art</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hovey! Why, the big stiff! He had been on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rocket III--and never looked up his friend. What did</seg><seg type="columnLine">it mean? And the girl! Alta Farrish! He blinked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes in amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Alta!" gasped John X. Mills, "what are you doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">here ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is what I intended asking you." She smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweetly, but it seemed that she drew a bit closer to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of Arthur Hovey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Larry was completely mystified. But he felt an</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost uncontrollable impulse to laugh aloud in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">great domed chamber. One more shock like this and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mills would surely die of apoplexy. His purpled fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures and bulging eyes would have made a horse laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The irate financier forgot himself. He forgot that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was in the presence 'of the nobility and the highest</seg><seg type="columnLine">authority of a strange planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean?" he roared. "Am I not your</seg><seg type="columnLine">legal guardian? Who gave you permission to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">home? Answer me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Dairo frowned in annoyance, but he did not in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terfere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Art Hovey stepped forward, keeping Alta in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">background. "You are speaking to my wife, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mills," he said quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a momentary silence. Then John X.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mills far outdid his previous efforts. He shook his fist</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the face of the young man who had so calmly an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced the preposterous affront to his authority. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranted and stormed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Dairo pounded vigorously for silence. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrestrial was insufferable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ambassador Nordstrum spoke sharply to his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patriot and Mills subsided, mopping his perspiring brow</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a large silk handkerchief. He wished he had these</seg><seg type="columnLine">two youngsters at home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">" \ MBASSADOR," asked the Dairo, "will you be</seg><seg type="columnLine">l\ so kind as to request the young people to present</seg><seg type="columnLine">their side of the story? It seems to be much involved."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nordstrum translated rapidly and Art Hovey stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the table. Larry regarded him in astonishment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Guess he hadn't known his friend as well as he thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Such a transformation he had never considered possible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The usually phlegmatic Art was supremely confident;</seg><seg type="columnLine">dominant; compelling. He directed his remarks at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambassador.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Nordstrum," he said, "you have be^n hood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">winked by Mills. He has used this mission as a means</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a personal end. His sole object in appealing to Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gress at this time was to prevent the marriage of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend to the girl he loves and force him to marry the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman who is now my wife.

This thing was a sorry mess. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly ashamed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know it is true," continued Art, "for I have in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestigated and have learned many things. For years</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have loved Alta Farrish, his ward, but I never courted</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, for Mills had planned her marriage to my dear</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend, Laurence Conover. I thought she cared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and that eventually he would submit to Mills'</seg><seg type="columnLine">wishes. But my friend had other plans and I wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">to help him, so I set about to learn the true state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs. First off, I found that my fondest dreams were</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible of realization. I--" He hesitated and glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his bride for approval. She nodded happily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Anyhow we were married--perfectly in order--A2</seg><seg type="columnLine">classification and everything. But my friend, to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy, must escape the laws of the three outer planets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He planned to settle here in Mercury and found a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach this planet. But I learned that Mills had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching him by means of the detectoscope--had fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed his every movement. So I watched Mills. I dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coverd the machinations he used in engineering this</seg><seg type="columnLine">official mission to the inner planet. So I followed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Rocket III, though my friend did not know I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on board. I wanted to surprise him--here--to be of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some assistance should it become necessary."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Art, you're a brick!" exclaimed Larry. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely credit his senses. To think of Art doping this</seg><seg type="columnLine">out--fooling him !</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I haven't told you the worst." Art paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">dramatically. "Mills not only deceived my friend; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">deceived his ward. The stock he votes in United Syn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thetic Food is but half his own. The other portion is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alta's. He voted it by proxy and has forged papers</seg><seg type="columnLine">which convinced her that he could thus control it until</seg><seg type="columnLine">her marriage. This has been the club he held over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larry Conover and over his ward to force the union he</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned--a union that interested him only because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it would permit him to retain control of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast business he has dominated for so many years."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Liar!" grated Mills.

The mission was already a failure.

Now--didn't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pudgy hands of the financier twitched nervously</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they gripped the arms of the chair.

Wilson</seg><seg type="columnLine">Observatory. There floated the enigmatic nebula of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Andromeda--the huge telescope probing directly toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">it--as if to pluck out the very secret of its being. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose, and paced the confines of the huge room. Under</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty, clean cut in features, he had already earned an</seg><seg type="columnLine">enviable deputation as an astronomer, which had won</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a rovqted place in the world famous observatory.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the very beginning, the great nebula had exercised</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peculiar fascination over him. In some inexplicable</seg><seg type="columnLine">way Standish had always felt that there lay the secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the universe waiting for him in the role of a Perseus</seg><seg type="columnLine">to deliver and bring forth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  In truth, many other contemplative observers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">speculated about that faint, dusty patch of light sprawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">athwart the enchained and enchanted body of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">legendary daughter of Cepheus and Cassiopeia. For cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turies men had pondered in vain, seeking the nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that faint light-cloud which so persistently evaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">their probings. It was not until recently, with the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">advance in the manufacture and use of precision in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struments and telephoto lenses, that the astounding truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been revealed to startled astronomers--this faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimmer in the skies is a great island universe of stars;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	far beyond the confines of our own galaxy--millions on</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions of suns and attendant planets, careening</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the outermost reaches of space-time, so incon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceivably remote that a ray of light traveling 186,000</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles per second would take nearly a million years to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Standish turned once more to the sheaf of photo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graphs. Yes--there was.no doubt about it, the faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">pin-prick of light labeled on the sky charts as 12478,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had himself named Alcoreth, showed an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistakable increase in brightness in this most recent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his photographs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For over a year, on every clear night, he had photo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">graphed the great nebula. The minute pin-pricks of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">light, representing huge stars, had been laboriously</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ticketed and compared. This queer behavior on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">part of Alcoreth, hitherto a placid, ordinary star,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aroused his interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Something interesting happening to the constitution</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of that old lady," Donald remarked to himself, medita-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tively stroking his chin. "I'd better turn the prisms</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on her and see what's going on in her innards to account</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Deftly he adjusted the great spectroscope, and swung</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it on the errant orb. As he gazed, a startled "Whew"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">escaped him. These were not the spectral lines and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bands customarily associated with hot gaseous stars in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">eruption.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "This is becoming more interesting--better verify</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it," he thought. Quickly he took out his series of com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">parison spectra. None of them checked with this spec-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Again he arose, and paced the room. This was evi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dently not a burning sun. Apparently it was a rela-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tively cold mass. What then was it ? Was it shining</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by reflected light? But, he argued with himself, there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was no sun within billions of miles to produce such a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vast outpouring of reflected light. There must be some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other cause for its luminosity. Excitedly Standish</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">paced about. Luminescence--phosphorescence. This</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">must be a world composed of some radio-active mineral!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He strode back to the spectroscope. No, these were not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the characteristic lines of any radio-active mineral known</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to science. Again he took up his restless pacing. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">word phosphorescence brought to his mind pictures of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the fields at night alive with the darting sparks of fire-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flies--of the forests, and the glow of rotting fungus and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">decaying wood--of the tropic seas under the Southern</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Cross, criss-crossed with pallid witch-fires.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He stoppeTd short in his tracks. By George, that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">it! Life forms--protoplasm--under certain conditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">- would become strongly luminescent.

And yet--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet. Try as he would to dismiss the thought from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, it occurred again and again, until it obsessed him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He must check it, and that this very minute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the course of his researches, Standish had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered that by causing the light of luminiferous proto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plasm to pass through a series of gases, the spectroscope</seg><seg type="columnLine">was capable of resolving the constituent elements. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet the process was a guarded secret, but the material</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With trembling hands the astronomer set up four thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">walled transparent chambers, put into each a definite</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantity of a rare gas--different for'each chamber--at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tached them in series to the great spectroscope in such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fashion that the light from Alcoreth passed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, before reaching the prisms that would cause it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to yield up its secret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What an idiot I am to waste my time on such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazy idea!" he scoffed aloud, at the same time looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">around guiltily. "It's damn foolish, all right, but what's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the odds. Let's take a look-see." He inserted a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parison spectrum of the organic elements, carbon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur and phosphorus--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the essentials of life as we know it on this planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With elaborate carelessness, hardly masking his inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">trepidation, he gazed into the aperture.

"Eureka, I have found it !" The cry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Archimedes on making his famous discovery. The im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible was true. The life elements were all present on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that distant star, and what was infinitely more, its spec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trum showed the peculiar arrangement of lines and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bands which his research had shown was invariably as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sociated with living protoplasm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His immediate impulse was to broadcast his discovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the scientific world. But then a thought sobered him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So fantastic a theory would never be accepted unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">supported by impregnable proof. Premature publica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and he would become a laughing-stock. No, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must wait until his spectroscopic research was perfected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the meantime, keep on observing this strange new</seg><seg type="columnLine">world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For three weeks he took innumerable photographs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely pausing for sleep and food. The star increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">in brightness, then tiny streamers shot forth inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mittently, then slowly it waned. From a fifteenth mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nitude star it passed gradually down the scale, till finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">a last plate failed to show any trace of it. Alcoreth was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone, and with her, Standish's hope of everlasting fame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The astronomer was in despair. How now could he</seg><seg type="columnLine">convince the scoffers that he had witnessed the impos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible--a world of living protoplasm!

It was as if the sea had congealed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was making a final triumphant drive for mastery over</seg><seg type="columnLine">its eternal enemy, the land. With the inevitableness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate itself the thing rolled up, enevloping all that op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed it, enfolding the shrieking mobs which tried to flee</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it, and, most horrible of all, digesting them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN New York the streets were packed with pale-faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">throngs. Although every home had its receiver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desire for the companionship of others had sent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire population into the streets. The public loud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">speakers, the newspaper bulletin boards were the nuclei</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the masses. As one item after another of disaster</seg><seg type="columnLine">was broadcast by the news-purveying agencies, a groan</seg><seg type="columnLine">would rise from the crowds and then silence would come</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. For these were silent crowds; the magnitude of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the calamity had stricken the people dumb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Forcing her way through the packed masses and into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hundred story tower which Columbia University</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just occupied, was Mary Cameron. Astounded on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her arrival by the terrific news of calamity, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously intent upon completing her errand and speed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her plane back to her brother. But tremendous diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culties had delayed her. Traffic was well-nigh sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended. It had taken an enormous bribe to persuade a</seg><seg type="columnLine">taxi-driver to undertake the journey from the Governor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Island landing field, through the vehicular tunnel and up</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broadway to the new educational centre in what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been Central Park. Held to a snail-like pace by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses which packed the streets from building line to</seg><seg type="columnLine">building line, the trip had taken hours. But now, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">dusk, she had reached her goal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great building was deserted. But the doors of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an elevator stood open and she could operate the simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism. Swiftly she rose through the hundred floors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this latest apotheosis of education to where, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very tip of the soaring tower, Cameron's home laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">was located. She unlocked the door, and entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Quickly dropping her close-fitting cap and leather</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying suit she began to assemble the bottles and jars</seg><seg type="columnLine">listed on the slip which she had brought from the moun-.</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain retreat she had left the night before. But the strain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of twenty-four hours of flying by sight and of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific scenes she had just witnessed suddenly told on</seg><seg type="columnLine">even her wiry constitution, and she dropped into a chair</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment's rest. She closed her eyes--in a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was sound asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Startled awake by a roar which, ascending from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet below, rattled the windows with the force</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">given it by millions of throats, she found the room glow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with a green and spectral light. The usual murmur</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great, city had changed to a terrific tumult in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which she could sense a terrible agony of fear even at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this Alpine height. She ran to the window. Night had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen, but it was not dark. From far below came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green light, a glowing luminescence, which reminded her</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some rotting fungus which she had one night found in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woods near Cameron's laboratory. The glowing ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terial made a gridiron there beneath, filling the streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">south and west, till it merged in sheets of green flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">where she knew the harbor and the rivers lay. Immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately beneath her the streets were still clear, but bathed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that unearthly light she could see black streams. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cupboard she knew her brother had a pair of binocu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars. Quickly getting them, she focussed them on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black streams. She saw people, thousands, tens of thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands, rushing north, shouting in a frenzy of terror, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, only a little south, the glowing green light pouring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the streets, towering far above the hurrying strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling mobs, moving with incredible swiftness, engulf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the stragglers. The menace had reached New York!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She swept the glasses north whence came a rolling as</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thunder. Far up the Sound she could see flashes--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forts at the upper end of the city were fighting their big</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns. South again, and below, quiet now, the glowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">jelly had filled the streets. New York was dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I'm in a fine fix now! I'm safe enough here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but how am I going to get away. Probably starve to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. Well that's better than being swallowed up by</seg><seg type="columnLine">that thing down there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A terrific crash downtown came to her startled ears;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then almost before she could turn, another, and another.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Down on the tip of the Island, where first Manhattan</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reached toward the sky, there was a clear space</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the 85-story Bank of Manhattan building had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been. Woolworth too was gone, and all the mountainous</seg><seg type="columnLine">structures below. As she gazed she saw the 150-story</seg><seg type="columnLine">City Hall Tower, just completed, sway, then, like some</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant of the forest felled after centuries of growth by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woodman's axe, topple over, and gathering speed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash into the lambent sea which bathed its foot. As it</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the surface of the quivering flood of light there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a tremendous splash, and through the air for hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds of feet flew huge glowing fragments. They fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the roofs and the serried facades of the buildings for</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocks around, and then, to Mary's horror, they spread,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wherever the patches of light lay the sturdy struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures of steel and granite began to melt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God! I'm not so safe after all. The ghastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff eats even the material of which these buildings are</seg><seg type="columnLine">made. I wonder how long this place will last. I guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's finish for me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL this time the yellow sport plane had been rush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing across the continent, sliding down the radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">beacon from New York. Intent on the path ahead, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two leather clad figures bent over the dashboard. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk, for the muffler had been cut out for greater speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No talk, but the thoughts of the two were identical.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's happening in New York? What's happening to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mary? Is she safe?" Over and over these thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">reiterated themselves in the weary brains. These two</seg><seg type="columnLine">great scientists, in whose intellects lay perhaps the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saving of the world, had forgotten everything save that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisp of a girl in New York, sister of one and sweet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart of the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MENACE FROM ANDROMEDA</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">85</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last the Appalachians appeared, passed beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, fell away behind them.

Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty feet from the tower it glided.

"Doug, how close</seg><seg type="columnLine">can we get to that window?" "I'll get within a foot, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll all go to hell together." "Then do it, and I'll get</seg><seg type="columnLine">her out, but first tell her what we plan. Get a flash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light; she knows the Morse Code.

A wave of the brave little hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">signalled understanding.

Down, on a long slant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight for that pinnacle rising sheer ahead. Down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever down, with increasing speed hurtles the plane. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracle of accurate steering, another miracle of perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">timing, and sheer muscular strength are required.

He was beginning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch the drift of Cameron's reasoning. *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Douglas went on. "My plan is this. Have the nations</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world concentrate their technicians and engineers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the power plants and factories most remote from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">menace. Construct huge searchlights of the utmost</seg><seg type="columnLine">candle power; and machines for casting enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">beams of ultra-violet light. In the meantime have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people of the areas endangered by the billowing march</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the monster retreat to the mountain fastnesses. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be done fairly easily--its progress from all reports</seg><seg type="columnLine">is approximately ten to fifteen miles a day. When all</seg><seg type="columnLine">is in readiness, mount our machines on tractors, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive them in front of the encroaching fiend. When it</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes within striking distance, turn on the juice full</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast. The power will come by tuned radio waves from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power plants operating in the hinterland. If our</seg><seg type="columnLine">theories are correct, on the impact of our rays, the viscid</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass will react much more violently than an amoeba</seg><seg type="columnLine">or paramecium would. Retreat would be all it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of, and the more exposed masses would be killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">off. In that way, we could get rid of the menace, or at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least drive it back into the ocean, by following it</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily all the way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Standish got up in enthusiasm, and rung Cameron's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. "Boy, you're a wizard! That's a marvelous</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme! You'll be the savior of the world!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on a moment," Douglas smiled protestingly, "it</seg><seg type="columnLine">may work and it may not. Remember, I'm basing my</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme on your hypotheses."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It'll work all right," retorted Donald confidently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and now I know I'm right, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't run away so fast," warned the bacteriologist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Remember, at the best, we shall only have managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive it back to the ocean.

"There you go--get me all excited,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then you let me down. I forgot that part. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">what's the good of your swell scheme ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah! but I have something else up my sleeve,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned his companion. "You know, of course, that I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">been working my head off trying to find a cure for</seg><seg type="columnLine">cancer. I haven't succeeded as yet--though the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">look is promising. But in the course of my researches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've invented a technique for excising cancer growths</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the living organism, and growing them indepen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently in special culture media. I have also discovered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">method of activating them so that when replaced</seg><seg type="columnLine">in living tissues they will multiply with unbelievable</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidity. At present, I have on hand here in the labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory about fifty pounds of activated cancer cultures, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is sufficient for my purpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now to get back to your theory again. If this visi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation is in truth from an alien world, it is highly im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">probable that it was ever exposed to the disease of can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cer. If that is so, then it lacks whatever immunity our</seg><seg type="columnLine">life has obtained through constant exposure, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cancer cells will spread like wildfire through the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">vast organism--and this malign influence will- be eradi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated from the face of the earth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Man, I repeat--you're a wizard!" The astronomer</seg><seg type="columnLine">pumped his hand violently. Then an idea struck him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But why not spray it with cancer immediately--why</seg><seg type="columnLine">bother with ultra-violet light to drive it into the depths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sea."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because," explained Douglas patiently, "cancer is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">respecter of persons, and once let loose on land, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">liable to spread to all forms of earth life, and we shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">only have succeeded in destroying ourselves too. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean, however, the range is sharply limited--we shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruct the people of the earth to remain inland until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the danger is passed. Once killed, the whole mass will</seg><seg type="columnLine">descend to the floors of the seas and there the cold and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure will destroy the cancerous tissues."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've thought of everything," was the admiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">retort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now to get into immediate communication with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conference chairman and unfold our plan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right--there's not a moment to lose.

"Sounds all right. Our last</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope anyway.

But I have not seen the principles of heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines' enunciated so clearly in any popular</seg><seg type="columnLine">magazine until now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Your remarks about the waste caused by cool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing cylinders, while true, may be a trifle mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading. Be assured that this waste is not of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineers' choice. If they could, they would cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly run their internal combustion engines at</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperatures of 1,000--2,000 degrees and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher. But no lubricant would stand that, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">any metal. If the chemists, of whom you are a</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinguished member, will give us a metal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lubricant to stand extreme heat, we engineers</seg><seg type="columnLine">will quickly build a motor to squeeze evrry possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble bit of energy out of the fuel. And make you</seg><seg type="columnLine">rich, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Speaking of the second law of thermodynamics;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is the reason for high compression motors--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the difference in temperature between the explosion</seg><seg type="columnLine">point and exhaust point of the stroke. The com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression ratio governs here, not the ratio of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore to stroke, etc. We also save heat by run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning a motor fast. The heat has less time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape from the hot gases to the cylinder walls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instead of passing off, it expends itself in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">expansion of the gases.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I could write a whole book on this subject,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I do not mean to dispute your remarks about</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket motors, the simplest and potentially the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most efficient heat engines, the only heat engine</seg><seg type="columnLine">that does not lose efficiency at extreme high speeds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now I have taken your remarks on my profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion with the good nature you intended. May I</seg><seg type="columnLine">say a few words about your business, the editing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a magazine? Reading your reactions to</seg><seg type="columnLine">readers* letters I think that you must rather feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">resentful at critics. This is only human, but I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hope you will know that my remarks and sugges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions are those of a sincere friend and steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">reader of Amazing Stories, which I consider to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be at least equal to the average of scientifiction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Should you be tolerant enough to print my sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestions I'll be greatly interested in whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">you might wish to add, and I'll see it, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">no matter where I am sent by the company, I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">always buy Amazing Stories, even in small</seg><seg type="columnLine">towns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Via the Time Accelerator," by Frank Bridge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The best story in the January number. I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">find no fault with the science of this story, unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">you get right down to narrow facts which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">disqualify about 95 per cent of all scientifiction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Because Bridge looks to me like a "comer/' let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me commend to him that he study the more fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished style of the professional writers who write</seg><seg type="columnLine">for other magazines. "Via the Time Accelerator"</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about 50% spoiled by the slow and amateurish</seg><seg type="columnLine">start. The first page is nothing but pointless</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation, irritating to the busy reader. Page</seg><seg type="columnLine">two is a mess of cockeyed mathematics about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory of time travel, that does not convince and</seg><seg type="columnLine">does not explain how Brockhurst is going to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to work, except something vague about the vi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bration of particles. As vibration itself must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressed in terms of time, so many oscillations</seg><seg type="columnLine">per second, the whole thing makes nothing but</seg><seg type="columnLine">nonsense. It is pseudoscientific gibberish. Also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrary to known fact. Matter, except at absolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">zero, is known to vibrate. Changing the rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">of 'vibration simply changes the etheric radiation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that body, whether that radiation be merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat, or in the case of extremely rapid vibrations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">light. So the time machine, as described, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely have "het up" its inventor and his plane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same as if he sat on a hot stove. All right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you use up two and a half pages getting started,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the story gets down to business about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of page 915, From then it is good, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some new ideas in it. Now if the author had</seg><seg type="columnLine">started like, say, R. F. Starzl in "The Globoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terror" in a recent number, with a tense situ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation right at the start, and followed it up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast action right along, he would have had a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">story as good as "The Globoid Terror," which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite a recommendation. I agree with the reader</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Oklahoma who says Starzl always presents</seg><seg type="columnLine">real science. Every astronomer will tell you that</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions on Venus' north pole are probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as described in "The Globoid Terror."

But the love stuff between Paula and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Prince was unnecessary. In such a story as</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, it will make a lot of readers say, "No Love</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stuff!" when really they have no objection to real</seg><seg type="columnLine">love interest, if it has something to do with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story.

The authors make folly of the word</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth.

A cover, a brightly colored cover,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">caught my eye. I picked it up and leafed through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it. At a glance I knew it was the one I wanted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I got it and read it through, and it was all I could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">do to wait until the next issue was out. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">magazine was Amazing Stories. I have read</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">some other science fiction magazines, but none</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">satisfies me more than Amazing Stories. I have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shown it to some friends and now they are buying it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now, to get down to facts. I write here to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">criticize your (our) magazine just as others do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The cover could not be better. It is perfectly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">colored and the pictures are usually taken from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one of the best stories. Morey is an excellent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">artist and he makes the best cover of all. Paul</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and Wesso are good artists, but I think Morey</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is the best.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Everybody tells their favorite authors, stories,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">etc., so I think I'll follow suit.

I have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">just finished the January number and the story</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ends there. I almost hated for it to stop. Capt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">S. P. Meek is getting better and better each</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">story that he writes. As for the best stories in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the January issue, I classify them as follows:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  1--"Drums of Tapajos"--Excellent. 2--'"She</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Prince of Space"--Extra Good. 3--"Via Ifie</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Time Accelerator"--Extra Good. 4--"Tanks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Under the Sea"--Good. 5--"The Act of Retipuj"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">--Fair. 6--"The Black Hand"--Flair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The stories for the next issue look as if they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were going to be good.

I think it is a good idea myself,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but I would not publish them in Amazing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Stories.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the best artist you ever had'and I believe ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have. To be sure, you had one or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">small illustrations \&gt;y him in the past months, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I see none by him in this otherwise perfect Febru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ary issue.

Jack Williamson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Green Girl" was the best story of the year.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Next came "Skylark Three" and "The Drums</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Tapajos" in a tie for second. The best novel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ette was the "Prince of Space"; another by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Williamson. The stories have improved by leaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bounds throughout the past year. It remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the Quarterly, however, to supply the real</seg><seg type="columnLine">kick of the year. I refer to those great novels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Paradise and Iron," by Dr. Breuer, and "A</seg><seg type="columnLine">Modern Prometheus" by Cyril Q. Wates. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were great. In the fall Quarterly it states that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wesso illustrated the story "The Black Star</seg><seg type="columnLine">Passes." It was done by Paul, and darn well</seg><seg type="columnLine">too.

A couple of his blows landed right heav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily; one in particular denting the .old armor</seg><seg type="columnLine">grievously and, methinks, cracking a rib or two.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, he is still technically unhorsed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main bout--his major thesis of the dud star.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reiteration is neither proof nor argument, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is still sticking to the curved-space-time theory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">worshiping it as the one undoubted and unquestion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able fact.

Also, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">declare that before Mr. Campbell, as a scientist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">can make such positive statements so unequivocally</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerning "possible" and "impossible" things, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be absolutely and mathematically certain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the basic fundamental assumptions upon which his</seg><seg type="columnLine">conclusions rest. And concerning the dud star</seg><seg type="columnLine">his basic assumptions are utterly incapable of</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof--they are theories; really only hypotheses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and far. from being facts. Therefore, unless he</seg><seg type="columnLine">can prove otherwise--something neither Einstein,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jeans, Eddington, nor Millikan has ever attempted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do--I must regretfully insist that Sir Camp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell shall close his pan and let me violate his pet</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory as much as I please 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> However, I do not want this Campbell-Smith</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to degenerate into a polemical, running on</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they do, forever, like Tennyson's "Brook."
