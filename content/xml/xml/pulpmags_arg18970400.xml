            <seg type="columnLine">nobody else had thought of inviting him. Mr. Colgate was the leading mer-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He lived in a great house, surmounted by a hideous mansard roof, capped</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with a gilded railing and surrounded by spacious grounds, dotted here and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">fearful of saying the wrong thing, but her taciturnity was more than atoned</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for by her husband and son.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Hartfield had heard about the Colgates through Elder Brink, and so lie</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had been in a measure prepared for them. He knew that Mr. Colgate was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the financial pillar of the church, of which he and his wife were also mem-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It was the first sermon he had ever preached to a regular congregation.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">His nerves were tingling yet from the force he had thrown into it. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wanted to go back to the quiet parsonage and think it all over by himself, to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">try and realize that he, John Hartfield, was actually embarked on a career</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Colgate liad met him at the station the night before with his carriage.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He had seen that his baggage was taken to the parsonage and in other ways</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had been extremely kind. How tiresome he was, though !</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Fine congregation we had this morning, Mr. Hartfield," he said as they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">walked off together. " You ought to feel complimented, upon my word."</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">"I shall feel more complimented if I have as big an audience tonight.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Curiosity over a novelty accounted for the crowd this morning, you know."</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Colgate winced a little at this. He never went to church at night</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">himself. He considered it beneath his dignity as the leading man of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">village to show himself in public too often. He eased his conscience in this</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">matter by telling the sexton that his well located pew was at the disposal of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">any one who might care to occupy it.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Ha, ha," he laughed now, evading the point at issue. " I see you are</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">exceedingly modest. Well, I suppose that is right for a young man just</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">starting out in life."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The patronage conveyed in these words stung John Hartfield to the quick.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The implication was that Thomas Colgate had earned the right to display</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pride in his achievements. The minister buried the finger tips of his right</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hand deep in his palm and placed his other on his clerical cut vest as if to re-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">adjust his tie. It was at this moment they were passing the Kingsbury</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cottage. Mr. Colgate took off his hat and bowed with more than usual cere-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mony to Mrs. Kingsbury. He wished her not to fail to note that he had the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">new minister's company.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Who is that?" asked Hartfield when they had passed. "She has a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sweet face, that looks as though it had seen a deal of suffering. I noticed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her in church. She seemed to be very attentive."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Colgate turned a sharp look on his companion.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Oh, then you do have time to pay heed to what your congregation is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">doing while you are preaching." He said this half laughingly, but with a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">vivid recollection of his tendency to somnolency about the time " thirdly"</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was reached. Then, without waiting for a reply, he went on: "That is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Kingsbury. Her husband was injured in the war and has been an inva-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lid ever since. They live on his pension."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Yes, Mr. Hartfield," Mrs. Colgate broke in here, "you never saw</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">more devotion than that mother and daughter pay that man. One of them</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Ala thinks she's the prettiest girl in town," Peyton Colgate volunteered</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Colgate proceeded, ignoring the interruption of his son, whose hits of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">slang, it may be stated, did not jar on him as they did on his wife. He had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a feeling that they made the boy more like city bred youths.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">in Newcomb very seldom permitted to pass their lips. And here was the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">prefer slipping off and going up King Street to tell Delia Mullins that the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">new minister was mighty queer, to continuing her walk with him. With a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">short " Good morning, Mr. Hartfield," and more cordial adieux to the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He realized that he had committed an indiscretion, a very trifling one, to be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sure, but he well knew how with one in his position molehills would be mag-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nified into mountains. But by this time they had reached the Colgate place,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and in the pride of displaying its attractions to his guest its owner forgot</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">what had puzzled him in that little speech about actresses.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Here we are," he announced, with as much of a flourish as intonation</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">can give to speech.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Hartfield knew that he was expected to be impressed. And he was--by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the bad taste everywhere visible. The iron groups on the grass, already</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">alluded to, were atrocious enough, but directly in front of the door was an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">immense glazed ball, resting in a tripod and reflecting on its mirror-like sur-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">face a flower bed of fish geraniums laid out in the shape of the letter C and an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">iron bench placed under an evergreen that was more suggestive of a cemetery</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"You have a beautiful lawn, Mr. Colgate," he said.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">This was true. Vulgar love of display could find nothing to work upon</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"But it's a great care, Mr. Hartfield, a great care," rejoined the mer-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">And then he threw open the front door with the air of one who said: " If</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">adorned the walls. The parlor was crowded so full of furniture heavily up-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">holstered that its atmosphere was stuffy almost to suffocation, and Hartfield</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hailed with delight Mr. Colgate's suggestion that Peyton should take the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Peyton Colgate was just eighteen--old enough to think himself a man,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but with not sufficient sense to pass for one. He had been indulged by his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">father from infancy and did pretty much as he liked most of the time. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">never failed to recollect that the "governor" was the "magnate," as he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would have termed it himself, of Newcomb. Consequently he stood in no</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">awe of any one else whom he met in the town. The new minister was young,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">younger looking than he really was, as has been said ; he wore a mustache</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and did not look a bit sanctimonious like old Dr. Bemis, his predecessor in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">charge ; then his remark about actresses had fired Peyton with the determi-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nation to draw him out.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He began the process when he had ushered their guest into a pink and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blue bedroom and pointed to the pitcher and basin on the stand between the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Have you ever been in New York?" he commenced, perching him-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">as he prepared for his ablutions.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Yes," was the guarded answer.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"You quite shocked Miss Tagford by what you said about actresses,"</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">went on Peyton with a laugh. "They're awfully poky in this town.- We</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">never have any shows here except the circus once a year. I s'pose you've</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Before Peyton liad quite finished his question Hartfield had plunged his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">face into the basin of water. When he was in condition for speech again he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">took the initiative and began, to question Peyton about his school, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whether he was going to college or not.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Young Colgate managed to get the lead again on the last named subject,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and as they were going down stairs inquired from what college Hartfield had</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Oh, I went to Columbia," answered the minister after the briefest pos-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sible hesitation--a pause of which Peyton thought nothing at the time.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He decided that Mr. Hartfield was not going to turn out such jolly com-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pany as he thought he might, and much to that gentleman's relief withdrew</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his attentions from him for the rest of his stay at the house.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" So this is jour first charge," said Mr. Colgate patronizingly, as he got</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Hartfield's foot twitched uneasily under the table. He wondered if " the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">three years old and not to a boy of ten. Before he had time to reply Mrs.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" I was born and brought up in New York, Mrs. Colgate. I think I shall</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" But that parsonage is such a great barracks of a place for one man to</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Colgate shook with the laughter this suggestion caused him. Pey-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Hartfield was delighted with the place. There was plenty of room for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the great stac^ of Ixjoks he had brought, and a large apartment on the upper</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">floor which he at once transformed into a gymnasium. Thither he resorted</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">now when he arrived from the Colgates'. Throwing off his coat, he closed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the door and then proceeded to pummel with all his might a sandbag which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he had suspended from the ceiling the night before.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">went slowly down the stairs to the room he had elected to make his study.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He remained here a few moments in quiet meditation, then started as the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ringing of the church bell broke on his ear. He picked up his hat and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Elder Briitk was standing in the churchyard, evidently waiting for him.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I thought you'd feel a little strange about goin' in alone," he said now</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was a trace of familiarity about it, and yet he was sure that he had never seen</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the girl before. She was very young, evidently not yet twenty, but there</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was a sweetness of expression in her face, almost a pathos, that gave to it a</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He made his address, and then, during the half hour assigned for the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Grace told her mother of the pleasant interview she had had with Mr.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Hartfield. Mrs. Kingsbury was both pleased and surprised to hear that he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">So the girl herself thought that night when she went to service. There was</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">hearts. But Grace Kingsbury was alone. She had always been of a retiring</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">disposition. She had many admirers among the youths of Newcomb, but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they all fancied her more than she did them, and as she did not think it honest</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not to show this, they soon ceased the effort to show her attention. Besides,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her whole heart was given to those at home, her invalid father, for whom she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was staff, amanuensis, reader, soother of pain; and the mother was to her like</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a sister almost. She did not feel the need of companionships outside of these</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and of that which her work in the Sunday school furnished her.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Now as she sat there in the short pew the Kingsburys rented, her eyes</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">that made it seem new to her, she was conscious of a strong desire to know</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">better this man who was so different from those with whom she was com-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Even though he had smiled as he spoke there was a sadness in his eyes. She</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wondered if lie had lost his own mother recently. He did not seem like a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Grace gave a guilty start. The sermon was ended in the midst of her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thoughts that had wandered from it to the preacher. She bowed her head</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">After the benediction she started to hurry home, as she always did, but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">half way down the aisle Mrs. Porter stopped her with a message to take to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her mother about the sewing society. While she was talking with her, a</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was Mr. Hartfield. He had his hat in his hand. A crowd immediately</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gathered about him, but as he saw Grace making her way out of it, he bent</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">toward her and added: " If you will allow me, I should be glad to walk to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It was so unexpected that she scarcely knew how to reply.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Hartfield said a general good night and followed her to the door.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"I--I hope you didn't think that you ought to see me home because I</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">talking. Hartfield, in his turn, enjoyed the call, brief though he made it,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">very much. The Kingsburys were in such contrast to the Colgates. Quiet</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">people, with bookish tastes, consorting with them suggested other themes</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The minister went away feeling refreshed in spirit. It was a happy ending</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of a hard day. When he reached the parsonage he did not go up to the top</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">floor and pummel the sand bag. He threw himself on the lounge in his study</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">without lighting the lamp, and clasping his hands behind his head, lay there</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thinking.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was not going to be such plain sailing as he had hoped. His three</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">years in the seminary had not entirely obliterated his old self. He recalled</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the slip he had made in talking with Miss Tagford. What an insignificant</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thing it was ! And yet he knew that it had made a deep impression on those</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">who heard it. Miss Tagford would be inclined to watch him closely here-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Colgate, too, he feared he had antagonized somewhat in spite of his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">good resolutions to bear with him. And suddenly he recollected a woman</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with a little child by the hand, who had waited to be introduced to him after</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">morning service. There was a crowd about him at the time; he had shaken</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hands and said he was glad to know her, but had not spoken to the little girl.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He had a dim recollection now of having seen the child pushed toward him,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but Mr. Colgate had come up at that minute and his attention had been</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">diverted. The same woman--he could not recall her name now--had been</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out at evening service. The little child was with her again and had gone to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sleep. He feared now that the mother had waited for him once more. But</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he had been in a hurry to speak to Grace Kingsbury, and had given her no</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">chance for another interview.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">And that walk home with Miss Kingsbury ! He wTondered if there would</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">permitted a certain line of independence. He realized, however, that it</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Presently he rose, struck a light and went out into the hall to unlock one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of his trunks. From it he took a small plush case containing several photo-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">graphs. Selecting two of these, he took them back into the study with him,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and sitting down by the table, held them up in front of him and gazed at</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">They wrere the portraits of a young man and woman, both very young,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">apparently. The woman, who was in evening dress, was very beautiful.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The man was Hartfield himself. He was in full dress, too, and there was a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sort of roguish smile about the lips.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">For fully five minutes Hartfield gazed at these two pictures; then, putting</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">them face downward on the table, he leaned his head on his hand and mur-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mured softly: " Yes, the same, the same. I must not forget that."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He rose, put the photographs back in the plush case, then placed this in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a drawer of the desk, which he locked. Then he took a book from the library</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">and read until after ten, when he started to retire. Ashe passed through the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">silent halls, Mrs. Colgate's words at dinner recurred to him. And now</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">somehow he felt as if there was some truth in them. The place did seem</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">to build or rent a structure as a sort of club house for the latter. To this</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">end he proposed that the young men get up an entertainment to be held in</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">of a rare treat in hearing the popular young pastor lecture. He had not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">announced his subject beforehand, and when he stepped to the front of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Tagford and a few others were scandalized. They went about for days there-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">after with uplifted hands declaring that they were never so shocked in their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lives as when they saw their minister cutting up monkey tricks in public</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">first arrived in Newcomb. He could not help seeing that a great deal of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">good was being done under his ministry. He determined that he would not</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Miss Tagford had risen and come over to the center of the room. Her eyes</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I think I ought to make sure about this thing," she murmured. " As</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">She made a sudden dart at the drawer and pulled it open. A look of dis-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">thing seemed to be tucked in between two of the sheets. She felt two pieces</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of heavy cardboard. With a fast beating heart she drew them out and found</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">them to be cabinet sized photographs. They were the two portraits Hartfield</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">took a good look at them and put them back before Catharine returned. She</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">did not stay long after that. She felt that already she had learned far more</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">that could not be, she decided, for what reason would there be then for his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">keeping the pictures hidden in that way ? And a portrait of himself was kept</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">along with it. Evidently the woman was some one with whom he was very</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Maybe he's married now." Miss Tagford's heart almost stopped beat-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">should be the one to prove to Mr. Hartfield's admirers that he was a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">people that she,had been looking among the minister's private papers and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">discovered something that compromised him. She could throw out hints,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">close up to the hat shelf and watched them. The woman was pretty ; there</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was no denying that. She certainly looked a good deal like the photograph.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">She was very vivacious, throwing her head back and laughing up into the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">homeward. Then she glanced up and saw the minister coming out of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">face she had never seen there before. But when he noticed that the carriage</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was still standing there, he slipped the letter into the side pocket of his coat,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and said: " It is from town. Mr. Brown hadn't taken it from the basket</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Mason as he came out of the post office. He wondered now how he could</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">have done it. He hoped he had not said anything out of the way. He had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">had not 3yet opened, but the writing on which he had recognized at the first</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">glance. He had never expected to see it again. So many years had elapsed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">since any communication had passed between him and,the writer that he had</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But it was idle for him to be anticipating evil in this way before he knew</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">strange coincidences constantly occurring in the world. He hurried on,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">reached the parsonage, and going up to the study locked himself in. Then,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">seated at his desk, he drew the letter from his pocket and slit open the en-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">closed his eyes, then squared his shoulders, unfolded the letter and began to</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Had she seen his name in one of the religious papers? It seemed highly</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the old daj's who had told her ? But he knew not one of these who was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">aware of his present whereabouts and occupation. He must leave this still a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mystery and go on to the next sentence.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Hartfield knew how much sentiment weighed with the writer. There</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">This was a command with a threat of some sort concealed behind it. He</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But there was no use in guessing at motives. The question to be decided</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">now was as to whether or not he should go to the Imperial that night.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">But to see that woman again ! Every nerve in his body revolted from the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">no ; this would not answer. She had determined to see him and there were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">plenty of ways in which she could effect her purpose if he did not permit</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her to do it in the one she had planned out. It was better that he should go.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Having arrived at this determination, he tore the letter into small pieces,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and then with a pair of scissors he clipped them into still smaller bits and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dropped them into the scrap basket. The act appeared to remind him of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">something. He unlocked the drawer where he had placed those two photo-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He had not taken them out since his engagement. Now he gazed at them</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Taking a newspaper from the table he crumpled it into a ball, threw it</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">from the case on the mantelpiece and struck it. He was about to apply it to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the paper when, with a sudden impulse, he bent over and snatched up the</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Even in immolation we shall not be together," he said grimly.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Still holding the rescued picture in his hand, he inserted the match in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">among the creases of the paper, and the next instant this had burst into</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">flames. He watched the ends of the photograph catch the tongues of fire</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and curl up as if in mortal anguish; then, when only cinders were left, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">placed the picture he held back in the drawer, turned the key on it, and pro-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ceeded to pace the floor restlessly till Catharine came to summon him to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">That night even Grace noticed that he was evidently distraught at the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">hand that rested on his knee were twitching slightly ; very small beads of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">perspiration were gathering on his forehead. Elder Brink turned slowly</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It is not so easy to describe a sensation. The air appears to be surcharged</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with a quality which defies capture and analysis. So it was in the parsonage</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">parlor. The members of the committee looked at one another helplessly, as</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">my pace became as rapid as theirs. I started to go to college at Columbia,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but my father, deeming the influence of metropolitan life not the best for me,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">removed me to Harvard. I was fond of study, although I still kept up some-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">After a very short acquaintance we were secretly married, only two of my</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">came to my father's ears. He was very angry, and after the talk he had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with me I realized what I had done. Already I had begun to suspect that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the woman had made a dupe of me, anxious only for the money I would bring</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her. As soon as commencement was over my father sent me off to Texas,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">where he had a large ranch. Meantime the woman made overtures regarding</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a divorce, which my father managed for me, paying over to her a sum of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">money, the exact amount of which I never ascertained. She at once married</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">another man, with whom my father learned that she was already on terms of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The wind had been increasing, and the lake now was lively with white</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">caps. Although the boat had been practically cut in two, the parts did not</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He expected to see there the mysterious individual who had called out to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">in his hand, he must have seen the disaster to the boat. Andy ran directly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for the landing rock, and watched with all his eyes for the appearance of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stranger. The skipper was so much absorbed in this lookout that he failed to</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The mysterious man did not appear, and perhaps the proximity of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">that he intended to conceal himself. Andy wondered that he had been so</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">imprudent as to call out to Tom when he raised the revolver ; but probablj7</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">very strong motive for concealment. This conclusion made the matter all the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">more serious and important to him, and he was therefore all the more anxious</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to solve the mystery which surrounded the stranger. But he could do noth-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing while his movements were hampered by the presence of the fair skipper,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Montoban was at the head of the lake of the same name. It was a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">flourishing town, almost large enough to be a city ; indeed it has risen to this</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">distinction since the events related in this story. Flowing into the lake on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the eastern border of the town was the Ouongo River, overlooking the mouth</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">a mile from the lake, it was still a rushing stream w'hen there was water</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">enough to swell its current. But there were two dams within half a mile of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Percival Singerlay and Mr. Phineas Barkpool had formerly been</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">partners in a very profitable manufacturing business, which had made them</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">millionaires in the estimation of other people, though their property was so</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">scattered and of such divers sorts that neither of them could have told</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whether he was worth a million or only half that princely figure. At any</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">They had been really the fathers of Montoban and the region about it, for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they were public spirited men, and had done their best to develop the resources</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the locality. Their enterprise had stimulated others to action, and the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">at the time that it was an evil day, for the two magnates of Montobau quar-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">reled over their business interests. It proved to be a very bitter feud, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">each accused the other of cheating and robbing him.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">They dissolved partnership, but they could not agree on the division of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the common property. Referees divided it for them. They drew a line</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">across the Onongo River, and gave Mr. Singerlay all the land below it, with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the manufactory, and all the land above it to Mr. Barkpool. The latter was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">compensated in cash for the great difference in the value of the moieties.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Singerlay rubbed his hands, and believed that he had obtained by far</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the larger half. So thought almost everybody else, and wondered that Mr.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Barkpool did not protest against the decision, fully satisfied that he had a</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But Mr. Barkpool did not protest, and even seemed to be pleased with the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">division, inequitable as it appeared to be to everybody else. The fact came</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out afterwards that lie had contrived to have it known to the referees that he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would be willing to take the up-river division of the land ; and this knowledge</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had greatly lightened the labors of the arbitrators. The business was settled</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">up with all possible haste, and the money award paid to Mr. Barkpool.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Less than a quarter of a mile from the lake was the dam, which furnished</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the power for the immense factory, of which Mr. Singerlay was now the sole</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">owner. His residence faced the river just below the rapids at the foot of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dam. The manufacturer believed he was the sole magnate of Montobau,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and he was accordingly happy in the belief.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Within three days after Mr. Barkpool had deposited his late partner's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">check for differences in values, a hundred men were at work building a dam a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">half mile above the old one. As many more were laying the foundation of a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mill more extensive than that of Montoban, called the Onongo. By the time</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the dam was built and the mill was finished, the machinery was ready to go</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into it.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A whole village of boarding houses and other buildings was erected almost</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the twinkling of an eye, and a mansion far surpassing that of the other</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">magnate rose into being in the most beautiful location on the south shore of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the lake, to be occupied by the owner of the new mill. In due time all the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">buildings were completed, and everything was in running order. Families</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whose members were in want of work took the houses, and the boarding es-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tablishments had all they could accommodate. The mill was in operation,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and turning out more goods than the old one.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Just at this point there was no rain to speak of for two months, and the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">river was almost dry. The Onongo mill had to shut down for the want of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">power ; but so did the Montoban. Mr. Barkpool did not wait a day, but put</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in steam ; and before his rival knew what he was about, the Onongo was at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">work again. Mr. Singerlay followed the example of his late partner, but it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">took time, and his opponent had the market for some weeks.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Barkpool immediately built a reservoir on his own land, where he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stored up the waste water against another dry time, for coal was expensive</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the absence of proper facilities of transportation. A branch railroad was</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Singerlay was president of the Montoban Bank, and, as Mr. Barkpool</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thought he was not fairly treated in the matter of the discounts, the Onongo</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Bank was started. The Onongo Hotel was built by the up-river magnate,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and the patronage of the Montoban Hotel was reduced for a time. The</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The town was divided into two factions, and there was constant war</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">churches shared in the rivalry. But again Montoban doubled, tripled, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">quadrupled its population, for competition is the life of trade. The business</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">done by the mills had been more than doubled, and new enterprises were still</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">soon frustrated by the assistance of the guard. Norbert adhered to his usual</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Eight days went by peacefully, yet the news brought by the convoys</seg>

        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">squeaking dismally on its huge leather straps, and the passengers were more</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">or less wrapped in slumber. Suddenly--well, as I have already alluded to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the coming attack, I cannot spring it upon the reader as perhaps I should</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">have done, dramatically ; and will simply say that we were awakened by the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">muzzles of two carbines, thrust right under our noses ! That is, one was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stuck under my nose, and another under my companion's, and, glancing over</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the shining barrels, we saw two dark and threatening faces, at their hinder</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ends. Each highwayman had flowing whiskers and fierce mustachios, a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">slouched hat and a mask that half concealed his face ; in fact, all the proper</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">accessories of the typical " gentleman of the road."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Each demanded, at the same time and in the same tone, " Your money or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">your life ! " I tried to reach around and unhitch my revolver ; but there was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a simultaneous and ominous click of carbine locks, and a still more dark and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">deepening scowl ; so I desisted, and we submitted to be relieved of our purses</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and our pistols, which they politely, but firmly insisted upon appropriating.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It may seem cowardly, but we had to submit. It ought to have surprised</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">me, I suppose, that the highwaymen spoke English, and devoted their ex-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">clusive attention to Tom and myself. But at that moment nothing seemed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">strange, and I should have thought it perfectly natural if they had spoken in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Greek or Hebrew. Perhaps we were, paralyzed at the suddenness of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">attack ; perhaps we lacked grit. Let that be as it may seem ; the fact was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that we were being held up in the most approved fashion.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">After having gathered in our money and revolvers,, the highwaymen</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">requested us to get out of the coach, and to mount two spare horses, which at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">this juncture an assistant led into view. And all this time, our Cuban friend</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was not only unmolested, but treated with apparent deference by the bandits.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Neither was anybody else in the coach disturbed, nor any plunder taken</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">us farewell; and we shook our fists in return, promising ourselves that we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would get even with him if, in the orderings of Providence, our paths ever</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" The scurvy scoundrel ! " muttered Tom. " I remember he said to you</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that there was no danger, and advised us to put our revolvers out of sight. I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">see his motive, now ; he was in league with these rascals."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" No doubt of it," I rejoined, recalling several suspicious expressions. I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">should mention perhaps that while there were but two principal performers</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in this sad affair, yet they were supported by some half a dozen other horse-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">men, who stood a little aloof, yet ready to give assistance if desired. We</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were not maltreated, nor even strapped to our saddles ; but on each side of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">us rode a well armed horseman, a glint of warning in his eye, and in one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hand a loaded revolver. Our own weapons the highwaymen had carefully</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tucked into their belts, where they displayed them, with rather more of osten-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tation than the occasion warranted. It could not be deuied that it was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a humiliating capture ; and though we gnashed our teeth, and vowed all sorts</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of vengeance, we went along peaceably in the direction indicated by our</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">guides. Close behind us rode the supernumeraries, and in this order we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">crossed the plain towards a range of hills. When we had accomplished about</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">half the distance, I saw the diligence, not far away, swinging around a circle,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of which we had traversed the diameter.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Our escort spoke but rarely, except to warn us now and then against at-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tempting to escape. They asked us where we were going, and what we were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">going to do when we had got there, but offered no information as to their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">own intentions. They- did not interdict our conversing aud we had the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">slight satisfaction of abusing them roundly, and telling each other what we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would do when \\^ got our liberty, etc. They paid no attention to our</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ravings, save to smile exasperatingly, showing the whitest of teeth.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At last, after an hour's riding, we reached the summit of the hill towards</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which we had been aiming, and found it to be in the midst of a vast estate,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">surrounded on all sides bj? fields of sugar cane. The tall chimneys of an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ingenio stood out black against the sky not far away, and near it was the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dwelling of the proprietor, 'set in the midst of gardens aud groves of fruit</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">trees. On the hilltop where we halted, was a hut of palm leaves, so thickly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thatched that it appeared more like a heap of wind drifted trash than an arti-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ficial shelter. It had an aperture at one side for a door, but was devoid of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">windows. An old negro .came out of the hut as we rode up and saluted us</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">respectfully, and after the rear guard had formed around us, we were com-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">manded to dismount.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Breakfast is ready, gentlemen," said the old man, as he stood aside,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">while we filed into the hut. There, in the dim light, we saw a long table,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">loaded with a substantial repast. It was not a hilarious party which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gathered around the primitive board, but there was no mistaking the hos-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pitable intent of our hosts. After the meal was over, coffee and cigarettes</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">were brought in, to which every one present helped himself, except the two</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">highwaymen who had captured us. They had not, indeed, eaten or drunk at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">all; but, without even removing their masks, had sat opposite their captives,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">keenly alert to their ever}7 movement. They seemed very much relieved</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when breakfast was over, and hastily led the way outside.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"You will remain here," they said to us, as we were about to mount.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">"We will take your horses along; but the hut, the negro, and all there is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">here, are very much at your service. You must give your parole, however,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that you will not attempt to follow us, nor to escape, until the sun has sunk</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">below the crest of yonder hill."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" But our revolvers ? " I interposed. " You may keep our purses, but we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">should like our weapons back. ' '</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"On the contrary," rejoined one of the pair, "we shall return your</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">purses, and retain the revolvers. We do not intend to place weapons in your</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hands to use against us. You are such brave men, you know,'you might do</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">something rash. Who knows, but you. might try to slioot#us?" With this</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Parthian dart of affront, they tossed us our purses, and rode away with their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">friends, leaving us at the hut's door, watching them gloomily as they sped</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">down the hill.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">We hadn't minded much the loss of our purses, since each of us had a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wad of bills stowed away in an inside pocket, and a belt cramed full of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">American eagles; but it would certainly have done us a world of good to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">have had a flying shot at the rascals, as they went galloping down the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">slcTpe. Before they left, the two principals had approached and offered us</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">their hands, one of them saying saucily, as we spurned them : " Oh well,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the time may come when you will be glad to take them, my friends, if you</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">can ; till then, adios."</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Tom and I, once left alone, said but little to each other, for the episode</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was an arrow rankling iu each breast. We could not but think that we had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">acted more like cowards, or fools, than like the men we had thought our-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">selves, and hardly dared look each other in the eye. But after we had lighted</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">our pipes and soothed ourselves with a smoke, the situation did not appear so "</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bad, on the whole. The hut was cool and comfortable, a delicious breeze</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was wafted up from the sugar cane, and a beautiful view was spread out</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">"around and beneath us.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Tom first broke the silence. "Do you know, old man," said he, "I'm</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rather inclined to this spot, after all. If we only had a couple of hammocks</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and some guns, we might spend a very pleasant week here, I'm thinking.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Funny though, isn't it? How the deuce did those fellows manage to rig up</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">this outfit at such short notice ? And how, in the fiend's name, came they to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bring us up here and leave us in possession ? It gets me ! Say, ask that old</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nigger whose estate this is, and whom he belongs to ; and particularly who</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">In reply to my question the old man answered that the plantation belonged</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">equally excited, but I fortunately advised sending the negro, with a request</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for horses, so that, peradventure the owner of the estate was our prospective</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">host, we might not bring the blush of shame to his brow. Tom assented</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">finally, and we were rewarded for our forbearance, two hours later, by the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">appearance of a most courteous gentleman, who informed us that he was Don</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Antonio's major domo, and who was profuse in his expressions of regret that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">we should have been maltreated on his master's property. After him followed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">two led horses, in charge of our sable friend, to whom, as we mounted and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sped away, we gave a half eagle, for the enjoyment of his hospitality.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then we cantered down the hill which we had ascended under circum-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It was then mid-afternoon, and the planter, the liveried servant told us, was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">indulging in a siesta. But he had been instructed to say that the house and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">all it contained was at our disposal, and he would show us to our rooms. We</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">followed him across a vast and marble tiled hall, and up a broad staircase, to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">two cool chambers, one of which was assigned to Tom, and the other to me.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">report to others my amazement ; but despite his presence, I allowed an em-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">phatic exclamation to escape me. For, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">And as I was hanging over it, in open mouthed amaze, my friend dashed</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">upon the wreck for the timber necessary to the construction of their little</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ship, they had to go carefully to work ; and as it was all manual labor, and as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they were very short handed, they found the task one of no ordinary</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At length, however, after nearly another montlT's arduous toil, they had</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Hitherto they had not allowed themselves time to investigate very closely</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the nature of the cargo which they had so laboriously conveyed to the shore,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">their chief anxiety being to secure from the wreck every scrap likely to be of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the slightest use to them, before the change of the season and the break up</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the weather should render this impossible. Now, however, they had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">leisure to give their booty a thorough overhaul ; and this was the next task</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">As, however, they were now no longer pressed for time, and one man could</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">easily do most of what was required to be done in that way, it was arranged</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that Dr. Henderson, should examine the cargo as far as he could, and prepare</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a detailed list of the various goods and articles of which it was composed;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whilst Grant and Nicholls should proceed in the raft on a trip of exploration</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">On the morning following the completion of their work of dismemberment,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">it was thought the doctor would have a difficulty in breaking open unaided</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were attacked by the three men, and their contents laid bare ; and then Grant</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and Nicholls got on board the raft--which was berthed at a short distance</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from the beach and made thoroughly secure by being moored with the ship's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">smallest anchor--and, hoisting her huge lateen sail, cast off from the mooring</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">buoy, and proceeded to execute a few trial evolutions preparatory to the ex-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The mode of working the raft under sail was, as has already been inti-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mated, the same in principle with that in vogue among the Dadrone Islanders</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">--that is to say, the vessel was sailed indifferently with either end foremost,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the sail being always kept on the same side of the mast. This is probably the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">most simple form of craft knowu to navigating mankind.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">This was the first occasion upon which it had had a fair trial, and it was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">found to answer admirably, the raft proving to be not only so stiff as to be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">absolutely uncapsizable, but also remarkably fast considering her shape, a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">speed of six knots being got out of her unloaded and with a good fresh breeze</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">As soon as the somewhat novel mode of working her had been satisfac-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">along its inner edge to the southward in the first instance, and discovered</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">They next tried the northern side of the bay, and here they were more</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">successful, for just where the reef seemed to join the land there was a channel</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of about one hundred feet in width, nearly straight, and trending in a north-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">westerly direction, with so much water iu it that the sea only broke iu one or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">two places throughout its entire length. This channel was all that they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could desire ; for as the prevailing wind seemed to be about southwest, they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were enabled to pass in and out of the bay with the sheet slightly eased off.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Standing through this channel, which was only about a quarter of a mile</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">long, they soon found themselves in the open sea, with a considerable amount</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of swell, over which the raft rode wdtli a buoyancy which was most satis-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">If Grant had any doubt whatever about the strength of any portion of his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">novel construction, it was in the transverse bracing which connected the bot-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">toms of his two pontoons, aud he was therefore rather anxious for the first</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ten minutes or quarter of an hour after he found himself' fairly in the open</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sea. But the bracing was found amply sufficient to give the required rigidity,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and this fact once demonstrated he kept away before the wind, aud coasted</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">along the northern shore of the island, keeping at a sufficient distance from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the tremendously lofty cliffs to prevent his being becalmed.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">With the wind over her quarter the raft traveled remarkably fast, aud</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">within an hour of the time when she passed out through the channel she was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">abreast of the entrance to the river--which, by the way, was so effectually</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">masked that Grant actually ran past it, aud arrived off a point which they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had seen from their original landing place before he became aware of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fact.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Retracing his way, the engineer, after a careful search, found the opening</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and passed into the river. Their course for the first two miles was dead to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">windward ; but the raft sailed remarkably near the wind, and held her own</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">even better than her designer had believed to be possible--the long, flat sides</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the two pontoons seeming to act the parts of leeboards, preventing her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from making any perceptible leeway.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">They reached the lake, sailed round the islet, landed there, and procured</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">ing once more made the best of their way back to the bay, where they</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">As the raft, with Grant and Nicholls on board, was running down with</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The latter, who usually carried his telescope with him, at once brought</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the instrument to bear upon the object, and found that Nicholls was right ;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and it was indeed a sail.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The craft, a very small one, was some four miles to leeward when first</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">descried, and notwithstanding the loss of time which such a step would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">involve, the engineer promptly bore up to examine it.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">As the two craft closed with each other, it was seen that the small sail was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">heading in for the island, and a few minutes later she was made out to be an</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">pected to find that the persons on board her were natives, who had possibly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been blown off the land, and, failing to make their own island again, had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">perhaps been wandering aimlessly about the ocean for many days. What</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was his surprise, then, when he observed one of the individuals rise in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">canoe and lift something to his shoulder, the movement being followed by a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">flash, a little puff of smoke, and the faint report of a gun.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Keeping his glass fixed upon the canoe, Grant next • observed that the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">individual who had fired tjie gun was gesticulating violently, the gesticula-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tions being such as to convey the idea of rejoicing.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A few minutes later the raft was so close to the canoe that the engineer,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">lady, carefully concealing his own somewhat gloomy anticipations as to her</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The least unpromising of them all was that of Captain Blake, who</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">proposed that, instead of incurring the delay and risk involved in the carry-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing out of such a plan, the raft should first be strengthened as much as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">possible, and that he, Manners, and Nicholls should then sail in her to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Singapore, from whence it would be easy to dispatch a rescue vessel to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">island to take off the rest of the party.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But when this proposal came to be canvassed more in detail, it was found</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that there were several verj7 grave objections to it, the most grave of them</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">all lying in the fact that, according to their calculations, the stormy season</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">must now be close at hand ; and, strengthen the raft as much as they would,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">or could, Grant believed that if she happened to be caught in a hurricane,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nothing could prevent her going to pieces.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Moreover, Singapore was well to windward of the island they were then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">upon, and, though the raft did very fairly upon a taut bowline in fine</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">weather aud in a moderate sea, Grant expressed very grave doubts as to how</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">she would behave in a strong breeze and a heavy sea.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then, again, the absence of the skipper, Manners, and Nicholls would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">reduce the defensive strength of those left behind to two men only, and that,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">too, without any artificial protection, save such as their united strength might</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">enable them to throw up.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">On the whole, after canvassing the question thoroughly, it was decided</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that the skipper's plan was very much too risky for adoption under the then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">existing circumstances of the party, and they eventually came to the conclu-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sion that no better course seemed open to them than to carry out Grant's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">original idea--namely, the construction of a house which should be strong</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">enough to serve also as a fort in case of need.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The next point to be decided was, of what material should the house be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">constructed ? Of timber of a suitable character there was a superabundance</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">upon the island ; nay, even on the islet itself there was more than sufficient</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for their purpose. But it would have to be cut, sawn to the required dimen-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sions, and hauled to the site of the building before it could be made use of ;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and all this involved a great deal of labor, to say nothing of the fact that,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when finished, the structure could easily be destroyed by fire.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Grant was strongly of opinion that stone was the most suitable material</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for the purpose ; but, unfortunately, he was by no means certain that a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">quarry could be found in a convenient position and at a convenient distance</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for transportation. If it could, he believed that shells in sufficient quantities</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for the manufacture of lime could easily be collected on the beach ; and he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had no doubt as to his ability to construct a kiln in which to burn them.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">As the engineer warmed with his subject he made the superiority of stone</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over wood so evident that it was finally decided he and Henderson should</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">devote the next day to a search for a suitable quarry, whilst the skipper, with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Manners and Nicholls for his assistants, was to essay the task of knocking up</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a temporarj' but somewhat more efficient shelter for the party than the tents</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would afford, pending the completion of the house or " fort," as they seemed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">inclined to style the proposed structure.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">In accordance with this arrangement, immediately after breakfast next</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">morning the tents were struck and placed on board the raft, and the ladies</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">armed with their repeating rifles and an axe each in their belts, set out in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">company for the gap in the cliffs, their intention being to proceed overland,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and to separate at the head of the river, each taking one of its banks with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the object of ascertaining whether any suitable quarry site could be found in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a situation convenient for the shipment of stone on board the raft.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The quest occupied the two friends for the greater part of the day, they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">arriving abreast the islet within half an hour of each other, and reaching its</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">friendly shores just in time to assist the working party there in putting the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">finishing touches to quite a respectable structure--half tent, half bower--for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which the skipper had acted the part of architect.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The house, or shelter rather, for it was too rough and ready an affair to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">roomy and watertight, though it was doubtful whether it would prove capable</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of withstanding the buffeting of a hurricane--and Captain Blake was very</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">justly proud of it.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">On comparing notes it was found that both the explorers had been success-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ful in their search. Both had found stone of a more or less suitable quality,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">some of it, indeed, being excellent ; but the honors of the day fell to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">doctor's lot, he having not only discovered a quarry site in a most convenient</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">situation, with stone of a quality far superior to anything that Grant had met</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The quarry was first reached, being situated only about half a mile above</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Grant Island, and a single glance sufficed to satisfy the refugees that here was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stone not only of superior quality, but amply sufficient iti quantity for every</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">possible want of the party. The quarry face consisted of an almost perpen-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dicular cliff of gray limestone springing out of the soil at a distance of only</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">some fifty feet from the margin of the stream ; it was about thirty feet in</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Captain Blake and Nicholls landed here, provided with the powder and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">like the stone, was situated close to the river bank, near enough in fact to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">permit of its being loaded direct on the deck of the raft by means of a long</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The doctor and young Manners willingly undertook to get such coal as</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">ping to the waist, at once set to work, whilst Grant made his way to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">On rejoining the skipper and Nicholls, the engineer found that the two</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">men had worked to such excellent purpose that they had already laid bare an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">area of some forty feet of stone, and disclosed a small fissure which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Grant thought would serve admirably to receive a blasting charge, which</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">This operation was soon accomplished, the fuse--a chemical preparation</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A minute later a faint boom was heard, followed by a tremendous crash</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and the rattle of falling fragments ; and, hurrying back to the spot, the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">workers found that, by a lucky accident, the charge had been so placed as to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dislodge and hurl down on to the bank beneath upwards of twenty tons of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stone.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">to the bahk ready for loading ; and when any especial difficulty was ex-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">perienced, a small quantity of powder always proved sufficient to overcome</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it. Such capital progress, indeed, did they make, that in less than a month</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they had not only quarried, but had actually transferred to the islet as much</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">By that time a very fair quantity of coal was also ready for removal ; and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">power at their command. The greatest care was exercised in the selection of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the timber, it being necessary to choose not only that which was thoroughly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sound, but also such as could without very much labor be conveyed to the saw</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">This latter necessity, or rather the actual labor of conveying the timber to</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It had been decided that the whole of the timber should be cut, sawn and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stacked in the ship yard before even the keel blocks were laid down, so that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it might become at least partially seasoned before being worked into the hull,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and this was accomplished in rather less than a couple of months.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">At length the day arrived when, everything being ready, the keel of the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">She could not, he thought, be going more than five knots, judging by the</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But he must bear up in chase at once, there was no time to waste in</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">none, lie.wTas quite able to manage the raft single handed. Moreover, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">began to suspect that Henderson would prove to be right in that suggestion</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">These reflections passed through the skipper's brain in a single moment--</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not perhaps quite so definitely as here set forth, but to the same purpose--and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the next he jammed his helm hard up, eased off the sheet, and bore away</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">For a few minutes after the disappearance of the moon Blake was able, or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fancied he was able, still to distinguish the canvas of the chase looming up</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">grew darker in that quarter or the weather thickened, for he was soon obliged</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But that circumstance gave him not the least concern ; he had set his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">course by a star, and he knew that so long as he continued to steer for it, so</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">long would the course of the raft converge toward that of the stranger.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He was concerned, however, to notice later 011 that not only was the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">by which he was following his course, but also that the wind was becoming</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">unsteady. Sometimes it fell away to such an extent as to cause the raft's sail</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to flap heavily as she rolled over the ridges of the swell, and anon breezed up</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">quite fresh again, but with a change of perhaps a couple of points in its</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">direction, the change generally being of such a character as to bring the wrind</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It is true the island was still in sight, some four miles astern, but the night</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">so strongly, and that, too, dead aft, that it made everything on board the raft</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">before she caught it, grimly held on his course, determined to risk everything</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rather than lose so good a chance ; his chief fear now being that the sheet</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would part under the tremendous strain brought to bear upon it by the im-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The raft, as has been elsewhere stated, was of very peculiar construction,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her shape and build being such as to peculiarly favor speed, especially when</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">running dead before the wind. Light as she now was, she skimmed away</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">before the fierce squall at a rate which made Blake's heart bound with exultation</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">There was now no longer any thought of turning back, for Captain Blake</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had by this time arrived at a firm conviction, first, that it was by the special</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">intervention of Providence that he had been led to undertake his fishing ex-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">And so he held on everything, and the raft rushed away dead before the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The door opened into a capacious hall, at the opposite end of which was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">an immense fireplace. An elderly, gentlemanly appearing man and a young</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">woman were sitting near the hearth. The woman was evidently preparing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">something to eat. The}7 both rose at our entrance and looked at us in a half</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">very ill in an adjoining room. The old gentleman said that he and his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">daughter had arrived some time ago and had found it necessary to stop 011</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">account of the storm, and were obliged to prepare their own refreshmeut.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">We were not of the Southern party--meaning the British? No. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thought not, glancing at Wilson's uniform. Well, he and his daughter were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">traveling from White Plains to Albany, and expected to take a boat from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Peekskill the next day. His name was Reuben Everard, and this was his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">While this informal method of introduction had been progressing, I was</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">She appeared to be about nineteen or twenty years of age. Her rather</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Her face was a trifle pale, probably from the fatigue of the journey. Her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rich brown hair was arranged in a loose knot at the crown of the head and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hung in flowing curls to her shoulders. Her eyes were of a sort that are</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rarely seen--a deep brown, out from which seemed to shine an inherent</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sweetness of soul. These, with a daintily curving mouth, formed what</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The old gentleman proved to be very genial and urged us to partake of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">almost wholly absorbed my attention. But I did not entirely forget myself,</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I was loth to leave, but I am a man of honor and knew my duty. I</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">down the post road in pursuit of Captain Wilson. As I said before, the mud</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" Yes," he began hesitatingly, " I knew him sixteen years ago in New</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">York City. He had just escaped from a French prison an' come to America.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He was pretty young in those days, but he was an old hand in crime. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">planned the Bannister robbery an' carried it out, too, though Henry Ford</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">helped, and I had a hand in the matter myself."</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Here Dawson reddened and became visibly embarrassed, while Lawyer</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Go on," said the major kindly, "you expiated that offense and have</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Dawson glanced gratefully at the major.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Yes," he resumed, "I put in my time at Sing Sing, and all because</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Maillard turned traitor and played me into the hands of the police. He and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Ford went to Europe, while I was breaking stone. That must be the time</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">you met Maillard in Paris. It was a daring thing for him to go back there,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when he knew the French police were looking for him. Ford went to London</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and stayed there for two or three years, if I ain't mistaken. Then I got out</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of prison at last, and just by accident ran across Ford one morning in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">police station at Harrisburg. He denied his identity at first, but I was too</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sharp to be fooled in that way, and I traced him over into Cumberland</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">County, convinced that something big was in the wind."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At this point Dawson reddened again, probably at the recollection of his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">encounter with the farmer's wife.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then he proceeded to relate in a lengthy manner the balance of his story,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with which the reader is familiar--his brief stay at the Lisburn inn, the assault</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">committed on him by Maillard and Ford, his terrible adventures in the cavern</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at Rich Hill, his final escape into the open air--of which he retained'but an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">imperfect recollection--and the midnight escape from the farmhouse.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">This part of the story was almost incredible to his hearers. They found</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it difficult to believe the late Major Penrose capable of such terrible crimes.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then Dawson told how he had gone straight to Harrisburg and worked to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">save money, of his chance meeting with Dick and Ford at the railway station,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and how he followed them clear to ROckport on the Hudson. When Dawson</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ended, his hearers were still more amazed than ever.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It remained for Dick, however, to cause the greatest sensation. He began</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his story with an account of the interview between himself and Dr. Galen--</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and at this point the doctor interrupted him to state briefly what had first</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">given rise to his suspicions.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then Dick told in a thrilling manner of the terrible scene that he had wit-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nessed from his hiding place in the wardrobe and of the assault under the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">locust trees. Here his remembrance ended, and he took up the thread of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">story again at the asylum, relating everything that had happened to him there</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">until his timely rescue by Dawson.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then Dawson told of the flight to New' York, and amused his hearers by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">an account of the fight on the Elevated Railroad. Their mirth speedily</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">changed to horror, however, when he narrated the struggle in Mulberry Bend.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Thus threads of the story were drawm together one by one, and Dick was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">triumphantly vindicated. His voice trembled when he thanked Walter aud</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Jack for their steadfast faith in his honor and honesty--not forgetting a share ^</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of gratitude to Miss Nellie, whose belief in his innocence had been fully as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">firm as that of the boys.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" The evidence was terribly strong, though," he admitted frankly, " aud</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I don't in the least blame those who thought me guilty."</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">THE MAJOR'S PLOT.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A few links were still needed to complete the chain--somewhat unim-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Oh ! by the way," exclaimed Dr. Galen suddenly, " how are we to ac-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">count for that mark on this man Maillard's arm ?"</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"He must have put it there himself," said Major Penrose, "either with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">India ink or with chemicals. He knew that I possessed a mark of that kind,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and feared that it would be called into question as a proof of identification.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He was too cunning'even to overlook such a slight matter as that. One thing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I wish to say right here, Dr. Galen, and I know that all present will agree</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with me. My father owes his life to you. Your prompt action is all that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">saved the cowardly assassin from completing his work."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The major would have said more, but at that moment the doctor's embar-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rassment was relieved by Pompey, who came cautiously into the room and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">approached Major Penrose's chair.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" De man what was shot am askin' fur you an' fur de doctor," lie said in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">an audible whisper. " He's bad, mighty bad."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I must beg to be excused for a few moments," said the major, rising to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his feet, and he hastily left the room, followed by the doctor.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">There was plenty to talk about during their absence, and an hour slipped</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by unnoticed. Then Major Penrose and Dr. Galen returned.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" How is Ford? " asked Dick. " Will he recover? "</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"I think he will," replied the doctor, "if no change sets in for the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">worse. The squire, too, is doiiig splendidly, and I 110 longer have any fears</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in his case. The crisis is past."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The major showed plainly that he had something important to say, as he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">took his seat at the head of the table.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" When we went up stairs an hour ago," he began, " we found Ford in a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">very restless condition. His wound was giving him much pain, and he feared</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that he was going to die. He declared that he wanted to make a full con-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fession, and as he seemed to be greatly worried, Dr. Galen decided that it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would be best to prop him up on pillows, and in short, broken sentences he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">told his story. Nothing was omitted, I believe, and I find that his narrative</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">supplies the missing links in the history of this awful and stupendous plot.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The confession was a great relief to Ford, and he is now resting with a very</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fair prospect of recovery. But I see that 37ou are all anxious to hear what he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had to say, so I will commence at once, though I will tell you iu advance that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the story is not a long one.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" You will be surprised to learn that Ford's participation in this crime was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to some extent accidental. He confirms Dawson's statement concerning</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Eugene Maillard. He went abroad with Maillard after the Bannister robbery,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and leaving his companion at Liverpool, went on to London, where he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">remained nearly five years. Then he returned to New York, living on his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wits for some time, until by mere accident he encountered Maillard, who had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">just returned from Algeria. The scoundrel's plan was all matured at that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">time, as is shown by the fact that he registered under the name of Horace</seg>

        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">the water. He saved himself by swimming, and made his way to Lewisberry.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">You all know how Dick so bravely rescued him from the burning building,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and I may add here that this noble deed saved Dick's life on more than one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">occasion.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" By this time Maillard recognized the need of a confederate. He made</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">proposals to Ford, threatening, in case he did not accept, to hang him for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">some terrible crime committed years ago in New York. What this was,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Ford refuses to tell. It was committed before he knew either Maillard or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Dawson, and Maillard only discovered it by accident. Ford was compelled to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">agree, and Maillard made known the whole plot, which, to state it briefly,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was as follows :</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Dick and my father were both to be put out of the way, and then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Maillard and Ford were to convert as much of the property as possible into</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cash, and flee to Europe, where they hoped to live in luxury and plenty for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the remainder of their lives. This tremendous crime seems incredible on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">face of it, but you have all seen how very nearly they succeeded. To go</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into details now would require more time than I can spare. It was Ford who</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">committed the first robbery when the squire's will was stolen, and it was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Maillard who shot Dick in the head. How determined he was to get Dick</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out of the road is shown by the upsetting of the boat 011 the Yellow Breeches</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Creek when Dick and Miss Maynard made such a wonderful escape.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Ford declares that this was done 011 purpose, and I don't doubt it. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">says, moreover, that Maillard had a confederate in some banking house who</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">informed him of the contents of the second will--which was drawn up in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">your office, Mr. Grimwood--and also gave him statements of the squire's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">account from time to time. This is a matter that must be speedily looked</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into. Ford declares that this party is not known to him.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Then Dawson here appeared 011 the scene, threatening to upset the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whole plot, and was speedily put out of the way--forever, as they fondly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hoped. The remainder of the story is too revolting to tell. Maillard</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">actually began to poison my father, and was discovered at his deadly work by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Dick. The rest you know--how Dick was attacked while running to inform</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Dr. Galen of his discovery, drugged with chloroform, and taken to a private</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">asylum up the Hudson. It was Maillard who broke open the secretary that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">night and stole the money. Pie had intended to kill Dick and throw the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">body into the millpond, but Ford held out against this, and proposed the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">other plan, by which Dick was removed from the scene, and in a manner</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which allowed 110 suspicions to fall upon the perpetrators of the deed.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I have one more thing to say. The keeper of this asylum, Dr. Clinch,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">is himself connected indirectly with the Bannister robbery, which explains</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">how he was induced to receive Dick, ostensibly as a patient, but really as a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">prisoner. He shall pay dearly for his share in the crime. I shudder to think</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">how nearly this awful villainy succeeded. I made a mistake in not bringing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">officers of the law with me from Harrisburg. Had I done so, Eugene</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">nized him at a glance. It was the man I have always known as Major</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">to him all the way to the square. A Herdic coach was standing in front</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the Bolton House, and before I could get near he had dodged into this</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and was driving up Second Street. In front of the Telegraph office a big</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">crowd was collected. They were reading the last edition of the paper that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was pasted on the inside of the window. I pushed forward and saw the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and made a clean breast of it all. He brought me right down here, and I told</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">my story to Mr. Burns. I have gone terribly wrong I know--all on account</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of fast living. I went into bad company ; I learned to drink and gamble ; to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">frequent the theaters ; I joined several clubs, and I had to dress well--these</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">things took more money than I could earn, and I went dowTn before the first</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the late gallant officer's effects. He could not assist the search. The little</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he knew was probably already known to the lawyers, yet it excited him</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wildly to think that some one besides himself was in search of the lad whose</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">memory had haunted him for so many mouths, and whom, even in his most</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">despairing moments, he had never quite given up for lost.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">True, he had long since ceased to believe that he was really to be found by</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">yet he had constantly lived iu a vague expectation of finding or hearing of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him some day accidentally and unawares. But this advertisement filled him</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with self reproach. What right had he had to do anything, to rest a day,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">till he had found this lost boy--lost by his fault, by his sin ? No wonder he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had not prospered. No wonder the bad name had haunted him and dragged</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">One thing was certain, whether what he knew was known toothers or not,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it was his duty to aid now in this new search. So he wrote as follows to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Torquay. Forrester, who appears to have been a cripple, and unable to help himself, was</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">As the reader knows, it was useless. Jeffreys was never near the place,</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But that month's experience was not wholly wasted. Memories of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">unheeded at the time, crowded in on Percy's memory now, adding to his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">it was that w7as responsible for Jeffreys' disgrace and dismissal ; and, that t</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Look here," said he, " if you want to fight, say so, and come on ! If</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Scarfe was staggered by this outburst ; he never suspected the boy had it</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Don't say a word about Jeff ! " said Percy, white hot, and springing to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Hook it ! No one asked you here, and you're not wanted ! "</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was evidently useless to stay. Scarfe had no intention of coming to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blows. He called, supposing the family was at home, in the hope of seeing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Raby. Hearing only Percy was iu towrn, he had asked to see him, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">counted, now that Jeffreys was out of the way, on making an ally of the boy.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">This was the result.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I came to see your mother," said he. " I can't congratulate you, Percy,</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Percy went out after him, and called down the staircase to Walker,</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The taunt about hospitality had stung him, and this was how he relieved</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">And so it happened that the house in Clarges Street had a visitor on the</seg>

        </ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">But it wore off as the hours passed. Mr. Halgrove had a fund of stories</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">sleeping fitfully on the bed, a head was put in at the door and a voice said in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a whisper : " Poor Mrs. Pratt's gone, John."</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">So the woman chattered 011, and when at last she went, Jeffreys glanced</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">No, he could not leave Storr Alley.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">In the morning as usual he performed their little toilets and announced to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">A fresh dilemma faced the newly made father. He must work if he aud</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his family were to eat. The thirty shillings he had earned last week could</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not last forever. Indeed, the neighbors all seemed to take it for granted he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would see to Mrs. Pratt's burial ; and how could he do otherwise?</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">That meant a decided pull on his small resources. For a day or two he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">might live on his capital, and after that-</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He put off that uncomfortable speculation. The baby began loudly to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">demand its morning meal ; and the three year old, having run through his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mirth, began to whimper for his mother. Altogether Jeffreys had a busy time</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">So busy that when, about midday, Tim, who had been perched up on a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">box at the window to amuse himself at the peril of his neck by looking out</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into the court below, suddenly exclaimed,</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">' ' There she is ! " He bounded from his seat like one electrified, and for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the first time realized that she might come and find him !</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">There was bar el y a chance of escape. She had already entered the house ;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and he became aware of the little flutter which usually pervaded the crowded</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tenement house when she set foot iu it.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">She had many families to visit; and each grudged her to the next.</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He debated the question till he heard her enter the chamber of death</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">With a groan he gathered together his papers, aud bidding Tim mind the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">baby till he returned, seized his hat aud hurried from the room.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He went out miserably into the street and waited within view of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">entrance to the alley till she should come out. It was long before she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">appeared--he guessed how those two friendless little orphans would detain</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her. When she came her veil was down, and iu the crowd on the pavement</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he lost sight of her iu a moment. Yet he knew her, aud all his resolution</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">once more wavered, as he reflected that he was still within reach of her voice</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and her smile.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He returned anxiously to the attic. The baby lay asleep on the bed, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Tim, perched on his window seat, was crooning over a little doll.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">There was a flower on the table ; the scanty furniture iu the room had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been set in order, and his quick eye noticed that a rent iu Tim's frock which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had caused him some concern in the morning had been neatly mended.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Tim came and put the little doll into his hands.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" She gave it me. Will she come soon again? " said the child.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Yes ; she's sure to come again."</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">In a strange turmoil of emotion Jeffreys resumed his writing. The flower</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the cup beside him was only a half withered aster, yet it seemed to him to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">perfume the room.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Till midnight he labored 011; then, cold and wearied, he put out his little</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">candle and laid himself beside the children on the bed.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He had scarcely done so when he became aware of a glare at the window,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which brought him to his feet in an instant. It was a fire somewhere.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">His first panic that it might be iu the house was quickly relieved. It was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not even in Storr Alle}7, but in one of the courts adjoining. He looked down</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from his window. The alley was silent and empty. No one there, evidently,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had }?et had an alarm.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Quickly putting 011 his boots, he hurried down and made his way iu the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">direction of the flames. From below they were yet scarcely visible, and he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">concluded that the fire, wherever it was, must have broken out in the top story.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Driver's Court, which backed on to Storr Alley, with which it was connected</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at the far end by a narrow passage, was an unknown land to Jeffreys. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Jews in Storr's had no dealings with the Samaritans in Driver's ; for Storr</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Alley, poor as it might be, prided itself on being decent and hard working,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whereas Driver's--you should have heard the stories told about it. It w^as a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">regular thieves' college. A stranger wdio chanced into Driver's with a watch</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">chain upon him, or a chink of money iu his pocket, or even a good coat upon</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his back, might as soon think of coming out by the way he entered as of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">flying. There were ugly stories of murders and mysteries under those dark</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">staircases, and even the police drew the line at Driver's Court and gave it the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">go by.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Jeffreys had nothing to apprehend as he rushed down the passage. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had neither watch, chain, nor money, nor good coat. His footsteps, echoing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">noisily iu the midnight silence, brought a few heads to the windows, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">almost before he stood in the court there was a cry of " Fire ! "</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Terrible anywhere, such a cry in a court like Driver's was awful indeed.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I11 a moment the narrow pavement swarmed with people, shouting, cursing,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and screaming. Although even yet the flames scarce^ appeared from below,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a panic set in which it was hopeless either to remove or control. Chairs,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tables, mattresses were flung, it seemed at random, from the windows.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Mothers, not venturing out on to the stairs, cried down to those below to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">catch their children. Drunken men, suddenly roused, reeled fighting and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blaspheming into the court. Thieves plied their trade even on their panic</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stricken neighbors, and fell to blows over the plunder.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Still more terrible was the cry to others who remained within.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Children, huddled into corners, heard that crjr and it glued them where</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they stood. The sick and the crippled heard it, and made one last effort to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rise and escape. Even the aged and bedridden, deserted by all, when they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">heard it, lay shouting for some one to help.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The flames, pent up at first and reddening the sky sullenly through the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">smoke, suddenly freed themselves aud shot up in a wild sheet above the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">court. The crowd below answered the outburst with a hideous chorus of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shrieks and yells, and surged madly towards the doomed house.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">There was no gleam of pity or devotion in those lurid upturned faces.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">To many of them it was a show, a spectacle ; to others a terrible nightmare,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to others a cruel freak of Providence, calling forth curses.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The flames, spreading downwards, had already reached the second floor,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when a window suddenly opened, and a woman, with wild disheveled hair,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">put out her head and screamed wildly.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The crowd caught sight of her, and answered with something like a jeer.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" It's Black Sal," some one shouted ; " she's kotched it at last."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Why don't you jump ? " shouted another.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Booh ! " shouted a third. " Who skinned the cripple? "</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The woman gave a scared look up and down. The flames at that moment</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wrapped round the window, and, with a wild howl, the crowd saw her disap-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pear into the room.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Jeffreys all this time had been standing wedged in the crowd, a spectator</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of that hideous scene and now a witness of this last tragedy.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">With a desperate effort he fought his way to the front, hitting right and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">left to make himself a passage. It was a minute before he got through.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then the crowd, realizing as if by intuition his purpose, staggered back, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">raised a howl as lie dashed into the door of the half consumed building.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The first flight of steps was still intact, and he was up it in a moment ;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but as he dashed up the second the smoke-swirled down in his face and half</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">choked him. He groped--for it was impossible to see--in search of the door ;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and, guided partly by the roar of the crowd without, and partly by the shrieks</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">within, he found the room.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was full of flame as he entered it, and to all appearance contained</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nothing else. The wretched woman, finding the stairs worse to face than the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">window, had rushed back there and flung herself desperately on the heads of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the crowd below.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">As he turned to save himself, Jeffreys, amid the roar of the flames, caught</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the sound of a shout from the corner of the room which he had imagined to be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">empty.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Rushing toward it, he made out the figure of a lad on the floor, blackened</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with smoke, and evidently unable to move.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Yet he was not senseless, for he called:</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Jeffreys caught him in his arms in a moment, and only just in time. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had literally to wade through flame to the door ; and when he reached the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stairs outside, the dense smoke, reddening every instant, burst upon him well</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nigh overwhelmingly.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">How he staggered down that awful flight with his burden he knew not.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">More than once he stumbled ; and once a shower of falling embers all but</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Those who watched without marveled how soon he returned ; and when</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they perceived that he bore in his arms a living creature, even Driver's Court</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">swayed back to let him"pass, and cheered him.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Happily a cry of "Engines ! " at the other end of the court diverted the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Drop him, he's a dead 'un," shouted some one who stopped a moment to</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I'll give j'ou a shilling to help me with him out of this," said Jeffreys.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was a shilling well spent. Unaided he could never have done it, but</seg>

        <ab>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then for the first time, left to himself, he looked in the face of this</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">unexpected guest. And as he did so the room seemed to swim round him.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He forgot where he was or what he was. He looked down on an upturned</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">face, but not one blackened with smoke. It was white and livid, with green</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">grass for a background--and the roar he heard was 110 longer the distant yell</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of a panic stricken mob--but boys' voices--voices shouting to himself !</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Bob Aunam, a vicious but good looking young miner, came over from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Sliandoka on a protracted spree and in some way struck up an acquaintance</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">looked to Lucy, as she saw7 him every day, like Solomon in all his glory. It</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">did not seem possible that he was ever black and rough, and he squandered</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">money as if he had trunkfuls of it. Furthermore he had the advantage of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and worked more hours per diem than any other man in the mine except his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">helper. That gave Lucy much more leisure and loneliness than were good</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for her. The duties of her simple housekeeping took little of her time aud</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">she lacked amusement. Jem had bought a piano for her, but she could not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">play upon it--iu fact its only use was for Jem to sleep on in hot nights. He</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">had happened to Lucy. Kind neighbors told him that any accident to her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">must probably have come close to hurting Bob Aunam at the same time. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had never heard of the young fellow before and now looked for him in vain.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Bob w7as gone. And Lucy never came back. When no longer able to expect</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">In another second, they were in a life or death struggle, wrestling and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">sure as God hears us--try to meet death like a man? "</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Oh ! Jem. I'm not fit to die."</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Their colloquy w^as violently interrupted by a terrific explosion that really</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">took place in some upper level of the labyrinthine mine, but seemed to be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">everywhere. It had almost the effect of an earthquake. Huge pillars of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">coal cracked, with reports like artillery, and great pieces flew from their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sides like missiles fired from guns ; vast masses of roof rock fell with awful</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">crashes, sending thunderous echoes rumbling down the cavernous depths of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the mine ; a tornado-like wind roared through the tunnels, bursting open the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ventilation doors, hurling empty coal cars from their tracks, tossing the two</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">men as ocean waves toss floating oars.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">When Jem came to himself, after a period of unconsciousness, he was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bruised, bleeding, iu perfect darkness and could not find his companion any-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">where near. Again and again he called ' ' Robert ! Where are you ? ' '</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">There was no reply. Although Bob heard him lie held his breath and was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">still. He hoped his implacable enemy might not discover him before a res-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cuing party came.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Jem reflected. Standing iu the tunnel he had caught the full force of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wind, while Bob lying along the w^all had probably been less its sport. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lamp was irretrievably gone, but Jem was too old a miner to be without the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">means of making a light. In a tightly corked bottle he carried matches and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he had a bit of caudle in a pocket. After the great wind succeeded such</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stillness that the air seemed to have died. The caudle flame rose straight</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from the wick, as if burning in a closet. Holding it above his head he re-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">traced the way along which he had been thrown and soon discovered the man</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he sought, who groaned audibly in despair at his recapture.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">192</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">JEM'S WAY*</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" That," remarked Jem, as one who states a fact, but without feeling any</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">personal concern in it, ''is probably the beginning of the end. The choke</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">damp should soon begin to settle now." And placing the candle on the tun-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nel floor, he seated himself comfortably to w^atcli it. ''I wish I hadn't lost</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">my pipe," he grumbled.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Bob renewed his supplications, weeping, protesting and praying in an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">agony of craven fear, without eliciting a word of reply.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The flame suddenly vanished.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Jem groped for the candle, picked it up and made haste to lift the helpless</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">man upon his shoulder again. He held him there, steadied against the wall,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">while he relighted the caudle. Then, moving slowly and cautiously, he went</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from chamber to chamber, farther down the long tunnel.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">''Not this way ! Turn back, for the love of heaven! You are getting</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">farther away from the up drift ! " shrieked the burden, struggling hard to free</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">himself.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">''Yes. I know," replied Jem. At length he found what he sought, a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">chamber where the first cut had been made across the top of the breast instead</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of at the bottom, a variation sometimes necessitated by exceptional conditions.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">A broad bench of coal was left at a height of about four feet from the floor.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Upon it he laid Bob, shoving him well back, and seated himself on the edge,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with his legs dangling down. The roof was so low that he had to sit in a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">half reclining position, resting his weight upon an elbow. The candle he set</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">near the edge of the bench, not far from Bob's face.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The young man began to feel hope that Jem only meant to frighten him</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">almost to death and would yet, at the last moment, let him escape. But with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that hope mingled a sickening fear that that last moment might be too long</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">delayed.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">''What's the use of climbing up here?" he protested. "If the choke</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gets this high, we'll never get out alive. Why didn't you let me be, on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">floor, if you meant to kill me this way ? ' '</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">If I could, lad, I'd keep thee for a month, just arm's length from death</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and, at.last--let him clutch thee."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Robert, abandoning hope, raved and wept.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">How long they waited, neither knew.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Suddenly the invisible fingers of approaching death again pinched out the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">little flame and Bob uttered a scream of terror.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Jem quickly tore off his jacket, rolled it into a bundle and thrust it, as a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pillow, under the miner's head. Then he once more lighted the candle and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">held it up. " Not long to wait now," he said coolly.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Presently Bob struggled and gasped for breath, heaved himself upon one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">elbow and cried ' ' Mercy ! Air ! ' '</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Jem looked at him with calm interest, silently, forgetting, in the absorp-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tion of his regard, to keep the candle above the rapidly rising tide of deadly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gas and for the third and last time, its light was extinguished. He did not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">trouble himself to find another match. Bob was quiet and still at last.</seg>
