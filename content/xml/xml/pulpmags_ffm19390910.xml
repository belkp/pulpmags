Over the island brooded a spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">sullen, implacable and alien; filled with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">threat of latent, malefic forces waiting to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">unleashed.

And</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and then, on the wind, came a breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">from unexplored jungles, filled with un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar odors, mysterious, and menacing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is on such mornings that Papua</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaks to you of her immemorial ancient-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and of her power.

Nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the mood Papua's alone. I have felt it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in New Guinea, in Austraila, in the Solo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mons and in the Carolines. But it is in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Papua that it seems most articulate. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is as though she said: "I am the ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">of days; I have seen the earth in the throes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its shaping; I am the primeval; I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen races born and die and, lo, in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast are secrets that would blast you by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the telling, you pale babes of a puling</seg><seg type="columnLine">age.

His</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever eagerly questioning brain had stamped</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself upon his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sought in my mind for an explanation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that which I had felt on the flash of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeting.

I tried to analyze what it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had disturbed me so; what profound</seg><seg type="columnLine">change in Throckmartin that had so</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaken me. Now it came to me. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though the man had suffered some ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rific soul searing shock of rapture and</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror combined; some soul cataclysm that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in its climax had remolded his face deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">from within, setting on it the seal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wedded joy and fear. As though indeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ecstasy supernal and terror infernal had</seg><seg type="columnLine">once come to him hand in hand, taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession of him, looked out of his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, departing, left behind upon him in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eradicably their shadow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Alternately I looked out over the port</seg><seg type="columnLine">and paced about the deck, striving to read</seg><seg type="columnLine">the riddle; to banish it from my mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And all the time still over Papua brooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">its baleful spirit of ancient evil, unfathom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, not to be understood; nor had it lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the Southern Queen lifted anchor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and steamed out into the gulf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DOWN THE MOON PATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I WATCHED with relief the shores sink</seg><seg type="columnLine">down behind us; welcomed the touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the free sea wind- We seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing away from something malefic;</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that lurked within the island</seg><seg type="columnLine">spell I have described, and the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept into my mind, spoke--whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather--from Throckmartin's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had hoped--and within the hope was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inexplicable shrinking, an unexpressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">dread--that I would meet Throckmartin at</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunch. He did not come down and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensible of a distinct relief within my</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappointment. All that afternoon I</seg><seg type="columnLine">lounged about uneasily but still he kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his cabin.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Southern Queen was rolling to a disquieting</seg><seg type="columnLine">swell and I had the place to myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Over the heavens was a canopy of cloud,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing faintly and testifying to the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">riding behind it. There was much phos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phorescence. Now and then, before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship and at the sides, arose those strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">little swirls of mist that steam up from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Southern Ocean like the breath of sea mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sters, whirl for a moment and disappear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I lighted a cigarette and tried once more to</seg><seg type="columnLine">banish Throckmartin's face from my mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the deck door opened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it came Throckmartin himself.

I puffed up my cig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arette and by its glow scanned him closely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was watching a large swirl of the mist</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was passing before the ship. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">phosphorescence beneath it illumined it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a fitful opalescence. I saw fear in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. The swirl passed; he sighed; his grip</seg><seg type="columnLine">relaxed and he sank back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Throckmartin," I said, wasting no time</seg><seg type="columnLine">in preliminaries. "What's wrong? Can I</seg><seg type="columnLine">help you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is your wife all right and what are you</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing here when I heard you had gone to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Carolines for a year?" I went on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt his body grow tense again. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not speak for a moment and then:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to Melbourne, Goodwin," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I need a few things--need them</seg><seg type="columnLine">urgently. And more men--white men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice was low; preoccupied. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though the brain that dictated the words</seg><seg type="columnLine">did so perfunctorily, half impatiently;</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloof, watching, strained to catch the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">hint of approach of something dreaded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are making progress then?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. It was a banal question, put forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a blind effort to claim his attention.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Progress?" he repeated. "Progress--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stopped abruptly; rose from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, gazed intently toward *he north. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed his gaze. Far, far away the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">had broken through the clouds. Almost on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horizon, you could see the faint lumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nescence of it upon the quiet sea. The dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant patch of light quivered and shook.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The clouds thickened again and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. The ship raced southward, swiftly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throckmartin dropped into his chair. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted a cigarette with a hand that trem-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bled. The flash of the match fell on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face and I noted with a queer thrill of ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehension that its unfamiliar expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">had deepened; become curiously intensified</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though a faint acid had passed over it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">etching its lines faintly deeper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's the full moon tonight, isn't it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked, palpably with studied inconse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The first night of full moon," I an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered. He was silent again. I sat silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, waiting for him to make up his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak. He turned to me as though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made a sudden resolution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Goodwin," he said. "I do need help.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If ever man needed it, I do.

As such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man would need help, so I need--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused abruptly and arose to his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffly; the cigarette dropped from his fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers. I saw that the moon had again broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the clouds, and this time much</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer. Not a mile away was the patch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light that it threw upon the waves. Back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it, to the rim of the sea was a lane of</seg><seg type="columnLine">moonlight; it was a gleaming gigantic ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pent racing over the rim of the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight and surely toward the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throckmartin gazed at it as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to stone. He stiffened to it as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointer does to a hidden covey. To me</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him pulsed a thrill of terror--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror tinged with an unfamiliar, an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fernal joy. It came to me and passed away</seg><seg type="columnLine">--leaving me trembling with its shock of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bitter sweet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He bent forward, all his soul in his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The moon path swept closer, closer still.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was now less than half a mile away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From it the ship fled; almost it came to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though pursued. Down upon it, swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">and straight, a radiant torrent cleaving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves, raced the moon stream. And then--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God!" breathed Throckmartin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if ever the words were a prayer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">an invocation they were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, for the first time--I saw--it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moon path, as I have said, stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MOON POOL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to the horizon and was bordered by dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. It was as though the clouds above</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been parted to form a lane--drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside like curtains or as the waters of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Red Sea were held back to let the hosts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Israel through. On each side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream was the black shadow cast by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">folds of the high canopies. And straight as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a road between the opaque walls gleamed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shimmered and danced the shining, racing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapids of moonlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far, it seemed immeasurably far, along</seg><seg type="columnLine">this stream of silver fire I sensed, rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than saw, something coming. It drew into</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight as a deeper glow within the light. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on it sped toward us--an opalescent</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistiness that swept on with the suggestion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some winged creature in darting flight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dimly there crept into my mind memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Dyak legend of the winged messen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger of Buddha--the Akla bird whose feath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers are woven of the moon rays, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart is a living opal, whose wings in flight</seg><seg type="columnLine">echo the crystal clear music of the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars--but whose beak is of frozen flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shreds the souls of unbelievers. Still</seg><seg type="columnLine">it sped on, and now there came to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet, insistent tinklings--like a pizzicati</seg><seg type="columnLine">on violins of glass, crystalline, as purest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearest glass transformed to sound. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">again the myth of the Akla bird came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now it was close to the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white path; close up to the barrier of dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness still between the ship and the spark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling head of the moon stream. And now</seg><seg type="columnLine">it beat up against that barrier as a bird</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the bars of its cage. And I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this was no mist born of sea and air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It whirled with shimmering plumes, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">swirls of lacy light, with spirals of living</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapor. It held within it odd, unfamiliar</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleams as of shifting mother-of-pearl. Cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uscations and glittering atoms drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it as though it drew them from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays that bathed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nearer and nearer it came, borne on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparkling waves, and less and less grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the protecting wall of shadow between it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and us. The crystalline sounds were louder</seg><seg type="columnLine">--rhythmic as music from another planet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now I saw that within the mistiness was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a core, a nucleus of intenser light--veined,</seg><seg type="columnLine">opaline, effulgent, intensely alive. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">above it, tangled in the plumes and spirals</seg><seg type="columnLine">that throbbed and whirled were seven glow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing lights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through all the incessant but strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered movement of the--thing--these</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights held firm and steady. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven--like seven little moons. One was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a pearly pink, one of delicate nacreous</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue, one of lambent saffron, one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerald you see in the shallow waters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tropic isles; a deathly white; a ghostly</seg><seg type="columnLine">amethyst; and one of the silver that is seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">only when the flying fish leap beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon. There they shone--these seven lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle varicolored orbs within the opaline mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiness of whatever it was that, poised and</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectant, waited to be drawn to us on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light filled waves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tinkling music was louder still. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">pierced the ears with a shower of tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">lances; it made the heart beat jubilantly--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and checked it dolorously. It closed your</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat with a throb of rapture and gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">it tight like the hand of infinite sorrow!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Came to me now a murmuring cry, still-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the crystal clear notes, it was articulate</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but as though from something utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">foreign to this world. The ear took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry and translated with conscious labor into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sounds of earth. And even as it com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed, the brain shrank from it irresistibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and simultaneously it seemed, reached to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward it with irresistible eagerness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Av-o-lo-ha! Av-o-lo-ha!" So the cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to throb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The grip of Throckmartin's hand re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laxed. He walked stiffly toward the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the deck, straight toward the vision, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a few yards away from the bow. I ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him and gripped him--and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. For now his face had lost all human</seg><seg type="columnLine">semblance. Utter agony and utter ecstasy--</seg><seg type="columnLine">there they were side by side, not resisting</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other; unholy inhuman companions</seg><seg type="columnLine">blending into a look that none of God's</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures should wear--and deep, deep as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his soul! A devil and a god dwelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmoniously side by side! So must Satan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">newly fallen, still divine, seeing heaven and</seg><seg type="columnLine">contemplating hell, have looked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then--swiftly the moon path faded!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The clouds swept over the sky as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hand had drawn them together. Up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the south came a roaring squall. As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon vanished what I had seen vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it--blotted out as an image on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">magic lantern; the tinkling ceased abrupt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly--leaving a silence like that which fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows an abrupt and stupendous thunder</seg><seg type="columnLine">clap. There was nothing about us but si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence and blackness!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through me there passed a great trem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling as one who had stood on the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">verge of the gulf wherein the men of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louisades say lurks the fisher of the souls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men, and has been plucked back by</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheerest chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throckmartin passed an arm around me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is as I thought," he said. In his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice was a new note; of the calm certainty</seg><seg type="columnLine">that has swept aside a waiting terror of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unknown. "Now I know! Come with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to my cabin, old friend. For now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you too have seen I can tell you"--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated--"what it was you saw," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we passed through the door we came</seg><seg type="columnLine">face to face with the ship's first officer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Throckmartin turned quickly, but not soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for the mate not to see and stare</seg><seg type="columnLine">with amazement. His eyes turned question-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a strong effort of will Throckmar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin composed his face into at least a sem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blance of normality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Are we going to have much of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said the mate.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a chill force--the phrase I have used--</seg><seg type="columnLine">frozen electricity--describes it better than</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything else. Stanton looked at me oddly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'So you felt it, too,' he said. 'I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering whether I was developing hal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucinations like Thora.

Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">edges were cut as though by an engraver of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jewels. They fitted against the neighbor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing blocks in almost a hair-line. Its base,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw, was slightly curved, and fitted as</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely as top and sides upon the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones on which it rested. And then we</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted that these stones had been hollowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow the line of the gray stone's foot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a semicircular depression run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning from one side of the slab to the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was as though the gray rock stood in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of a shallow cup--revealing half,</seg><seg type="columnLine">covering half. Something about this hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">attracted me. I reached down and felt it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goodwin, although the balance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones that formed it, like all the stones</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the courtyard, were rough and age-worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">--this was as smooth, as even surfaced as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it had just left the hands of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">polisher.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'It's a door!' exclaimed Stanton.

For a foot above</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on each side of the corner of the gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock's lintel I had seen a slight convexity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible only from the angle at which my</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze struck it. These bosses on the basalt</seg><seg type="columnLine">were circular, eighteen inches in diameter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we learned later, and at the center ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended two inches only beyond the face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrace. Unless one looked directly up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at them while leaning against the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock--for this slab, Goodwin, is the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock--they were invisible. And none would</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare stand there!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We carried with us a small scaling-lad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der, and up this I went.

I laid my hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the one I was examining, and drew it</seg><seg type="columnLine">back so sharply I almost threw myself from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ladder. In my palm, at the base of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumb, I had felt the same shock that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had in touching the slab below.

The impression came from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot not more than an inch wide. I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully over the entire convexity, and six</seg><seg type="columnLine">times more the chill ran through my arm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were, Goodwin, seven circles an inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide in the curved place, each of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">communicated the precise sensation I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">described. The convexity on the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the slab gave precisely the same re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sults. But no amount of touching or of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressing these spots singly or in any com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bination gave the slightest promise of mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to the slab itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'And yet--they're what open it,' said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stanton positively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Why do you say that?'

No trace! Even as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought this Edith dropped to her knees</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it and reached toward something</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying at its foot. It was a little piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray silk. I knew it for part of the kerchief</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thora wore about her hair. Edith took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragment; hesitated. I saw then that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been cut from the kerchief as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a razor-edge; I saw, too, that a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">threads ran from it--down toward the base</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the slab; ran to the base of the gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock and--under it! The gray rock was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">door! And it had opened and Thora had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed through it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think, Goodwin, that for the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes we all were a little insane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We beat upon that diabolic entrance with</seg><seg type="columnLine">our hands, with stones and clubs. At last</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason came back to us. Stanton set forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the camp to bring back blasting powder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tools. While he was gone Edith and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">searched the whole islet for any other clue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We found not a trace of Thora nor any</seg><seg type="columnLine">indication of any living being save our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves.

The rock within</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">effective blasting radius of the cursed door</seg><seg type="columnLine">resisted our drills. We tried explosions at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the base of the slab with charges covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by rock. They made not the slightest im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression on the surface beneath, expending</seg><seg type="columnLine">their force, of course, upon the slighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistance of their coverings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Afternoon found us hopeless, so far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking through the rock was concerned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Night was coming on and before it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would have to decide our course of</seg><seg type="columnLine">action. I wanted to go to Ponape for help.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Edith objected that this would take</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours and after we had reached there it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be impossible to persuade our men</seg><seg type="columnLine">to return with us that night, if at all. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">then was left? Clearly only one of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">choices: to go back to our camp and wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">for our men to return and on their return</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to persuade them to go with us to Nan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tanach. But this would mean the aban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">donment of Thora for at least two days.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We could not do it; it would have been too</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowardly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The other choice was to wait where we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were for night to come; to wait for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock to open as it had the night before, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make a sortie through it for Thora be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore it could close again. With the sun had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come confidence; at least a shattering of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mephitic mists of superstition with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the strangeness of the things that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had befallen us had clouded for a time our</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds.

The assertion of the natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the ani had greatest power at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time might be a far-flung reflection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge which had found ways to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">forces contained in moonlight, as we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">found ways to utilize the forces in the sun's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays. If so, Thora was probably behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slab, sending out prayers to us for help.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how explain the sleep that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">descended upon us? Might it not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MOON POOL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">19</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">been some emanation from plants or gase-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous emanations from the island itself? Such</seg><seg type="columnLine">things were far from uncommon, we agreed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In some way, the period of their greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">activity might coincide with the period of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon, but if this were so why had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thora also slept?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As dusk fell we looked over our</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons. Edith was an excellent shot with</seg><seg type="columnLine">both rifle and pistol. With the idea that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impulse toward sleep was the result</seg><seg type="columnLine">either of emanations such as I have de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribed or man made, we constructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough-and-ready but effective neutralizes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we placed over our mouths and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nostrils. We had decided that my wife was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remain in the hollow spot. Stanton</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take up a station on the far side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stairway and I would place myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite him on the side near Edith. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">place I picked out was less than five hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet from her, and I could reassure</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself now as to her safety, as I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon the hollow wherein she</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouched. As the phenomena had previ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously synchronized with the rising of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon, we had no reason to think they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would occur any earlier this night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A faint glow in the sky heralded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon.

The moon dawn increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly; the disk swam up, and in a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment it seemed was shining in full radiance</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon ruins and sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As it rose there came as on the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the curious little sighing sound from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inner terrace.

Even at the distance he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">from me, I discerned amazement in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.

Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was turned full toward the moon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was in deepest sleep!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As I turned again to call to Stanton,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes swept the head of the steps and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, fascinated. For the moonlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">had thickened more. It seemed to be--</seg><seg type="columnLine">curdled--there; and through it ran little</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleams and veins of shimmering white fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A languor passed through me. It was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ineffable drowsiness of the preceding</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. It was a sapping of all will to move.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tore my eyes away and forced them upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stanton. I tried to call out to him. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the will to make my lips move! I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled against this paralysis and as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">did so I felt through me a sharp shock. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like a blow.

We will first try</seg><seg type="columnLine">a concentration of the rays of the nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">full moon upon these circles to see whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">that will open the rock. If it does we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to investigate the pool without in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terruption from--from--what emanates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look, here on the chart are their loca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions.

He pointed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are certainly cleverly concealed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they must be open to the air to get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light.

"Wake me up a good fifteen minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lay upon the berth. I sat thinking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I came to myself with a start. What time</seg><seg type="columnLine">was it? I looked at my watch and jumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the port-hole. It was full moonlight;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the orb had been up for fully half an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour. I strode over to Throckmartin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook him by the shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Up, quick, man!" I cried. He rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepily. His shirt fell open at the neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I looked, in amazement, at the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">band around his chest. Even under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric light it shone softly, as though little</seg><seg type="columnLine">flecks of light were in it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throckmartin seemed only half-awake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked down at his breast, saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing cincture, and smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes," he said drowsily, "it's com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing--to take me back to Edith! Well, I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Throckmartin!" I cried.

"No use; keep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">maps; come after us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went to the port and drowsily drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside the curtain.

I sprang back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a corner and crouched there. At the port-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole was a radiance; swirls and spirals of</seg><seg type="columnLine">living white cold fire. It poured into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin and it was filled with dancing motes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light, and over the radiant core of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone seven little lights like tiny moons. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered Throckmartin to it. Light pulsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through and from him. I saw his skin turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a translucent, shimmering whiteness like</seg><seg type="columnLine">illumined porcelain. His face became un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognizable, inhuman with the monstrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">twin expressions. So he stood for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. The pillar of light seemed to hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tate and the seven lights to contemplate</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I shrank further down into the corner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw Throckmartin drawn to the port.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The room filled with murmuring. I fainted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I awakened the lights were burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But of Throckmartin there was no trace I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There are some things that we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound to regret all our lives.

And Earth and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solar system valued him at less than a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fly-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you mention rats, Ev? You require</seg><seg type="columnLine">rodents for some purpose?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS the mechanically expressionless</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice of Zeoui, his Martian associate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who stood beside him.

Eugenic breeding and medical</seg><seg type="columnLine">alteration had brought his shape to ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proximate that of an Earth man. His soft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bladder-like body had been elongated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffened with artificial spine, and raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">erect upon two slender limbs. Its upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">corners were even shaped into shoulders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bore in lieu of arms two tentacles</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sensitive tips, just now concealed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his space-mittens. At the top, under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">helmet, was his large and fragile braincase,</seg><seg type="columnLine">SPACE STATION NO. 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">29</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shaggy all over with the petal-like fronds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tags of tissue housing his Martian</seg><seg type="columnLine">awareness of conditions that approximated</seg><seg type="columnLine">the five Terrestrial senses. Thus developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and equipped, Zeoui could walk and work</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Earth's mankind, could talk--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">favored ultra-pedantic and exact poly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">syllables--by stirring air through an arti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficial larynx. He was more at home among</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terrestrials than among the jelly-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies and feeler-appendages of his fellow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke again: "A rocket vessel, swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">and small, approaches."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Coming here?

He and Zeoui would mix</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid oxygen and other ingredients into</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuel and operate the pumps, but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be no chatting or fraternizing. Skip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pers might transmit formal orders, receive</seg><seg type="columnLine">reports, no more.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">it curved in, around, and down to the deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a hundred yards away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost before its rocket blasts had sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sided a panel sprang open in its side and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a helmeted head popped out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Someone disembarks," commented</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zeoui's maddeningly dry voice. "Yes, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">makes significant motions of the hand."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The first figure to reach the deck was</seg><seg type="columnLine">small and slight, even in space-overall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ev!" came a soft, trembling cry to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everitt's earphones, and his heart stirred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had never expected to hear that voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ev, dear!"

A moment later he had clutched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the newcomer in his arms, was pressing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to him and gazing at a dear white</seg><seg type="columnLine">face through two thicknesses of clouded</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass. Her big, storm-dark eyes swam with</seg><seg type="columnLine">tears of mingled joy and concern, her full</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips trembled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then more motion from the direction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship caught Everitt's eye.

Inside the old con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol room that, stripped of instruments and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitted with a desk, chairs and cabinets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">served as an office, they felt the comforting</seg><seg type="columnLine">pull of the artificial gravity that the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck lacked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All began to unship their helmets.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everitt and Fortuna freed their faces first</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at once kissed with hungry violence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everitt thought that the biggest of For-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuna's companions chuckled derisively</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his half-doffed headpiece, but was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too happy to resent it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now," Fortuna murmured, freeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">her lips, "I'll tell you how we are work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing your escape."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Escape?" repeated Everitt sharply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You don't mean--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I tried to get you relieved," the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, with a serious wag of her dark, curly</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, "but daddy turned obdurate.

Half turning in Everitt's embrace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she nodded to the big man. "Tell him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ropakihn."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ropakihn?" said Everitt. "Are you--?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">He paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The giant's head was out of the helmet</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. It showed huge, heavy-jowled, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright, piggy eyes, a mighty blade of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose and a crimson complexion. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">coarse, well-combed thatch of hair was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good six feet six above the office floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the armored body was heavy, even for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that height. A loose smile crossed the big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">red countenance as a raspy voice answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everitt's half-voiced question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I'm Ropakihn, the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">played--well, eccentric--to get away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">here." The lips grew looser, writhing a bit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They shut me up in a comfortable but</seg><seg type="columnLine">boresome asylum, until Miss Fortuna here</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to visit me. She arranged for a leave</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of absence for me and these other inmates.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You see," and his rasp grew smug, "I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the new type of war-craft and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">MS-ray. Knew it from a retired officer--</seg><seg type="columnLine">also eccentric enough to be shut up. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">babbled out the location of a hangar where</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ultra-fast experimental ship was kept."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everitt puzzled over this information.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"MS-ray--metal-solvent?

He was good</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to listen and to pick these other</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the first time Everitt looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ropakihn's five companions, also helmet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less by now. And he was genuinely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shocked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not one of them was normal. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the rust-ray was a hunched and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted dwarf with the face of a cunning</seg><seg type="columnLine">weasel. Two of the others were well set</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, but they wore expressions of brutal stu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pidity. The remaining two were patently</seg><seg type="columnLine">imbecilic, fidgety and grimacing. No won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der both Fortuna and Ropakihn had avoid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed saying "crazy"--had employed such</seg><seg type="columnLine">words as "eccentric" and "afflicted." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other expression would have been too</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed to use in this company.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ropakihn continued, amusedly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In any case, Everitt, Miss Fortuna got</seg><seg type="columnLine">us out. Now she wants us to try to get you</seg><seg type="columnLine">out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly," added Fortuna in happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumph. "What with our extra speed, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a start of hours on the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ships. Have you any baggage? We'll head</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to Earth at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't go," said Everitt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">SPACE STATION NO.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fortuna began to argue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't understand, darling.

"Zeoui</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't handle things alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortuna clenched her little fists in de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spair. "Don't you want me? Don't I love</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, and didn't Spaceways do you a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shabby trick? Your every instinct--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There are many instincts," he inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted gently. "One is for love, and heaven</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows that it's strong in me. But another's</seg><seg type="columnLine">for honor and loyalty. That keeps me at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my post."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another silence, with all eyes on Everitt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally Fortuna shrugged, though not in</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete resignation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe you're right," she said slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I know I am," Everitt rejoined.

The man called Corby made a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sloppy gesture of salute and turned to enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air-lock, putting on his helmet as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everitt tightened his muscles as if to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring, but Ropakihn lifted his weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">warningly.

"But in a few weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll be conquerors. That MS-ray will blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">the defenses loose from the whole Jovian</seg><seg type="columnLine">colonial setup. They'll have to surrender</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a lunge at his towering foe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the magnetism in his shoes, augmented</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the floor's artificial gravity, slowed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge for a second. In that second Ropa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kihn was on guard, fending him off with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rifle barrel across his chest, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corby and the two others had fallen upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For full half a minute Everitt battled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his angry strength almost a match for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">three assailants, but then they forced him</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and began to bind his limbs with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt from his own overall. Fortuna, seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his defeat, made a dash as if to help him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ropakihn, laughing, clutched at her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she swerved away, then ran for the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">that led to the hulk's interior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A form popped into view on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">threshold, barring her retreat.

Everitt and Fortuna,</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless in their bonds, lay propped</seg><seg type="columnLine">against a bulkhead under Corby's guard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ropakihn, lolling on the desk, talked. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">throve on his own boasting, telling enthusi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">astically of his enterprise in planning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">theft of the speed-craft with its new ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment, his courage and resource in exe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuting that theft, of his daring in conceiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the idea of conquering Jupiter's moons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half an hour was gone before he wearied</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the sound of his voice. Breaking his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream of self-praise then he moved to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">port and looked out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's Zeoui?" he demanded, half</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud. "I don't see him or the others.

Probably none at all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swinging around, he glared at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners and at Corby. "Say," he blus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered at the universe in general, "are those</seg><seg type="columnLine">lazy limpets soldiering on their mixing</seg><seg type="columnLine">jobs? I'll show them how!" He started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramp across the floor, but the loud clang</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his magnetized boots halted him. Lift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one foot, then the other, he pulled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal footgear away. "No need for them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know I'm coming," he commented. "Corby,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're in charge until I get back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was gone into the inner passage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corby, his slow mind groping after the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">reason for his chief's ire, took a step as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if to follow, then stared stupidly in Ropa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kihn's wake. For the moment he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching Everitt or Fortuna.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everitt felt a tug at his bonds. A hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">was freeing him--Fortuna's hand. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">won loose! He wasted no time in ponder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing now, but as his own arms felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strap draw away, sprang to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Corby heard the motion and turned, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he lifted his ray-tube Everitt's hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist connected with the loose-hung jaw. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunchback went hurtling backward, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">skull ringing on the floor .before his wea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pon fell with a shattering sound. He lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everitt caught up the ray-tube, saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was jammed, and dropped it with an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamation of impatience. From the desk</seg><seg type="columnLine">he seized his helmet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you going to do?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fortuna breathlessly, sitting up to untie</seg><seg type="columnLine">her ankles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stay where you are," he cautioned her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily. "Leave your feet tied and your</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands behind you. Then Ropakihn and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men will think you're still helpless, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave you alone for a minute." He poised</seg><seg type="columnLine">the helmet above his head. "I'm making</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dash for the ship outside. Zeoui and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his playmates may not recognize me at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once. If I get in among them and smash</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, I'll have the MS-ray. Give me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment to learn how to work it, and it'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">be our saving."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clamping his helmet in place, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped to the inner lock-panel. Behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him rose the panicky roar of Ropakihn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurrying back from his inspection. The bel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed words penetrated even the helmet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Corby!" the giant was shouting. "Look</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive! The fuel-mixer went wrong somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">--liquid oxygen escaped, and both the boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">are frozen stiff as boards!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came into view, and saw Everitt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You loose?" he bawled, but his erstwhile</seg><seg type="columnLine">captive was into the air-lock, then through</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and upon the deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No motion, no life met Everitt's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside. The outlaw ship was where it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">34</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">been, half the radius of the deck away, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it extended the jointed metal pipe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried fuel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ropakihn was right, no liquid was cours-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing through that flaccid conduit. Everitt</seg><seg type="columnLine">started at a half-run for the cruiser.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But a savage voice rang in his ear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phones: "Stand still, or I'll plug you!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everitt whirled around. Ropakihn had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come out, helmet hastily donned and rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">poised. His huge body almost fell at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer threshold of the lock, and only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutch at a port-rim saved it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The outlaw, in his haste to pursue, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left off his magnetic boots. Outside the hulk</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had only the tiny gravity-pull of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck to govern him, and his huge body</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighed but a few ounces. An unconsid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered touch of toe-pressure was enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbalance him, even hurl him clear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take off your shoes and throw them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me!" he yelled at Everitt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The smaller man stood still, making no</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion to obey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ropakihn's beaked face darkened with</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage. "Off with them, or--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Steadying himself with his left hand on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the port-rim, Ropakihn pointed his rifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the other. Everitt ducked out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of fire, himself slipping to one knee.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At once Ropakihn floundered forward anc'</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him, clutching one foot and fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripping the shoe from it. "I'll do the walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, you do the stumbling," he taunted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everitt lay still beneath the outlaw, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">not in submission. He was analyzing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation--so logical, though he had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of it before. Inside the hulk you</seg><seg type="columnLine">had weight and never stopped to realize</seg><seg type="columnLine">that out here you needed magnets to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">you down lest--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ropakihn had tucked his rifle under an</seg><seg type="columnLine">elbow and was pulling off the other shoe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That vast mass of flesh, sprawling upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everitt, was no heavier than a silk hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kerchief. Even as the second shoe fell to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deck, Everitt summoned his strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">and surged upward, thrusting his enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">along and traveling with him. Next instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">they floundered in emptiness, the deck</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping from beneath them as if snatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the hand of a prank-playing Titan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rT^HEY wrestled wildly in space, weight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">A less as swimmers and clumsy as</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamers. It was like a dream at that, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible nightmare in which one strikes or</seg><seg type="columnLine">grapples but encounters no resistance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arms around Ropakihn's body, Everitt</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared over the crag of the giant's shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Space Station No. 1--dwindling, falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and away, shrinking to a lump-cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered shield on a starry curtain of black.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The very heave of Everitt's body had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to send them both flying like stones</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a sling, unfettered by gravity, unim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peded by air, hundreds of yards, a mile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They wrenched and tore at each other's</seg><seg type="columnLine">throats for a time, baffled by the folds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fabric. Then Ropakihn, letting go, struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everitt clumsily on the breast-bone. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">buffet dashed them violently apart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everitt saw the jetty sky and its stars</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirl, saw the disk that was the station</seg><seg type="columnLine">whip from underfoot to overhead, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">back out of sight to appear underfoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. He was somersaulting in space</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ropakihn, too, was flying backward, head</seg><seg type="columnLine">over heels over head, shrinking to the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent size of a squirming doll.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everitt gave vent to a hysterical laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">over their ridiculous plight. Strong as lions</seg><seg type="columnLine">but light as feathers they were losing</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves in nothingness by their own un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">directible exertions. Even now they had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">power to come together or to return to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck after they had left. He had a mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture of himself falling to an orbit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">circling the man-made planetoid like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">satellite. Ropakihn, caught in another</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbit, might make the same circuit at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slower or faster pace. Drawing into con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">junction, perhaps they would be close</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to resume hostilities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everitt laughed again more wildly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A shout assailed his earphones. Ropa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kihn, far away, was doing something with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rifle. Yes, firing it, not at Everitt, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">into space behind himself. Flash after flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">of detonation and Ropakihn seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grow in size.</seg><seg type="columnLine">SPACE STATION NO. 1</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">35</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oh, that was it. The weapon carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive charges and its recoil, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely enough to stir a proper weight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could propel the few ounces that its</seg><seg type="columnLine">operator scaled just now. The rocket was</seg><seg type="columnLine">definitely approaching. He grew bigger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bigger, like a rubber figure swelling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he was aiming the gun at Everitt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">firing once. The bullet missed, and the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coil slowed Ropakihn. Again they collided</seg><seg type="columnLine">and grappled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The smaller, more agile Everitt man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged to seize and clamp his enemy's mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive rifle arm. Ropakihn tried to shove him</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose, but Everitt wrung the wrist he held</seg><seg type="columnLine">with desperate vigor. He heard the giant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">involuntary grunt of pain, saw the huge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mittened hand sag open. The weapon swam</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly out of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Darting out his own hand, Everitt</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched the receding barrel. He had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to find trigger or grip, but struck as</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a club.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shock of the blow, falling on Ropa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kihn's shoulder, almost drove them apart</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, but they clung somehow as the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to snatch back his rifle. Everitt threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">his legs up and forward, clamping them</seg><seg type="columnLine">around his foe's great waist as around</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wild horse. He took a rib-buckling</seg><seg type="columnLine">punch over the heart, but next moment had</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck once more with the rifle-butt, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time full on the front of Ropakihn's helmet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The clouded glass splintered, and sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly the outlaw's red visage showed plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and monstrous in the unfiltered sunlight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A breath's space, then the red turned blue,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great mouth gaped after the fleeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. Bulging eyes fixed Everitt with dire</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate and abruptly fell blank and dull as</seg><seg type="columnLine">pebbles. The blueness deserted the face in</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn, and went tallow-pale. The heaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">cask-like body between Everitt's clamping</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees gave a final convulsive shudder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">relaxed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everitt had won.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE DID not feel elated, only weary.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kicking loose from the senseless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying Ropakihn, he stared frantically</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">around to locate the station. It was behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shoulder. Pointing the rifle into space</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him, he fired it again and again. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">recoil made itself felt. Again and again he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A full minute elapsed before he ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached the deck of the little island in</seg><seg type="columnLine">space. His sense of direction changed--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">station was no longer before or behind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but beneath. He glanced upward once. Afar</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw the silhouette of Ropakihn, quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless and limp in the sky. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted down like a leaf from a tree. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">overalled figure dashed across the deck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pla'tes to meet him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "An outstanding exhibition of valor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical prowess, Ev!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No mistaking that affected voice.

Above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray tumbling waste of waters, a pale opal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">escent curtain of fog was slowly descend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. The Adventurer--Mr. Wilkinson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">yacht--rode at anchor barely two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards from shore. Already she was swathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in drifting tides of vapor. Like a fantom</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, she appeared and disappeared. At one</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment she seemed to be scarcely a stone's</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw from the beach; at the next, a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so offshore. It had been blowing hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the preceding night. The waves were</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an army coming home with victory on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their shields. They thundered out their</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep-throated war song on the beach. Far</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in the impenetrable mist, like a voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">from another world, the melancholy call</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a seagull rose for a moment above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumult of tumbling waters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Miss Bessie," Captain Ben con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued with a shake of his head, "there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">more things hid away in the sea than ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">man heard tell of. But the fog's gettin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">precious thick. I think you'd best be off to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house or you'll get wet to the skin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Elizabeth had caught sight of some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in the surf which held her undivided</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention. It was a large box which, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that moment, was riding the snowy crest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wave. On it came smoothly, like a minia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture ship, sinking at last into a milky chasm</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the billow tripped on the beach with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its treasure and fell sprawling. For an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant the box was left high and dry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moved by a sudden impulse which she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was soon to regret, Elizabeth ran forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the wet, quivering sand and bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the box.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come back, missy! " Captain Ben called</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a shrill, quavering voice. "What ever are</seg><seg type="columnLine">ye thinkin' of? Come back this instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">afore one of them big waves catches yer! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elizabeth raised the box. Holding it tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her breast, she hurried back just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">another huge wave charged down on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a threatening roar. Lowering her prize</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sand beyond the reach of its many</seg><seg type="columnLine">long arms, she surveyed Captain Ben tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umphantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This belongs to me now, doesn't it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she asked, indicating the box with a slender,</seg><seg type="columnLine">moist finger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, aye, missy," Captain Ben said</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemnly. "What a man fishes out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea belongs to him, no matter who it be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed to afore. The King of England's</seg><seg type="columnLine">crown jewels might be in this here box</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they wouldn't be no more his now than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike Rafferty's pig." He paused and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratched his grizzled chin. "But I guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">these ain't crown jewels," he added rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorrowfully. "They're more like to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">lemons."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Why lemons?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "'Cause a tramp steamer run aground</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the fog last night off Wishbone Point.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had to lighten her cargo afore they</seg><seg type="columnLine">got her off; and they do say she was loaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">down with crates of lemons. Some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys in the village was fishin' for 'em all</seg><seg type="columnLine">mornin'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't believe it is a crate of lemons,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elizabeth said with a shake of her head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once more she bent down and turned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">box over on its side. At the next moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a stifled cry, she stepped back so hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riedly that she nearly tripped over the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's outstretched legs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, what's the matter, missy?" Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Ben asked, looking up from the net in</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise. "You looks as if somethin' had</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit yer!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's something alive in that box,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said in a rather unsteady voice. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard it move. Do you suppose it could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a baby, Captain Ben?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old fisherman's mouth extended</seg><seg type="columnLine">from ear to ear. A glimpse of his gums</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be seen, with here and there a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">discolored tooth rising from them like so</seg><seg type="columnLine">many weatherbeaten tombstones. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing silently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't laugh at me!" Elizabeth cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WHIMPUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">39</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">angrily. "I tell you there is something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">alive in that box! I heard it rattling about</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when I moved it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Captain Ben rose stiffly to his feet and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bent over the box. "I misdoubt it's a baby,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Miss Bessie," he mumbled. "A baby</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't have much chance of weatherin'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through such a sea in this old craft. Mebbe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the lemons ain't packed very tight. Let's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">' see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He put one of his gnarled hands on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">box and turned it over. On the instant a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strange flapping sound could be heard issu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing from the interior, followed almost im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mediately by a loud scratching as though</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">long, sharp nails were at work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Captain Ben uttered an ejaculation of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">amazement. "That's mighty strange!" he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">muttered. "There must be fish and crabs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in this box. But who ever heard tell of--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He paused and scratched the top of his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weatherbeaten hat. "Shall I open it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " No," Elizabeth murmured. "I don't</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">want to see what's in it. There's something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">horrible, I know. I wish I hadn't taken</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that box out of the water."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Why, what's the matter, missy? You</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">look all upset. It's only fish and crabs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thrown in higgledy-piggedly in an old chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It ain't like you to get worked up over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nothin'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Elizabeth bit her lip. What made her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feel this way about a harmless old box?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">It was ridiculous! And yet, try as she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would, she could not even look at it now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When she had bent over it and put her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hand on its cold, wet surface, when she had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heard those strange flapping and scratch-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing sounds within, a wave of intense, if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unaccountable, fear and repulsion had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">passed through her. Now trembling little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">patches of gooseflesh stood out on her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brown arms. This was absurd. She must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have caught cold. Or perhaps she just had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a touch of malaria.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I think I'll go back to the house, Cap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tain Ben," she said at last. "I feel cold."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You don't look very hearty today,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">missy, and that's a fact.

The one excitement which he allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself was an occasional flyer in Wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street. He was proverbially lucky in such</seg><seg type="columnLine">speculations. The considerable fortune,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which his father had left him, had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken wings--on the contrary, like a snow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball rolling down-hill, it had gathered to it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self many lesser fortunes. But this success</seg><seg type="columnLine">without effort had given him no flicker of</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each year his complexion had grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">sallower, his eyes duller, his muscles flab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bier. The boredom which must necessarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">attend a smooth existence, was smothering</seg><seg type="columnLine">the manhood in the financier. Beneath a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain of down, he was snoring his life</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he rose ponderously, and laid a</seg><seg type="columnLine">plump, moist hand on his daughter's shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der. "I've got a surprise for you, Bessie,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said in a slow, heavy voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A surprise, dad! What is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Wilkinson smiled sleepily. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended teasing her, but now lacked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vitality. "The surprise is upstairs, shav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing," he said, sinking back into the easy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair like a large stuffed doll.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elizabeth flushed. In an instant she for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">got all about the wooden box and her dread</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its flapping, scratching contents. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't mean that the surprise is Jay, dad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Wilkinson nodded and smiled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes," he murmured. "Dropped into my</seg><seg type="columnLine">40</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Famous fantastic mysteries</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">office just after he got off the boat. Didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire--wanted to make it a surprise. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">here he is to tell you about it himself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this moment a tall, athletic young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man opened the screened door, and, seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elizabeth, hurried forward and took her in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bearlike hug. Jay had never been a gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle lover, but she liked him all the better</seg><seg type="columnLine">for that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, old girl," he said at last, holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">her off at arm's length and regarding her</seg><seg type="columnLine">attentively with his steady gray eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you're looking pretty fit. You didn't ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect me home so soon, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I didn't," she murmured. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrote me that you intended doing Europe</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the rest of the team."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled a trifle shamefacedly. "I in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended to," he said. "I thought that you'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">think all the more of me if I stayed away</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little longer. After we beat the English-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men that deciding game, the team broke up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larry and Martin dropped in on Paris;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Henry and I were going to do Scotland and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ireland, but at the last moment I quit. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to do some explaining. Henry was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">sore as a boil." He paused and stroked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleft in his prominent chin meditatively.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, here I am," he finished, "and will-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to step up to the altar most any time."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"'Wait till somebody asks you, sir," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said with a sudden flash of color. "Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you still think that polo is the most impor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant thing in life?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young man shook his head. "No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it's exciting; and I crave excitement."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elizabeth experienced the disquieting</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensation at her fiance's words which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">common enough to most girls when they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought face to face with their great enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that priestess of adventure which beckons</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swift and the strong. It is the instinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">of feminine love to be everything, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">must content itself with so little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a nomen t she said a trifle bitterly:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"At one moment, Jay, you talk of settling</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, of becoming thoroughly domesti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated; at the next, you sigh for speed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrills. Which side of you am I to believe?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I like excitement, but I don't put it above</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything else in the world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're a girl," her fiance answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly, "and with a girl it's different. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fellow has to be doing strenuous things</seg><seg type="columnLine">or else--" He paused and shrugged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Haskin' pardon, lady and gentlemen,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said a strange, husky voice which sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the scraping together of two rusty iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">bars, "a chap down at the beach says as</seg><seg type="columnLine">'ow you 'ad picked up a old chest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All three turned their heads in surprise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There, standing on the lower step of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">veranda, swinging a mildewed, canvas cap</seg><seg type="columnLine">between finger and thumb, was one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangest figures Elizabeth had ever seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Above medium height, but so bent that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his back rounded out like a drawn bow; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">long legs wide apart as though balancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself against the shock of the sea; his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, with its great bulbous nose and close-</seg><seg type="columnLine">set black eyes, cocked on one side shrewdly</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a bird about to take flight--he resem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled some scarecrow posturing in a corn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field. And yet, on the second glance, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the humanness of the man. It was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his crafty, thin-lipped mouth, in the swing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his lantern jaws, in the twitching of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">corded, brown fists, which resembled two</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea-spiders. All in all, from his tangle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">straw-colored hair to his shining boots, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked as out of place on Mr. Wilkinson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad, sun-swept veranda as one of the pi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rates in "Treasure Island."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The chap as I spoke to," the man con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued, "said as 'ow 'e 'ad brought the chest</seg><seg type="columnLine">up 'ere a few minutes back.

"There was some holes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that, I remember."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Was there, lady, was there?" cried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in evident excitement.

Sep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tember 15, 1935."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're well decorated, my man," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Wilkinson with a flicker of an eyelash</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Jay's direction. "Who was the artist?''</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's a tasty bit of work, ain't it?" said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sailor in evident pleasure. "That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I halways says--tasty! Black Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">did 'em hall--'im who was my shipmate</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard the Sea King.

'E did this 'ere when we was ship-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrecked together on a coral island in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">China Seas. 'E never got off that island</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither, did Black Tom."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never got off it!" Elizabeth cried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Did he die there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now I wouldn't say so much as that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gal.

Jay broke in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sailor half-closed his eyes till they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were mere pin-points. "They," .he mut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered. "Them things what live on coral</seg><seg type="columnLine">islands in the China Seas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He means whim pus" said Captain Ben,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had at that moment hobbled up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right you are, matey," said the man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The whimpus got Black Tom, soul and</seg><seg type="columnLine">body.

"Now what can we</seg><seg type="columnLine">do for you?" he said rather sharply. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've come up here to tell us lies about</seg><seg type="columnLine">mermaids you're wasting your time. We've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a first-class liar here as it is." He gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Ben a significant stare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's more things afloat, Mr. Wilkin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, than you ever heard tell of," Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben began in a plaintive, asthmatic whine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This man here is right when he speaks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of whimpus. I heard tell of 'em afore."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the sailor cut him short. "Look</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, lady and gentlemen," he said, step-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping forward, "I come peaceful enough for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my property, and I'm bound I'll 'ave it!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My daughter picked the box out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water.

"Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">would a ten-pound note be agreeable? Say</seg><seg type="columnLine">the word, lady." He began to fumble in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't take it, Bessie," Mr. Wilkinson</seg><seg type="columnLine">advised, enjoying the affair as a child enjoys</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new kind of game.

But what</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be in the chest? Something alive--</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had heard it move--something which</seg><seg type="columnLine">this man considered to be worth more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty dollars. It was worth finding out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It couldn't be your box I found," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And why ain't it, lady?

"You seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what the outside of the box looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">like. But that isn't enough. I believe you</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that there were a few trinkets inside?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, ma'am."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Well, that isn't so, Mr. Farley.

The sailor's crafty eyes wandered</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, there, and everywhere; Mr. Wilkin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son's round face indicated surprise; Jay</seg><seg type="columnLine">began stroking his amber-colored mustache</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully. At last Captain Ben spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's no use, Bill Farley, or whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">your name may be," he said.

"Have you a baby in that box?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she asked excitedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps he's a kidnaper," Jay sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested. "They're quite common."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's got a bad face," Captain Ben</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered, casting a suspicious look at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowering Bill Farley. "When a Britisher</seg><seg type="columnLine">is bad, he's most uncommon bad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Wilkinson took a step forward with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air of a stern judge. "What have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">got in the box?" he demanded harshly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sailor looked from right to left, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though contemplating escape, and then into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faces of his persecutors.

Mr. Wilkinson was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first to speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've got a what?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I got a whimpus," Bill Farley repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">stubbornly.

At one moment she wished she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had accompanied them; at the next, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was glad that she had remained where she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pier was several hundred yards from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house. Elizabeth, although she strained</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes, was unable to ascertain what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were about. By this time they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached their destination. Looking very</seg><seg type="columnLine">small and toylike, they were bending for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward as though examining something.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An involuntary shudder passed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl's frame.

But before she had traversed more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a quarter of the distance, she encoun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered Captain Ben, who had detached him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self from the group on the pier and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hobbling across the front lawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was cornin' up to tell yer all about it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">missy," he said, smothering a yawn with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge fist.

She begin to scratch at him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her claws and gnash her teeth--but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">weren't no use, for Farley had her safe by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the neck all the time. Well, missy, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a piece of fishin' line in his trouser-pocket.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No sooner did she stop her antics than he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it fast about her.

Take a squint</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the sky, gov'nor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as he spoke great black clouds, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">knights fully caparisoned for the lists, rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly into the pale-blue sky. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared with startling suddenness as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though they had been created in an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">by some malevolent magician of the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">finite; and, with their coming, the whole</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the heavens was altered. A soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow suffused the heights above. The sky</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowed ruby red in spots as though it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glass door against which gigantic tongues</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flame were pushing forward. At any</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment one expected to see it come crash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down in red-hot fragments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the mournful wailing ceased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was followed by a silence so profound</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the ticking of Captain Ben's large</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver watch was distinctly audible to all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was something awe-inspiring in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence. One felt that all about in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sullen sky, in that motionless sea now shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fiery corrugations, in those swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering clouds, a relentless force was</seg><seg type="columnLine">creeping forward noiselessly on hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A solid white wall had risen up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea a mile or so away. For an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">it hovered there, a mound of snow against</seg><seg type="columnLine">a murky background, and then it swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward them with a sullen roar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hurry, missy, hurry!" cried Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben in a high falsetto.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seizing Elizabeth's hand, he half led and</seg><seg type="columnLine">half dragged her toward her cabin. Scarce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly had they stumbled down to compara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive safety before a huge wave tossed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventurer up on her beam-ends as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">she were a toy; and a frantic, tearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind, like a mad old woman, screaming,</seg><seg type="columnLine">chuckling, roaring, circled about overhead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">raking the yacht from stem to stern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sudden wild bound of the Adven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turer skyward threw Elizabeth on the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her cabin, and Captain Ben, head first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall. Both were stunned. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long time they lay there, unconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the progress of the typhoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Elizabeth opened her eyes again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">night had fallen. But what a strange night</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was!--a luminous night which enveloped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the raging sea with a pall of fire. Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorway she caught a glimpse of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood-red heaven. Indeed the sea and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky had apparently become as one--a fiery</seg><seg type="columnLine">brotherhood, inseparable on the horizon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The typhoon had not abated in fury</seg><seg type="columnLine">since those first few blinding moments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WHIMPUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">51</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">On the contrary, the ocean had been so</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashed by that terrific and luminous wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it had risen up in wild revolt, threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening the very sky. Great billows, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiery locks, charged down on the Adven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turer and tossed her heavenward in de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rision. Each instant it seemed that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">must perish in those glowing chasms</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead; but she fought her way through</seg><seg type="columnLine">them somehow and rose up gamely on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side, salt incrusted from her keel to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her smoke-stacks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elizabeth was too weak to move. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay there, a blinding pain creasing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead, staring about her like a terror-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken child. There was no light in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin except those strange, vivid flashes</seg><seg type="columnLine">which stole in through the doorway and</seg><seg type="columnLine">which served to illumine objects in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragmentary fashion. Now Captain Ben's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face could be seen. He lay within arm's-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach of Elizabeth, huddled up against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall. She wondered if he were dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But now something happened which</seg><seg type="columnLine">made her forget Captain Ben entirely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly the roaring of the wind died</seg><seg type="columnLine">down as though by magic--it was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though nature were holding her breath--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she heard strange flapping, scratching</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds in the cabin where the steps led up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the main deck. Whatever it was, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming closer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A great, numbing fear enveloped Eliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beth like a coverlet of snow. Only too well</seg><seg type="columnLine">she knew those flapping, scratching sounds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She tried to scream, but her voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">frozen in her throat; she tried to rise, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">her limbs refused their office. And now</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the luminous light from the sea failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. An inky blackness succeeded it which</seg><seg type="columnLine">draped all things in impenetrable shadow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the flapping, scratching sounds con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued. They were not more than two feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">away--now less than a foot--now-- Sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly she felt something cold and sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch her outstretched palm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lizzie!" a hoarse voice shouted. "Liz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zie! Where 'ave yer got to, Lizzie?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill Farley's dark figure blocked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin door. Striking a match, he peered</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him anxiously. At this moment Cap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Ben sat up and rubbed bis head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who's that?" he called weakly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's Bill Farley, matey.

All night the Adventurer had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">running before the hurricane like a chip</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a mill-race; now.she was able to pursue</seg><seg type="columnLine">her course unmolested. The wind had died</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to a gentle breeze; and, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waves still rode mountain high, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">crests were no longer flecked with foam.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soon the sun rose and looked down re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">assuringly on a wind-scarred sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The passengers of the yacht, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">much the worse for the night's rough usage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered under the awning on the after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here comes Captain Masters," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elizabeth suddenly.

"There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a curtain of mist hiding it, but it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising."</seg><seg type="columnLine">52</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill Farley raised the telescope to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye and gazed long and attentively.

Not a breath of air ruffled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the placid surface; and the red rags, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had once served as a part of Black Tom's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wardrobe, hung disconsolately from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flagpole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the girl uttered a shrill cry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, there's the boat now!" she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, two of them--one right behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Wilkinson raised the binoculars to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes in some excitement.

Mr. Wilkinson asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man moistened his lips and</seg><seg type="columnLine">launched out into speech. "I've been fish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in' for the last few days while you all have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been searchin' this island. There's some</seg><seg type="columnLine">most curious fish in these parts--gay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored, with tails most like a lady's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fan and pop eyes like a frog.

Jay cried impatiently.

Now I didn't get a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bite for nearly ten minutes; then, all of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden, somethin' gives that line a awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerk. 'What's this?' I says to myself, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coral fish don't pull near so hard. 'Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps a young shark has laid hold.' Well, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled that fish up on deck, although I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sweatin' time of it, and what do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think it was gentlemen?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sure I don't know," said Jay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Was it a shark?"

"But lead us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to your whimpus, Captain Ben."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE life-boat was lowered carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the sea. One by one the men, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed with a revolver, climbed down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope ladder and seated themselves. Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben, Jay, and Mr. Wilkinson were the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave the deck. They all turned to Eliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beth for a final word of leave-taking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll be home in time for lunch," Jay</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Do you see this, Bessie?" He held</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large canvas bag aloft.

I got her in a bird-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cage one of the men had. These whimpus</seg><seg type="columnLine">can cut up rough."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What will I do if anything should hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pen to you, dad?" Elizabeth asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WHIMPUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">55</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What could happen to us?" Mr. Wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kinson said reassuringly. "We're eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong and all armed to the teeth. Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry, Bessie--we'll be back for lunch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All aboard!" cried Jay. "The sooner we</seg><seg type="columnLine">start the sooner we'll be back with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">booty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Captain Ben lingered for an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the other two had clambered down</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the boat. "Don't you fret, missy," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, giving her shoulder a furtive pat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We'll make out all right.

Ever since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the preceding afternoon, when the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">whimpus had been caught and she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned of the intended expedition, the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been the prey of wild fancies. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, dark forebodings of she knew not</seg><seg type="columnLine">what had haunted her pillow. And now a</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled despondency enveloped her opti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mism like a wet blanket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some time she stood at the rail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching the progress of the life-boat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally, after it had disappeared around</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the curving arms of Whimpus</seg><seg type="columnLine">Island, she turned away with a sigh and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered her cabin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elizabeth glanced about in search of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some refuge from herself. She saw a book</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying on the table within arm's reach. Pick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it up hurriedly, she opened it at random</seg><seg type="columnLine">and began to read. Unfortunately for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace of mind, the book happened to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">volume of Poe's verses. The particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">poem she turned to was The Bells and</seg><seg type="columnLine">those lines which run:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   They are neither man nor woman--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   They are neither brute nor human--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   They are Ghouls--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She dropped the volume with a cry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgust and hurried up to the main deck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was well past noon. A blazing sun rode</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky, casting its rays on Whimpus Island</seg><seg type="columnLine">which seemed to be wavering in the intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat. Elizabeth gazed long in that direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, but she could see no vestige of hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manity on the shimmering shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '"It's nearly one o'clock," the girl mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mured. "I've half a mind to go and see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what's happened to them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a small skiff on the after-deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">which she had often used when at home.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To-day the sea was so calm that a canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have ridden it with perfect safety.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Acting on a sudden impulse, she lowered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skiff into the water and, in a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, was seated in the stern, paddling</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly toward Whimpus Island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In less than fifteen minutes the skiff</seg><seg type="columnLine">grounded on the shore and Elizabeth began</seg><seg type="columnLine">her search.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whimpus Island extended for nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">three miles. In breadth, however, it rarely</seg><seg type="columnLine">exceeded two hundred yards. The walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very rough. There were all manner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hummocks, which rose up like bumps on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bald head, and fissures in the coral which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to be taken into account.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elizabeth was a strong, active girl, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was nearly worn-out before she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">circled the island. Every now and then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped to rest. At these times she called</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloud, whereupon her voice would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught up by every cave and echoed back</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollowly. But no human voice answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">hers; no human figure met her eye in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that weary tramp. Indeed, a blight seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rest on the island. Unlike any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">which she had ever seen, no sea-gulls</seg><seg type="columnLine">whined about its cliff and no grasses grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">even where there was a stretch of solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">soil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They must still be in the cave," Eliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beth murmured in a vain effort to fight off</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing depression. "It won't do any good</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting for them. I'll go back to the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wait there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she came to this decision, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing on the hummock from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black Tom's gaudy nether garments flut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered brazenly in the wind. The girl, tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">in both body and mind, seated herself for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant beneath this barbaric emblem</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rested her chin in her hands. Several</seg><seg type="columnLine">paces from her, a long red fissure in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coral seemed to grin at her as though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a human mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly she heard a strange sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">56</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which made her start and look up. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dull droning like the humming of innum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erable bees, not unmusical and rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">soothing except for an occasional loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">snort which broke into it like a peremptory</seg><seg type="columnLine">command. These sounds evidently issued</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the fissure already alluded to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What can it be?" Elizabeth wondered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She walked over to the fissure and tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">peer down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the dull buzzing sounds grew loud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er. Suddenly there came such a loud snort</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the shadowy depths that Elizabeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">involuntarily recoiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sea-lions!" she murmured. "I've heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">them snort just like that in the zoo. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">buzzing sound must be water running into</seg><seg type="columnLine">some cave. No doubt the tide rises and</seg><seg type="columnLine">falls."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last she retraced her steps to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had left the skiff, and, with a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart, paddled back to the Adventurer. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">she neared the yacht, hope rose up in her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps they had returned while she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been out of sight on the other side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island; perhaps they were safe on board,</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing at her fears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Making the skiff fast, she clambered</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard the Adventurer and was greeted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence and shadows. A glance at the empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">davits where the life-boat usually reposed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blighted her hopes. She experienced a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of complete weakness. Sinking down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the hard deck, she began to sob.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Night was slowly falling. A gray mist</seg><seg type="columnLine">stole up silently from the water, enveloping</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whimpus Island in an impenetrable curtain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mystery. The sun sank with startling</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenness as though its fiery light had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been extinguished by the touch of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm, luminous sea. A legion of languid</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows stole about the hysterical girl on</seg><seg type="columnLine">noiseless feet. They bent backward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward like flowers fondled by the breeze;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they pointed at Whimpus Island with</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghostly fingers; they were like embodied</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams which seek release.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Elizabeth wept on, quite unheeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">their silent supplications; wept on, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stars opened timidly like frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes; wept on, while the moon, grinning,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rose up triumphantly as though to say:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, what did I tell you? Here we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other side of the world. Look where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am looking, and you will see something</seg><seg type="columnLine">very strange.

Then she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurry up on deck, her heart beating wildly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">expecting to see the life-boat pull up along-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. At each disappointment, her spirits</seg><seg type="columnLine">would sink again into the darkest depths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of despondency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning she paddled her skiff</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shore and searched the island from end</seg><seg type="columnLine">to end. She returned sadly to the ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the third day all hope deserted her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Straining her eyes across the silver-shod</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea, she saw the island like a sinister red</seg><seg type="columnLine">question-mark standing out against a pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue page. Not a vestige of life was stirring</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. Black Tom's tattered garments--</seg><seg type="columnLine">how dear, how human a symbol after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all!--waved in melancholy triumph over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot, blistering waste of coral.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps it was this still vivid remnant</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a brave man who had gone to his ever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lasting rest, perhaps it was a fine frenzy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of despair, but certain it is that Elizabeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">took her courage in both hands and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">out alone to battle against the whimpus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Very calmly, though with a wildly beat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing heart, she went down to Captain Ben's</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters, ransacked his belongings and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WHIMPUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">turned on deck with a strong fishing-line.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her next problem was to bait the hook</seg><seg type="columnLine">properly. She examined her trinkets, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one, and finally decided on the ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Jay had given her on the day of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">engagement. Why did she choose this ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">among all the others? Was it because she</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved it best; or, perhaps, because it sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolized her love which was as keen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brave as a sword?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elizabeth lowered her bait carefully over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side. Bending forward, she saw it slip</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the water, which was as clear as crys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal; saw it sink down slowly into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths, saw a host of flaming darts shoot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing this way and that--coral fish, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all colors of the rainbow--and finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw it resting on a strip of snow-white</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand. For several minutes she stood there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">immovable, staring down; and then she ut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered a low exultant cry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Several dark gliding shapes began to ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proach the glittering bait. They formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it in a solemn circle as though de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciding. Elizabeth caught a glimpse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly moving tails, beneath a long, silky</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance which trailed out behind and</seg><seg type="columnLine">which glimmered dully. Surely these were</seg><seg type="columnLine">whimpus. She even caught a glimpse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an outstretched, avaricious claw. What was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that held them back? Why didn't they</seg><seg type="columnLine">bite?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She leaned forward further still and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the answer to her question mirrored on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">placid water. Her own face looked back</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her. Yes, evidently the whimpus had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen her. Now they were pointing upward</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their clawlike fingers, now they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">stealing off in a stately procession. Soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps they are as afraid of me as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was afraid of them," Elizabeth told herself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This thought gave her a new confidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a new idea. Pulling the line up, hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">over hand, she hurried into her cabin, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening one of the port-holes wide, threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">her bait out into the sea. Then she seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself and waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In her present position she could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen from the water. If they had not gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">too far away, perhaps they would return</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and nibble, now that she had disappeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At any rate, it was just possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For five minutes, ten minutes, Elizabeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat as silent as a statue, with a white face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flashing eyes; and then, just as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to pull the line in and cast again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she felt a violent jerk which nearly pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to her feet. The line had suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown taut and it took all her strength to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then the struggle began. Elizabeth</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an athletic girl. Her muscles served</seg><seg type="columnLine">her well that day. Little by little, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasping breath and straining arms, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought it out. Often she gained a yard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to lose it again. But now her fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing blood was up; she knew no weakness</seg><seg type="columnLine">or fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually, inch by inch, the girl drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whimpus to the surface of the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then above it. Now it was dangling</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air; now it shot through the port-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole like an arrow and fell, flapping and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratching, to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, at last, the whimpus relinquished</seg><seg type="columnLine">its frenzied hold on the glittering bait.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moving its small, round head from side to</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, it clawed its tangle of golden hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its face and stared at Elizabeth. Slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly the large blue eyes became dilated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear, the large loose-lipped mouth fell open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">disclosing sharp yellow fangs, the tail</seg><seg type="columnLine">flapped wildly, and both claws were raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">on high like terror-stricken hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Elizabeth looked at this monster</seg><seg type="columnLine">concocted in the laboratories of the sea--at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this creature, half fish and half vampire;</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this composition of scales and flesh--</seg><seg type="columnLine">with horror, it is true, but without fear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her imagination had long ago pictured it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had seen it so often in her dreams, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">now the reality was not so difficult to view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And thus it was that a woman and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whimpus faced each other for the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time since the world began--while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clock in the cabin ticked on contentedly;</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the chairs presented their stolid</seg><seg type="columnLine">wicker backs like disinterested strangers;</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the sea, as though amused at what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw, tickled the yacht's sides, and, laugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing merrily, sped by.</seg><seg type="columnLine">58</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TREASURE TROVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Elizabeth was the first to act. a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">colossal calmness had descended upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">her which had crystallized her every</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, her every sensation, into a well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formulated plan. She must not fail now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She realized with a perfect clarity of vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all her hopes of ultimate happiness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her life and the lives of her dear ones, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended on an immediate exertion of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental and physical powers. She loathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">this abysmal monster on the floor with both</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fleshly and spiritual loathing, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">must not falter in her self-appointed task.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a large wicker lunch-basket</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the chair beside her. Picking it up, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised the lid and took a step forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the whimpus, which, up to this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been in an attitude of frozen horror,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its clawlike hands raised above its head--</seg><seg type="columnLine">now seemed to read its adversary's intent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hissing faintly, its fishy eyes covered by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray film of fear, it squirmed backward as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elizabeth advanced till finally its flapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail touched the wall. There it paused and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with gnashing teeth and extended nails,</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaited the attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the girl did not hesitate. Stepping</seg><seg type="columnLine">bravely forward, she bent down and at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted to force the creature into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunch-basket. Hissing, it squirmed to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side and escaped. Once more she essayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her task; and this time the whimpus's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp teeth were embedded for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now a blind fury drove Elizabeth on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As she felt the sudden pain, her left hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the monster's throat and tightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">there till it relinquished its hold to gasp</seg><seg type="columnLine">for breath, till its tongue protruded like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarlet streamer, till its eyes were nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">popping from its head. And then she lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">it from the floor; lifted it and held it at</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm's length. Her fingers, like steel rings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still encircled its slender throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as the whimpus's pale, leprous face</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned scarlet, as its blood-shot eyes rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward till nothing was visible of them but</seg><seg type="columnLine">their crimson-threaded whites, she relaxed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her hold. It would never do to kill it out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. It must serve her first; it must guide</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to her loved ones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The whimpus squirmed only very feebly</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. Elizabeth had no difficulty in placing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in the lunch-basket, where it lay flapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly. .Her next task was to tie the fish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-line securely about its waist, where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fish's tail joined the woman's body. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">it could not escape, but its swimming pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers would remain unimpeded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She then closed the lid on her prisoner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">secured it, and carried the lunch-basket up</seg><seg type="columnLine">on deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She tied a handkerchief about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound, and climbed down the ladder, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding the lunch-basket, and into the skiff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slipping the oars into place, she bent her</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong, supple back to the task and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon propelling the boat swiftly toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the skiff was finally grounded on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shore, she sprang out with all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerness of one who goes willingly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elizabeth opened the lunch-basket and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew out the whimpus. The monster by</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time had regained some of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength. As she held it suspended in mid</seg><seg type="columnLine">air on the end of the fishing-line, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">squirmed frantically, gnashed its teeth, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">emitted a strange hissing sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment she swung it back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth to see that the line held; then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw it from her into the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first the whimpus swam straight out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with incredible swiftness--so fast, indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was put to it to give it free play</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but after it had traversed a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards or so, it turned and began to creep</seg><seg type="columnLine">back further down the shore. Fortunately</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fishing-line was very long; but, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, she was soon forced to follow it along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In this way Elizabeth half circled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island. At last she came to a tangle of salt</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass which grew in profusion against one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the coral cliffs. To her amazement the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fishing-line passed through this tangle as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the creature on the other end had clam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered back on shore. And yet this seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WHIMPUS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">59</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible, for the shoulder of the island</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this point was precipitous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As she paused before the green, swaying</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of salt grass, there came another tug</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the line which showed her that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whimpus was still in active flight. Pushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nodding sea-foliage aside with her left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, she uttered an ejaculation of sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There, in the coral wall, was a cave hol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed out as though by human hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Undoubtedly this subterranean passage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way led into the very heart of the island.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps the whimpus was leading her into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the treasure-chamber where, dead or alive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she might find the missing passengers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Adventurer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elizabeth, with a wild beating heart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped through the dark portal and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately swallowed up in the gloom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not a light glimmered; soon the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cave was lost to view. Walking in</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitch blackness, a stream of running water</seg><seg type="columnLine">above her ankles, the taut line leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">her forward as a blind man is guided by</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding to the leash of some intelligent</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog, she stumbled on for a hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">or more. Suddenly a strange sound came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her out of the darkness far ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elizabeth paused and listened, in spite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a sudden angry tug on her wrist. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was again--only louder now. A drowsy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">humming sound it was, followed almost im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately by a loud snort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is no telling whether Elizabeth could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have mustered up enough courage to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">further had not the whimpus at that mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment given the line such a frenzied jerk</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was carried forward a step in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of herself. This step was the decid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one. There was no use turning back</seg><seg type="columnLine">now. Behind her lay loneliness, starvation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">death; before her? Well, that might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">quicker, at any rate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The frightened girl waded onward</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the blackness, while the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds grew louder and louder. Now a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray shaft of light stole around a bend in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passage. She reached it; she turned an</seg><seg type="columnLine">brupt shoulder of rock and uttered a cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">vvhich echoed through the vault. She was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">destined never to forget the sight which</seg><seg type="columnLine">met her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The passageway here terminated in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spacious hall. Through a fissure in the ceil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, javelins of flaming sunlight poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on a strip of shimmering sand which</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely raised its head above the shallow</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. And on this sand, piled up in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittering heap and indiscriminately min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled, were precious stones, pieces of colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass, yellow bars of gold, brass door-knobs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a child's toy sword, several helmets which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soldiers of Caesar might have worn, rat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tles with colored beads, a crown set with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic emeralds which might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">adorned some fair Egyptian's brow. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">one and all caught the shafts of sunlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reflected them, casting a luminous light</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the dark, dripping walls and on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale sheet of water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not the sight of these precious</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones and glittering gewgaws which wrung</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cry from Elizabeth. No, it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">group which sat about this treasure in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemn circle--these men, with their chins</seg><seg type="columnLine">resting on their breasts; these skeletons</seg><seg type="columnLine">from whom hung in tatters the clothing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an earlier age; these gleaming skulls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moldy thigh-bones, more aged relics still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which time had crumbled into little pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dery heaps beneath the weight of its relent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less hand. And also it was that outer ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">of custodians which guarded both--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">swimming ring of whimpus, whirling round</seg><seg type="columnLine">and round in a magic circle and emitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">that strange, unearthly humming sound as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they went--those singular creatures that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were neither brute nor human, their large</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue eyes fixed with a glassy stare on what</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested on that strip of sand, their long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden hair floating behind them in a filmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">gauze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Scarcely had Elizabeth's cry echoed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the chamber than a change took</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. The humming died away as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">by magic. Now a hundred pairs of terror-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken eyes were turned on her, a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred pairs of terror-stricken clawlike hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">were raised on high, a hundred scaly tails</seg><seg type="columnLine">churned the water into foam. Once, twice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whimpus sped around the strip of sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">60</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and then straight toward her and the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sageway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She floundered to one side; the fishing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line dropped from her nerveless hand. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">next instant they were past her, gliding by</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly and out into the passageway. Leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a trail of foam, they vanished in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom. She was left entirely alone with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, ah, no, they were not all dead!</seg><seg type="columnLine">What was that? Surely it was a human</seg><seg type="columnLine">snore--a snore so awe-inspiring, so sonor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous, that from a distance it had seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snorting of an animal in pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elizabeth stepped cautiously forward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The light reflected from the heap of treas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure was blinding. She shaded her eyes with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Could it be? Yes, it was. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt about it. The snorer was Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ben! There he sat, his cavernous mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaping, his hairy fists doubled on his knees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And next to him, his head resting on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, a strang expression of physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">loathing on his face, sat--Jay! Surely there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was her father on his right, sleeping sound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, his chin resting on his breast! And the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other sleepers were the crew of the Adven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turer. None were dead as yet--thank God!</seg><seg type="columnLine">--not one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Elizabeth put her hand on Captain Ben's</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder and shook him. "Wake up!" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">cried. "Wake up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man's stentorian snore ceased on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the instant. He raised his face and Eliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beth saw that it was bedewed with perpira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. "Don't you touch me!" he muttered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Can't you see I'm an old man? I--I--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's Bessie!" the girl cried. "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly the light of recognition flared</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in the old fisherman's eyes. "Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">missy," he said feebly, like a frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">child, "take me out of here. I want to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, missy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Elizabeth was shaking Jay. "Wake</seg><seg type="columnLine">up! Wake up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young man opened his gray eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh!" he cried. "Get me out of here!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Oh, Bessie, dearest girl, it's you! You don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what a horrible dream I've had!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Elizabeth had turned to her father</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wake up, dad!" she cried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you want?" the financier</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered. "Oh, Dolly, Dolly, shameful</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolly!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wake up, dad!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then Mr. Wilkinson opened his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stared solemnly at his daughter. "I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a nightmare, Bessie," he said. "Get</seg><seg type="columnLine">me out of here if you can. I'm about all</seg><seg type="columnLine">in! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Elizabeth woke the others first.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Masters and his crew. Last of all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she came to Bill Farley. He was sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside a skeleton which still wore a tat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered sailorsuit. The cockney had a senti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental smile playing beneath his bulbous</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose. One of his arms were buried to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elbow in a heap of precious stones; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other clasped the body of a dead whimpus</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his breast. His eyes were swallowed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavernous hollows; his lips were a chalky</seg><seg type="columnLine">white.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wake up!" Elizabeth cried bravely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although the man's face frightened her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wake up!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bill Farley was silent. But his smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadened and twitched his upper lip</seg><seg type="columnLine">above two yellow fangs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wake up!" she cried again, shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">him violently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sailor did not move, but his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickered open for an instant. "I 'ears you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ma'am," he said very faintly. "Call louder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ma'am.

Sleek, intensely black,</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft hair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">70</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was the composition of her fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures that made a click in my mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm nuts about museums. Give me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">museum and I can wander there a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, happily and oddly excited by these</seg><seg type="columnLine">collected tangible inheritances from an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient peoples who were human the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we are human, but who thought, acted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed differently; who perhaps pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed strange knowledges which we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">never possess again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Therefore I knew Brenda Karpen at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once. I had seen those features--not pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cisely the same ones, but the same un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistakable type--many times before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carved in stone and copied from death</seg><seg type="columnLine">masks of queens of the Nile, of Assyria,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Babylon. Features strong yet delicate, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose straight, the proportions beautifully</seg><seg type="columnLine">classic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Brenda's possession of them might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been rare among women, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly not unique. Look around you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The races are mixed now, and confused,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the flawless features of the ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">queens have never died. The girls are</seg><seg type="columnLine">generally Syrian, Jewish, Armenian--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can find them anywhere, among Mexi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can Indians, in France, Spain, Russia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Park Avenue or the slums of Boston.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How long has this been going on?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Karpen lifted his eyelids and I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spark was there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How long do you think?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My spine was ice again but I said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Two thousand years. You will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">many wives waiting for you, Karpen, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">each will be a copy of the others."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said with a deep sadness, "I--hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">they do not wait. I've instructed Brenda</seg><seg type="columnLine">she must--not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She smiled. It was sweet, enigmatic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret. The nearest thing to the Mona</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lisa smile I'd ever seen. "What little</seg><seg type="columnLine">time you've had for me, Karpen, will be'</seg><seg type="columnLine">always in my heart," she said. "I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have a child of yours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It won't be like me," he said. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">child will die when his time has come."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Listen!" I screamed, because now I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that I had to know. "Who are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stared at me and replied dully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, merely Karpen. A Jew."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I STAYED there till Christmas Eve. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept on a couch and thought not once</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the office. My spirit was filled with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounting, swelling dread. Not for Brenda.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She, I discovered immediately, was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">rich but she had an income which would</seg><seg type="columnLine">support her, and any child, in comfort,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no matter what happened to Karpen him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. But dread of what he might do when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ambassadors assembled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We left Brenda's apartment only once</seg><seg type="columnLine">during that period, and then to visit an</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclusive men's store. There Karpen out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitted himself from head to foot in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">finest evening clothes the place could</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply, and insisted that I purchase simi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar gear for myself. The salesman who</seg><seg type="columnLine">attended to our wants scarcely opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mouth. His air was one of fascination,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his face was white and troubled, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he ought to remember Karpen but</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And indeed, the fact that such a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark man with the build and rugged coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenance of a laborer, the bald head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wide knobby brow of a wise and an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient spirit, should require the formal</seg><seg type="columnLine">tails of highest society, doubtless was</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to silence any salesman. And if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he failed to lose his troubled look even</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we departed--well, I suppose very</seg><seg type="columnLine">few persons would remember and identify</seg><seg type="columnLine">any convict, not having known him per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonally, after newspapers had declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">him officially dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just why are we doing this?" I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">growled when the man left us alone a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Karpen replied slowly, with an odd dig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nity, "I, too, shall be an ambassador of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great One, and we must do Him honor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We must not appear less well provisioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">--than the others."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afterward, when I had written it down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thought it over, it sounded unnatural,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stilted, a trifle absurd. But I wrote it down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way he said it and that was it. "I,</seg><seg type="columnLine">KARPEN THE JEW</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">71</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">too, shall be the ambassador of a Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">One," Karpen said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Afraid? I was plenty afraid. Each meal</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, food and wine would appear on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brenda's table. She refused to permit any</seg><seg type="columnLine">contribution from me, and Karpen of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered none, and then Christmas Eve had</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived and we set forth--tail-coated, top-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatted, caped, gloved. Just Karpen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I. All day Brenda had been very gay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then inexpressibly sad, by turn. She kissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Karpen goodbye, a kiss even more intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that first one I had unwillingly wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nessed, and held him off by his shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking into his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You won't be back, Karpen?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miserably he shook his great head. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have--so much to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We walked. The night was crisp, clear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">chill. The stars shone bright and a slivver</seg><seg type="columnLine">of moon hung in the night sky and we did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hasten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Karpen asked suddenly, "How old are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thirty-five. You know that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded. He counted back, on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers. "The last one ended in 1918. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">were--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fourteen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A Boy Scout?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah," I said. "I sold Liberty Bonds</seg><seg type="columnLine">going from one office to the next. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a Boy Scout uniform, I was a runt for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my age, 1 had a lot of badges, an Eagle</seg><seg type="columnLine">badge, and 1 sold plenty of bonds."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OU don't know how it was, then,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Karpen said and his voice was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword, steel, bitterly slashing. "The next</seg><seg type="columnLine">men never remember, never know till</seg><seg type="columnLine">they see new killing, themselves. A few</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their fellows turn into animals, ruth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, themselves safe, slavering with power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lust. The few start the bands, the flags.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wave the flags, blow the trumpets, beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drums. A few start the new men, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next crop who don't remember, again into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the killing. No, you're a new one and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you don't remember. Nothing of the hush</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospitals, where bodies which are only</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunks of living meat still do live in this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">day, souvenirs of violence which the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">men are not permitted to see. Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dawn, and young men whimpering</seg><seg type="columnLine">or savage in mud and filth and vermin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry, afraid, awaiting zero. Awaiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dreadful top tick of. a watch, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambling up, slipping and scrambling in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud, the air screaming and bursting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves quiet, only the rifles blasting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves moving to death, to dreadful</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn flesh and shattered bone. Themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">become animals when they ought to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">at home, safe, working, loving their lovely</seg><seg type="columnLine">young women, children and dogs in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a fire. Music and warmth and peace</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wine and sunlight, all gone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you going to do, Karpen?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I muttered urgently. "Your grammar is</seg><seg type="columnLine">punk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't reply. The Mark Hopkins. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered an elevator, ourselves the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">passengers that trip, and Karpen said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sixth floor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The boy stopped the car in front of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blank wall. "You can't go there, sir,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. "You must have made a mistake."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Karpen's eyes seemed to glow. His chin</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a rock. "No mistake," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The frightened boy let us out at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixth floor. The corridors contained per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps two dozen men of assorted nationali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties. Well-dressed; but tough and hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed men, for all that. Secret police, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To my astonishment we walked directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the swarming guards and not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">let his glance stop on us, not one at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempted to block us. We might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible. I--think we were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Karpen took a key from one of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pockets and opened a door. 1 followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him through one room empty even of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rugs and furniture and into a second.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The second room was long, big. At a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">table the conference of the ambassadors</seg><seg type="columnLine">was already in session.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Karpen and I selected two chairs against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearest wall and sat down. Nobody</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned a head. Nobody, in fact, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">even to be aware of our presence till</seg><seg type="columnLine">Karpen acted, hours later.</seg><seg type="columnLine">72</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Right now John Albertson was speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Later the others spoke, sweated, bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained, approached exhaustion and refused</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, spoke again. I think my mouth soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have dropped open, and stayed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, because afterward I needed a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bahkmeteff was there, representative of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new dictator of the Union of Socialist</seg><seg type="columnLine">Soviet Republics. Callieri was there, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Italy. Prince Taguchi, from Japan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sturmer, a tall German with a monocle, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse face, and utterly blank blue eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each man acting not for his people, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his master.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no single dictator in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States; only a dictating group, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">oligarchy. Given continued peace, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States eventually might overwhelm</seg><seg type="columnLine">its oligarchy and become truly demo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cratic. Therefore John Albertson was there</seg><seg type="columnLine">also, representing not the President nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people of the United States, but him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self and his group--cunning men who un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstood the waving of flags and the beat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of drums, for profit and personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They used English, in the cultured and</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversational tones of gentlemen. So it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't their tones that dropped my mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">open. It was the things they said, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible calm meanings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">OF COURSE I had known that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern major conflict ever occurs</seg><seg type="columnLine">unprecedented by definite agreements be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween all powers which may be affected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Later any conflict may get out of hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but its beginning is always a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">premeditation and not of passion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Yet I had never watched the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chinery mesh. The ambassadors of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great abhor newspapermen whom they</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot control. Yet there I was, beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">Karpen the Jew, and the ambassadors in</seg><seg type="columnLine">cultured voices were calmly and cunningly</seg><seg type="columnLine">trading in violence, in the lands, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth, the human lives and blood of other</seg><seg type="columnLine">nations. They calmly estimated how many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their own men would be slaughtered</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the various fronts of attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The presence of Bahkmeteff, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had amazed me most. Callieri and Taguchi</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Sturmer--fanatic fascists. In the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">world war the fascists must inevitably</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight all the rest of the world but mainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the communists, as they fought so long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">horribly in Spain. And yet here, in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel room, these fascist leaders were mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing parley with the enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For peace?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I must have been quite unsophisticated</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night, to have felt even that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">tingling thrill of hope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Because these men had assembled not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to avoid blood and death, but to cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and agree upon the details of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">manufacture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As you know, gentlemen," Bahkmeteff</seg><seg type="columnLine">said suavely, "war, to the Russian dic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tator, is an immediate necessity." Lately,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reminded them, handwriting had ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared upon the wall. Lately the Russian</seg><seg type="columnLine">people had demanded that no more food-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuffs be exported from the Soviet Union.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A demand which had risen after two dec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ades of cruel, animal-like labor, raising</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous crops only to watch those</seg><seg type="columnLine">crops dumped into foreign world markets</seg><seg type="columnLine">at ruinous prices in exchange for machinery</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the Russians might use but cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly could not eat. A demand so ugly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that wisely it had been granted, at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the present. But war would lift the</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds of the Russians off their bellies</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and only war.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mussolini and Hitler, too, were totter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. The Ethiopian burlesque was past</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Italy long ago had seized that luck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less African land for its oil.

The Germans were</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested, Sturmer said, primarily in</seg><seg type="columnLine">France, Belgium, and Southern Africa,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but would attack Russia as a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">form, not really concentrating any force</seg><seg type="columnLine">there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oh, the ambassadors, personally, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">John Albertson, were safe enough in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">planning. Not one of them, not one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dictators for whom the ambassadors</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke, ever would see an actual firing</seg><seg type="columnLine">line. They were as impersonal as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were playing chess. War-is always</seg><seg type="columnLine">impersonal to those who start it. It be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes personal only to those hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thousands of younger men who get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bullets in their guts; and then John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Albertson was speaking again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE bands and the flags were ready,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said. Geniuses of publicity--ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">also. Nothing would be simpler, to trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">propagandists using an oligarchic press, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">orators and politicians, than hurling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States into war--on either side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Karpen bent toward me and his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was stiff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have heard," he said.

John Albert-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son was moving across the thick carpet</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward a window and when Karpen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jew had brought him there, Karpen de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberately withdrew one strangling hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and got the window open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he looked down upon Albertson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sadly, and--I thought--compassionately.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the deliberation of an automaton</seg><seg type="columnLine">Karpen lifted John Albertson high, held</seg><seg type="columnLine">him squirming and screaming thus a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, and flung him into space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Albertson's screams diminished and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, abruptly, sickeningly, ceased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Karpen turned and faced the ambassa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dors.

I say</seg><seg type="columnLine">phosphorescent light, for that is the nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">word I can find to describe it--a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiation, quite different from the reflected</seg><seg type="columnLine">light to which we are accustomed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I said that the hollows inside of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave were blackness.

In</seg><seg type="columnLine">no way did it differ in appearance from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid part, except that its surface seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be in motion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another curious thing was the outlines</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all the shapes in view.

You see</seg><seg type="columnLine">something like it when looking at an object</seg><seg type="columnLine">through water--only, of course, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no distortion.

The problem,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, was to find a chemical, sufficiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">unharmful to life, that would so act upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body cells as to cause a reduction in</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulk, without changing their shape. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to secure a uniform and also a proportion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate rate of contraction of each cell, in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to have the body shape altered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After a comparatively small amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">research work, I encountered an apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">insurmountable obstacle. As you know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentlemen, our living human bodies are</seg><seg type="columnLine">held together by the power of the central</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligence we call the mind. Every instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">during your lifetime your subconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind is commanding and directing the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividual life of each cell that makes up</seg><seg type="columnLine">your body. At death this power is with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn; each cell is thrown under its own</seg><seg type="columnLine">individual command, and dissolution of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body takes place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I found, therefore, that I could not act</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the cells separately, so long as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were under control of the mind.

I devoted my time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, to finding a chemical that would tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porarily withhold, during the period of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell-contraction, the power of the subcon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious mind, just as the power of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious mind is withheld by hypnotism.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am not going to weary you by trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lead you through the maze of chemical</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiments into which I plunged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I worked on rabbits almost exclusively.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a few weeks I succeeded in com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely suspending animation in one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them for several hours.

He opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers, showing two small vials. "I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">made them as you see, in the form of tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">pills, each containing a minute quantity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drug.

And again I con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived myself but six feet tall, standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">above a dainty little toy world.

I think the careful way</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which I picked my course, stepping in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open as much as possible, helped re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">assure the people.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">country here wras crossed by a winding river</seg><seg type="columnLine">running in a general way at right angles to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my line of progress. At the right, near at</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and on the nearer bank of the river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay a little city, perhaps half the size of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arite, with its back up against a hill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What first attracted my attention was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that from a dark patch across the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">which seemed to be the woods, pebbles ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to pop up at intervals, traversing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little arc perhaps as high as my knees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and falling into the city. I watched for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment and then I understood. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a seige in progress, and the catapults</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Malites were bombarding the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rocks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I went up a few steps closer, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pebbles stopped coming.

Inert little fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures lay in the streets, and I bent lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">and inserted my thumb and forefinger be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween a row of houses and picked one up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the budy of a woman, partly</seg><seg type="columnLine">mashed.

At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of her I was struck with a sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">fit of anger. I flung the pebble violently</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into the wooded patch and leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the river in one bound, landing square-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly on both feet in the woods.

Then I walked back to Arite,</seg><seg type="columnLine">again picking my way carefully among</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowds of the Oroids, who now feared me</seg><seg type="columnLine">so little that I had difficulty in moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">without stepping upon them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When I had regained my former size,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which needed two successive doses of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drug, I found myself surrounded by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd of the Oroids, pushing and shoving</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other in an effort to get closer to me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The news of my success over their enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been divined by them, evidently.

He lay still, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed as he half-remembered his last</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours of consciousness. Buala, the witch</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor--the emerald god that had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from tribe to tribe and from father to son</seg><seg type="columnLine">through untold ages until it fell into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Buala's custody--his days of haggling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cajoling, with Buala adamant in his super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stitious faith in the emerald god's magic</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leif Abbot had wanted that treasure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he couldn't get it by more or less</seg><seg type="columnLine">legitimate -means, he took it by theft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In spite of his African adventures, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, he had underestimated the emerald's</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence and prestige. He awoke one night</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find his own carriers attacking him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear the throb of drums. He escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the jewel, but his porters and guides</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted him, taking all his supplies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could have followed the river, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have taken him downstream</seg><seg type="columnLine">through hostile villages that he now could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not pass through and live. He chose the</seg><seg type="columnLine">southward course toward the headwaters</seg><seg type="columnLine">and open country, where he had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumors about two white men whom the</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives called "Witch-Makers." Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the nightmare of his flight through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the green hell, the insect hordes, fever,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirst, hunger, and finally delirium. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered nothing from that point on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His thoughts growing clearer each mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, he opened his eyes.

He was lying on his side on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. Bars interfered with his vision, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw two white men in the interior of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tent, and--lying upon an operating</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, his own body!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leif Abbot closed his eyes in a daze.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He must be dead or in the grip of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lirium still.

Un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to balance on his legs, he toppled</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazily and fell with a jarring thud. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">head throbbed. A moan of pain came</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his lips--but to his ears it sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the whimper of an animal!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The room reeled around in his vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he fell. His head lowered, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunned gaze fastened upon the padded</seg><seg type="columnLine">paws of a beast, and black-furred legs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They seemed part of him. He stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a hand, and stared in the hypnotism</seg><seg type="columnLine">of horror as a paw scraped the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">where his hand should have been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a timeless drag of eternity he lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">immobile, trying to figure some mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out of the strange distortion of things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was not dead, because he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">disembodied, yet he stood apart from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rightful body which lay beyond the bars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The cage inclosed a beast; and he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As his thoughts skittered through this</seg><seg type="columnLine">new, waking nightmare he became con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious of a voice.

He heard a fly crawl on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas of the tent. When the second man</seg><seg type="columnLine">tilted his pipe, he heard fingers rasp on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bowl, and a rustle as of raindrops</seg><seg type="columnLine">when some ashes fell to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Leif Abbot, if you are Leif Abbot, can</seg><seg type="columnLine">you hear me?" asked the booming voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The beast in the cage scrambled to all</seg><seg type="columnLine">fours and swayed against the bars. Glar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sullenly out, he lowered and raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before the speaker could continue, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a wild interruption. Leif Abbot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking through the bars, saw his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffen on the operating table. The eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened with an expression of animal fero-</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. Ropes bound the body, but it burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ropes with a surge of strength that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leif Abbot in all his life had not equaled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mouth parted, but from that human</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat came a snarl born of the jungle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The body hurtled across the tent in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring of an animal, teeth bared, arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">outstretched like paws ready to rip and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gouge. The white men scattered and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds a furious battle raged. The white</seg><seg type="columnLine">men won, but only because Leif Abbot's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body was too exhausted to endure the ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rific strain put upon it by the untamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit within.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the struggle ended, the body lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless under the influence of an opi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate. The taller of the men, the one with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waving black beard, painted their</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratches and wounds with iodine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After he had finished, he turned again</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the cage. "I am Dr. Burton. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">colleague is Dr. Travers, a physicist and</seg><seg type="columnLine">biochemist. We have been engaged in ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periments here for several months. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">you staggered half dead into our camp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were compelled to adopt extreme meas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ures or you would already be dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do not be alarmed. Whatever seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible to you is really very simple. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have discovered how to separate the life-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream or consciousness or whatever you</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to call it from the body to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">it belongs, and to effect an exchange with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some other body. Thus far we have worked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">only with the lower vertebrates. In your</seg><seg type="columnLine">case, your chances for survival as Leif</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abbot were so small that we operated upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the six layers of your cerebral cortex and</seg><seg type="columnLine">transferred your identity to the body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strong and healthy black panther. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">panther's identity now occupies your own</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick and weakened body. By this inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">change we hope to strengthen your body</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficiently so that your identity can later</seg><seg type="columnLine">be restored to it, with better chances for</seg><seg type="columnLine">your recovery and survival.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In the meantime the door to your cage</seg><seg type="columnLine">is open behind you.

You have all the intelligence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and all the senses and instincts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big cats. You should be able to avoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">any danger and survive any attack."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leif Abbot attempted to answer, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a rumbling growl issued from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat. His new vocal cords either were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not capable of speech or would require</seg><seg type="columnLine">long practice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The greenish yellow eyes of the panther</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowered his mute hatred. Burton's glib</seg><seg type="columnLine">explanation failed to satisfy him. Not for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant did he believe Blackbeard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his companion. They wanted the emerald</seg><seg type="columnLine">god for which he had risked his life. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">poorly paid scientist would pass up such</seg><seg type="columnLine">an opportunity for easy wealth? They</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't have courage enough to let him die</seg><seg type="columnLine">or to kill him. But it would be murder</seg><seg type="columnLine">just the same, in a different form, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">protracted, and under the guise of science.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither Burton nor Travers spoke again</seg><seg type="columnLine">They watched him in silence; and he in</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn glared balefully from them to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerald that still lay among his effects,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its glitter matched by the smoldering flame</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turbulent emotions swept him. Hatred</seg><seg type="columnLine">rankled at the back of his thoughts. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to adjust himself to his weird change</seg><seg type="columnLine">of state. He plotted a dozen ways of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricking them in order to regain possesion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his treasure, but he hopelessly confused</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lost resources as man and his as yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown abilities as panther. Forgetting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his new form momentarily, he tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">108</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp the bars of the cage, but his paws</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely slid along the bars. He had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers to help him now. He had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">before appreciated so fully the infinite</seg><seg type="columnLine">utility of hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Probably they were merely awaiting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">departure into the jungle before killing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the panther-spirit that now occupied his</seg><seg type="columnLine">real body. And there was absolutely noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing he could do for the present, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">take their advice before they changed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds. He might be doomed to die in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle, but while he lived he could scheme</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways of vengeance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stared for the last time at his captors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then turned and bounded into the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE BLACK MARAUDER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE rest of the night, all the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, and the following night the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">panther remained away.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">panther, its right hind leg broken, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleeding from numerous wounds, dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself forward. It did not whimper. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">glazing eyes still burned with sultry hatred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rebellion though death fast approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Travers, quick!"

He watched anx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iously, tugging at his beard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Travers shook his head in doubt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Afraid it's too late.

The brute thirst</seg><seg type="columnLine">faded from the eyes of Leif Abbot as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">human identity re-entered his body. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam of sanity and intelligence lingered</seg><seg type="columnLine">for seconds, gradually to be replaced by</seg><seg type="columnLine">an expression of trance-like repose and sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pended will-power when the drugs took</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burton heaved a deep sigh.

As a man I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't identify more than a part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. I had half-memories that didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite bridge the gap between my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge and the panther's instincts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">habits.

Finally he sighed</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply. "I resent it after a fashion, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he should be first to have so remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">an experience," he murmured.

The recollection was mixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with fever and the impression of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightmare in which he had somehow been</seg><seg type="columnLine">imprisoned in the body of a panther. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a harrowing nightmare, too graphic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vivid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Among his haze of thoughts drifted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces of two white men who proclaimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves scientists but who mastered</seg><seg type="columnLine">demoniac arts. Leif Abbot had an uncer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain feeling that he had talked to them at</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable length, but he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine what he had talked to them about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was all hopelessly involved. He tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">vainly to force the pictures into a consecu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive sequence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he blinked his eyes open and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw his own body still lying upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operating table, he felt only the dull un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">happiness of one who has already been</seg><seg type="columnLine">shocked into numbness. Assailed by fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodings, he looked down. His head moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">with singularly abrupt and sudden jerks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he saw the talons, the thin, horny</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs, and the feathered body of a bird of</seg><seg type="columnLine">prey, he screamed his fury. The result was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a croak, harsh and forbidding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Travers had left the tent.

"Another triumph, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete success!

Return when you will, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would advise you not to remain away</seg><seg type="columnLine">for any extended period."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leif Abbot had an insensate urge to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fly straight at that ruddy face, hook</seg><seg type="columnLine">his talons in the bushy black beard, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peck at the man's eves. But out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">turmoil of his emotions, out of the need</seg><seg type="columnLine">for radically readjusting himself to his en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vironment, one thought stood clear. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity other than the one specified</seg><seg type="columnLine">had beert unintentionally given him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With mental prayers that Burton would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not divine his purpose, he used his beak</seg><seg type="columnLine">to push the cage door aside.

By the easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">response, he knew that the bird's natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">motions and habits had carried over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He struck instantly. A swoop brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">him over the emerald figurine that lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">among his belongings. He hovered, clutched</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in his talons, and sailed for the tent</seg><seg type="columnLine">flap. Burton lunged after him, shouting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come back here! Drop that, you idiot!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His wing-tips grazed the canvas and</seg><seg type="columnLine">deflected his course. Burton almost caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with him, but his outstretched hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">just missed the eagle's tail feathers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the bird soared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A bullet buzzed by. Leif Abbot heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a loud report. He squinted earthward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Travers had appeared from nowhere. Run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning toward the tent, he whipped out his</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver and was emptying it at the flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">target. There could be no doubt of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose. Only the emerald could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought such greed to his eyes. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to kill the eagle and the mortal</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit of Leif Abbot if necessary to prevent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loss of that treasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LEIF ABBOT swooped, swerved, darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in erratic arcs, mounted suddenly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">side-slipped, nose-dived, and straightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. No ordinary marksman could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit so crazily veering a target. Only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracle could have enabled even a superb</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot to halt the eagle. Travers was not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marksman, and chance did not provide</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the miracle. His bullets went wide of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bird. With his last triumphant glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a scream of mirthless mockery, Abbot</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Burton struggling to wrest the pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Travers, a useless struggle now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weapon was empty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The figurine did not weigh enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove a hindrance. After the first thrill of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight and escape, he forgot about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">prize. He felt a stronger emotion. A rap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture gripped him, an ecstasy unlike any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing he had yet known.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many times during his life, when watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the wild ducks fly south on the Mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Western prairies in autumn, while staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at seagulls as they circled a ship, or ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miring the lightning-like speed of hum-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mingbirds as they darted toward honey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers, he had envied the birds their</seg><seg type="columnLine">winged freedom. He reveled in that free-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom now. He rose ever higher, his strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings beating the way aloft. It took less</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort than he had imagined, for his wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">slanted automatically to receive the full</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifting power of every gust of wind and</seg><seg type="columnLine">utilize each upward eddy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt like a spirit liberated from all</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly ties. The jungle became only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark mass below him. The landscape un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">folded toward farther horizons. Trees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks, and water holes lost their indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viduality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ground evolved into masses and</seg><seg type="columnLine">areas, a darker carpet for the jungle, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighter area for the plain, a sun-capped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow-filled mass for the mountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found himself flying toward those</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant peaks that rimmed the northeast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern horizon. In the midst of his breathless</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoyment and elation, he wondered why</seg><seg type="columnLine">his course came so easily. Then he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered a previous experience, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">guessed that the nest of the eagle lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere among those towering crags</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gorges.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was about to change his line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight when his far-sighting gaze was drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the puzzling actions of three birds. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">birds swooped to earth in single file, rose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looped over, and dipped again. It dawned</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him that the birds were airplanes miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant; and their maneuvers could best</seg><seg type="columnLine">be explained if they were indulging in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">luxury of ground-strafing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fifteen minutes later, drifting at an</seg><seg type="columnLine">altitude of approximately a mile, he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">his surmise correct. The airplanes, fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombers equipped with machine guns, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently resorted to ground-strafing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of any considerable target worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombing. He estimated the region to lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty miles north of where he had met</seg><seg type="columnLine">the raiding column the day before. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only a guess, for small landmarks</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be distinguished at all from bis</seg><seg type="columnLine">height, and the large ones he viewed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a different perspective.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gorges, basaltic extrusions, lava flows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">116</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and jagged hills formed the terrain, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though a giant hand had built turrets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered massive blocks in random forma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Why any nation should want that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonely, unlovely land mystified him. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his height, however, he detected tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">ants here and there on the hilltops, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawling from bush to bush in the valley</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottoms. He heard the stutter of machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns and saw answering wisps of smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">puff up from the ground. Now and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the ants stopped crawling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spiraled lower, the peril from stray</seg><seg type="columnLine">shots forgotten in the anger that again</seg><seg type="columnLine">welled inside of him. Leif Abbot had more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than one contradiction in his make-up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As a footloose adventurer and trader, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had always been alert to strike a shrewd</seg><seg type="columnLine">bargain when he could; but he was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as eager to leap into fray on the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the underdog when someone else was taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unfair advantage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still circling downward, he wondered if</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was anything he could do about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one-sided battle. His intentness on getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">a closer view and his preoccupation with</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of counter-attack brought him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the danger zone before he realized it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">song of a sky-riding slug passed too close</seg><seg type="columnLine">for comfort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONE of the bombers completed its</seg><seg type="columnLine">power dive and its burst of firing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It zoomed upward for position. Its nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">was tilted toward the eagle. Leif Abbot</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly saw the leather helmets of its crew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a surprised expression behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot's goggles as he noticed the eagle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leif Abbot dropped the emerald figurine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It fell straight to its target.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a crash and a zing. Glitter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing green fragments and a flash of gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaked the air. It was as though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">propeller had rammed a stone wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bomber leaped under its own mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentum, lost speed, and went into a tail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spin. It plunged toward the ground from</seg><seg type="columnLine">its altitude of only a few hundred feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pilot frantically worked the controls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had just got the craft straightened out</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it crashed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All its bombs must have exploded at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the instant of impact. A gigantic fountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flame roared up. Grass and bushes flat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened as a wall of wind rushed in. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">concussion numbed Leif Abbot even be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he felt the skyward surge. The air</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with blasted objects, debris, shards</seg><seg type="columnLine">of metal, bits of flesh. The second bomber,</seg><seg type="columnLine">diving to do its own ground-strafing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wake of the first, was caught over that</seg><seg type="columnLine">inferno, tossed as by invisible hands. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtling missile must have struck the bomb</seg><seg type="columnLine">rack, for the machine disintegrated in an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other great geyser of flame and smoke and</seg><seg type="columnLine">erupting metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He never knew the fate of the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">bomber. Tossed around in the violent cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rents from those blasts, he fought for</seg><seg type="columnLine">control.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the world became quiet. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reel and grow fuzzy. His thoughts be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to wander. How had he managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear at all? So far as he knew, birds were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not equipped with auditory apparatus akin</seg><seg type="columnLine">to man's, yet he had distinctly heard Bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His wings felt sticky. He wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fold them in and plummet to earth. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be so easy. He could straighten out</seg><seg type="columnLine">just before he crashed--but he wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">straighten out any more than the bomber.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He didn't even know if he was flying in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the camp's direction, but he kept to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight line. The emerald was gone. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">should he go on, with the treasure for</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had endured so much shattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a million irrecoverable bits? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">insane impulse had made him throw it</seg><seg type="columnLine">away? At least they wouldn't be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take it away from him now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LEIF ABBOT awakened from a dream</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had been flying through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air and sinking toward the green shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the jungle. He was not at all sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had wakened. Instead of flying, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself in suspension. He floated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not in air, but amid a denser medium. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the shadowy green twilight, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the obscurity of water, not of forests.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beast, bird, fish--what did it matter?</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WITCH-MAKERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">117</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">One nightmare was no worse than another.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had survived the others, and he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">live through this, until the delirium left</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and he opened his eyes again upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world as he knew it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Try as he might, he could not close his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, now that a measure of awareness had</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned.

They had used their fiendish</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery to deprive him of his rightful</seg><seg type="columnLine">body for the third time.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose, dived, circled, wriggled, and spun</seg><seg type="columnLine">around until he was dizzy with exaspera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.

He could not turn his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had they placed him in the headwaters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground springs, that formed the source</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the river he had followed in his orig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inal flight? He became aware of a gentle</seg><seg type="columnLine">lazy current, and allowed himself to drift</seg><seg type="columnLine">along.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The water swarmed with life.

You turned that</seg><seg type="columnLine">confounded stream into our faces, and--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why bless my soul--I didn't see you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">122</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">said Zenophon Xerxes Zapt; "not until</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was too late--that is--then I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw you--and then you disappeared."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Exactly," Bob agreed, very much as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zapt himself might have done it. "That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly what we did."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Turn around then, Robert," the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor advised.

We turned around</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were blotted out about the time you</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave the porch its third dose," Bob re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined, and paused in consternation. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once he became aware that he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the porch floor or the steps, or Nellie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or himself. About all he seemed able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see was the little man standing there on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawn squirting some sort of diabolical fluid</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the hose he now perceived came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from the laboratory window. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">without the least warning he found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sight filled him with a sort of quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">upflaring rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a rush he was off the porch, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be there, whether he could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">it or not, and flinging himself toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">source of his and its disappearance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put down that hose!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Robert, to whom are you speaking?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Zapt peered toward the changing</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of Sargent's voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm speaking to you," Bob told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost roughly. "Put down that hose or</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn it off, or--something."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Remarkable--remarkable," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor, smiling. "Robert, I cannot see</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, though I hear you plainly. You ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear to be actually very near me. If any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing had been needed to clearly demon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strate the unqualified success of my recent</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigations, this--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put down that hose!" Bob said it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the third time and seized the rubber tubing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And for some reason best known to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, Professor Xenophon Xerxes Zapt</seg><seg type="columnLine">chose to resist. He struggled to retain pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">session of the hose, exerting his frailer</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength against that of the unseen, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger man who was dragging on it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tugged and Bob tugged, and all at once the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">professor lost his balance and sprawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the ground, while the nozzle released</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his controlling guidance, whipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">round like a serpent striking, and drenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to the skin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I say, professor, I didn't mean to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do that," began Bob, and broke off--be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause apparently he was speaking to noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Professor Xenophon Xerxes Zapt had</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the porch where she had been an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unseen watcher Nellie screamed the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">word "Father!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sargent put down the hose and groped</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward where he had last seen "father" on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Father!" Once more Miss Zapt was</seg><seg type="columnLine">calling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Sargent's fingers made contact with</seg><seg type="columnLine">something clammily wet and very active</seg><seg type="columnLine">that bounced away from his touch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">emitted a most irascible exclamation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There, now, you impudent young whelp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">see what you have done!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I can't--professor," Bob stammered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightening and drawing a hand across his</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemingly useless eyes.

"I can't see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch or the steps, but 1 can make out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door. Are you there, professor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course I'm here," Zapt assured him</seg><seg type="columnLine">none too sweetly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then come along." Bob began moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward what was still visible of the house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling with shuffling feet for the vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps, in order to ascend them to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">BLIND MAN'S BUFF</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">123</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">equally vanished porch, where Nellie</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited, to all appearances no more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">disembodied voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bob!" that voice came to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here--coming," he answered, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the steps, and went gropingly up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands outstretched before him. "Nellie?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beside the door he found her. She gasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he touched her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's all right now," he said, "I've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Talk about blind-man's buff!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Behind him came a sound of two objects</seg><seg type="columnLine">colliding, and the professor cried: "Ouch!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Father!" Miss Zapt stiffened inside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm Bob had slipped about her; "did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt yourself?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not irreparably, my dear," said Zapt</seg><seg type="columnLine">in somewhat sarcastic fashion. "And I</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust I have not badly damaged the steps.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where in thunder are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Right here by the door."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Huh!" The sound of tentative foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps came nearer. "All right--now I touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As a matter of fact," said Sargent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that's my hand you're holding, but it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the same. I'm holding Nellie. We'd bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter stick together."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor grunted and removed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutching fingers. "We'd better get some</seg><seg type="columnLine">place where we can locate ourselves by</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of definitely known objects. Go into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the living-room," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They passed inside. At least they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">now see where they were going. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained the door of the living-room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed through it. Bob led Nellie to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">couch and seated himself beside her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Father, where are you?" she inquired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Here," came the voice of the professor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"In my usual chair, my dear. I presume</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can see it, at least. Sargent, what are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you doing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm holding Nellie's hand." Bob told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the literal truth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Xenophon Xerxes Zapt quite audibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">sniffed. "At least," said he, "I can't see</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well--you've nothing on me there, pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor," Bob retorted. "Here's a pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">kettle of fish."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Exactly," complained the protessor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If you young people hadn't interfered--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's hardly the point now," Sargent</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupted. "The question now seems to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, how do we get rid of the stuff?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time Xerxes Zapt made no answer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then he sighed. "That is the point,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Robert, of course," he assented. "But you</seg><seg type="columnLine">see, I hadn't gone into it fully, and--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Father!" Nellie's voice cut into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">confession.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See here," Sargent half rose and sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">back as her panic-tightened fingers held</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. "Do you mean we've--got to stay--</seg><seg type="columnLine">like this, till you think up an answer?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's it, Robert," said Xenophon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xerxes Zapt in a tone he plainly strove to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make soothing. "I think that I had--er</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that I had better try to think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nellie began laughing. There was noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of humor in the sound. It was just the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cachinnation of jangled nerves and ended</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a sob.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bob put his arms about her and drew her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head against his shoulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't leave me, Bob," she murmured.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Promise me not to leave this house till I</seg><seg type="columnLine">see you again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I won't," said Sargent. "I won't leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">till your father has thought of something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get us all out of this fix." He drew his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms tightly about her shaking figure, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">held her. The situation was rather eerie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say the least. He could see everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the room quite plainly--everything, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the professor, and Nellie, and himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet the sound of another sigh wafted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him from the reading chair beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, where presumably Zapt was thinking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was followed by mumbled words: "Milk?</seg><seg type="columnLine">--no--certainly not. Benzine?--scarcely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ether?--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ether ought to do it," Sargent caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the suggestion. "You said it was etheric</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrations that were responsible for sight."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The professor grunted again, but made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no further comment. Silence came down</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Dusk had fallen. The sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuffling footfalls struck on Sargent's ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the snap of a switch. A sudden illumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation filled the living-room and hallway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Plainly Zapt had turned on the lights. Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">124</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">listened while he padded back again to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair and sank into it with a creaking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">springs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then Zapt was speaking: "All things</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered, Robert, I think we had best go</seg><seg type="columnLine">upstairs and change our clothes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Simple? It was as simple as that. Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw it in a flash. "Of course," he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed, as Nellie stirred in his embrace</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her father's words, "that will be all right</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you and Nellie, but I haven't any extra</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes here, myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can lend you a bathrobe, Robert,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zapt replied. "Such a step will at least give</seg><seg type="columnLine">us an opportunity to once more establish</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves. The solution being mainly on our</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing, either their removal or their cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering with an unsaturated texture, will ren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der us visible in a major extent, even if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">does not restore the visibility of our faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hands. And, of course, I shall think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">something in time. Alcohol might do it--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Exactly." Judging by sounds, the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor rose. "You will come with me, Rob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ert. Nellie will go to her room."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come, dear," Robert prompted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped Nellie to her feet. And then, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall of a heavy body, followed by inarticu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">late grunts and mouthings and mumbles</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from the front porch, he paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sounds went on. They might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a scuffle to judge by their nature, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might have been occasioned by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">object trying to right itself. There was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clumping reminiscent of heavily shod feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">--the rasp of stertorous breathing--then--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Phwat th' divil?" a self-interrogation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sssh!" One could fancy Xenophon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xerxes Zapt was the source of the sibilant</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning. "Officer McGuiness. He's noticed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house, confound him. Quick now before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he comes inside! Upstairs!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In his last statement, Professor Xeno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phon Xerxes Zapt had been absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. Danny McGuiness, large, florid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irish, and a careful officer, had noticed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, as a matter of course--as during his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours of duty patrolling the street on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">it stood, he noticed it and half a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">others every time he passed. And to-night</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he approached it, just after dusk and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the assumption of his tour of duty, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed something about it, such as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never beheld in all of his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came to a halt and stared. And then</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite slowly he lifted a massive hand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed it across his eyes. Seemingly, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gazing upon the roof and the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">story of a house, without visible means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">support, as the judge of the city court was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wont to say of certain individuals brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him. The roof and the upper story</seg><seg type="columnLine">were quite familiar. Danny had seen them</seg><seg type="columnLine">every night for many months, since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night he saw them first, but--the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the picture had disappeared. Everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">below that strangely buoyant part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure was seemingly wiped out, very</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as a drawing might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponged from a slate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hence Danny's instinctive gesture to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. He knew he couldn't be seeing what</seg><seg type="columnLine">they said he was. He had heard of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">catastrophes overtaking a man in the past.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hemi--or semi--or something like that, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctors called it. Anyway, a man saw only</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of what he looked at, and quite plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was seeing--or he wasn't seeing--some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing like half of Professor Zapt's house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He put down his hand and laid hold of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fence that ran in front of Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zapt's yard. All at once, regardless of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof and upper story of the mansion at</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he was staring, Danny felt a need of</seg><seg type="columnLine">support. For a moment he stood clinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it, and then--he decided on a test.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Slowly he turned his vision away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floating superstructure of a modern resi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence, and directed it across the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he let go of the fence and drew a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long breath. He could see the other side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street all right--all of it. Under such</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions his eyes did nothing by halves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could see the houses from top to bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom, the boles as well as the tops of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street-fringing trees. Then--what in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of all sense was the answer? Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">a temporary seizure merely--something he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had eaten, maybe, that had caused a pass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing semiblindness. He turned back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more faced in the original direction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stiffened before the original effect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BLIND MAN'S BUFF</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">125</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, sa-a-y!" said Officer McGuiness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and decided that the trouble must be with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house and not himself. He decided,</seg><seg type="columnLine">also, to investigate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew Xenophon Xerxes Zapt. Sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral times before he had known the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor to produce some odd results by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiments--had even profited by them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">some extent, when Zapt had seen fit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand him sundry bits of neatly engraved</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper, as a mark of appreciation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest Danny had displayed. Having re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered from his first shock of surprise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">McGuiness was half-minded that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing some such condition now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Funny little feller," he muttered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, as he went up the walk from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate. "Always fussin' wid some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">contraption. Lookit this now, wull ye--</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookit--hull bottom of th' house gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">--rest of it floatin'--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abruptly he collided with something and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawled forward on what felt, even if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not look like the steps of the missing</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment he lay with the breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly shaken out of him, and then he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to feel tentatively about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're here--even if I can't see 'em,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he decided at last, the conviction driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">into him by his fall and the verdict of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">groping touch. "They're here, but--phwy</seg><seg type="columnLine">is ut, I can't see 'em? Shure, now I'm here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll mention ut to th' perfissor.

It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all most peculiar to be walking on some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing he couldn't see, and despite him, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">affected Danny oddly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Phwat th' divil?" he voiced his be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wilderment in a heavy rumble and stiffened</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his tracks at a warning "Sssh!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a sound of caution--a sibilant</seg><seg type="columnLine">plea for quiet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danny considered quickly.

Danny thought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">words rather than spoke them, gave over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his first intention of ringing the bell if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could find it, laid hold of the screen door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dragged it open and stepped inside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hall ran straight back before him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw the upward sweep of a flight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs. To the right lay an archway giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a lighted apartment. McGuiness turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward it, made his way into the living-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and gazed about him. So far as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see he stood alone in a room other-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise deserted, and yet--dimly it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him that he detected a sound of sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed breathing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He frowned. It was like being in a dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened room with some unknown person--</seg><seg type="columnLine">only this room was brilliantly lighted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">still he could perceive no one. A peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">tingling, prickling sensation began to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down his spine. Somebody had</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered, and they must have been close</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, for him to have heard it--some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body or something was breathing not ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet from him. He was sure of it now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The pad of a careful footfall! He</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled, tightening his grip on his club--</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find nothing at all--or at least no one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before his starting eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> x^nd yet that softly padding sound went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. It was as though unseen enemies were</seg><seg type="columnLine">creeping upon him. Tiny drops of moisture</seg><seg type="columnLine">started on his cleanly shaven upper lip. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">spun about again at a rustle of movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a new direction. His respiration</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickened. A few moments ago his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tricked him and now, seemingly, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't believe his ears. Or could he?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those whispers--of breathing--of unseen</seg><seg type="columnLine">footfalls were all about him. Surely some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one or something was moving in the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something? McGuiness began to lose some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his ruddy color. He wasn't a coward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but this unseen, this unknown, this appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently unknowable thing was getting on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Father?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">126</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAMOUS FANTASTIC MYSTERIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He jerked himself up at the sound of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">articulated word--no more than another</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibilant sighing, but none the less some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing within his comprehension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sssh! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There it was again--that plea for silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">--caution--from the hallway now, or else</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ears had utterly failed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He twisted himself toward it. "Perfissor</seg><seg type="columnLine">--are ye there, perfissor?" he questioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoarsely and advanced on legs that shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">the least bit for all his dogged effort to</seg><seg type="columnLine">control them. At the worst, he told him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self now, he was facing something human.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet, when he reached the hallway</seg><seg type="columnLine">and groped along it, searching, searching</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily for what he couldn't see, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one, and--a stairboard creaked. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted his eyes quickly. He could see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs and--there was nothing on them!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All at once McGuiness found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaken by something like a chill, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clenched his teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aw go to th' divil," he snarled a grit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting surrender, "shure an' I wasn't hired</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go chasin' after ghosts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A giggle--an unmistakable giggle--was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wafted to him from the second story. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet to his baffled imagination it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gibbering of a disembodied something.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kicking open the screen door he stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside, removed his helmet to draw a none</seg><seg type="columnLine">too steady hand across a sweat-dampened</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehead, and took a deep and somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertain breath. Then very slowly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the steps and went down them, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traced his way along the walk to the street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned to look back at w'hat he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see of the house.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was just the same as it had been, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">now McGuiness knew that no matter how</seg><seg type="columnLine">it appeared, the bottom part was there, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">--it wasn't the same after all--there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a light upstairs!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He regarded it for several minutes be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he understood. When he had gone in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side it had not been there--and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that creak on the stairs! Somebody had</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered "father," and somebody had</seg><seg type="columnLine">"sshed" the speaker into silence, and--</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebody had giggled when he said he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't chasing ghosts--and the recollec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of that giggle wasn't at all the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">now as it had seemed inside the house. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a sound of amusement with noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of menace about it. The officer was</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly puzzled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All at once Danny McGuiness set his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irish jaw in determination. "Begob," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">declared to no one but himself, "I'm go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in' to get to th' botthom of this now, do ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">moind.

Upstairs he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would find them. He would go up, and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he'd demand an explanation.

He'd go up and find the lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, and--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something brushed against his leg!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started, checked himself, and stooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly with reaching fingers. They closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on something furry--something silken soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">--something that drew back and emitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unmistakable hiss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A cat!" said Danny. "A kitty, d'ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">moind now--an' I can't see her--I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see her any more than I could thim steps--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but--I can feel her--or I could. Kitty--</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitty--come here, kitty." Still bent he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan feeling in all directions, turning on</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy feet as he sought to come once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">in contact with her. "Come, kitty--come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Officer McGuiness. Where th' divil did</seg><seg type="columnLine">you go to?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, officer, such language! I'm sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McGuiness straightened slowly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced upward, quite to the head of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs--and remained staring while his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy jaw sagged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Because something stood there--only it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hard to say what it was--except that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it appeared like the dress of a woman--</seg><seg type="columnLine">just that--just a dress leaning a little to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward him across the railing. Or no. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">BLIND MAN'S BUFF</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">127</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be a pair of feet beneath it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pair of feet, but neither hands nor head!</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was nothing at all above the neck of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the garment save a little triangular spot, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">white as--as white as a virgin reputation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And that was all. There wasn't anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">else. There was just that tiny white tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle, and a pair of feet, and the dress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So much he saw and then the dress was</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined by two other garments--a jerkily</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving bathrobe and a suit of clothes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The three formed a group and began de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scending.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whuroo!" Danny let the sound out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chest in a sighing exhalation and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching. But it wasn't a battle-cry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">combat--it was just the last stand of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious volition. And after that, as the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">headless figures marched down the stairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him, Officer Danny McGuiness was</seg><seg type="columnLine">volitionally paralyzed. He stared with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">never-shifting vision, but he neither spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor moved. He was past all speech or</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement, until, suddenly--the lady's gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, officer," it said, "you look as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you were seeing a ghost."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hope waked anew in Danny McGuiness's</seg><seg type="columnLine">breast. He stiffened his shaking knees. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice had nothing of whispers, of "sshes"</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it. It had a distinctly human note.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It sounded suspiciously like that of Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Zapt's daughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shure, I--I don't know what I'm see-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in'," he stammered.

And surely that was Xeno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phon Xerxes Zapt's voice emerging from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the suit of clothes. "That's the substance</seg><seg type="columnLine">on our faces, McGuiness. Come into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">living-room and I'll explain the matter to</seg><seg type="columnLine">your better understanding."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All roight, perfissor," Danny assented.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is yersilf, isn't ut, perfissor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," said the suit of clothes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"An--th'--th' bathrobe?"

They went on and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained fully what had occurred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Danny grinned when the narrative was</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished.
