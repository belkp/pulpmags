S. trained</p><p> men are stepping up to big jobs, over the</p><p> heads of older men, past those whose only</p><p> qualification is long service.</p><p> There is a job ahead of you that some man</p><p> is going to be picked for. The boss can’t</p><p> take chances. When he selects the one to</p><p> hold it he is going to choose a trained man</p><p> with sound, practical knowledge of the work.</p><p> Get busy right now and put yourself in line</p><p> for that promotion. You can do it in spare</p><p> time in your own home through the Inter-</p><p> national Correspondence Schools, just as</p><p> nearly two million men have done in the last</p><p> twenty-five years, just as more than 100,000</p><p> men are doing today.</p><p> The first step these men took was to mark</p><p> and mail this coupon.

At the Law Courts he glanced up </p><p>at the clock and came to an irresolute halt </p><p>by the curbstone. As he stared idly a girl </p><p>popped out from behind a taxicab and pro- </p><p>ceeded to cross the road. </p><p> She was of medium height, dark as a</p><p>Spaniard and walked with the self-reliant </p><p>swing of the American woman. A cream </p><p>soft hat, devoid of any decoration save a </p><p>dark tassel, and her loose Holland costume </p><p>gave her a cool capable appearance. She </p><p>saw him when hafi-way across the road, </p><p>acknowledged his salute and changed her </p><p>course as a taxi came whirring up behind </p><p>her. </p><p> He started forward in alarm as the ma-</p><p>chine bore down upon her, hooting dis- </p><p>mally. She glanced over her shoulder as if </p><p>measuring the distance and increased her </p><p>pace by a fraction. The cab shot by her </p><p>with scarcely a foot to spare. He had </p><p>stepped back on to the pavement hurriedly, </p><p>sheepishly. She looked up as she held out </p><p>her hand, her large eyes observing him </p><p>amusedly, and remarked— </p><p> “Well, what’s the news?”</p><p> “Oh, nothing certain.”</p><p> “Well, come and have tea with me?”</p><p> She moved on, leaving him to overtake her</p><p> in a stride.</p><p> “Yes, I’ll take you to tea, Miriam.”</p><p> She glanced at him.</p><p> “But ‘nobody asked you, sir, she said!’ ”</p><p> “Well, of course it comes to the same</p><p> thing,” he retorted.</p><p> “Nothing of the sort! I asked you to tea</p><p> with me. Don’t start that idiotic argu-</p><p> ment all over again.”</p><p> “But—but—it’s—I’ve told you; I can’t</p><p> let a girl pay-”</p><p> “Rubbish; you’re too English! You’d</p><p> better tea by yourself.” He hesitated,</p><p> frowning.</p><p> She looked up at him with a laugh; then</p><p> her lips tightened.</p><p> “It isn’t the fact of the things; it’s the</p><p> principle.”</p><p>Copyright. 1918. by The Ridg-way Company in the United States and Great Britain.

Rubbish!”</p><p> “As a matter of fact,” she began again as</p><p> soon as they were seated and had ordered</p><p> tea, “you have an idea that it is symbolical</p><p> of the rights of women.”</p><p> “Oh, Lord!” he groaned.</p><p> She laughed.</p><p> “Women who earn their own living have</p><p> a perfect right to equality with men. There</p><p> are men who are just as incapable, just as</p><p> inefficient as any woman. But there are</p><p> women—I, Lordly Creature,” tapping him</p><p> on the shin with a dainty foot, “I am quite</p><p> as capable of earning my living as you—</p><p> Salt of the Earth!”</p><p> He smiled indulgently.</p><p> “Yes; in some cases. But even then it</p><p> never is the same work as a man does.”</p><p> “Poof, and why not?”</p><p> “Well, as dressmakers, milliners, needle-</p><p> workers and—and all that sort of thing,</p><p>and even then men-” </p><p> He paused doubtfully, gazing at her</p><p> twitching lips.</p><p> “Sugar, Lordly Creature?”</p><p> “Don’t be a fool, Miriam!” he said</p><p> sourly. “A woman’s place is behind the</p><p> shelter of man. He works, fights, conquers,</p><p> to her gain.”</p><p> “Are you fighting and conquering for a</p><p> woman’s gain?”</p><p> “Just like a woman!” he retorted.</p><p> “Mere sentimentality.”</p><p> “Exactly what is sentimentality?”</p><p> “Love—and all that.”</p><p> “Dear me! Really?”</p><p> Their glances met. He laughed with the</p><p> satisfaction of one parrying a dangerous</p><p> thrust from the enemy.</p><p> “Sentimental bosh of the worst descrip-</p><p> tion. Plato-”</p><p> “Plato is dead! Live and see for your-</p><p> self. You’ll find out one day!”</p><p> “I?” He laughed derisively. “My dear</p><p> Miriam, one of the great points that I</p><p> value is that we can be pals, that you never</p><p> expect me—like every other girl—to make</p><p> love to you.”</p><p> Her eyes twinkled. She opened her lips to</p><p> say something, changed her mind and said—</p><p> “Have some more tea, Alan?”</p><p> “No, thanks,” he said looking at his</p><p>watch, “I must run up to the office. If </p><p>there’s any fresh development in the </p><p>Moroccan imbroglio I may have to get </p><p>away immediately. By the way, Miriam, </p><p>if I should have to leave in a hurry I sha’n’t </p><p>have time to run home, so you might make </p><p>a point of seeing the mater and—explaining </p><p>things. She’s always absurdly anxious, </p><p>imagines things-” </p><p> “And doesn’t understand men’s affairs,</p><p>eh? But supposing I can’t get away?” </p><p>“Why not? You’ve only the usual shop </p><p>to attend to.” </p><p> “But I might go abroad, too.”</p><p> He laughed indulgently.</p><p> “My dear child, you’re a brilliant journal-</p><p>ist—for a woman.” </p><p> “Thank you!” she said with a short laugh.</p><p> “But—oh, women are very well within</p><p>limits but-” </p><p> “What limits, pray?”</p><p> “Well, you know what your work is—at</p><p>races, balls, crushes and all that sort of thing </p><p>—social work, but-” </p><p> “Well, but what? Go on.”</p><p> “Hang it, Miriam, you can’t expect to do</p><p>a man’s work.” </p><p> “Really! Why not?”</p><p> “Well, how on earth could you tackle my</p><p>job? Fancy a woman as a war correspond- </p><p>ent! Why, obviously it’s impossible.” </p><p>“How? Why?” </p><p> “Oh, don’t be absurd, child! How could</p><p>a woman travel in Morocco alone, get </p><p>through the tribes or into some blockaded </p><p>town, for instance?” </p><p> “Well? You haven’t explained!”</p><p> He jerked out his cigaret-case irritably.</p><p> “Well?”</p><p> “Oh, I can’t be bothered to explain the</p><p>obvious!” </p><p> HER EYES glinted angrily for a</p><p>moment; then she sat back in the </p><p>chair to watch him light his cigaret. </p><p>She observed the broad shoulders and huge </p><p>limbs, the flaxen hair above his long clean- </p><p>shaven face. He was not bad-looking </p><p>really, she decided. The high forehead, </p><p>straight nose, and prominent jaw suggested </p><p>a horse’s head—a nice horse that she </p><p>wanted to pat. She smiled at the idea and </p><p>thought it a pity that his eyes were a trifle </p><p>small as he stared rather sulkily at his </p><p>boots. A young giant, but lacking . . . She </p><p>pulled herself up short and said slowly— </p><p>The Double Scoop </p><p>5 </p><p> “Alan?”</p><p> "Yes?”</p><p> “Do you know that you badly need a</p><p>hiding?” </p><p> He smiled complacently, palpably re-</p><p>joicing in his physique. </p><p> “Who’s going to give it to me?” he de-</p><p>manded, stretching his arms. </p><p> “I’m going to! No, not physically, you</p><p>(glorious she had nearly said). “You ani- </p><p>mal, I’m going to give you a good lesson.” </p><p>He laughed and stood up. </p><p> “Come along, my child,” he said moving</p><p>toward the pay desk. </p><p> “No, you don’t,” cried Miriam and</p><p>slipped in front of him. </p><p> “Miriam, don’t be-”</p><p> “You dare!” she flashed upon him. He</p><p>turned away with an impatient sigh to wait </p><p>while she received change. </p><p> “I do feel a fool!” he confided to a print</p><p>on the wall. </p><p> “And you are!” said Miriam as she</p><p>joined him. “Come along!” </p><p> They walked up Fleet Street together.</p><p>She waited whilst he went into his office. </p><p>He was away longer than Miriam expected </p><p>and she began to grow impatient. At last </p><p>he reappeared smiling restrainedly. </p><p>“When’re you going?” she asked. </p><p>“Tomorrow night — overland to Gib. </p><p>Just seen the chief,” he said endeavoring to </p><p>curb his school-boy excitement. </p><p> “And then?”</p><p> “On to Fez, to interview the sultan.</p><p>Latest news is that General Moinier is </p><p>leaving from Rabat at the request of the </p><p>sultan to relieve Fez. It’s what I told you </p><p>would happen months ago.” </p><p> “D’you think Fez will fall?”</p><p> “No. The French’ll get there all right—</p><p>unless some one cuts Hafid’s throat. Then </p><p>the Germans will chip in. Then there’ll be </p><p>a lovely row!” he declared enthusiastically. </p><p> “The Germans?” said Miriam thought-</p><p>fully. “I hadn’t thought of that. I must </p><p>read up the subject.” </p><p>“Do!” said Alan. “Then you’ll be able to </p><p>follow my stuff better. I’ll write you, too.” </p><p>“Thanks,” said Miriam and laughed. </p><p>“What’re you laughing at?” he de- </p><p>manded. </p><p> “Nothing!”</p><p> “H’m. Come and lunch with me to-</p><p>morrow? Shall be leaving by the evening </p><p>boat-train and, I say, don’t forget the </p><p>mater, will you?” </p><p> “If I have time.”</p><p> “Course you’ll have time.”</p><p> “Going on the bust this evening I sup-</p><p>pose?” she inquired looking him full in the </p><p>eyes. </p><p> “Promised to dine some of the boys,” he</p><p>said grinning. </p><p> “H’m—men! Well, good-by, Alan—and</p><p>good luck. Remember what I told you.” </p><p>“What you told me?” </p><p> “Yes, about a good hiding,” she said</p><p>smiling. </p><p> “Oh,” said he as one dismissing a trivial</p><p>question. “My dear girl—but I’ll see you </p><p>tomorrow so-” </p><p> “No you won’t, I shall be busy.”</p><p> “Busy! Why?”</p><p> “Yes, never mind: you’ll know sometime.</p><p>Good-by—and don’t be surprised when we </p><p>meet again.” </p><p> “Oh that’ll be six months or more—snow</p><p>and mistletoe at home, eh? Good-by!” </p><p>“Good-by, Alan!” </p><p> He raised his hat and strode way, his chin</p><p>a trifle higher, shoulders a little farther back. </p><p>Miriam watched him for a moment with an </p><p>enigmatic smile and turning dived into the </p><p>traffic, making straight to the library of her </p><p>paper. </p><p> She nodded to one of the girls in charge.</p><p>“Morocco, please — Revolution, 1908,” </p><p>said Miriam curtly. </p><p> The girl went to one of the many lines of</p><p>pigeonholes containing hundreds of dock- </p><p>eted envelopes and selected a large fat one </p><p>with which Miriam retired to an adjacent </p><p>desk, sat down and with notebook and pen- </p><p>cil proceeded to wade through a vast mass </p><p>of newspaper cuttings on Morocco. </p><p> It was after nine o’clock by the time that</p><p>Miriam left the library to snatch a hurried </p><p>dinner and finish some articles for the third </p><p>and fourth editions. </p><p> Contrary to her usual custom she ar-</p><p>rived in Fleet Street in the morning and </p><p>requested a personal interview with her </p><p>editor after the conference. At last she was </p><p>ushered into the great man’s sanctum. </p><p>Langley was a notoriously difficult man to </p><p>handle. She exercised great tact in broach- </p><p>ing the proposition. </p><p> At first he would not hear of it, although</p><p>he approved of the idea. </p><p> “No, no; it’s quite impossible. Quite</p><p>impossible, Miss Vickers, I’m sorry.” </p><p> “Why is it impossible? Because I’m a</p><p>woman?” </p><p>6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>“Well, yes; obviously.” </p><p> “Then you’re going to send a man?”</p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “And steal my idea—Agadir?”</p><p> “Really, Miss Vickers, you place me in a</p><p> very awkward position.”</p><p> “It isn’t awkward at all, Mr. Langley,</p><p> let me go!”</p><p> “But you’d never get in, be murdered,</p><p> held for ransom, or carried off into the—er—</p><p> interior. You don’t understand what might</p><p> happen.”</p><p> “Oh, yes, I do; quite. And take the</p><p> risk. Come, Mr. Langley, don’t be so hide-</p><p> bound by convention. Women can do fine</p><p> things sometimes. Think, I’m pleading for</p><p> my sex as well as myself.”</p><p> “But you ought not to, Miss Vickers.</p><p> Sex ought not to enter into business.”</p><p> “Exactly!” cried Miriam triumphantly.</p><p> “Now you can’t refuse!”</p><p> Langley smiled grimly.</p><p> “Expediency, my dear Miss Vickers. I</p><p> daren’t take the risk of answering to my</p><p> people if anything happened—to a woman.</p><p> Think what the public would say.”</p><p> “Easily got over. I’ll use a male nom</p><p> de guerre. That’s a sacrifice, Mr. Lang-</p><p> ley.”</p><p>He shook his head and frowned </p><p>slightly. </p><p> “I can not do it, Miss Vickers,” he an-</p><p> nounced in a tone of finality. “I’m very</p><p> pressed for time.”</p><p> “You must let me go, Mr. Langley.</p><p> Now everything is a matter of price I’ll go</p><p> for my expenses only.”</p><p> “No; the odium—the responsibility would</p><p> be just the same.”</p><p> “Wait; I’ll go in my own name at my own</p><p> expense. You pay for stuff published—</p><p> usual foreign rates. You can’t afford to</p><p> refuse that.”</p><p> “H’m.” Langley paused, pursing his</p><p> hard clean-shaven lips.</p><p> “Use a male nom de guerre and it’s a</p><p> bargain.”</p><p> “You’re close, Mr. Langley, but women</p><p> and beggars can’t be choosers I suppose. I</p><p> agree.”</p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p> Be wise, young Jackal, open not by day:</p><p> Await the somber safer face of night.</p><p> Be sure that all you meet upon the way</p><p> Are greyhounds, trained to run you down at sight.</p><p> —Sidi Ilammo.</p><p>COME three weeks later Miriam rose </p><p>^ from breakfast on board the R. M. S. </p><p>Agadir to see the streak of white foam of </p><p>the sandy coast-line run out in a gossamer </p><p>thread into the horizon where, about a </p><p>point on the port bow, appeared the daz- </p><p>zling white tops of minarets floating in the </p><p>refraction of the sun’s glare. </p><p> Steadily the ship throbbed her way</p><p>through the empty blue seas, lessening the </p><p>mirage effect of the distant city until the </p><p>white houses grew above the black rocks, </p><p>and the funnels and masts of a French </p><p>cruiser at anchor materialized against the </p><p>dark of the land beyond. </p><p> Lunch was just ending as they steamed</p><p>through the deep-water passage and swung </p><p>to anchor alongside the cruiser. From the </p><p>deck of the steamer the town, a mass of </p><p>white-topped houses snuggling within the </p><p>encircling ramparts, nestled half upon the </p><p>sandy shore and half upon the greeny-black </p><p>rocks, where the old arched water-gate </p><p>stood at the brink of the water in dignified </p><p>challenge. </p><p> To the right of the town was a fair</p><p>stretch of hard sand sweeping up into the </p><p>dunes which ran on to the southwest into </p><p>the foothills of the Atlas Mountains; be-</p><p>hind the ship stretched a linked arm of </p><p>small islets, a natural breakwater against </p><p>the Atlantic seas. In the blue of the sea </p><p>and sky the Moorish town scintillated and </p><p>gleamed like a rare jewel set in the gold of </p><p>the sand, justifying the native name Es- </p><p>Sueira, The Picture. </p><p> Miriam was more than a little excited at</p><p>having arrived at the beginning of the </p><p>great adventure which would prove her </p><p>theory right or wrong, a theory evolved </p><p>from a careful study of the map that the </p><p>objective of the Germans in the first move </p><p>of the international game of chess for the </p><p>possession of Morocco would be Agadir, the </p><p>finest seaport on the Atlantic coast and the </p><p>key to the great caravan route from the </p><p>south, closed to trade for fifty years by </p><p>treaty. </p><p> Her plans for the moment were chaotic;</p><p>and a little fluttered by the fear that Alan </p><p>or some other male correspondent would </p><p>have happened upon the same idea. An- </p><p>other British steamer was not expected </p><p>until the next week; but she had heard </p><p>that an Italian, French or German boat </p><p>might turn up any day, all things being </p><p>erratic and unforeseen in Morocco. Hence </p><p>The Double Scoop </p><p>7 </p><p>her rather flurried determination to make </p><p>a start at once. </p><p> Within an hour Miriam had been bap-</p><p>tized in the clinging odor and lazy hum of </p><p>the Orient once more. At the hotel she </p><p>had engaged a sharp-faced young guide </p><p>who spoke a broken English. Feeling that </p><p>she could conduct inquiries better herself </p><p>than trust to distortive interpretation she </p><p>demanded to be taken to the Jewish quarter </p><p>for although she had no Arabic, she had a </p><p>sound knowledge of Spanish—archaic Span- </p><p>ish studied as a hobby—which most of the </p><p>Jews of the Moghreb spoke in the tongue </p><p>of old Castile, a relic of their forefathers in </p><p>the peninsula. </p><p> She had not as yet formulated any defi-</p><p>nite plan by which she might gain access </p><p>to Agadir. The idea of engaging servants </p><p>and boldly setting out from Mogador was, </p><p>she saw, quite impracticable; for the one </p><p>reason that the American consul would </p><p>never permit her to leave. No; it must be </p><p>by strategy. The method she intended to </p><p>investigate was an attempt to approach by </p><p>water. Failing that, she left the Fates to </p><p>decide, with the mental reservation that </p><p>go she would—somehow. </p><p> “Tcha Hondi?” expostulated Ahmed in</p><p>disgust. </p><p> Miriam insisted, so with a muttered</p><p>curse calling the wrath of Allah upon Jews </p><p>and other infidels Ahmed led the way, see- </p><p>ing many perquisites falling into other </p><p>pockets than his own. </p><p> At the end of the narrow street she came</p><p>upon the ship-party of tourists, suburban </p><p>dames, sprawling uncomfortably on the </p><p>backs of donkeys, with indignant noses and </p><p>perpetual expressions of nervousness at the </p><p>unstable nature of their straw saddles at </p><p>which they clawed with frantic fingers; </p><p>others struggled vainly to appear at home </p><p>perched upon the red-flanneled cumbrous </p><p>saddles of their mules; all in too desperate </p><p>an alarm to do other than appreciate the </p><p>variety and pungency of the street smells. </p><p> Now Miriam had omitted to make the</p><p>orthodox farewells in sheer dread of the</p><p>storm of inquisitive questions which would </p><p>surely accompany the amenities. </p><p> “Why, there’s Miss Vickers!” cried the</p><p>foremost dame and immediately fell off </p><p>her donkey. </p><p> During the ensuing hubbub of shrill</p><p>laughs, cries of distress, and guttural ob- </p><p>jurgations of the donkey-boys, Miriam </p><p>made her escape by turning down the first </p><p>handy turning, which happened to be a </p><p>narrow dark alley scarce six feet wide, over </p><p>which the houses met. Hurrying through </p><p>this tunnel, wondering whether Ahmed </p><p>would have the sense to follow her, she </p><p>came out into a small open space thronged </p><p>with white-robed Moors, amid the dust and </p><p>filth of horses, camels, mules, and donkeys, </p><p>grunting and heehawing. </p><p> A group of mountaineers, wild elf-locked</p><p>Berbers with camel-hair turbans, turned to </p><p>stare at her, their hawk-noses and fierce </p><p>eyes questioning, covetous. Miriam turned </p><p>aside to avoid them and met the dark </p><p>somber eyes of a Moor at her elbow. That </p><p>look, inscrutable, yet suggestive of unthink- </p><p>able vices, sent a thrill of apprehension </p><p>through her. She knew well the insolent </p><p>expression of certain types of European </p><p>men, but they seemed artificial in com- </p><p>parison to the calm assurance and depth </p><p>of wickedness in those Moorish eyes. </p><p>SHE turned away to look up the </p><p>passage. For the first time she felt </p><p>a misgiving at the prospect of </p><p>traveling alone in this barbarous country. </p><p>There was no sign of Ahmed, but out of the </p><p>gloom of the tunnel appeared a tall gray- </p><p>bearded figure, clad in a black pill-box cap </p><p>and black soutane, a veritable patriarch </p><p>stepping out of a Biblical picture. </p><p> As she stood irresolute, not daring to turn</p><p>for fear of those hideous glances, he came </p><p>toward her slowly. ,He glanced at her curi- </p><p>ously and at the motley crowd beyond. </p><p>Evidently her distress was written upon her </p><p>face; for he paused in front of her as if de- </p><p>siring to speak, but embarrassed for need </p><p>of the medium of speech. She saw a kindly </p><p>dignity seasoned with a touch of cunning </p><p>at the back of those bright black eyes. </p><p> “Where does this road lead to?” she in-</p><p>quired in Spanish. </p><p> The old Jew showed no surprise, save by</p><p>the lighting up of his eyes, as, with a ges- </p><p>ture of greeting full of exquisite grace, he </p><p>saluted her and said: </p><p> “This is a fondak (caravansary). The</p><p>dona has lost her road?” </p><p> “No, senor,” replied Miriam. “I sought</p><p>to take a short-cut. I thank you, I wall go </p><p>back.” </p><p> “If the dona will permit,” said the</p><p>patriarch, “I will conduct her. She has </p><p>lost her guide?” </p><p>8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Yes; Ahmed is a fool; he-”</p><p> At that moment a scrawny creature clad</p><p>in rags, with a brown-seamed face like a </p><p>gargoyle, brushed roughly past her and spat </p><p>fiercely between them, rasping out a string </p><p>of curses. </p><p> “The beast!” exclaimed Miriam, glaring</p><p>after him angrily. </p><p> But the Jew apparently had neither</p><p>heard nor seen the insult, for he was saying </p><p>imperturbably— </p><p> “If the dona will follow me?”</p><p> His voice was almost drowned by the</p><p>voluble curses of his aggressor, the loud </p><p>laughter of the Moors and the muleteers in </p><p>the vicinity. Miriam’s anger merged into a </p><p>wave of admiration for the calm dignity of </p><p>the patriarchal Jew. As she turned to fol- </p><p>low him he halted, with his back to the </p><p>fanatic, who was still spewing curses, shel- </p><p>tering her, and with a courtly gesture bade </p><p>her go on in front. The action and the </p><p>grace impressed the girl. No one in this </p><p>generation, she thought, could have sur- </p><p>vived the incident with the same inimitable </p><p>dignity: it was medieval. </p><p> And the street thronged with donkeys,</p><p>mules and horses—the jarring note in the </p><p>shape of the party of tourists had disap- </p><p>peared—the glimpse of the embattled ram- </p><p>parts with the narrow slits in the bastions </p><p>fashioned for arrows, made her forget her </p><p>own incongruous clothes. A French naval </p><p>officer, smartly uniformed and dapper, ma- </p><p>king his way through the crowd, seemed like </p><p>some strange being from another century. </p><p>As she paused for a moment to allow the </p><p>Jew to overtake her, she felt a sensation of </p><p>giddiness as her mind escaped the bonds of </p><p>suggestion and readjusted itself to reality. </p><p> At a little distance along her guide turned</p><p>off down a cobbled lane to the left and pres- </p><p>ently halted at a narrow blue door. She </p><p>was ushered into an open courtyard paved </p><p>with blue and white tiles; the whitewashed </p><p>pillars and the mattresses ranged beside </p><p>the walls in a large room opposite, were </p><p>scrupulously clean. The yellow sun threw</p><p>the arched veranda into violet shade, cool </p><p>and restful. </p><p> The old man clapped his hands and in</p><p>response a young girl with prominent dark </p><p>eyes, and rosy cheeks appeared. She was </p><p>dressed in a dark-blue caftan; twisted </p><p>’round her black hair was a brilliantly yel- </p><p>low kerchief, and in her small ears large gold </p><p>earrings. He said something in Hebrew, </p><p>whereat she laughed merrily and moved </p><p>away, her slippers shuffling over the tiles, to </p><p>reappear with another woman similarly </p><p>clad but elderly and stout. </p><p> Miriam was soon seated, uncomfortably</p><p>enough in European costume, upon the </p><p>edge of one of the mattresses on the floor. </p><p>Sweet coffee was brought. The old man </p><p>sat quietly in one corner, his wife and </p><p>daughter near to Miriam talking politely in </p><p>Spanish. Their eyes, shyly inquisitive, </p><p>questioned every article of her attire. </p><p> Gradually Miriam began to lose her sense</p><p>of strangeness and led the talk upon the </p><p>ways and customs of the country, to the </p><p>trend of opinion concerning the present sul- </p><p>tan and the general situation, gaining copy </p><p>as a good journalist should. When at </p><p>length Miriam intimated that she would </p><p>like to leave they insisted that she must </p><p>break bread with them. Miriam felt a </p><p>queer sense of shame in pretending to pro- </p><p>test that she must go whilst she really </p><p>wished and intended to stay. </p><p> The breaking of bread was a ceremonious</p><p>affair of many dishes; chiefly cous-cous, an </p><p>Arab dish of semolina but made in the Jew- </p><p>ish style with raisins. Although she soon </p><p>felt very much at home there was an ever- </p><p>recurring sense of incongruity. The man- </p><p>ipulation of her Parisian-shod feet troubled </p><p>her; her sun-hat became an abomination </p><p>and her comparatively loose skirt developed </p><p>the tentacles of an octopus in cramping her </p><p>limbs. She longed to throw them away, </p><p>and envied the cool caftan and bare feet of </p><p>the little goggle-eyed Jewess. Boots in- </p><p>deed seemed a sacrilege on the smooth tiled </p><p>floor. </p><p> At last she was driven to discard her hat</p><p>and, scarcely realizing what she was doing, </p><p>so fumbled with her hairpins that her long </p><p>black tresses rolled down her back to the</p><p>admiration of her hostess and daughter. </p><p> There seemed an atavistic sense of her</p><p>natural environment in the air. She was </p><p>impelled to confide in the patriarch sitting </p><p>there so wise and dignified. She felt sure </p><p>that they would not betray her. For a </p><p>moment she conquered the desire and, to </p><p>compromise, began to talk of Agadir. </p><p> The old man, Musa Ben Ibrahim, de-</p><p>scribed the place to her. She was con- </p><p>scious of exaltation when he announced </p><p>that he had relatives and many business </p><p>friends there. He held forth long and </p><p>earnestly against the tyranny and injustice </p><p>The Double Scoop </p><p>9 </p><p>of the Kaid Gilhooli, chief of the district. </p><p>Miriam inquired whether it were possible </p><p>to approach the town by water, saying that </p><p>she had a friend who thought of going that </p><p>way. Ben Ibrahim wagged a forefinger in </p><p>dissent. It would be quite impossible to </p><p>get a boat of any sort to undertake the trip </p><p>from Mogador. He advised her friend not </p><p>to attempt it. The land journey was the </p><p>usual way, but dangerous even for Moorish </p><p>or Jewish merchants. Miriam’s heart sank. </p><p>|||pp] AT THAT moment little Zara, who </p><p>i||||| had taken a great fancy to Miriam </p><p>and had seated herself as close as </p><p>she dared to her, could restrain her curi- </p><p>osity no longer. Her black eyes goggling </p><p>with excitement she craved permission to </p><p>see and handle a string of blue Egyptian </p><p>beads which Miriam wore. Miriam un- </p><p>fastened and handed them to Zara who </p><p>yelped with delighted admiration, flinging a </p><p>score of questions. Then Miriam, her dis- </p><p>appointment dulled for the moment by the </p><p>distraction, asked to be allowed to see the </p><p>girl’s hair kerchief. </p><p> Zara laughed delightedly at the compli-</p><p>ment as she quickly unwound it. Miriam, </p><p>after admiring the texture, laughingly put it </p><p>over her own head. Zara, quick to grasp an </p><p>idea, wriggled over and bound it in the Jew- </p><p>ish fashion over Miriam’s long hair, and sat </p><p>back with many “Eh! ehs!” of admiration, </p><p>pointing a triumphant podgy finger. Mir- </p><p>iam glanced at her host. He was staring at </p><p>her in amazement. </p><p> “By Abraham!” he cried. “Look, my</p><p>woman, she is one of us!” </p><p> Miriam flushed and laughed. Zara, with</p><p>a little cry sprang up and pattered away, she </p><p>returned, staggering under the weight of a </p><p>gilded mirror which her father assisted her </p><p>to rest on the floor. Miriam gave an in- </p><p>voluntary cry of astonishment. The bright- </p><p>yellow kerchief bound about her own raven </p><p>hair, her own large Latin eyes, olive-tinted </p><p>complexion and red lips formed the picture </p><p>of a typical Oriental Jewess, peering </p><p>amazedly. With heavy gold earrings and </p><p>the caftan the resemblance would have been </p><p>perfect. </p><p> For a moment or two Miriam was an-</p><p>noyed. Then she gave a gasp and sat back </p><p>abruptly, staring at the patriarch in the </p><p>corner. The solution of the problem of en- </p><p>tering Agadir had flashed into her mind. </p><p>In the Jewish garb nobody, not even a </p><p>Moor, would suspect her American na- </p><p>tionality. She felt an almost overwhelming </p><p>desire to hug the old man, to tear off her </p><p>boots and European clothes, to dance, sing, </p><p>laugh, and cry at the same time. </p><p> With an effort she controlled herself,</p><p>smiled and gave back the kerchief to Zara. </p><p>As a preliminary, she told little Zara to </p><p>keep the Egyptian necklace, to the little </p><p>one’s wild delight, who, not to be outdone </p><p>in courtesy, insisted that Miriam should ac- </p><p>cept the hair kerchief. </p><p> Miriam now keen upon business, thanked</p><p>her absent-mindedly. She reflected that </p><p>this man had relatives at Agadir and busi- </p><p>ness dealings. He would surely be send- </p><p>ing, or having a share, sooner or later, in </p><p>some caravan going to Agadir. She must </p><p>persuade him to let her go disguised as a </p><p>Jewess. </p><p> Talking and smiling abstractedly she</p><p>thought out her plan of action. She had </p><p>contemplated going as a Moorish woman, </p><p>but as such great difficulties would have to </p><p>be overcome; for her liberty would be neces- </p><p>sarily restricted, and she had no liking to </p><p>trust herself in the hands of any Moor. </p><p> A panic seized her that Alan or some other</p><p>correspondent might arrive at any moment. </p><p>She must lose no time but strike whilst the </p><p>opportunity served. After a short pre- </p><p>amble to the effect that she was a woman </p><p>writer in which she had some difficulty in </p><p>convincing them—they seemed to think it a </p><p>great joke and laughed discreditingly—she </p><p>plunged straight into her proposition. </p><p> At first it was received with uplifted</p><p>palms of horror. It was impossible—if any- </p><p>thing happened the American consul would </p><p>hold him responsible. But when Miriam </p><p>pointed out that she was prepared to pay </p><p>well the refusals became less emphatic; and </p><p>she hinted that there were sure to be other </p><p>Jews who would not be so timid. After an </p><p>excited colloquy with his wife amid much </p><p>gesticulation he agreed. Then came the</p><p>crux of the argument—the price. For all </p><p>his patriarchal bencvolence and hospitality, </p><p>the mention of douro—long and gesticula- </p><p>tory was the bargaining, but at length it </p><p>was completed. </p><p> There was no caravan leaving for two</p><p>weeks, he protested; but in consideration of </p><p>certain money one should leave on the mor- </p><p>row with Miriam in charge of his son and </p><p>little Zara as her maid. </p><p> The sky was a pageant of scarlet and</p><p>IO </p><p>Adventure </p><p>amber, fading to violet over the dense blue </p><p>of the sea as Miriam returned to the hotel. </p><p>Here she discovered the proprietor in a </p><p>state of incoherent excitement imploring </p><p>the consul to organize a search-party as </p><p>Ahmed had returned with the news that </p><p>Miss Vickers had been kidnaped. Miriam </p><p>almost laughed herself into hysterics; more </p><p>at the thought of her success than at the </p><p>corpulent distress of Boniface. </p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p>Bismillah! Here’s ink, a fair tablet, a pen, </p><p>I’ll set down the names of your enemies, men. </p><p>The wandering bees, which betray the rich store; </p><p>These, these are your foes, and will be evermorel </p><p> —Sidi Uammo.</p><p>FIVE days later a small caravan wound </p><p>through a rugged and rocky defile. </p><p>The glare of the afternoon sun shone </p><p>straight into the eyes of the travelers. </p><p>In the van riding sideways upon a decrepit </p><p>pack-horse, was Yakub Bin Musa, a young </p><p>Jew, who, with his black cropped hair and </p><p>small mustache was of a type which, save </p><p>for the black fez cap and dirty gray soutane </p><p>might be seen any day in London or New </p><p>York, immaculately clad in conventional </p><p>garb. </p><p> Behind straggled a small train of pack-</p><p>donkeys in the midst of which were a party </p><p>of three men—a boy of fifteen and two </p><p>ancients—and two women. All were </p><p>mounted on donkeys astride or sideways </p><p>upon the straw-filled packsaddles as big </p><p>as half a sofa. For miles they had plodded </p><p>along the rugged mountain-side in silence </p><p>save for objurgatory oaths on the part of </p><p>the men toward the animals who traveled </p><p>patiently with the blase air of their kind, </p><p>the big ears swaying listlessly. </p><p> To the south the land fell away in rough</p><p>undulations like enormous tumuli, to a vast </p><p>plain across which meandered a faint broad </p><p>track, as of an army—the great highway </p><p>across the Sus from Timbuktu and the </p><p>Soudan. Scattered at long intervals were </p><p>a few mud-walled villages, glinting white</p><p>in the sunlight, and on the horizon the blue </p><p>of distant hills. Behind the ground rose </p><p>in jumbles masses of sandy rock and sward </p><p>losing itself in the brown and blue of the </p><p>heights of the lower Atlas Mountains, bold </p><p>and stately. </p><p> Presently in a twist of a hill path a group</p><p>of horsemen appeared: three wore the </p><p>dignified white robes and hoods of the Moor </p><p>and were mounted on scarlet saddles; the </p><p>others in the van were wild-looking Arabs </p><p>in gray woolen garments, black elflocks </p><p>peeping out below their camel-hair turbans, </p><p>long-barreled guns sticking out across their </p><p>pommels. As they approached, riding in </p><p>the insolent manner of the conquering race, </p><p>the Jewish party drove their animals off </p><p>the track to allow them to pass. </p><p> The Jews cringed as the white-clad leaders</p><p>rode in haughty silence, apparently unaware </p><p>of their presence. The ragged mob of the </p><p>escort favored them with disdainful glances, </p><p>a few muttered “Ya Houdi (Jew)!” accom- </p><p>panying the reproach with a contemptuous </p><p>spit. </p><p> But as the three came abreast of the two</p><p>women, one, a falcon-faced man, deliber- </p><p>ately rode over to the elder of the two girls, </p><p>pulled up his horse so that it barred her </p><p>donkey’s progress and bending over in his </p><p>saddle peered insolently into her face. As </p><p>he made a loud remark in Arabic with </p><p>gleaming teeth and eyes afire, the little </p><p>girl, a few paces behind, screamed in alarm. </p><p>The men of their party stared helplessly. </p><p> The large sloe eyes of the girl were wide</p><p>with alarm as she tried to drive her donkey </p><p>’round, exclaiming: </p><p> “Zid! zid (go on).”</p><p> The other horsemen who had slowed up</p><p>to see the fun, laughed and shouted ribald </p><p>remarks. The Moor bent further over in </p><p>his saddle, grinning wickedly. Miriam’s </p><p>eyes flashed angrily; she swayed backward </p><p>in the saddle, clutching with one hand to </p><p>keep her seat as she swung the other with </p><p>all her force in a resounding slap across her </p><p>persecutor’s face. </p><p> The man shot upright in his saddle like</p><p>a released spring, speechless with indignant</p><p>amazement. Never in all his roving life </p><p>had he had such an experience from a </p><p>woman—and by Allah, a daughter of a </p><p>filthy Jew! </p><p> Miriam, mad angry, kicked her donkey</p><p>into motion and smacking his head on one </p><p>side—for she had no reins—piloted him </p><p>’round an equestrian statue of a Moor. </p><p>The Jews were dumb with fright, fearing </p><p>instant retribution. The man’s compan- </p><p>ions continued to ride on slowly, turning </p><p>in their saddles to watch the comedy. </p><p>The Moor stared blankly at Miriam as </p><p>she passed him; hesitated; then breaking </p><p>into a volley of curses against the Jews, </p><p>The Double Scoop </p><p>ii </p><p>rammed home the sharp edge of his stirrups </p><p>and rode off with a clatter. </p><p> When Miriam had time to look at her</p><p>companions she saw that they were yellow- </p><p>gray, their teeth chattering like castanets. </p><p>Her anger died as the danger passed. </p><p> “Beard of my father!” stuttered Yakub,</p><p>“know ye not who they were? That was </p><p>the Khalifa, Esha ben Fila!” </p><p> Miriam recollected that this man was</p><p>the Moorish governor of the district. She </p><p>looked back and laughed, feeling rather </p><p>perky over her triumph; but her escort after </p><p>exchanging glances, continued the march </p><p>in silence. Indeed Miriam never quite </p><p>realized, as the Jews did, that she had been </p><p>within an ace of having the whole party </p><p>massacred. </p><p> For another two hours the caravan</p><p>plodded along monotonously, gradually de- </p><p>scending and nearing the great broad track </p><p>of the Sus highway. Little Zara, riding </p><p>close to Miriam, could scarcely take her eyes </p><p>off the heroine of such a great adventure, </p><p>breaking out into little giggles of admiration. </p><p>It began to dawn upon Miriam as, con- </p><p>stantly changing her position on her un- </p><p>comfortable pack to gain five minutes’ </p><p>relief to her aching back and cramped limbs, </p><p>that she had let herself into a very pre- </p><p>carious situation. </p><p> For some twenty awful minutes of de-</p><p>pression, probably caused by the reaction </p><p>from the excitement and the trying con- </p><p>ditions of the journey, she regretted that </p><p>she had ever undertaken the trip. She </p><p>nursed, too, a sullen resentment against </p><p>the men of her escort, despising them for </p><p>their craven attitude, wholly forgetting </p><p>that they were unarmed and, moreover, </p><p>were of a race down-trodden and abused </p><p>for centuries by her aggressor’s people. She </p><p>imagined with a thrill of the pride of race </p><p>of what would probably have happened </p><p>had Alan been with her. </p><p> Then the sequential train of thought</p><p>that she was on the verge of success and </p><p>scoring a point over Alan and other men, </p><p>brought back her self-confidence and put</p><p>her in an optimistic mood once more. Still </p><p>heartily did she wish that the aching </p><p>monotonous journey would come to an end </p><p>as she—let it not be whispered in Gath— </p><p>scratched herself—for in every village and </p><p>tent in Morocco there are many varieties </p><p>of insects—yearning mightily for a hot bath </p><p>and carbolic soap. </p><p>AT LENGTH as the sun reached </p><p>its zenith the mountain trail con- </p><p>verged into the main caravan road </p><p>scored by the tracks of countless camels, </p><p>horses and mules. Within the next half- </p><p>hour upon rounding a shoulder of the hill- </p><p>side the blue of water leaped into view, </p><p>awaking Miriam from a tired and dusty </p><p>lethargy into drumming her donkey’s ribs </p><p>impatiently with her bare heels. By de- </p><p>grees appeared the mud huts of Fonti </p><p>scattered low on the beach; the rampart </p><p>walls along the foreshore beyond; then </p><p>perched high upon a conical mass of black </p><p>rock, washed in creamy foam, a gray </p><p>Moorish fort. </p><p> The town nestling between the walls, lay</p><p>on the slope of a hillside some six hundred </p><p>feet above the water, white and dazzling </p><p>in the sunshine. Outside the walls a gray </p><p>open space was crowded with a seething </p><p>mass of men and animals, the sok—market- </p><p>place—upon the farther side, outlining the </p><p>tops of fairy minarets and the rugged </p><p>turrets of the khalifa’s castle, was the warm </p><p>dark-green of an olive plantation. </p><p> Urging her donkey faster Miriam came</p><p>up with Yakub who had pulled up at a turn </p><p>of the trail commanding a view of the </p><p>harbor. There was a look of relief on his </p><p>face as if rejoicing at the prospect of losing </p><p>the responsibility of his charge, as he </p><p>exclaimed, pointing a dirty finger: </p><p> “Look, signorina! Agadir!”</p><p> Miriam’s heart gave an exultant leap.</p><p>Her eyes ran feverishly over the sweep of </p><p>the rocky land behind the bastion into the </p><p>curving blue of the headland ending in Cape </p><p>Ghir eighteen miles away like a gigantic </p><p>protecting arm forming an almost land- </p><p>locked harbor. On the opposite low shore </p><p>some miles away was the commencement </p><p>of the Sus plain through which, near at </p><p>hand, ran the Wadu Tamaraka and the </p><p>Wadu Sus, low and out of sight.</p><p> As Miriam, an hour later, passed beneath</p><p>the shadow of the Babes-Sus, the main gate </p><p>of Agadir, with its huge metal-sheathed, </p><p>nail-studded doors, into the narrow cobbled </p><p>streets thronged with white-robed Moors, </p><p>elf-locked Berbers, impassive woolen- </p><p>garbed Susi, many negro slaves and a few </p><p>hooded women, she felt that wonderful </p><p>thrill of exultation on the accomplishment </p><p>of a coveted ambition. </p><p> The excitement was fully sustained until</p><p>in a mean little house, blue-washed as usual, </p><p>12 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>but not like Ben Ibrahim’s small palace at </p><p>Mogador, Miriam had leisure to take stock </p><p>of her temporary home. Her host was a </p><p>mildewed little man, a snuffling wheezy </p><p>Shylock, rapacious-eyed and predatory of </p><p>nose; the hostess, a pallid bundle of dirty </p><p>clothes. As a consolation there were two </p><p>little girls with gollywog eyes and pre- </p><p>cocious minds who seemed gifted with a </p><p>disinterested affection for Miriam, but </p><p>which little Zara, out of jealousy perhaps, </p><p>instantly pronounced to be cupboard </p><p>love. </p><p> But that night as Miriam, after a lick</p><p>and a promise with the aid of a cracked </p><p>jar of water, saw to the safety of her </p><p>baggage, consisting of two fountain pens, </p><p>a supply of ink and paper and a revolver, </p><p>she was in an irritable state of mind as well </p><p>as body—particularly of body! All the </p><p>romance of the great adventure seemed to </p><p>have died—bitten to death as Miriam </p><p>expressed it savagely. And when she had </p><p>retired to her allotted mattress, she imag- </p><p>ined how Alan would laugh at her. </p><p> Then the visual picture of herself indig-</p><p>nantly denying it, crying “I—” scratch, </p><p>scratch—“can stand it as well—” scratch, </p><p>scratch—“as any man—” scratch, scratch, </p><p>tickled her sense of humor. The spell of </p><p>misery was broken. As she wriggled her </p><p>head on the hard pillow made of a bundle </p><p>of robes, and stretched her stiff and aching </p><p>limbs, she chuckled. </p><p> The next day Miriam spent in writing.</p><p>She went for a ramble in the evening under </p><p>the escort of Yakub to the ramparts over- </p><p>looking the bay, keenly observing the en- </p><p>vironment and catechizing him. Fortu- </p><p>nately Yakub was a native of the place, </p><p>so that she was able to glean brief biog- </p><p>raphies and estimate the relative im- </p><p>portance of the notables, including a </p><p>garbled history of the place—half of which, </p><p>unfortunately long after the copy had been </p><p>sent away, she sadly discovered to have </p><p>originated in the fertile brain of Yakub, </p><p>too eager to please. </p><p> He pointed out to her the palace of the</p><p>khalifa—a bad man and cruel according </p><p>to Yakub—in the western end of the town</p><p>just beyond the principal mosque. Imme- </p><p>diately she desired to visit it. Yakub was </p><p>horrified; he flatly refused to make any </p><p>attempt to take her through the town at </p><p>all until a bald promise of much backsheesh </p><p>set his wits to work. Eventually he arrived </p><p>at the conclusion that the visit might be </p><p>accomplished in company with two old </p><p>Jewesses who were permitted to visit the </p><p>harem ladies to sell various trinkets and </p><p>trading stuffs, but stipulating that it would </p><p>require still more hassani to bribe the </p><p>women. </p><p> As Miriam made a faint effort at haggling</p><p>Yakub’s eyes glinted greedily as he tried </p><p>to think of some other tangible excuse for </p><p>extracting more money. So it was settled </p><p>that the venture was to be made upon the </p><p>morrow. </p><p> Miriam sat herself upon an ancient</p><p>cannon mounted upon a clumsy wooden </p><p>carriage, the wheels of which were made </p><p>of thick planks of wood bound together </p><p>with heavy cross-laths, the impotent muzzle </p><p>pointing through the embrasure command- </p><p>ing the bay. Away to the west of her was </p><p>the little fishing-village of Fonti which they </p><p>had passed on their trail, a few European- </p><p>built towing-boats lying upon the small </p><p>stretch of sand. About half a mile out a </p><p>similar boat was approaching the town, </p><p>the distant oar-blades sparkling in the sun. </p><p>As she leaned idly admiring the deserted </p><p>blue waters of the bay there floated out the </p><p>call to prayer from the distant mosque: </p><p> “Al-lah Ak-ba-ahl Allah il AllahI La</p><p>illaha il Allah, wa Mohammed er-rasool </p><p>Al-la-a-ahl” </p><p>THE call rising in three notes to a </p><p>high-pitched chant, rang out eerie </p><p>and plaintive, dying away in sweet </p><p>cadence to a faint echo in the hill beyond </p><p>to be, caught up quite near her by another </p><p>mueddin. </p><p> The first time that Miriam had heard</p><p>the call to prayer she had been deeply </p><p>impressed with the beauty and the calm </p><p>mystery, in such antithesis to the fierce </p><p>lustful creed which it represented. And </p><p>here in Agadir isolated from any of her </p><p>kind the effect was intensified. She glanced </p><p>across at Yakub who was squatting in the</p><p>shade of the rampart staring craftily at </p><p>nothing, an avaricious smile playing over </p><p>his mouth—probably thinking of the dollars </p><p>he was going to make. </p><p> She felt that time had buckled back into</p><p>the fifteenth century; that she was in </p><p>another period, for the medieval environ- </p><p>ment was perfect. She found herself imag- </p><p>ining that Yakub might well be the biblical </p><p>Jacob as a young man. Noah she was sure </p><p>The Double Scoop </p><p>13 </p><p>was the replica of the dignified Ben Ibrahim </p><p>at Mogador. </p><p> An approaching footstep startled her.</p><p>She looked up to see a man of medium </p><p>height in European clothes advancing. </p><p>She stared for a moment, unable to believe </p><p>her eyes; then panic seized her that she </p><p>had failed after all; that this man was some </p><p>correspondent who had stolen a march on </p><p>her. He wore a shabby suit of gray, a </p><p>light red tie, a dirty collar and a small </p><p>artisan’s cap. His lean face was shaped </p><p>like a hatchet; two pale eyes peered sharply </p><p>over a predatory nose. </p><p> Miriam glanced at Yakub interrogatively.</p><p>He appeared startled and put one finger </p><p>to Ins lips suggestively. Miriam was </p><p>puzzled. Why should Yakub fear this </p><p>man? He was now quite close. He glanced </p><p>at Yakub and at her. Miriam felt the </p><p>contempt in the look and flushed with </p><p>annoyance, forgetting the guise in which </p><p>he saw her. Then when nearly abreast of </p><p>her he turned his head abruptly as if vexed </p><p>at her scrutiny. He was about to replace </p><p>a cigaret in his mouth, but the hand re- </p><p>mained in mid-air as he paused and de- </p><p>liberately stared. </p><p> Miriam wondered what paper he repre-</p><p>sented and tried to decide whether he was </p><p>English or not. She thought not. He </p><p>passed on, looked ’round twice and, as if </p><p>having made up his mind, turned back and </p><p>came straight toward her. Miriam heard </p><p>a muttered exclamation from Yakub. Sud- </p><p>denly recollecting that she was a Jewess </p><p>she looked the other way and cast down </p><p>her eyes, wondering what he was going to </p><p>do. She felt an impulse to speak to him </p><p>in French. It would be such a luxury </p><p>to talk to a fellow-European—even if he </p><p>were a rival correspondent—and if a for- </p><p>eigner it did not matter very much. She </p><p>felt him look her up and down deliberately, </p><p>insolently, and involuntarily she blushed. </p><p> “Ashkoonik?” he demanded abruptly.</p><p> She heard Yakub reply for her. She</p><p>looked ’round at the stranger as he asked </p><p>another question in Arabic which she could </p><p>not understand. She decided that she did</p><p>not like the snarling curve of his lips under- </p><p>neath the yellow mustache as he smiled at </p><p>her. </p><p> “Je ne parle pas Arabic,” she said curtly.</p><p> “So? Vous parlez franqais, eh, cherie?"</p><p>he said. </p><p> Insolently smiling he advanced a step</p><p> toward her and lifted a hand as if to chuck</p><p> her under the chin.</p><p> “You dare!” exclaimed Miriam angrily,</p><p> sliding off her gun.</p><p> The next instant she could have bitten</p><p> her tongue off.</p><p> “Lieber Gott!”</p><p> He peered keenly at her.</p><p> “You are English!” he said, and sweeping</p><p> off his cap apologized profusely.</p><p> He explained that he had meant no</p><p> offense, but thinking her to be a Jewess,</p><p> he could not understand her imperious tone.</p><p> For quite three minutes he stood and ex-</p><p> plained in fluent English, whilst Miriam,</p><p> weakening to his flattery, lost her sudden</p><p> antipathy.</p><p> “My name is de Bouche,” he continued,</p><p> “Baron de Bouche. Whom have I-”</p><p> He raised his eyebrows interrogatively.</p><p> For a moment Miriam hesitated.</p><p> “Miriam Vickers is my name. I am</p><p> American,” she said. “Are you a—for a</p><p> newspaper?”</p><p> “Nein—no. I have business here—that</p><p> is all,” he replied.</p><p> He appeared slightly disturbed at the</p><p> mention of the press and eyed her sharply.</p><p> “What paper are you here for then, Miss</p><p> Vickers?”</p><p> “Oh, none at all!”</p><p> She scarcely knew why she had made the</p><p> denial.</p><p> “I am traveling—well,” she laughed</p><p> deliciously, suddenly developing a keen</p><p> relish in diplomacy, “well, to tell you the</p><p> truth I came here disguised like this from</p><p> Mogador for fun more than anything else.</p><p> I had a friend with me, but she wouldn’t</p><p> come. But it’s been a delightful expe-</p><p> rience—rather rash I thought at first.”</p><p> She was pleased at her own faculty for</p><p> embroidery. She had looked him straight</p><p> in the eyes as she had made the statement,</p><p> but he seemed too engrossed in admiring</p><p> her face to be hypercritical.</p><p> “So? Yes,” he replied; “it was rash.</p><p> You are returning now?”</p><p> “Oh, I don’t know—perhaps. When I</p><p> get tired of the novelty.”</p><p> “So? If you will pardon me offering</p><p> advice it would be well for you to return</p><p> soon. This is no place for—forgive me—</p><p> a handsome woman.”</p><p> “So I have discovered,” retorted Miriam</p><p> smiling.</p><p> “So? But you do not realize the danger.”</p><p>14 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> He spoke emphatically but with the</p><p>manner of a man carrying on a rational </p><p>conversation and thinking about something </p><p>else at the same time; his eyes never ceased </p><p>devouring her face and figure. She became </p><p>uncomfortable and the antipathy returned. </p><p> “Oh, I’m aware of the danger,” she said.</p><p> “So?”</p><p>HE TALKED on for some time in a </p><p>similar strain urging her to leave. </p><p>_Yakub sat silent, watching the two. </p><p>At length Miriam said that she was going </p><p>home and called to Yakub. The baron </p><p>bade her “good night,” explaining that he </p><p>dared not escort her through the town for </p><p>fear of drawing the attention of the Moors </p><p>to her. </p><p> “Who is that man, Yakub?” she inquired</p><p>as soon as they were out of earshot and in a </p><p>quiet lane. </p><p> “Es-sid-el Keleeb,” returned Yakub, who</p><p>was obviously greatly perturbed. </p><p> “Why has he that name?”</p><p> “Because he has been about Morocco</p><p>for many years and used to have with him </p><p>always a little dog; on horseback or mule </p><p>the dog was always with him; that is why </p><p>the Moors call him the master-of-the-little- </p><p>dog. He is a bad man. The Moors and </p><p>Jews alike hate him. One day-” </p><p> Yakub leered and drew a finger across</p><p>his throat. </p><p> At that moment, although Yakub chose</p><p>the most deserted way, they came upon a </p><p>small sok of shops. Half-way through the </p><p>crowded space, there was a cry of “Balaakl </p><p>BalakU”—make way—as, preceded by </p><p>two ragged soldiers, a swarthy-bearded </p><p>Moor appeared, clad in white, riding on a </p><p>richly caparisoned horse. </p><p> “El khalifa!” whispered Yakub, and drew</p><p>Miriam aside into the throng to permit </p><p>the great man to pass.</p><p> The coal-black slave, walking at the</p><p>horse’s head, mocking the sultan’s pomp </p><p>and ceremony, struck Miriam across the </p><p>shins with a staff. Miriam stifled a cry as </p><p>Yakub roughly dragged her farther into </p><p>the press. She looked ’round angrily as </p><p>the yellow shoe and bare heel encased in </p><p>the shovel stirrup of the governor brushed </p><p>her hip, to meet a pair of tired eyes squint- </p><p>ing down a falcon nose. </p><p> Then to her horror she recognized him</p><p>as he pulled up his horse and bent over </p><p>toward her She heard a smothered whine </p><p>from Yakub and a host of unintelligible re- </p><p>marks from the uncouth crowd about her. </p><p>The khalifa was saying something to her. </p><p> “She is my cousin, ya sidi,” whined</p><p>Yakub. </p><p> “What is thy name, Jew?”</p><p> Miriam fascinated with fright mechani-</p><p>cally noted the lean brown hands holding </p><p>the crimson reins, the thick sensual lips and </p><p>the pouched eyes. </p><p> “Yakub Bin Musa,” snuffled Yakub.</p><p> The crowd was eagerly peering about,</p><p>straining to catch a glimpse of the khalifa’s </p><p>new fancy. Several muttered curses and </p><p>contemptuous cries of “Houdi! Keleeb </p><p>Rondi”—dogs and Jews. She felt the </p><p>fierce scrutiny once more; then he nodded </p><p>and with a word to his slaves rode on. </p><p> After the clattering escort had passed</p><p>Yakub hurried her along amid laughs and </p><p>curses from the released mob, humming </p><p>like a swarm of bees. As soon as they were </p><p>in a quiet street once more, Yakub hastened </p><p>her along, wailing that all was lost; that </p><p>the khalifa was a bad man and bemoaning </p><p>their fate generally. </p><p> After' this excitement had died down</p><p>Miriam bribed Yakub to keep silent on </p><p>the matter; for she foresaw that the Jewish </p><p>family would take fright and insist upon </p><p>her departure if they knew. Yakub even- </p><p>tually consented, avarice overcoming fear. </p><p> That night she returned to her inter-</p><p>rupted topic of the baron, upon which</p><p>Yakub, saie in the recesses of his house, </p><p>proceeded to enlarge. The baron, vide </p><p>Yakub, spoke almost every European lan- </p><p>guage with equal fluency; he had been </p><p>in Morocco for some eight years engaged </p><p>in running arms and ammunition—a great </p><p>deal of it through Agadir, so Yakub said— </p><p>and in trading or stealing cattle. He was </p><p>treacherous, and many parts of the country </p><p>were barred to him lest he meet the just </p><p>wrath of some swindled Moor. This was </p><p>interesting enough, Miriam thought, but </p><p>it was not until Yakub mentioned as if of no </p><p>importance, that the baron was in league </p><p>with Germany that Miriam’s journalistic </p><p>instincts were fully aroused. </p><p> “With Germany? How?” demanded</p><p>Miriam. </p><p> “Senor Baron,” said Yakub, “has for a</p><p>long time spent much money, money from </p><p>Germany. That is why the Moors here </p><p>do not kill him. He is under protection </p><p>of the khalifa.” </p><p>The Double Scoop </p><p>15 </p><p> Yakub rubbed his forefinger and thumb</p><p>together, the eloquent gesture signifying </p><p>dollars. </p><p> “But what does he do here?” inquired</p><p>Miriam eagerly. </p><p> “He promises that Germany shall help</p><p>the Moors against the dogs of French— </p><p>but he lies,” observed Yakub emphatically. </p><p>“Why?” </p><p> “He lies,” he asserted gesturing. “He</p><p>pays many dollars to make them listen to </p><p>him. As long as the river of dollars lasts </p><p>so long will they listen to him, but when it </p><p>is dry-” </p><p> He leered suggestively.</p><p> “But how do you know that he is acting</p><p>for Germany?” </p><p> “They say these things in the sok—and</p><p>my aunt and cousin hear them from the </p><p>harem ladies of the khalifa. Senor Baron </p><p>lives in a house of the khalifa. Yes, it is </p><p>so,” said Yakub, and added nonchalantly </p><p>as he rose to his feet, “Senor Baron has </p><p>promised that a German war-ship will come </p><p>to Agadir to prove his words—pah!” </p><p> “What?” exclaimed Miriam agog. “War-</p><p>ship in Agadir! I was right!” she added </p><p>excitedly in English. “Sit down Yakub! </p><p>Are you sure? When?” </p><p> “Allah only knows—Munana (tomor-</p><p>row). Come, signorina, Zara is calling to </p><p>supper!” </p><p> But Miriam’s pen was racing at top speed.</p><p>TWO days had elapsed before </p><p>Miriam was enabled to make the </p><p>promised visit to the harem of the </p><p>khalifa. In the large tiled courtyard open- </p><p>ing on to the gardens she squatted in com- </p><p>pany with the two old Jewesses whilst they </p><p>displayed their goods and haggled with </p><p>the ladies of the harem, a motley group of </p><p>women; a few old and haggard, others </p><p>mere children of fourteen with dark sloe </p><p>eyes and velvet skins, their fat arms—for </p><p>avoirdupois is beauty in Moorish eyes—</p><p>smothered in silver bangles, their hair and </p><p>ears similarly bedecked. </p><p> Among the attendant slaves, huge gross</p><p>eunuchs and negresses, Miriam noticed a </p><p>sweetly pretty half-caste, lean, and there- </p><p>fore despised. She was as active as a </p><p>leopardess and had a petulant discon- </p><p>tented expression. Miriam made friends </p><p>with the aid of a silver bangle upon ob- </p><p>serving that she could speak Spanish. </p><p>Her name was Ramah and her face lit up </p><p>with mischievous pleasure on learning what </p><p>Miriam desired her to do. Gossip is half </p><p>the soul of a Moorish woman. </p><p> Two, three, four more days passed and</p><p>still no sign of the promised diplomatic </p><p>coup. Miriam began to think uneasily of </p><p>those close-written sheets she had dis- </p><p>patched by special runner to her agent in </p><p>Mogador. Except for an early morning </p><p>walk upon the ramparts approached by a </p><p>circuitous route in the vain hope of seeing </p><p>the war-ship, Miriam, after the episode in </p><p>the sok, was kept almost a close prisoner </p><p>in the Jewish house. On the third day, to </p><p>Miriam’s annoyance, the baron walked into </p><p>the house. He apologized for calling, ex- </p><p>cusing himself on the grounds that he had </p><p>heard that she had not taken his advice, </p><p>and was anxious for her safety. </p><p> He dismissed the Jews from the room in</p><p>an autocratic manner. Miriam objected, </p><p>but he feigned not to have heard her. He </p><p>was a born raconteur; he entertained her </p><p>with vivid stories of sport, duelling, in- </p><p>trigue and adventure in every capital in </p><p>Europe to the wilds of Borneo and China. </p><p>He seemed to have been everywhere and </p><p>done everything—and everybody, beating </p><p>down Miriam’s antipathy until at times she </p><p>thought him the most fascinating man she </p><p>had ever met. Again he urged her to leave, </p><p>gazing at her the whole time with undis- </p><p>guised admiration. But Miriam felt afraid </p><p>of the man and was relieved when he </p><p>departed. </p><p> One moonlight evening she arrived upon</p><p>the ramparts to see the somber shape of a </p><p>gunboat lying at anchor some two miles out, </p><p>stealthy and ominous under the flocculent </p><p>sky. She stared, drinking in the sight and </p><p>thinking with a triumphant smile of Alan. </p><p>She was aroused from her pleasing reverie</p><p>by an exclamation from Yakub and looked </p><p>up to see the baron approaching her. </p><p> “Ah, good evening, Miss Vickers.”</p><p>“Look! Look!” cried Miriam, forgetting </p><p>her dislike of the man and pointing across </p><p>the bay. “There’s the war-ship.” </p><p> “The war-ship?” he repeated quickly.</p><p> “I mean,” said Miriam recollecting, “a</p><p>war-ship. What is it, a cruiser? Do tell </p><p>me and why is she here?” </p><p> “No, it’s, a gunboat,” returned the baron,</p><p>coming close to her. “But I want to talk </p><p>of something else to you.” </p><p> There was a thick note in his voice that</p><p>made Miriam glance ’round at him. </p><p>l6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Briefly this,” he turned suddenly to</p><p>Yakub and said harshly: “Emshiit (go </p><p>away.)” </p><p> Yakub went a few paces, watching the</p><p>baron with frightened eyes. </p><p> “How dare you order my servant about?”</p><p>demanded Miriam. </p><p> “So? I dare anything and anybody</p><p>when I wish,” said the baron quietly, look- </p><p>ing at Miriam hungrily. “I have warned </p><p>you to leave here. You will not. Herr </p><p>Gott—now I tell you I love you. So? </p><p>Don’t start from me!” he added with a </p><p>snarl intended for a smile as Miriam shrank </p><p>from him. “You are in great danger. </p><p>Leave with me under my protection. You </p><p>can not go by road. I have a ship coming </p><p>in a few days. You will come with me?” </p><p> “I sha’n’t do anything of the sort,” ex-</p><p>claimed Miriam angrily, although her heart </p><p>beat faster. </p><p> “So? When I want a thing I take it,”</p><p>said the baron, watching her with a piercing </p><p>stare. “You will come with me?” </p><p> “No, I will not! You dare-”</p><p> “So? Then choose—the khalifa has seen</p><p>you and seeks you. You are the sort who </p><p>inflame men’s minds! Think—imagine </p><p>what will happen to you—in the harem, </p><p>so? Sid Eisha has a taste for sweet woman- </p><p>hood—now, little fool, choose!” </p><p> Miriam grew pale as she realized her peril.</p><p>Her thoughts raced—if only Alan . . . </p><p> “Gott verdampf nochmal, der Teufel soil’s</p><p>holen—choose, you devil-faced beauty.” </p><p> A floccus of cloud obscured the moon.</p><p> “I shall appeal for protection to that</p><p>war-ship out there,” she exclaimed, point- </p><p>ing her finger across the bay. </p><p> The baron laughed.</p><p> “So? I think not, little fool.”</p><p> He took a step forward, his eyes aflame.</p><p>Miriam in a panic whipped out her revolver. </p><p>But with a catlike spring the baron seized </p><p>her wrist and twisted the gun out of her </p><p>hand. </p><p> “Yakub, Yakub!” she panted, but Yakub</p><p>had vanished. </p><p> The baron flung her from him, lifted the</p><p>revolver over the parapet with the toe of </p><p>his boot and laughed in her face. </p><p> “You she-devil,” he said, “I love you</p><p>all the more. Go home now and think it </p><p>over. Adios!” </p><p> And with a ceremonious bow he turned</p><p>and walked off. For a moment Miriam </p><p>stared after him, white and panting with </p><p>rage; then as he disappeared ’round the </p><p>angle of the wall she buried her face in her </p><p>hands, facing the placid gunboat out in the </p><p>bay, and sobbed. </p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>Like artless fawn, each fair gazelle reposes </p><p>Upon her forest couch of musk and roses; </p><p>The air instinct with dreams of perfumed pleasure— </p><p>A sight, I swear, worth camel-loads of treasure. </p><p>—Sidi Hammo. </p><p>ALAN CARFAX arrived at Rabat from </p><p>- Fez very pleased with himself. He had </p><p>intended to lie perdu for a while watching </p><p>events, but to his disgust he received a per- </p><p>emptory cable informing him of a big news </p><p>scoop by an opposition paper, from their </p><p>special correspondant at Agadir, prophesy- </p><p>ing the advent of a German war-ship. Alan </p><p>smiled skeptically; but he began to wonder </p><p>who his rival might be. </p><p> He hurried on to Mogador where he failed</p><p>to discover a trace of any man having passed </p><p>through. Finally he concluded that one </p><p>Foote, a wily individual of the Daily Post, </p><p>had stolen a march by water. There was </p><p>not even a rumor in Mogador of any occu- </p><p>pation of Agadir: every one scoffed at such </p><p>an idea. Alan wrote a scathing article upon </p><p>the credulity of newspaper correspondents</p><p>in general and began preparations to set out </p><p>for Agadir, filled with an unholy joy at the </p><p>thought of the lemon he had handed to the </p><p>other man—whoever he might be. </p><p> But when a week later he rode, preceded</p><p>by a weedy red-capped soldier of the </p><p>Makhzen, past Fonti and up the slope </p><p>toward Agadir, he stared gloomily and </p><p>swore as he caught sight of the Panther lying </p><p>on the sunlit waters, grim and businesslike. </p><p>But now. . . . </p><p> As he followed the soldier through the</p><p>camel-skin tents and groups of tribesmen </p><p>encamped in the outer sok he scarcely </p><p>noticed the scowls and muttered curses </p><p>against the infidel. His brain incessantly </p><p>clamored for a solution of the problem. He </p><p>saw that wretched scathing article appear- </p><p>ing and the ensuing wrath of his editor. He </p><p>expected every moment to see the fat sar- </p><p>donic smile of Charlie Foote grinning tri- </p><p>umphantly at him in the white-walled </p><p>streets. </p><p> Abd-el-Kader, the soldier, had pulled up</p><p>and roused him from his reflections with the </p><p>remark that they must rest here. </p><p>The Double Scoop </p><p>17 </p><p> “Fain?” demanded Alan.</p><p> “Here,” returned the soldier. “Now I</p><p>go to see the khalifa that he may give us— </p><p>if Allah wills—a place to sleep.” </p><p> Alan frowned at the delay; but by ex-</p><p>perience knew that it was inevitable. So </p><p>Abd-el-Kader clattered away leaving Alan </p><p>to squat in the shade of a wall in company </p><p>with his muleteers and servants to pass the </p><p>time in smoke and contemplation of Allah </p><p>the All-Merciful. The muezzin was still </p><p>chanting while they waited. </p><p> As Alan stared idly at the hovering flies,</p><p>the clatter of hoofs made him look ’round to </p><p>see another European mounted on a coal- </p><p>black, long-maned stallion. At first Alan </p><p>thought it was the redoubtable Foote, but </p><p>a second glance revealed a hatchet-faced </p><p>stranger. The man pulled up in front of </p><p>him, his animal curveting and snorting try- </p><p>ing to savage the meek steeds of Alan’s party. </p><p> “Good afternoon,” said the man after a</p><p>piercing stare. “You’re a correspondent, I </p><p>suppose?” </p><p> “Yes, I am,” retorted Alan taking um-</p><p>brage at the domineering tone. “Who the </p><p>devil are you?” </p><p> The man watched him with a quiet glare,</p><p>curbing and sitting his resless mount like one </p><p>of the Bersaglieri. </p><p> “Are you from the Daily Post?” demand-</p><p>ed Alan. </p><p> The other smiled contemptuously.</p><p> “No, I have not that honor. By the way</p><p>I would advise you to return to Mogador.” </p><p> “Why?”</p><p> “Because you will find that this is not a</p><p>healthy spot for a meddlesome journalist. </p><p>Take my advice. Buenas noches;” and </p><p>loosing rein he galloped up the deep-rutted </p><p>street. </p><p> Alan stood gazing after him. He turned</p><p>to his men.</p><p> “Who is he?”</p><p> “A son of Shaitan!” said a Moor tone-</p><p>lessly. “Es-sid-el-Keleeb.” </p><p> A few minutes afterward Abd-el-Kader</p><p>returned, pulled up his rickety animal and </p><p>with an imperious wave of the hand beck- </p><p>oned them forward. </p><p> “Ajeel” (Come!)</p><p> “Ajee,” echoed Alan angrily. “Who the</p><p>devil are you talking to, you brown-faced </p><p>baboon.” • </p><p> “Ajee/” repeated Abd-el-Kader with a</p><p>face of bronze, and turning rode slowly up </p><p>the street. </p><p> Alan would have dearly loved to have</p><p>knocked him down, but he knew that he </p><p>dared not. On the trip Abd-el-Kader had </p><p>been most affable, but now . . . What </p><p>was the reason? </p><p> Following the line of the walls Abd-el-</p><p>Kader halted at last in a bare open space on </p><p>the ramparts and intimated that they were </p><p>to camp there. Alan objected, but was </p><p>curtly told that such was the khalifa’s order. </p><p>He raged inwardly and demanded to be </p><p>taken to the khalifa in person. At first </p><p>Abd-el-Kader refused, saying that he was </p><p>too tired. Alan mounted and rode off by </p><p>himself, followed presently by Abd-el- </p><p>Kader muttering pious curses on all infidels. </p><p> They arrived at the outer courtyard of the</p><p>palace where Abd-el-Kader conversed apart </p><p>with one of the khalifa’s soldiers who </p><p>glanced in Alan’s direction, nodded, and de- </p><p>parted. Abd-el-Kader squatted on the </p><p>cobbles in the corner, produced a kiff pipe </p><p>and placidly proceeded to smoke. </p><p> “Has he gone to tell the khalifa?” de-</p><p>manded Alan. </p><p> “If Allah wills!” returned Abd-el-Kader,</p><p>exhaling smoke, in a voice devoid of ex- </p><p>pression. </p><p> “When shall we see him?”</p><p> “When Allah wills!”</p><p> “I must see him now—quickly—under-</p><p>stand?” </p><p> “Allah is all merciful!”</p><p> Alan bit his lip and swore softly.</p><p> Half an hour passed slowly. The horses</p><p>fidgeted, flicking at the flies with their long </p><p>tails; Abd-el-Kader smoked with the eternal </p><p>placidity of a Buddha. There was no other </p><p>sign of life. The elongated shadows grew </p><p>denser. </p><p> “Is he going to see me or not?”demanded</p><p>Alan. </p><p> “If Allah wills,” came the placid reply.</p><p>Alan swore violently; and curbed himself. </p><p>He had been through similar ordeals so </p><p>often. </p><p> “Who is that other Roumi (European)</p><p>here?” he inquired presently. </p><p> “Allah only knows!”</p><p> “Abd-el-Kader!”</p><p> Abd-el-Kader looked up sleepily from his</p><p>pipe with cold expressionless eyes. </p><p> “What ails thee?”</p><p> “Allah only knows!”</p><p> Alan gave it up. He felt a wild desire to</p><p>attack some one violently—Abd-el-Kader </p><p>for choice—and getting up, fell to pacing </p><p>i8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>slowly the courtyard. Once a red-capped </p><p>soldier appeared, stared at them with in- </p><p>curious eyes, and vanished. </p><p> THEN as he turned on his quarter-</p><p>deck march he became aware of </p><p>some one watching him. He </p><p>glanced up and caught a glimpse of a pair </p><p>of large bright eyes set in a frame of blue- </p><p>black hair. He glanced at Abd-el-Kader, </p><p>him absorbing dreams of paradise through </p><p>the narrow pipe-stem. As Alan came back </p><p>he watched. The eyes came above the </p><p>level of the wall, twinkled and were fol- </p><p>lowed by the face, a creamy olive-tinted </p><p>face, with pomegranate lips and pearly teeth </p><p>disclosed in a shy smile. </p><p> Alan forgot his annoyance and halted just</p><p>below the wall. The huge silver ear- </p><p>rings wobbled violently; the face disap- </p><p>peared and shot up again, peering curiously </p><p>down at him. Alan seemed to have for- </p><p>gotten his pose as a misogynist. He glanced </p><p>'round cautiously. </p><p> “Who art thou?” he asked.</p><p> “Ra-mah!” came the reply deliciously</p><p>sweet. Small hands with henna-stained </p><p>nails came over the wall; the whole of her </p><p>bust appeared and the girl gazed at him </p><p>ardently. </p><p> “Thou are beautiful to look upon, oh,</p><p>Roumi,” she announced with the naive in- </p><p>nocence of a wild creature. </p><p> “Oh!” said Alan inanely and blushed.</p><p> When he raised his eyes again—feeling</p><p>an awful fool, as he expressed it—she was </p><p>still watching him with longing eyes. </p><p> “What dost thou, oh, Roumi?” she in-</p><p>quired curiously. </p><p> “I am seeking audience with the khalifa,”</p><p>answered Alan, glad to escape from an em- </p><p>barrassing topic. </p><p> She smiled—gloriously, Alan thought</p><p>involuntarily. </p><p> “Thou wilt not speak with him this day,”</p><p>she said, “for he is now with his women in </p><p>the garden.” </p><p> “Barakolofikl (Thank you!)” exclaimed</p><p>Alan as he flushed with rage at the thought </p><p>of the deliberate way in which he had been </p><p>fooled. </p><p> “Mahababbikutn! (A thousand times</p><p>welcome),” she smiled at him. “Where </p><p>dost thou live?” </p><p> “My tent will be pitched by the further</p><p>ramparts,” he replied somewhat sulkily. </p><p>“Who art thou, oh, Ramah?” </p><p> “I am but the slave of the khalifa,” she</p><p>said; “but I find no favor in his sight.” </p><p>There was a long pause. </p><p> “You’re - pretty!” exclaimed Alan</p><p>suddenly in English. </p><p> Her eyes welled with delight, the whole</p><p>of her face seemed transfigured as she read </p><p>the flare of admiration in his eyes. </p><p> “Hamdullahl (Allah be praised!) ” she ex-</p><p>claimed, “that I please my lord!” </p><p> And immediately Alan became self-con-</p><p>scious. </p><p> “I must go,” he said sharply. “Good</p><p>night, oh, Ramah!” </p><p> “Allah watch over thee,” she responded</p><p>softly. </p><p> He awakened Abd-el-Kader, far gone in</p><p>the realms of kiff, with difficulty. As they </p><p>neared the site of his camp he came upon a </p><p>Jew and Jewess walking. Still thinking of </p><p>Ramah he glanced idly at the girl, started </p><p>and looked again. She was watching him </p><p>and as he passed her she peered up into his </p><p>face and laughed. </p><p> “Good God!” exclaimed Alan turning in</p><p>his saddle, “what an extraordinary resem- </p><p>blance! If—” She turned and laughed </p><p>again. “Why that’s Miriam’s double!” </p><p>Alan had much to think of that evening; </p><p>of his position, of Ramah, and not a little of </p><p>Miriam amid the roar of Fleet Street. He </p><p>fell asleep—to dream of Ramah—who mys- </p><p>teriously changed like a dissolving view</p><p>into Miriam. </p><p> Next morning as the rising sun tipped the</p><p>minarets and white-topped roofs in a rosy </p><p>flood, Alan rode up to the khalifa’s palace </p><p>once more, in company with one Bu Shaib, </p><p>a red-bearded son of the Riff. This time </p><p>the outer courtyard held a dozen horses </p><p>and mules; some of their owners seeking </p><p>audience, squatted patiently along the wall. </p><p> For over two hours Alan waited seeing</p><p>one man after another summoned. At </p><p>length when the last of the Moors had rid- </p><p>den away a huge black slave in white, with </p><p>an enormous silver-hilted scimitar slung </p><p>by a red sash, appeared at the inner gate </p><p>and bawled out- </p><p> “Let the Nazarene come to ray lord!”</p><p>Alan rose and was ushered into the inner </p><p>courtyard where he found the Khalifa Esha </p><p>Ben Fila seated cross-legged upon a carpet </p><p>in the shade of an arch. His eyes, pouched </p><p>and heavy, appeared impassively sullen. </p><p> A leather cushicn or footstool was lying</p><p>in the full glare of the sun on which Alan </p><p>The Double Scoop </p><p>19 </p><p>was told to sit. For a minute or two the </p><p>khalifa feigned to be unaware of his presence </p><p>continuing to talk in Shilhah — a Berber </p><p>language of which Alan knew no word—to a </p><p>scribe who sat at his feet with his horn and </p><p>paper. </p><p> Alan broke in with the orthodox saluta-</p><p>tion. Ben Fila glanced carelessly at him </p><p>as one might on noticing a cat in the room, </p><p>and nodded, mumbling unintelligible an- </p><p>swers to the series of greetings. Although </p><p>boiling with rage inwardly Alan knew suf- </p><p>ficient of Oriental ways to simulate calm in- </p><p>difference. At length after the preamble </p><p>Alan approached the object of his visit. </p><p>He had arrived the previous day, he ex- </p><p>plained, and demanded to know why he was </p><p>not received in the customary manner and </p><p>given a house for himself and his followers. </p><p> “Hast thou letters from the Makhzen</p><p>(Government)?” inquired the khalifa in a </p><p>level bored tone. </p><p> “Nay, it is not necessary,” returned</p><p>Alan, “I have with me a soldier from Kaid </p><p>Gilhooli, the protection of the kaid.” </p><p> “There are many soldiers in the empire of</p><p>the sultan—whom Allah bless!” </p><p> “In Fez and Marakesh it was not neces-</p><p>sary to have letters.” </p><p> “The ways of the North are not the ways</p><p>of the South.” </p><p> “I demand protection and a house.”</p><p> “Allah is great! If Allah wills.”</p><p> “I shall make complaint to Kaid</p><p>Gilhooli.” </p><p> “If Allah wills.”</p><p> “When? Today?”</p><p> “If Allah wills!”</p><p> The khalifa’s eyes had fastened upon a</p><p>pair of field-glasses slung across the English- </p><p>man’s shoulders. He bent and whispered </p><p>in the scribe’s ear. Said the scribe-</p><p> “El khalifa wishes to see those glasses!”</p><p>But Alan knew from the whole attitude </p><p>of the reception that they were hostile to </p><p>him; evidently in the pay of the stranger on </p><p>the black stallion. Alan began to lose con- </p><p>trol of his temper—a fatal thing in Oriental </p><p>diplomacy. He knew that the request to </p><p>see the glasses meant that the khalifa </p><p>coveted them as a gift; but he was too angry </p><p>to play out the Moorish game. </p><p> “No,” he said to the khalifa “they are not</p><p>for sale,” and knowing that the khalifa and </p><p>Gilhooli hated each other, repeated: “If I </p><p>am not treated properly I shall return and </p><p>make complaint to Kaid Gilhooli.” </p><p> “If Allah wills,” returned the khalifa</p><p>imperturbably. </p><p> “The English Government is powerful,”</p><p>supplemented Alan. </p><p> “Allah is all merciful!”</p><p> Alan without further ado got up and</p><p>walked out, returning veiled insults with an </p><p>open one. </p><p>AS ALAN rode off he passed three </p><p>German naval officers mounted on </p><p>Moorish horses, with an escort of </p><p>sailors marching like infantrymen. They </p><p>were the source of his troubles, he reflected </p><p>savagely. Returning to his camp he sat on </p><p>the ramparts alongside one of the ancient </p><p>guns which, ironically, was trained right </p><p>on the grim little shape of the Panther out </p><p>in the bay. </p><p> Whilst he sat there composing a vicious</p><p>article, scathing in the inference to the lost </p><p>prestige of England, a German naval order- </p><p>ly approached and handed him a note: an </p><p>invitation to lunch from the commander of </p><p>the gunboat. Alan accepted and as he </p><p>walked down to the beach after a wash, </p><p>thought what a sardonic sense of humor the </p><p>Germans had! </p><p> The lunch passed off well. Most of the</p><p>officers spoke English and moreover Alan </p><p>more than appreciated the table delicacies </p><p>and wine. Over coffee and cigars the com- </p><p>mander gave his version of the reason of </p><p>their visit which—to Alan’s private amaze-</p><p>ment—consisted in the German commercial </p><p>interests in the Sus. He was given to </p><p>understand, he continued, that Alan had </p><p>met with some opposition or difficulty with </p><p>the khalifa? The Moors were very obtuse </p><p>people at times, but the commander would </p><p>be most happy to offer Alan the protection </p><p>of his Imperial Majesty the Emperor. </p><p> In a flash Alan saw scare - head</p><p>placards- </p><p> “Englishman seeks German protection in</p><p>Morocco.” </p><p> With a thin Yorkshire smfle he thanked</p><p>Herr Commander very much for his offer, </p><p>but regretted that he was unable to avail </p><p>himself of it. </p><p> He was rowed back to the black rock land-</p><p>ing-place with a wee small glow of satisfac- </p><p>tion that he had managed to circumvent </p><p>that subtle little move, only to receive </p><p>checkmate when he arrived at the camp. </p><p>From the fire a red-capped soldier rose up </p><p>and briefly informed him that by the </p><p>20 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>khalifa’s orders he was to leave the city on </p><p>the morrow. </p><p> “Go to the devil!” Alan exclaimed angrily,</p><p>and although the Moor did not understand, </p><p>he cursed him fluently and piously as he </p><p>turned away. </p><p> The sun set behind Cape Ghir in a flood of</p><p>crimson and purple dying the sea and tinting </p><p>the gunboat in blood. </p><p> Alan moodily contemplated the situation.</p><p>In the chaos of his mind he remembered </p><p>Miriam and smiled indulgently as he </p><p>thought of her silly boasts and idea of wo- </p><p>men journalists. What indeed could a wo- </p><p>man do? Imagine a woman journalist in his </p><p>shoes now? Good heavens, it was farcical! </p><p>He would use the episode to shatter </p><p>Miriam’s insane arguments when he got </p><p>home. Then as the sun dipped and violet </p><p>twilight wrapped the world a fit of de- </p><p>pression seized him. He had been lucky </p><p>before; this was his first defeat and it </p><p>seemed bitter, particularly when it might </p><p>have been the greatest scoop in the journal- </p><p>istic world for years. </p><p> “That confounded alien mongrel on the</p><p>black horse!” was the mysterious special </p><p>correspondent and the German combined—• </p><p>playing traitor as spies usually did. He was </p><p>the “German commerical interests in </p><p>southern Morocco”—the Sus where there </p><p>was no European trade at all! That con- </p><p>clusion cheered him a little. It would </p><p>make a scorching article. </p><p> A light silvery laugh startled him. He</p><p>turned sharply to see the hooded figure of a </p><p>woman, a pair of brilliant eyes twinkling </p><p>at him above the blanket hoik. </p><p> “Ramah!” he cried as she lowered it.</p><p> “E-eh, oh, Roumi.”</p><p> “How didst thou come-”</p><p> “S-shwith one henna-stained linger to</p><p>lips. “I come to warn thee. Come!” </p><p> She glided into his tent which sheltered</p><p>them from the sight of the men around the </p><p>fire.</p><p> “Listen, oh, Aziz—” he hardly noticed</p><p>the endearing term in his excitement— </p><p>“Es-sid-el-Keleeb and the khalifa, my </p><p>master—lying in the garden I did hear them </p><p>talk. If thou are not gone by the morrow </p><p>theyplottokill thee. But thou must not go.” </p><p>“Nay, I will not,” exclaimed Alan, his </p><p>pugnacity aroused by the news. </p><p> ‘“Nay but thou must,” she adjured him</p><p>apparently inconsistently, “but only to re- </p><p>turn, oh, my beloved.” </p><p> Again the superlative term, which he did</p><p>not heed. She drew closer to him. </p><p> “Wilt thou trust thyself to me?” she</p><p>demanded. </p><p> “Yes, of course,” he answered absently in</p><p>English, thinking hard. </p><p> “What sayest thou?”</p><p> “Eh? Yea, Ramah, I agree. It is good,</p><p>little one.” </p><p> “Listen. Tomorrow thou wilt go, thou</p><p>and thy servants and make thy camp beside </p><p>Fonti on the beach.” </p><p> “Mezian. It shall be done. And then?”</p><p> “Wait until I come for thee.”</p><p> “Mezian,” he assented and intent upon</p><p>his professional interests, failed to notice </p><p>her reproachful eyes as her dim form melted </p><p>into the shadows. </p><p>CHAPTER V </p><p>Vast as creation, yet when all is said, </p><p>How short the words that make our weal or wo? </p><p>What dearer heaven now? What deeper hell? </p><p>“I love thee,” or “I love thee not” farewell. </p><p>And may the mercy of the Lord descend </p><p>On Sidi Hammo. Here his song hath end. </p><p>—Sidi Hammo. </p><p>THAT evening as the darkling night </p><p>swallowed up the plain of the Sus, </p><p>Miriam uneasily watched Fear put Avarice </p><p>to flight in the hearts of her Jewish hosts.</p><p>Yakub had broken faith and told of the </p><p>scene on the ramparts between Miriam and </p><p>the baron, with the result that old Yusuf </p><p>and his pallid wife clamorously insisted that </p><p>Miriam must depart from Agadir before </p><p>worse befall or at least that she must leave </p><p>their house. They feared and hated the </p><p>baron as the Evil One, and hand in glove </p><p>with the khalifa; Allah only knew what </p><p>might not befall them. Miriam offered </p><p>more money, but with an effort that wrung </p><p>rheumy tears from the old man’s eyes he </p><p>refused. </p><p> Miriam, although fearful of the impor-</p><p>tunities of the baron, did not intend to </p><p>leave Agadir in ignominious flight. The </p><p>more pressing the circumstances became </p><p>the more tremulously stubborn she grew. </p><p>She had heard from Yakub, via the sok, of </p><p>Alan’s arrival so that she was not sur- </p><p>prised to pass him in the streets. She had </p><p>imagined that he would know her, but </p><p>when she observed the lack of recognition </p><p>in his eyes she laughed and passed on in- </p><p>tensely amused. </p><p> At the first intimation from Yusuf Ben</p><p>The Double Scoop </p><p>21 </p><p>Musa that she must leave the house, she </p><p>had naturally thought of taking refuge with </p><p>Alan whom she imagined to be quite au fait </p><p>with the authorities, as she had observed </p><p>him embark for the gunboat. But on sec- </p><p>ond thoughts the idea smattered too much </p><p>of humiliation. Eventually she concluded </p><p>that it was a choice of two evils—refuge or </p><p>ignominious flight; so she reluctantly de- </p><p>cided tto descend upon the unsuspecting </p><p>Alan next day. </p><p> As she sat in the courtyard with little</p><p>Zara staring at the square of scintillating </p><p>stars above she tried to console hejrself— </p><p>half-defiantly—that whatever happened she </p><p>had secured the creme dc la crime of the </p><p>scoop and wandered mentally to Fleet </p><p>Street, thinking of herself as the heroine of </p><p>the hour. Then a thought of the baron </p><p>who had maintained an ominous silence </p><p>since the episode, sent a cold shudder of ap- </p><p>prehension down her spine. It required </p><p>little imagination to realize that in such an </p><p>out-of-the-way barbarous spot many dread- </p><p>ful things might happen to a woman. </p><p> In an access of impotent rage she cursed</p><p>her sex for their inherent weakness. It was </p><p>all so bitterly unfair. She looked at Zara </p><p>in the gloom and wondered if it were not </p><p>better to be of her type, the Oriental </p><p>woman, frankly a toy for man’s leisure mo- </p><p>ments, dumb, uncomplaining; not dream- </p><p>ing of the liberty and understanding which </p><p>might and should be theirs. </p><p> It was an idea born of momentary weak-</p><p>ness of which she felt ashamed the next </p><p>moment. Yet everything seemed so cruel </p><p>and heartless, a kicking against the pricks </p><p>of fate. A passionate desire suddenly </p><p>welled up within her to cry peccavi, to run </p><p>to Alan and throwing her arms ’round his </p><p>neck to sob her heart out. She had to set </p><p>her teeth to conquer the surge of emotion. </p><p>It passed; she smiled bitterly in the dark- </p><p>ness. </p><p> At that moment there was a patter of</p><p>small slippered feet. One of the gollywog </p><p>little Jewesses rushed excitedly into the </p><p>courtyard, swinging a candle lantern and </p><p>crying out upon her father in Hebrew. In </p><p>a moment Yakub and the rest of the family</p><p>were gathered in a gesticulating group. </p><p>Out of the medley of voices Miriam heard </p><p>Yakub crying at her: </p><p> “Thou hast brought this upon us! We</p><p>are lost!” </p><p> Miriam got up and went over to them.</p><p> “Eh-eh!” yelled Yakub wildly, waving</p><p>his palms. </p><p> The little girl held the lantern up and</p><p>pointed a tragic finger at her, screaming </p><p>shrilly; the old man wrung his hands and </p><p>the wife literally howled. </p><p> It was some minutes ere Miriam could</p><p>interpret anything intelligible from the </p><p>hubbub. Then little Zara, the only one </p><p>who had not lost control of herself, ex- </p><p>plained that the little girl had just come </p><p>from the palace with the news that the </p><p>khalifa had at last discovered the abode of </p><p>the pretty Jewess with whom he had fallen </p><p>in love one day in the sok. </p><p> The baron has executed his threat,</p><p>thought Miriam. She went very white, for </p><p>she divined what this might mean. </p><p> “And he hath sworn that he will take</p><p>you into his harem! IValii—IValii!” Zara </p><p>broke out. “They will come for thee, and </p><p>kill the rest of us! Walli! Wo is me!” </p><p> There was renewed pandemonium. The</p><p>upshot was that they were hysterically de- </p><p>termined to throw Miriam out of the house </p><p>then and there to save themselves. Little </p><p>Zara remonstrated, crying shrilly that </p><p>Miriam might be hidden away; but this </p><p>suggestion was met with howls, proclaim- </p><p>ing that death was sure if she were not </p><p>found by the khalifa’s people. </p><p> Old Yusuf stood by the arch leading to</p><p>the door; wringing his hands he implored her </p><p>to go and called upon all the prophets of the </p><p>Pentateuch; the wife wailed helplessly be- </p><p>side him; the child with the lantern dashed </p><p>excitedly between Miriam and her father </p><p>like an erratic dragonfly, clutching at her </p><p>clothes; whilst Yakub, gibbering with craven </p><p>fear, hovered about Miriam trying to sum- </p><p>mon sufficient courage to eject her forcibly. </p><p>Miriam with faithful little Zara clinging to </p><p>one arm, defied them—head up and curling</p><p>lips—in a mixture of Anglo-Spanish cum </p><p>Franco-Arabic. </p><p>THEN in the midst of the uproar </p><p>there was a fresh commotion at the </p><p>door. Old Yusuf shrieked and was </p><p>sent flying on to his face; the child dropped </p><p>the lantern, which spluttered and went out </p><p>as a group of armed men burst into the </p><p>courtyard. There was a moment of para- </p><p>lyzed silence. The leader, a tall hawk- </p><p>faced Arab, peered ’round by the aid of a </p><p>lantern carried by a negro. Then simul- </p><p>taneously the howls broke out afresh. As </p><p>22 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Miriam darted behind a pillar the men </p><p>swooped upon her. In a trice rough hands </p><p>seized her. A blanket was bundled over </p><p>her head. She felt herself lifted by wiry </p><p>arms. Struggling violently, mad with rage, </p><p>she was borne swiftly away. </p><p> The enveloping blanket produced the suf-</p><p>focation of a nightmare; the powerful arms, </p><p>that dreadful sense of impotence. Miriam </p><p>struggled futilely until she collapsed into a </p><p>limp burden from sheer exhaustion, in </p><p>which she dimly heard the mutter of voices </p><p>and scuffle of animals. The sensation of </p><p>being lifted in the air roused her to another </p><p>paroxysm. She felt the gentle undulating </p><p>motion of a horse or mule walking, and the </p><p>muffled klop Hop of hoofs upon cobbles. </p><p> The journey seemed to last for hours.</p><p>As her senses began to revive a little she </p><p>became acutely conscious that the coarse </p><p>hair of the blanket scratched her face and </p><p>lips, forcing a pungent acrid taste into her </p><p>mouth. The chaos of her mind caused by </p><p>the shock began to clear. Lucid thoughts </p><p>sped swiftly. She jumped to the conclu- </p><p>sion that she was being taken to the kha- </p><p>lifa’s palace. In a second of time her imagi- </p><p>nation painted a vivid picture of what her </p><p>fate would be. She shuddered and groaned </p><p>with anguish. Wildly she thought of ways </p><p>to escape; of some method to take her own </p><p>life rather than .... </p><p> A nausea overwhelmed her. She lost</p><p>sense of time and space. </p><p> Then after an eternity she became con-</p><p>scious that she was lying on something soft </p><p>and that the cool night air was fanning her </p><p>cheeks. She drew a long breath, sighed and </p><p>opened her eyes. Bending over, his sharp </p><p>features in the light of a lantern, was the </p><p>baron. </p><p> He must have rescued her then? A feel-</p><p>ing of relief and gratitude glowed for a mo- </p><p>ment. He at least could never be so terri- </p><p>ble as a Moor. The baron was holding a </p><p>glass of brandy which he bade her drink in </p><p>a curiously low tone. Strange. Miriam </p><p>wondered, with that irrelevance of thoughts </p><p>in moments of distress, why his voice was </p><p>so soft. Like a gentle purr it seemed. She</p><p>gazed at him and tried to think what was </p><p>going to happen, but the one idea of the </p><p>gentleness of his voice seemed to obsess </p><p>her brain. </p><p> He was talking about something, but she</p><p>could not grasp the sense. Then the alcohol </p><p>began to take effect. She found her mind </p><p>coming under control again and began to </p><p>comprehend what he was saying. Some- </p><p>thing about regrets for some action. What, </p><p>for rescuing her? How absurd! She tried </p><p>to thank him, but found her lips were stiff </p><p>and swollen. The liquor stung them too. </p><p> “You are feeling better?” he inquired.</p><p> Miriam mumbled inarticulately.</p><p> “So? Allow me!”</p><p> Then he bent down and rearranged some</p><p>of the cushions. How kind he was, the </p><p>baron! The predominant terror that she </p><p>was about to fall into the savage Moor’s </p><p>power had for the time driven the baron’s </p><p>character from her mind. Then the asso- </p><p>ciation of ideas stirred the memory cells </p><p>into activity. She sat up, spurred by the </p><p>idea. </p><p> “My God!” she gasped thickly. “Did</p><p>you kidnap me?” </p><p> The baron had put down the lantern—</p><p>there was no one else in the starlit court- </p><p>yard—and was sitting beside her. His </p><p>mouth twisted into that snarling smile. </p><p> “If you like,” he said shrugging his</p><p>shoulders, “to put it so crudely. So?” as </p><p>Miriam made a movement of disgust. </p><p>“You beautiful little fool,” he said bending </p><p>toward her, “I saved you from a vile fate. </p><p>That black swine was going to take you. </p><p>Herr Gotti What do you think I have risked </p><p>for you, Liebchen? Everything for you. </p><p>Eight years have I plotted and schemed for </p><p>an Empire—ja, here in the Sus. It is with- </p><p>in my grasp, and Gott im Himmel, I play with </p><p>it—for you!” </p><p> He grasped her wist and kissed her hand.</p><p>She shrank away from him, but his grip </p><p>was like a steel trap. </p><p> “So?” he snarled. “Mein lieber Gott, you</p><p>lovely fool, I will tame you. Ja, I meant </p><p>to take you, but not until I was ready. </p><p>Then that cochon of a Moor—in two days </p><p>my boat will be here to take us—us, you </p><p>angel devil, to Cape Juby where we two </p><p>will be the German interests in the Sus. A </p><p>nice honeymoon, eh, Liebchen? But we’ll </p><p>spend the first two days here, so?” </p><p> There was a pause. Holding her a pris-</p><p>oner by the wrist he devoured her panting, </p><p>quivering figure with his eyes. Voices and </p><p>the clatter of horses sounded some distance </p><p>away. </p><p> “Give me a kiss, Liebchen!” he demanded</p><p>thickly and leaned toward her. </p><p> Miriam shrieked and made a frantic</p><p>effort to tear her wrist loose. He sat back </p><p>The Double Scoop </p><p>23 </p><p>retaining his hold and chuckled as he </p><p>watched her struggle and scream. </p><p> “Shriek, you sweet little devil, you!” he</p><p>said with an evil smile. “Women’s screams </p><p>are music in Morocco—so! Come! That’s </p><p>enough!” and he drew her to him. </p><p> Miriam kicked madly and beat him with</p><p>the one free hand like the wing of a cap- </p><p>tured bird. </p><p>SUDDENLY came a guttural oath. </p><p>The baron was lifted bodily from </p><p>her, releasing his hold at the bidding </p><p>of the instinct of self-preservation. Miriam </p><p>fell back panting, wild-eyed, to find the </p><p>room full of red-capped sodliers, creatures </p><p>of the khalifa. In a flash she realized that </p><p>Nemesis had overtaken the baron in the </p><p>jealous wrath of the khalifa, but that she </p><p>was reserved for a worse fate. Amid the </p><p>guttural remarks of the Moors, she saw, in </p><p>the light of several lanterns, the baron, as </p><p>helpless as a trussed fowl, his face distorted </p><p>with rage, in the hands of a gigantic negro </p><p>slave, who grinned with hellish delight. </p><p> A wild thought of self-destruction flashed -</p><p>athwart her mind, but before she had time </p><p>to recover even her power of speech, two </p><p>soldiers unceremoniously lifted her by the </p><p>shoulders and ankles and carried her out. </p><p>She felt too stunned and helpless to offer </p><p>futile resistance this time; numbed with </p><p>awful fear. She was hoisted on to the pom- </p><p>mel before a mounted negro. There was </p><p>the dim scuffle of horses and men, harsh </p><p>commands and exclamations. Then the </p><p>cavalcade started forward. Miriam, ex- </p><p>hausted and beaten, sobbing, swung limp </p><p>to the motion of the horse. </p><p> As the procession climbed up the dusty</p><p>narrow streets toward the governor’s palace </p><p>the early morning call to prayer rang out </p><p>resonant and clear beneath the shimmering </p><p>stars. </p><p> “Allah—Ak-ba-ak— La illaha U-”</p><p> Miriam did not swoon this time. Her</p><p>emotions seemed too overworked to re- </p><p>spond. Only the gasping sob and the dull </p><p>ache of choking fear. The flickering lights</p><p>of the lanterns carried by the slaves on foot, </p><p>danced ghostlike on the white walls. The </p><p>dark of the head of her captor was sharply </p><p>silhouetted against the stars. They seemed </p><p>to rock and sway giddily. She wondered </p><p>vaguely why the face was beardless. A </p><p>cock crowed near by. The muezzin was </p><p>still chanting. </p><p> Allah Akbah—there is no God save Al-</p><p>lah! </p><p> The stars were blotted out; sounds re-</p><p>echoed loudly under an arch. The stars </p><p>flashed at her again. The horse stopped. </p><p>She was lifted down and carried into the </p><p>gloom of a room. Somebody placed her on </p><p>something soft and yielding. She did not </p><p>know what it was; nor care. She ached all </p><p>over. She felt sick and tired, mentally and </p><p>physically—oh, so tired and weary. Noth- </p><p>ing mattered. </p><p> There was somebody moving about her.</p><p>She wished they would leave her in peace. </p><p>She seemed to have been ill-used, miserable </p><p>and tired ever since she could remember. </p><p>Feebly she wanted to die—but she knew </p><p>that she could not die because her heart </p><p>kept leaping within her bosom. </p><p> A light flashed in her eyes. She blinked</p><p>and saw an enormously fat woman leering </p><p>at her. Huge earrings bobbed under the </p><p>black hair. She was saying something in </p><p>Arabic. She handed the lantern to some- </p><p>body and laid her fat fingers on the shoulder </p><p>cords of Miriam’s robe. The touch aroused </p><p>her; spurred her into a frenzy, dispelling </p><p>the mental paralysis, sent a thousand awful </p><p>thoughts searing her brain. She uttered a </p><p>soundless scream and half-leaped, half- </p><p>wriggled, off the bed. She fell on to the </p><p>floor, scrambled into a corner, crying half- </p><p>articulately: </p><p> “No! No! No! No!”</p><p> As the odalisque, laughing hideously,</p><p>advanced ’round the bed a deep guttural </p><p>voice sounded behind her. She made some </p><p>reply, received a curt order and fled. </p><p> In the dim light Miriam saw the figure</p><p>of the khalifa. She watched him with the </p><p>fascination of a rabbit about to be devoured </p><p>by a snake. He walked silently across in </p><p>his bare feet, took up the lantern and ad-</p><p>vanced toward his victim, stroking his </p><p>beard and smiling. He said something in </p><p>Arabic. The proximity of the danger cooled </p><p>Miriam, made her think with lightning </p><p>rapidity. She had no means except her </p><p>hands to protect herself. She was abso- </p><p>lutely in this man’s power. If only </p><p>Alan . . . Her soul cried to him for </p><p>aid. </p><p> “Ana Americana!” she said desperately,</p><p>watching him keenly. </p><p> He started and peered at her closely.</p><p> “Ash?”</p><p> “Ana—Americana,” she repeated louder.</p><p>24 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Her heart beat faster with wild hope.</p><p>He spoke quickly, lowered the lantern and </p><p>examined her. He seemed perturbed and </p><p>puzzled. Miriam took heart. </p><p> “Look!” she cried in English standing up.</p><p>“I—am—American,” tapping her bosom. </p><p>‘ ‘American—I—go—Mogador—Sueira— </p><p>American consul. Fahamshi? (understand).” </p><p> The word “consul” seemed to convince</p><p>him. </p><p> “Subhan Allahl” he exclaimed, and</p><p>stepped back a pace. </p><p> Miriam over-eager, stepped aside.</p><p> “La! La!” lie said quickly gesturing a</p><p>negative. </p><p> Miriam stopped and stood watching</p><p>his impassive face, as he gazed at </p><p>her. </p><p> He was thinking swiftly. This girl was</p><p>as no other woman he had ever seen. She </p><p>was not a Jewess as he had supposed, but a </p><p>European. That was no odds, both were </p><p>infidels, cursed dogs of unbelievers. But </p><p>the Roumis were powerful—here on the </p><p>coast. There was a Roumi war-ship in the </p><p>harbor: if he took this girl they might re- </p><p>taliate by bombarding the town. They </p><p>needed an excuse to do so, he well </p><p>knew. </p><p> No, there were many dollars to be had</p><p>from the Roumis. Yet—Yillahl The girl </p><p>was beautiful! He looked at her as a con- </p><p>noisseur. He could retain her for two, per- </p><p>haps three years, and even then she would </p><p>still be worth a thousand dollars! And who </p><p>would know? That son of shame, that pig </p><p>of an unbeliever Es-sid-el-Keleeb? he </p><p>would soon be paying for his insult to the </p><p>beloved of Mahomet. His eyes wandered </p><p>hungrily over her again. No, by Allah, no </p><p>accursed Nazarene should stand between </p><p>him and his desire. He would away to his </p><p>Kasba/t in the Sus. The Roumis—Allah </p><p>was a!! powerful! </p><p> Miriam saw the change, saw the fire of</p><p>passion rekindle in his eyes and nerved her-</p><p>self for an effort—if only to obtain a weapon </p><p>to kill herself. As he smiled evilly she </p><p>made a desperate spring to pass him. He </p><p>caught her by the voluminous sleeve. She </p><p>hit out wildly and the whole of her soul </p><p>leaped into the name of her beloved: </p><p> “Alan! Al-an!”</p><p> The lantern was dropped in the struggle</p><p>and lay spluttering. An awful minute in </p><p>which the brute’s arms were ’round her, </p><p>his breath in her face. . . . </p><p>gjfflS MEANWHILE Alan had shifted </p><p>his camp to the beach near Fonti. </p><p>Long after sunset the hooded </p><p>ghostly figure appeared. She had brought </p><p>a jellab for him to wear above his European </p><p>clothes, a sufficient night disguise. Strik- </p><p>ing up the hill she led him by a rough and </p><p>broken path to the northern corner of the </p><p>city wall, where by a ruined bastion they </p><p>made entrance into the narrow streets. </p><p> Once the tramp and jingle of men and</p><p>horses drove them to shrink in the dark </p><p>shadow of a gate. A crowd of soldiers and </p><p>slaves on foot and horse passed them. The </p><p>leader, a hawk-faced Arab, made remark as </p><p>he passed: </p><p> “May Allah burn all infidels. That dog</p><p>Es-sid-el-Keleeb hath surely eaten of our </p><p>master’s sweets. Great will be his wrath, </p><p>by Allah!” </p><p> “What doth he mean, Ramah?” whis-</p><p>pered Alan. </p><p> “Es-sidi hath taken a hunger for a Jewess,</p><p>but Es-sid-el-Keleeb hath stolen the bird,” </p><p>answered Ramah. “S-sh, let us hasten. </p><p> Together they followed the band of night</p><p>marauders to the khalifa’s palace where by </p><p>a postern gate Ramah admitted Alan to a </p><p>deserted part of the rambling gardens. </p><p>Here in a small room she bade him rest </p><p>whilst she brought food and lights. While </p><p>he waited patiently in the gloom his </p><p>thoughts turned to Miriam. Ever since the </p><p>night before when Ramah had kissed him </p><p>the image of Miriam kept recurring to his </p><p>mind. Strange he thought and sought for </p><p>a reason, but not being practised in emo- </p><p>tional analysis it eluded him. </p><p> As Ramah returned with a lantern carry-</p><p>ing a basket of food the early morning call </p><p>to prayer rang out from the adjacent </p><p>mosque. As Ramah approached she seemed </p><p>to take the form of Miriam. </p><p> Her great eyes shone as she set the feast.</p><p>She brought news that there was a great </p><p>commotion in the palace as the khalifa was </p><p>mad with rage at being balked of his prey; </p><p>and that he had dispatched a force to cap- </p><p>ture Es-sid-el-Keleeb with orders to send </p><p>him to his Kasbah, ninety miles in the in- </p><p>terior, and on pain of death to bring back </p><p>the girl to him. </p><p> Alan felt a sudden fear grip him for</p><p>Miriam’s safety—which was absurd, for </p><p>Miriam was in London! Yet a voice seemed </p><p>to whisper: </p><p> “Alan! Oh, Alan!”</p><p>The Double Scoop </p><p>25 </p><p>“What’s that?” he excalimed starting up. </p><p>But only the cry of the Muezzin an- </p><p>swered him. </p><p> “What ails thee, oh, Aztiz?” queried Ra-</p><p> mah anxiously.</p><p> “Nothing,” said Alan, and relapsed into</p><p> silence, answering Ramah’s chatter in</p><p> monosyllables.</p><p> Gradually Ramah’s efforts began to thaw</p><p> him.</p><p>Presently as she sat beside him there </p><p>came the sound of the clatter of a cavalcade. </p><p>Again he thought of Miriam. He glanced </p><p>at Ramah. How like Miriam she seemed. </p><p>He felt a desire to kiss her; her large soft </p><p>eyes invited him. </p><p>Then the sound of a stifled scream </p><p>brought him to his feet. He listened in- </p><p>tently. </p><p> “It is but some slave being beaten,” said</p><p> Ramah petulantly, “or mayhap the Jewess</p><p> I told thee of.”</p><p> There was a long pause in which Alan felt</p><p> certain of the proximity of Miriam. He</p><p> stood at the door, staring into the violet</p><p> black shadows of the garden.</p><p>There came distinct and close, a wild </p><p>broken cry: </p><p>“Alan! Al-an! </p><p> Alan dashed madly in the direction, fumb-</p><p> ling for his revolver as he ran, hearing,</p><p> seemingly at a great distance, the voice of</p><p> Ramah crying:</p><p>“Come back to me, beloved! Leave me </p><p>not, oh, Aziet” </p><p> A tall figure in robes stood over Miriam</p><p> clutching her shoulder with one hand.</p><p> Alan’s face peered amazedly into hers.</p><p> “My God, Miriam!” he cried.</p><p> “Alan, oh Alan!” she panted.</p><p> In the meantime the khalifa had recov-</p><p> ered from the shock of the wrench and had</p><p> summoned his guards.</p><p> Alan turned, revolver in hand, to find</p><p> the room full of slaves and soldiers, mostly</p><p> armed with scimitars. Thrusting Miriam</p><p> behind him he covered the khalifa, crying</p><p> in Arabic—</p><p> “At the first move thou art dead!”</p><p>The men hesitated and looked at their </p><p>chief who stood by the bed, glaring at Alan. </p><p> “Tell these men to go,” Alan continued.</p><p> “This woman is American—-fahamshi?</p><p> He drew back the hammer of the revolver</p><p> with an ominous click. The khalifa backed</p><p>and muttered a rapid order. </p><p> “Nam, sidi,” chorused the men and</p><p>filed out. Miriam stood behind Alan, her </p><p>breast heaving, her eyes devouring his face. </p><p> “Sit down and rest somewhere, darling,”</p><p>he said, without turning or lowering his </p><p>pistol. </p><p> She flushed at the endearing term, un-</p><p>conscious upon his part, and obeyed. The </p><p>khalifa never removed his eyes from the </p><p>steady revolver muzzle. </p><p> “Now,” said Alan standing over him like</p><p>a young god, “either you give us a safe </p><p>conduct to Mogador—or I go to the Ger- </p><p>mans. They will blow Agadir to pieces. </p><p>Choose!” </p><p> The khalifa did not hesitate. A mad and</p><p>armed infidel was not to his liking. </p><p> “It is the will of Allah! Thou and the</p><p>girl shall start at once for Mogador.” </p><p> “If there is any treachery thou and thy</p><p>people will suffer for it. Swear!” </p><p> “On the beard of my Lord Mohammed, I</p><p>swear it!” answered the khalifa. “May </p><p>Allah the All Merciful, the All Forgiving, </p><p>curse thee,” he added piously. </p><p> “Go and give orders for our departure,”</p><p>said Alan, lowering the revolver. “And re- </p><p>member thy oath!” </p><p> The khalifa departed slowly, retaining his</p><p>dignity, for which and the absence of whin- </p><p>ing excuses, Alan forgave him much. </p><p> He turned and in the dim light looked at</p><p>Miriam half-sitting on the edge of the huge </p><p>bed. </p><p> “My God, little woman,” he said and</p><p>took her in his arms. </p><p> In a moment or two there was the low</p><p>throat-laugh of a woman’s triumph. </p><p> “You great, dear darling,” she whispered</p><p>half-tearfully. “I knew that months and </p><p>months ago.” </p><p> But neither noticed the patter of little</p><p>slippers at the door as Ramah, with a chok- </p><p>ing sob, stole softly away to the solitude </p><p>of a roof-top to hide her passionate grief </p><p>like a stricken fawn. </p><p> As the violet wings of the dawn flew be-</p><p>fore the pageant of the sun, she watched </p><p>the lovers ride out of the city gate, the kha- </p><p>lifa’s escort about them. Then she real- </p><p>ized dimly that her dream of love was over, </p><p>the gates of paradise were shut in her face, </p><p>that she was left to sink into the sordid </p><p>slough of an odalisque. </p><p>The Ferret ancHhe&amp;ef </p><p> by J. Allan Dunn</p><p>Aulor of “The Bully," “The Marooncr," etc. </p><p> ^iHE “Ferret” could have reported</p><p>the conversation between the </p><p>; !■ warden and the man from head- </p><p>WF H quarters very accurately, that </p><p>part of it, at least, that generalized upon </p><p>himself and the three others who were to </p><p>leave the penitentiary that morning, having, </p><p>it was supposed, if not generally practised, </p><p>fully expiated their crimes and being re- </p><p>stored to freedom if not full citizenship. </p><p>For the Ferret was very, very far from being </p><p>a fool. </p><p> “Once a crook, always a crook!” an-</p><p>nounced the detective, somewhat wearily. </p><p>“You wait till they begin coming back to </p><p>you. I ain’t running down your dope </p><p>or your methods but you’re new to the </p><p>game, if you’ll pardon my saying so. </p><p>There’s a heap of improvement needed in </p><p>penitentiaries, I’ll grant you, but all your </p><p>honor system, your free talk and your </p><p>baseball games ain’t going to make an </p><p>honest man out of a blown-in-the-glass </p><p>crook. Do what you will with ’em, they </p><p>figure the mistake they made was in getting </p><p>caught, not in the crime itself. </p><p> “They come in sore and they go out sore,</p><p>for all your coddling of ’em. You can’t </p><p>make ’em glad to be here. A man in a cell </p><p>nurses a grouch and a guy with a grouch ain’t </p><p>going to repent. He may think it pays best </p><p>to run straight but he gets out and he reads </p><p>about something good that was pulled off </p><p>and then he meets his woman or some </p><p>tvoman and then some of the gang come </p><p>around and show him an easy thing. Well— </p><p>he’s sick of prison grub and prison fare and </p><p>so’s his woman of the skimping she’s done </p><p>while he was in. The excitement gets </p><p>him—and then we get him and you see </p><p>him registering at your hotel inside of a few </p><p>months at best. </p><p> “Take it from me, Mr. Warden, I know</p><p>’em. ‘Once a crook, always a crook.’ Take </p><p>the Ferret, first-class cracksman and high- </p><p>flier, going out today after five years less </p><p>eight months for behaving himself; he’ll </p><p>be back. I’ll bet you a month’s pay he’ll </p><p>be back inside of six months, or, if he isn’t,</p><p>we’ll be looking for him. Why was he good </p><p>in quod? Because he wanted to get out of </p><p>quod. Not because he means to go </p><p>straight.” </p><p> “I’ll take that bet, Henderson,” said the</p><p>new warden quietly. “Call it an even </p><p>hundred. You know only the seamy </p><p>side of human nature. There’s a right and </p><p>wrong side to every man, but you never </p><p>turn over the goods to have a look at the </p><p>pattern that was intended to be shown. A </p><p>crook may be always a crook, but all con- </p><p>victs are not crooks, Henderson. Circum- </p><p>stance, environment, desire of that same </p><p>excitement you mentioned,-the same sort of </p><p>desire that sent men viking in old times, have </p><p>a lot to do with it. The Ferret,” he broke </p><p>off to smile, “do you know what the Ferret </p><p>has been doing and what he wants to do?” </p><p> “I’d make another little bet on the last</p><p>end of it. What has he been doing?” </p><p>26 </p><p>The Ferret and the Bet </p><p>27 </p><p> “Doing wonderful things in my garden</p><p>and greenhouse. The man is a born genius </p><p>with grafting and crossing.” </p><p> “I believe all of that,” said Henderson.</p><p>“Double-crossing and grafting are easy to </p><p>him.” </p><p> “And he wants—wait, we’ll have him</p><p>in and ask him.” </p><p> The Ferret was escorted in. He might</p><p>have been anywhere between forty and </p><p>fifty. His hair, that had been allowed to </p><p>grow since his time of freedom approached, </p><p>was long enough to be laid back in a smooth </p><p>gray pompadour. The forehead was well- </p><p>shaped, the nose well-chiseled and the </p><p>mouth neither small nor thin-lipped. His </p><p>eyes—Henderson would have called them </p><p>cunning—to the warden they were shrewd. </p><p>He was slight but built with all the sug- </p><p>gestive agility of the animal after which </p><p>the underworld had christened him. </p><p> The work among the warden’s shrubs</p><p>and flowers had banished all trace of prison </p><p>pallor, his cheap, ready-made suit fitted </p><p>him surprisingly well, he looked not at all </p><p>like a discharged prisoner, not at all like a </p><p>malefactor, a wizard at coaxing combina- </p><p>tions and blowing stubborner safes—he had </p><p>used oxy-acetylene on the last one. His </p><p>hands might have been those of a wood- </p><p>carver, a musician even, or a master- </p><p>gardener. </p><p> Though Henderson would have set them</p><p>down as the hands of a forger or a master- </p><p>cracksman. And he stood respectful with a </p><p>certain dignity, quite at his ease, the hint </p><p>of an ironic smile on his lips for Henderson, </p><p>the gleam of a friendly one in his eyes for </p><p>the warden. </p><p> “What are you figuring on doing,</p><p>Rogers?” asked the latter in kindly fashion. </p><p> “I should like to take up the raising of</p><p>fancy shrubs, sir,” answered the Ferret, </p><p>ignoring Henderson’s grin at his words. </p><p>“It takes more capital than I have. To go </p><p>into it properly it would take a thousand </p><p>dollars before I’d get any return but I'll go </p><p>at it quietly, if I can get an opening.”</p><p>Henderson snickered. </p><p> “Be .careful of the kind of opening you</p><p>choose, Ferret,” he said. “Too bad you </p><p>ain’t got something tucked away to start </p><p>you out. Now, see here, Ferret, I ain’t up </p><p>here on your account so don’t let that </p><p>worry you.” </p><p> “I won’t, Mr. Henderson.”</p><p> Henderson flushed a little at the irony.</p><p>He had been the chief instrument in sending </p><p>the Ferret up for his stretch but it had not </p><p>been his cleverness, it had been through </p><p>the treachery of a stool-pigeon and he felt </p><p>that the Ferret did not rate his professional </p><p>acumen over-highly. </p><p> “The warden tells me you are trying to</p><p>go on the level,” he said. “You go ahead </p><p>and raise fancy shrubs all you want, I’ll </p><p>never bother you. But I’m going to be on </p><p>the level with you. I’ve made a little bet </p><p>with the warden here, never mind for how </p><p>much or how long, that you’ll be tapping </p><p>the tumblers again. Now I’ll warn you, </p><p>I’m going to keep close tabs on you, but I </p><p>am warning you and if you win I lose.” </p><p> The Ferret raised his expressive eye-</p><p>brows. </p><p> “That’s mighty square of you, Mr.</p><p>Henderson,” he said. “And mighty nice </p><p>of you to take a chance on me, sir,” he said </p><p>to the warden. </p><p> But he made no protestation of his de-</p><p>termination or ability to win the warden’s </p><p>bet. </p><p> “That’s all, Rogers,” said the latter,</p><p>rising. “Good-by and good luck.” </p><p> They shook hands, warden and ex-convict</p><p>and the latter passed from the private office </p><p>quietly, unobtrusive but unslinking and, </p><p>presently, went out of the Gate of Sorrow </p><p>and down to the train with the others who </p><p>had also shaken off the shackles of judg- </p><p>ment. </p><p> “Want to hedge, Henderson?” asked the</p><p>warden. </p><p> “Not me. Wait till he sees Broadway</p><p>and a Jane he wants and who wants a flash. </p><p>You can book that bet.” </p><p> And the warden booked it.</p><p>IT HAPPENED that Henderson </p><p>got through with his penitentiary </p><p>business in time to take the same </p><p>train as the Ferret, whom he found in the </p><p>smoking-car. Being a sport, Henderson, </p><p>known to all the trainmen, did not help to </p><p>make the Ferret conspicuous by even </p><p>nodding to him but he took a seat across the </p><p>aisle and a little back of his man, lit one of </p><p>the warden’s cigars and kept a casual, but </p><p>keen eye on the Ferret. </p><p> The Ferret looked out of the window for</p><p>a while at the green meadows of West- </p><p>chester County, at the green woodlands, </p><p>the blue distance, the nigh flowers, the </p><p>birds, at a butterfly that vagrantly fluttered </p><p>28 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>with the train for a few seconds and there </p><p>was a look in the eyes that would have </p><p>surprised Henderson, almost a suggestion </p><p>of the dew that might still be moist on the </p><p>ferns in the shady coppices. Then he </p><p>bought a paper from the news-butcher, </p><p>a paper and an orange, and glanced at one </p><p>long-forbidden luxury while he slowly </p><p>swallowed the other, segment by segment. </p><p>Suddenly he sat up, absorbed in an item. </p><p> Henderson noticed the swift change,</p><p>noticed the heading of the paper, bought </p><p>one himself when the boy came through </p><p>again and read where the Ferret was reading </p><p>for the second time. There was no dewy </p><p>look in the Ferret’s eyes now, only the hard </p><p>shine of gray steel. And into Henderson’s </p><p>eyes crept a look of triumph. </p><p> “What did I tell the warden,” said</p><p>Henderson to himself, “what’d I tell him. </p><p>What he’s reading is like catnip to an old </p><p>Tom. He’s sore he wasnft in on it. His </p><p>mouth’s watering now, I’ll bet. Wonder </p><p>if I’ll get on the case?” </p><p> And he settled himself to read the item</p><p>with professional absorption. </p><p> There had been a week-end gathering</p><p>at the Long Island home of a Wall Street </p><p>successful broker, whose wife affected the </p><p>close acquaintanceship of Bohemia. Her </p><p>guests had many names famous in the Four </p><p>Arts plus the Art of the Theater and the </p><p>Roof Garden and there were others more </p><p>eccentric than famous, a rollicking, uncon- </p><p>ventional crew who had participated in a </p><p>fancy-dress dance, starting in the house, </p><p>transferred to the moonlit, lantern-painted </p><p>lawn and winding up with an early break- </p><p>fast at the Country Club. </p><p> And the next morning the pearls of the</p><p>hostess were missing, after many of the </p><p>guests had departed. </p><p> It was not a matter for the police,</p><p>declared the hostess. Not yet, at all events. </p><p>They might have been taken in mistake. </p><p>There had been necessarily a great con- </p><p>fusion in the leave-takings and donning of </p><p>wraps. She hoped, she expected, they </p><p>would be returned. Followed a detailed</p><p>description of the necklace of matched </p><p>pearls with a sapphire clasp. </p><p> Henderson bit savagely into the stub of</p><p>his cigar. </p><p> “Bah!” he told himself. “One of the</p><p>Bohemiam bums hooked ’em. Lot’s of </p><p>’em ’ud starve if it wasn’t for a lot of crazy </p><p>women who want to entertain ’em. I’ll </p><p>bet she suspects one of them right now. </p><p>Not a matter for the police? Rot. If some </p><p>of those spangled poets and paint-daubers </p><p>was jugged once in a while it ’ud do ’em </p><p>all good. I wonder—yes, there it is.” </p><p> He had turned over the sheets to the</p><p>advertising columns and there in the </p><p>personals he found what he expected. </p><p> $500 REWARD and no questions asked for the</p><p>return of the pearl necklace owned by a certain </p><p>hostess and missed yesterday morning after a dance. </p><p>Apply to Throop &amp; Towne, Jewelers, New York </p><p>City. </p><p> Curiously enough, the Ferret had also</p><p>turned to that column. But now he was </p><p>reading the sporting page with zest. Ap- </p><p>parently his interest had ceased with the </p><p>fact that the job had been turned—and </p><p>turned by an amateur. But Henderson </p><p>still mentally spluttered. </p><p> “- fool ad. Wrote it herself. Got</p><p>her husband to put up the five hundred. </p><p>It’s a cinch she not only guesses who it was </p><p>and wants to cover them but she wants to </p><p>help ’em out of the mess that put them up </p><p>to the swipe. Maybe-” </p><p> His eyes narrowed as his mind wandered</p><p>down the devious and dirty alleys that his </p><p>profession sometimes led him to. An </p><p>infatuated, foolish woman, a shrewd ad- </p><p>venturer, the five hundred an acknowledg- </p><p>ment of attempted blackmail and an </p><p>implied willingness to meet it. Busy </p><p>husband and idle wife. The old triangle </p><p>stuff. It was old to Henderson. </p><p> Presently he too was deep in the possi-</p><p>bilities of war-time baseball. But he kept </p><p>the Ferret in view when the train got in. </p><p>The Ferret wandered along almost jauntily, </p><p>an idler in New York. He bought a</p><p>gardenia from a police-dodging vender, </p><p>smelled it and set it in his lapel and </p><p>strolled on again, the flower utterly re- </p><p>deeming the cheapness of his suit. </p><p> At Fifth Avenue he made his way to</p><p>the library steps and, standing beside one </p><p>of the supercilious twin lions, a woman met </p><p>him. She was no taller than the Ferret </p><p>and she was slender, her clothes giving </p><p>her a youth that still lingered in her quick, </p><p>impetuous rush, matched by the Ferret’s </p><p>embrace. Henderson caught sight of a </p><p>carefully tinted face, that yet did not avoid </p><p>the Ferret’s kiss, of hair carefully made </p><p>golden, and he smiled as he passed on. He </p><p>The Ferret and the Bet </p><p>29 </p><p>was through with the Ferret for the present. </p><p>But he felt reasonably sure of his bet. He </p><p>even pondered as to how he should spend it. </p><p> “A painted moll. They all fall for</p><p>them,” he told himself. </p><p> He was looking at the only side he knew,</p><p>the seamy one, he did not guess that rouge </p><p>and powder and eyebrow-pencils that hide </p><p>the ravages of time are sometimes the </p><p>camouflage of love, love that seeks to hold </p><p>and is a little afraid. </p><p> “You’re lookin’ fine, Jim. Who gave</p><p>you the gardenia?” </p><p> “I bought it for you, Nan. Lookin’</p><p>great yourself. Let’s get out of here. </p><p>Let’s get a regular meal. Somewhere where </p><p>there’s music and singing stuff and </p><p>dancing.” </p><p> “Got any money, Jim?”</p><p> “Seven dollars, old girl. Enough for eats. ”</p><p>“I’ve got nearly four hundred left, Jim.” </p><p>“You wonder! You ain’t been starving </p><p>yourself, have you?” </p><p> “Not me. Do I look it? But I moved</p><p>to a smaller place.” </p><p> “Good dope. Keep the bunch off for</p><p>a while.” </p><p> She looked earnestly at him.</p><p> “Don’t you want to see them, Jim?</p><p>I saw Flynn on the street. He told me to </p><p>tell you he had something good that needed </p><p>you. They was waiting for you to come </p><p>out, he said.” </p><p> “Did you tell him where you was living?”</p><p>“No, Jim. He told me where I could </p><p>find him.” </p><p> “Good! Nan,” he took her arm, “I’m</p><p>going to cut out all that stuff.” </p><p> “Jim! You mean it?”</p><p> Her voice rang out so that people turned</p><p>to look at them. The Ferret nodded.</p><p> “We’ll talk it over later. But I’ll tell</p><p>you this much. I’m going into growing </p><p>fancy shrubs. Got it all doped out. Re- </p><p>member how I always could make things </p><p>grow? Remember the first garden we had? </p><p>You was always good at it too, Nan— </p><p>brace up, old girl, here’s the grill.” </p><p> She winked back the happy tears that</p><p>welled and they turned into the grill. </p><p> Looking at things dispassionately it</p><p>seemed as if the chances of winning lay </p><p>even between Henderson and the warden </p><p>at that moment. </p><p> Later that afternoon the Ferret started</p><p>down-town to take the Long Island ferry. </p><p>There was a famous arboriculturist whose </p><p>plantations and nurseries were located </p><p>there, close to many of his customers, and </p><p>the Ferret, who never allowed the grass </p><p>to grow under his feet, intended to get his </p><p>prices and other information at first-hand </p><p>as well as look for a likely piece of land for </p><p>the leasing. </p><p> Just how he was going to tackle the</p><p>problem of an independent nursery on the </p><p>three hundred-odd dollars that constituted </p><p>his and Nan’s capital he could not figure </p><p>out but his consuming energy to get going </p><p>forced him to a start. Also, at the arbori- </p><p>culturist's he might hear of a job. For </p><p>the warden had promised to give him ref- </p><p>erences that would not hold the taint of </p><p>his work having been done in the peni- </p><p>tentiary. And, to the Ferret, the warden </p><p>was a good deal of a surprise and somewhat </p><p>of a god, a superman, at least, one who </p><p>never failed in his promises. </p><p>WHEN he walked aboard the ferry </p><p>and made his way forward to the </p><p>bows, a red-headed, pasty-faced </p><p>man spotted him and followed him. The </p><p>Ferret did not see the man, for he walked </p><p>silently as a cat, until the latter caught </p><p>him by the elbow and, as the Ferret swiftly </p><p>slewed his neck to look at him, led the way </p><p>to the rail. </p><p> It was Flynn. Flynn of his old crowd,</p><p>Flynn who found the plants and did the </p><p>scouting and preliminary investigation. </p><p> “Been looking for you, Jim,” said Flynn.</p><p>“Figured you’d ring up some time to- </p><p>morrow. I gave Nan the number. But </p><p>the sooner the better. We been waiting </p><p>for you to get back. Where you bound?” </p><p>“To look at a place on the Island, Flynn. </p><p>Where you off to?” </p><p> Flynn grinned.</p><p> “I got a date,” he said. “There’s a flash</p><p>maid over at this plant we’re figuring on </p><p>you for, and she and me is keeping com- </p><p>pany. Where’s this dump you’re after? </p><p>Who put you wise to it. Tip from up </p><p>there, eh?” </p><p> “You’re a way off, Flynn,” said the</p><p>Ferret. “I’m through.” </p><p> “Through what?”</p><p> “I’m going straight, Flynn.”</p><p> “The-you are. Say, what’s the idea.</p><p>You ain’t got converted to that Billy Sun- </p><p>day stuff have you?” </p><p> “Figure.it how you want to, Flynn. I’m</p><p>through.” </p><p>30 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> The other fell back and studied the</p><p>Ferret’s face, inflexible with purpose. Then </p><p>he whistled softly. </p><p> “You’ve gone balmy up there, Jim.</p><p>You’ll come out of it after a while, after </p><p>what you got salted is used up. Nan didn’t </p><p>seem to be extra flush, at that. Say, Jim, </p><p>you ain’t in earnest, are you? Listen, this </p><p>plant is a cinch. Five thou’ apiece in it, </p><p>easy. Don’t be a mutt, Jim. What’s your </p><p>lay?” </p><p> “I’ll tell you what my lay is, Flynn.</p><p>I’m sick of this hide-out game. There’s </p><p>nothing in it to offset what you lose. I </p><p>want to be able to live in one place and </p><p>know it’s mine and it ain’t going to be </p><p>taken away from me and Nan, or me taken </p><p>away from it. Nan feels the same way </p><p>about it. She’s always wanted to be on </p><p>the level, Flynn, and I guess she’s got some- </p><p>thing coming to her after my trip up the </p><p>river.” </p><p> “Lost your nerve up there?” sneered</p><p>Flynn. </p><p> “No,” said the Ferret, looking him</p><p>straight in the eyes, “I don’t believe I have, </p><p>Flynn. I hope not, I’m going to need it </p><p>all. But I’m through.” </p><p> Flynn shrugged his shoulders.</p><p> “You know your own business best,”</p><p>he said. “Anyway Nan’s got my ’phone </p><p>number. So long.” </p><p> He turned away and the Ferret lost him</p><p>when they took different trains. He looked </p><p>out at the fields and gardens and the earth </p><p>seemed calling to him. What he had told </p><p>Nan was quite true. Things grew for him, </p><p>he was a bom gardener, a real craftsman. </p><p>A vision of peace grew slowly, of him with </p><p>his shrubs and Nan with her flowers— </p><p>she always loved flowers—there were ger- </p><p>aniums struggling in the tiny apartment </p><p>he had just left. But it would be a hard </p><p>road and he did not yet see the start. </p><p>And then, timed to his own pulse, the wheels </p><p>seemed clacking out a rhythm that pres- </p><p>ently voiced itself persistently. </p><p> “Five - thou’ - apiece. Five - thousand -</p><p>easy.” </p><p> To turn this one trick and then the way</p><p>would be clear! He saw what he could do </p><p>with that. Land, a house, tools, young </p><p>plants in the upturned soil. . . . </p><p> He swept the thoughts from his brain</p><p>and sat frowning until his station was </p><p>reached. </p><p> The big grower was cordial and sympa-</p><p>thetic but the Ferret was soon convinced </p><p>how utterly impracticable was his plan. </p><p>With war-prices and war-payments he </p><p>would have to spend all his scanty hundreds </p><p>for fertilizer alone. The grower offered </p><p>him a certain credit for plants when he was </p><p>once established but where was the rent to </p><p>come from for the land, the dwelling, the </p><p>living-expenses? </p><p> “You say you can get recommendations,”</p><p>said the grower. “I can place you in a job. </p><p>Good salary. I wouldn’t wonder if they </p><p>could find a place for your wife if she’s </p><p>handy. No kids, you say?” </p><p> “No,” said the Ferret slowly, “no kids.”</p><p> “Well, I know they are having a hard time</p><p>with their help. It isn’t far from here, </p><p>Mr. Rogers. You can tell them I sent you </p><p>up. They are a bit upset at this time. </p><p>Had a robbery night before last. But I </p><p>dare say Mrs. Haskins’ll see you.” </p><p> The Ferret listened to the directions and</p><p>started for the Haskins place. It would </p><p>be the best thing to do for the present, </p><p>especially if Nan got on, and that should </p><p>be easy. For Nan was more than just </p><p>handy; she had been a maid when he first </p><p>met her, much as Flynn was going to meet </p><p>the girl he mentioned. But there was a </p><p>peculiar irony in it all. He and Nan, ex- </p><p>con and ex-con’s wife, applying for a job in a </p><p>place where a pearl necklace had been </p><p>stolen, for this was the Mrs. Haskins of </p><p>the news item. It was risky. </p><p> If he was ever tipped off of course he had</p><p>an alibi as to the necklace; no one could </p><p>accuse a man of robbery who was in jail </p><p>when it occurred. But every place was </p><p>risky in a way and, since he had no capital,</p><p>he could not turn down the first chance. </p><p>The warden would manage his credentials. </p><p>The warden did not believe in showing the </p><p>seamy side of a man who was trying to </p><p>make good. He would only say that he </p><p>recommended the pattern. </p><p> “Mrs. Haskins is somewhere in the</p><p>garden,” the maid told him, and, if he had </p><p>come about a gardener’s position, he might </p><p>as well see her there. </p><p> So the Ferret trod the walks between</p><p>trim lawns and flower-beds, through a rose </p><p>garden and so down, as directed by a man </p><p>who was handling watering-hose, to a </p><p>terrace backed by a yew hedge, high as the </p><p>Ferret’s head. </p><p> He walked along the hedge toward the</p><p>gap of its entrance on to the terrace, </p><p>The Ferret and the Bet </p><p>3i </p><p>screened himself by masses of shrubbery, </p><p>and his trained ears caught the syllables </p><p>of earnest talk and, from a nature not yet </p><p>subdued, listened with the habit of his </p><p>recent profession. </p><p> “So, when I saw the news in the paper</p><p>this morning, Helen, I made up my mind </p><p>to come over and see what could be done. </p><p>I got up late but I came as soon as I could. </p><p>I’m terribly sorry about it.” </p><p> Now the Ferret had learned to read men</p><p>in many ways, by looks, by apparently </p><p>trivial actions and by the intonations of </p><p>the voice. This voice sounded frank, sym- </p><p>pathetic as it was cultured, but there was </p><p>a purring quality to it that made the </p><p>Ferret distrust its owner before he saw him, </p><p>and feel sure that his suspicion was well </p><p>placed. It was the voice of a man accus- </p><p>tomed to talk much with women—a voice </p><p>that could flatter readily and did—that </p><p>could charm and woo, the voice of a stage- </p><p>lover. </p><p> The woman’s voice was harder to inter-</p><p>pret. It held a hint of fear, a hint of in- </p><p>sincerity, or of fence, but it was charming. </p><p>And the Ferret, rooted suddenly, still </p><p>listened. </p><p> “Did you see the reward I offered,</p><p>Clinton? Harry was very kind about it. </p><p>He offered to make it more but I thought </p><p>it was enough. And I want my pearls </p><p>back, Clinton. I love them. The money </p><p>does not matter so much but they were </p><p>Harry’s wedding-gift to me and I want </p><p>them.” </p><p> The insincerity, or whatever it was, left</p><p>the voice as she spoke of her desire for the </p><p>gems. Then it came back. </p><p> “Can you suggest anything, Clinton?”</p><p> “I can’t. I’m a dub at such things. I</p><p>suppose you might double the reward if you </p><p>don’t get any response. The necklace is </p><p>worth much more.” </p><p> “It cost ten thousand dollars. But—</p><p>whoever took it—would not be easily able </p><p>to dispose of it, Harry says. Mr. Throop,</p><p>the jeweler, told him that the pearls would </p><p>lose value immediately they were separated </p><p>or sold unmatched, and of course the full </p><p>description was in the paper.” </p><p> “Yes. But I think I should double that</p><p>reward tomorrow.” </p><p> The Ferret did not shift his position but</p><p>his eyes hardened and his fists clenched. </p><p> “Clinton,” went on the woman. “Do</p><p>you remember you promised to return to </p><p>me those two letters I sent you. They did </p><p>not mean anything. They were just foolish </p><p>letters but Harry—won’t you let me have </p><p>them?” </p><p> “I will, tomorrow, Belle. If there is</p><p>nothing else I can do, I’ll be getting back </p><p>on the 5:50. That is, if you’re not going </p><p>to ask me to stay to dinner.” </p><p> He laughed as he spoke.</p><p> “No, it isn’t convenient tonight, Clin-</p><p>ton.” </p><p> “If I were you I’d telephone to those</p><p>jeweler people and also to the paper, </p><p>doubling that reward. I think it will bring </p><p>results. You say your husband was willing </p><p>to increase it. And I’ll send you those— </p><p>foolish—letters you speak of.” </p><p> The Ferret looked at his cheap but com-</p><p>petent watch. It was 5130 and the station </p><p>was a full mile back. He intended to catch </p><p>the 5150. The job—could wait. The man </p><p>and the woman moved on. Doubtless they </p><p>were going back to the house. The Ferret </p><p>ambuscaded behind the shrubs, glimpsed the </p><p>graceful figure and pretty face of the woman </p><p>and paid especial attention to the man, a </p><p>handsome, somewhat haggard chap, fault- </p><p>lessly dressed, who passed on with a covert </p><p>smile as he passed out of sight. </p><p> Within a hundred yards of the station</p><p>a car sped by the hurrying Ferret and in it </p><p>sat the man whose first name was Clinton. </p><p>He got out at the station and the car re- </p><p>turned toward the Haskins place. </p><p> Up-town, and later, the man whose first</p><p>name was Clinton descended from the </p><p>elevated in the nineties and walked to the</p><p>door of a bachelor-apartment house which </p><p>he opened with a key. He entered. A </p><p>minute later the Ferret inspected the small </p><p>foyer and noted a card that read: </p><p>Clinton Howard Bowdin. Apt. 8. </p><p> He looked at the rest of the names,</p><p>apparently comparing them with an en- </p><p>velop he carried, frowned and crossed the </p><p>street, seemingly looking at numbers. </p><p> But he glanced back at the house he had</p><p>left, quite casually. It was dark and </p><p>some of the windows were already illumin- </p><p>ated. </p><p> “Apartment eight,” mused the Ferret.</p><p>“That should be on the top floor back. </p><p>Seven is in front. No one home there.” </p><p> He walked up the street and back again</p><p>slowly. Three doors from the house that </p><p>32 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Clinton Bowdin had entered was one </p><p>evidently vacant—“To Let” signs in its </p><p>windows. </p><p>NAN greeted the Ferret expec- </p><p>tantly. Supper was ready for him. </p><p>“The first home meal, Jim,” she </p><p>said. “Any news? Or do you want to </p><p>keep it until after supper?” </p><p> “No news, old girl,” he said. “But</p><p>prospects. And I have to go out after </p><p>supper.”	'</p><p> She did not question him but, after he</p><p>had gone, she went into the bedroom where </p><p>he had been rummaging in a closet and </p><p>herself reached down a box on the back of </p><p>the shelf. Hardly knowing she carried it </p><p>she bore it into the next room and sat down </p><p>heavily with the box on her lap. Her face </p><p>was old now, old and pinched between the </p><p>lines, and gray. </p><p> “He has taken his keys and his gun,”</p><p>she repeated to herself over and over as </p><p>she rocked, her face a mask of dread— </p><p>dread and sorrow. </p><p>BTHE Ferret entered the doorway of </p><p>the vacant house like a shadow and </p><p>deftly set in the lock a twisted piece </p><p>of tempered wire. A little pull, a pause, a </p><p>quick thrust and a turn and the lock slid, </p><p>the shadowed door opened and closed again. </p><p> Two minutes later the scuttle leading</p><p>to the roof lifted and the Ferret emerged, </p><p>keeping well back from the front coping and </p><p>making his swift and subtle progress over </p><p>the roofs. He tried the scuttle-hatch of </p><p>the house that stood the third below and </p><p>found it tightly fastened from within. </p><p>Hardly visible in the gloom, he glided to the </p><p>back of the roof, peered over, tested a gutter, </p><p>let himself down with the agility of a gym- </p><p>nast, swinging to his hands, and dropped </p><p>without noise on to the top landing of a </p><p>fire-escape. </p><p> The landing was outside a room before</p><p>whose window a blind was drawn, almost </p><p>to the bottom, all but an inch. The Ferret </p><p>bent—looked through. </p><p> Handsome Clinton Bowdin was seated at</p><p>a table gazing at a lustrous string of pearls </p><p>clasped by a sapphire. </p><p> “Wondering if she’s doubled that re-</p><p>ward,” the Ferret told himself. “He’s </p><p>figuring on getting up early tomorrow to </p><p>see that paper. But he can’t cash in until </p><p>the jeweler opens.” </p><p> He stood upright, struck silently a safety-</p><p>match, showing the barest glimmer through </p><p>his shielding fingers while he briefly sur- </p><p>veyed the latch of the window. With the </p><p>precision of an expert he inserted something </p><p>between the sashes upward, gave a twist </p><p>to the handle of the instrument and the </p><p>catch was sprung with the tiniest of clicks. </p><p>Within, Bowdin did not move. </p><p> The Ferret nosed the breeze, almost</p><p>imperceptible, tried its strength with a wet </p><p>finger and then a loosely held bit of paper. </p><p> He eased up the bottom sash with the</p><p>tool that had started the catch and, inch </p><p>by inch under his wide-spread fingers, </p><p>quick to sense any lack of balance, the lower </p><p>pane moved upward, back of the blind. </p><p> Bowdin put back the necklace into its</p><p>case and took up two letters that he read </p><p>through with a sneering smile. </p><p> “Cheap at the price,” he said. “The</p><p>little fool to— Hell!” </p><p> He jumped to his feet as the spring blind</p><p>rushed up and flapped about its roller. </p><p>Coming through the window was a slight </p><p>man of whose face nothing could be seen </p><p>but a resolute chin and two eyes, hard as </p><p>steel, showing through a mask. One re- </p><p>markably steady hand held an automatic </p><p>aimed for Bowdin’s heart. </p><p> Bowdin did not move.</p><p> “I’ll put up my hands if you want me</p><p>to,” he said. “But you’ve come to the </p><p>wrong apartment. I am broke, my mur- </p><p>derous friend, always, perennially broke. </p><p>Nothing worth your while shooting for. </p><p>Besides the house is full, some one might </p><p>hear the shot.” </p><p> “You wouldn’t,” said the Ferret. “You’d</p><p>see the flash and feel the smash of the bullet</p><p>and that would be the end of you. I’ll look </p><p>out for myself afterward. But I’ll shoot.” </p><p> Bowdin turned pale, sweat broke out on</p><p>his forehead and the fingers of his hand </p><p>on the table trembled. The brutal de- </p><p>scription and the tone that backed it had </p><p>broken his bravado. </p><p> “What do you want?” he said in a low voice.</p><p> “The necklace you were admiring. Don’t</p><p>move!” </p><p> He shoved the automatic forward so that</p><p>its grim muzzle brushed the serge of </p><p>Bowdin’s coat and picked up the case </p><p>with one hand, sliding it into his own </p><p>pocket. Then he took up the letters. </p><p> “What do you want those for? They</p><p>are private letters.” </p><p>The Ferret and the Bet </p><p>33 </p><p> “Same thing you wanted them for. Now,</p><p>Mr. Bowdin, don’t start anything after I go. </p><p>I’m going out the front way. It might be </p><p>awkward for you to explain how you got </p><p>that necklace. Get me?” </p><p> He deftly ran his hand over Bowdin in a</p><p>search for a weapon. </p><p> “Now then,” he said, “you climb out</p><p>that window on to the fire-escape. Go on.” </p><p>With a glance of furious but futile resent- </p><p>ment Bowdin obeyed. </p><p> “You can break the glass after a while if</p><p>you can’t open the sash like I did. Or you </p><p>can climb down and stir up the janitor. </p><p>Good night.” </p><p> He pulled down the pane and set the</p><p>catch, leaving the discomfited Bowdin </p><p>glaring at him through the glass, went down </p><p>the stairs, opened the front door-latch and </p><p>passed into the street, confident that he </p><p>would not be followed. </p><p> Nan looked up with a white face and red-</p><p>rimmed eyes as he entered and tossed the </p><p>jeweler’s case into her lap. </p><p> “Jim,” she said. Jim! You said-”</p><p> “Nan. There’s a reward of one thousand</p><p>hung up for this and no questions asked. </p><p>I fell on to it. The thousand means every- </p><p>thing to us just now. I turned down </p><p>Flynn’s job, though there was five times the </p><p>amount in it. The people who put up this </p><p>reward won’t miss a thousand as much as we </p><p>would ten cents. A cheap thief swiped it and </p><p>I took it from the thief. I took something </p><p>else from him, two letters a woman would </p><p>give the thousand for without a murmur.” </p><p>“You said you’d go straight, Jim. I was </p><p>so happy till I saw what you’d taken from </p><p>the box.” </p><p> “We’ll chuck them all in the river to-</p><p>morrow, Nan, after I get the thousand.” </p><p>“But it’s stealing, Jim. Stealing and </p><p>blackmail.” </p><p> “Where do you get that? I ain’t selling</p><p>the letters. I ain’t read ’em and I ain’t </p><p>going to. I’m sending ’em back. I didn’t</p><p>take the necklace. Luck chucked it my </p><p>way when I most needed it and I’m going </p><p>to get that thousand.” </p><p> His face was dogged.</p><p> “Jim, it’s just the same. You didn’t earn</p><p>the thousand.” </p><p> “The- I didn’t.”</p><p> “Jim, I’ll put it to you this way. Maybe</p><p>I don’t put it well but I know it ain’t </p><p>straight. Which way would the warden </p><p>look at it?” </p><p> The Ferret flushed. He sat down with a</p><p>straight line between his brows. Then he </p><p>laughed. </p><p> “The warden! If the warden knew he’d</p><p>figure he’d lost his bet, I reckon.” </p><p> “How’s that, Jim?”</p><p> And he told her of the wager.</p><p> THROOP, senior partner of Throop</p><p>&amp; Towne, Fifth Avenue jewelers, </p><p>looked in perplexity at the slight, </p><p>gray-headed man who sat opposite him in </p><p>his private office. Between them the </p><p>Haskins necklace lay on the leather-topped </p><p>desk like a coiling snake. </p><p> “You say you don’t want any reward?”</p><p>he asked. “But the money is here. I give </p><p>you my word the matter goes no further.” </p><p>The Ferret shook his head. </p><p> “Won’t you leave your name—con-</p><p>fidentially? This is most extraordinary. </p><p>Do you realize the necklace is worth ten </p><p>thousand dollars?” </p><p> “Yes, I realize that, Mr. Throop. But</p><p>you are breaking the compact.” </p><p> “What compact?”</p><p> “No questions asked. Good morning,</p><p>sir.” </p><p> Outside the store the Ferret dropped a</p><p>letter in a mail-box. It was addressed to </p><p>Mrs. Belle Haskins of Long Island and </p><p>marked “personal.” As he turned away,</p><p>some one tapped him on the shoulder and </p><p>he whirled. </p><p> “Hello, Ferret,” said Henderson.” What</p><p>are you doing in Throop &amp; Towne’s?” </p><p>“Pricing diamonds with Mr. Throop,” </p><p>said the Ferret. “If you don’t believe me, </p><p>ask him.” </p><p> Henderson looked at him with a half-</p><p>grin. </p><p> “You’re a foxy one, Ferret, but I’ve got</p><p>my eye on you. I’m going to collect that </p><p>bet.” </p><p> “Will you do me a favor, Mr. Hen-</p><p>derson?” </p><p> “What is it?”</p><p> “Just how much did you bet with the</p><p>warden about me?” </p><p> The detective looked at him quizzically.</p><p>“A century. Why? Want to pay it for </p><p>the warden?” </p><p> “I might. I’m going up to see him this</p><p>afternoon.” </p><p> He walked off, leaving Henderson looking</p><p>after him in a muddle of speculation. </p><p>Presently the detective shadowed him, </p><p>34 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the Ferret perfectly conscious of the opera- </p><p>tion. And, when Henderson, flashing his </p><p>badge, asked his question at the ticket </p><p>office, the puzzle on his face deepened at </p><p>the answer. </p><p> “Ossining. Round trip.”</p><p> In the train the Ferret skinned off his</p><p>roll. Five twenties he put in his vest </p><p>pocket, the balance, a little over two hun- </p><p>dred and seventy dollars, he returned to </p><p>his hip. </p><p>y“I’LL tell you what I think of it, </p><p>Rogers,” said the warden as he </p><p>handed the Ferret a cigar. “I </p><p>should like to meet that wife of yours. </p><p>I wish you’d arrange it.” </p><p>“Why, of course, I’m proud to, sir.” </p><p>“For one thing I want to ask her if she </p><p>considers I’ve lost this bet to Henderson. </p><p>Because I’m not at all sure about it myself, </p><p>Rogers, and her vision is rather wonderful. </p><p>So you had better keep the hundred till we </p><p>talk it over. I’ve been thinking about you, </p><p>Rogers. How would you like to have me </p><p>as a business partner?” </p><p> “Why—why?”</p><p> The Ferret gasped and choked.</p><p> “I’ve got a thousand or so I could invest</p><p>in, say the fancy shrub business, Rogers. </p><p>Like to go into it?” </p><p> “You’d trust me?”</p><p> “I’d trust you and that wife of yours,</p><p>together, anywhere, Rogers. You’ve won </p><p>your own best bet.” </p><p> In the eyes of the Ferret, riding through</p><p>Westchester County in the early evening, </p><p>was a look that might have suggested the </p><p>dew on the ferns in the shady coppices that </p><p>graced the verdant hills. And a vision </p><p>came again, to stay, a vision of upturned </p><p>earth and the balm of shrubs, of fragrant </p><p>flowers, and, tending them, himself and </p><p>Nan. </p><p>BLIGHTY </p><p>BY TALBOT MUNDY </p><p>MHE derivation of “Blighty” is as </p><p>simple, really, as the origin and </p><p>meaning of Theodore Roose- </p><p>velt’s nickname given him by </p><p>the natives of East Africa. In spite of the </p><p>fifty various explanations given in the </p><p>papers, “Tumbo” means “stomach,” neither </p><p>more nor less. And “Blighty” means Eng- </p><p>land. It is one of Tommy’s adaptations </p><p>from Hindustani—a language he twists </p><p>and changes to suit himself when in India </p><p>and, when time-expired, brings home in </p><p>fragments with which to adulterate the </p><p>ever-growing English language. </p><p> Originally the word is vilayli, which</p><p>means European. But since the only sec- </p><p>tion of Europe, and the only Europeans </p><p>with whom the vast majority of natives </p><p>ever come in contact are England and </p><p>the British, by inference the word lias </p><p>come to mean British almost whenever </p><p>used. Vilayli pani—European water— </p><p>soda water. So much for the native stand- </p><p>point. </p><p> Adapting that, Tommy gets Blighty</p><p>tobacco, as distinguished from the local </p><p>article, Blighty clothing, Blighty letters, </p><p>Blighty leave, and—last of all—he “goes </p><p>Blighty” when the troopship takes him </p><p>home. So “Blighty” is England; and to </p><p>“wish you a Blighty one” is to hope that </p><p>when you are wounded it will be a severe </p><p>enough case to take you to England, with- </p><p>out “sending you West.” </p><p> The daily swelling war vocabulary is full</p><p>of similar instances. “Rooty,” for the </p><p>bread ration, is simply Hindustanee roli— </p><p>bread. “Treck,” meaning to move in any </p><p>way on wheels, is the Boer word trek— </p><p>travel. To “keep a dekko lifting,” mean- </p><p>ing to keep a sharp lookout, is from the </p><p>Hindustani imperative dekko—look. </p><p> Before ever he “napooed” a man Tommy</p><p>in the old days would nayhai him, and that is </p><p>from the Hindustani ne hoi, meaning is </p><p>not. Of all the other scores and scores of </p><p>words that Tommy has brought home from </p><p>Indian campaigns, perhaps the oftenest </p><p>used is “go arsty” for “go slow”—simply the</p><p>Hindustani word ahsti—softly, gently. </p><p>*T*AtTO'A </p><p>ifMfWWf1 </p><p>Arab </p><p>hy Boy &amp; Churchill </p><p>Author of “The Welding," “A Shift Into Reverse." </p><p>WTWHOME recruiting officer, anxious </p><p>to fill out a draft, wished Single- </p><p>■ ton Smith on to the Service. </p><p>■	• 4 He was healthy, cornless,' with</p><p>a mouth full of teeth, and may have looked </p><p>like good raw material, but as a “flat-foot” </p><p>he was a flat failure. He wouldn’t drill, he </p><p>wouldn’t work, he wouldn’t mix, and worst </p><p>of all he wouldn’t keep himself clean </p><p> “He’s a plain bum,” said “Slim” Higgins.</p><p>“One of the kind that knocks at back doors </p><p>and leaves a tomato-can on a fence-post </p><p>when he crosses a creek. About as much </p><p>chance to make a sailorman of him as to </p><p>beat the boatswain cussin’ when there’s a </p><p>foul anchor.” </p><p> Slim Higgins and Dick Reasoner sat on</p><p>their respective ditty-boxes, smoking black </p><p>cuddy pipes, and discussed this new puzzle </p><p>to the training-ship Dixie. It was Wednes- </p><p>day afternoon, rope-yarn Sunday, with drill </p><p>over, smoking lamp lighted, and nothing </p><p>to do until supper. </p><p> “Uhuh,” answered Slim’s companion,</p><p>“but you overlooked one point.” </p><p> “Shoot it, then,” said Slim. “It’ll be</p><p>the only thing that anybody noticed if it’s </p><p>anything good. This guy thinks that water </p><p>is the root of all evil.” </p><p> “Well,” said the other, shifting his pipe</p><p>over, “he enlisted, didn’t he? Had to vol- </p><p>unteer to do it. What made him join if </p><p>there wasn’t some good in him?” </p><p> “Needed a meal-ticket,” scoffed Higgins.</p><p>“Maybe so, but I have looked him up. </p><p>Here he is right here.” </p><p>Carefully Reasoner pulled from his blouse </p><p>a small, well-thumbed dictionary, and turn- </p><p>ing to a page, put his blunt brown finger </p><p>on a word. His shipmate watched him</p><p>without amusement. </p><p> “Listen-to-reason” Reasoner’s well-</p><p>known pet hobby was sacred and had a way </p><p>of working out most unexpectedly. </p><p> “Upheaval,” he read: “A lifting from</p><p>below; a lifting of strata by some internal </p><p>force.” </p><p> “What’s strata?” asked Slim. “Sounds</p><p>like a Japanese cuss-word.” </p><p> Reasoner turned the pages swiftly.</p><p> “I’ve looked it up, but forget it,” he</p><p>apologized. “Here she is: an artificial </p><p>layer.” </p><p> “You’ve hit it,” said Higgins, “it’s a</p><p>layer of dirt. But just to be a sport, I’ll </p><p>bet you a new, hand-sewed white hat that </p><p>“Hobo” Smith, if he is an ‘upheaval,’ gets </p><p>upheaved over the side before he makes a </p><p>sailorman. There goes the mess call. You </p><p>can work on these hopeless specimens all </p><p>you want to, but me, I’m findin’ it hard </p><p>enough to punch a little sense into the likely </p><p>ones.” </p><p> The Dixie had just cleared Hampton</p><p>Roads for a six-months’ training cruise. </p><p>Smith with ten others had come aboard at </p><p>the last moment without the usual stay at </p><p>the receiving-ship. He was labeled lands- </p><p>man for detail, which meant that his duty </p><p>was anything from cook’s striker to passing </p><p>coal. </p><p> The first morning at inspection the divi-</p><p>sion officer pounced on Smith. His uniform, </p><p>new, stiff and ill-fitting, was terribly dirty. </p><p>35 </p><p>36	Adventure</p><p>He had been peeling spuds for the cook, </p><p>and had not changed. </p><p> “You look like a hobo,” cried Lieutenant</p><p>Thorne. </p><p> For the good of the division it was well</p><p>to make an example in the beginning, and </p><p>Smith afforded a glaring opportunity. </p><p> “What do you mean coming to quarters</p><p>looking as if you had just crawled from </p><p>under a freight-train? Go to the barber and </p><p>get that shag of hair cut. Go to your bag </p><p>and get a clean uniform. Go get some </p><p>water and wash your face.” </p><p> “Yes, sir,” humbly answered Smith, mak-</p><p>ing a ragged salute, without embarrass- </p><p>ment, though all his shipmates were grin- </p><p>ning at the bawling out. “What then?” </p><p> “Go to the devil,” laughed the lieutenant</p><p>insolently. </p><p> Hobo shuffled off without a sign of re-</p><p>sentment. He had been named. He was </p><p>a yellow cur as well. His shoulders drooped. </p><p>His feet dragged. If he had owned a tail, </p><p>it would have been between his legs. </p><p> A week in the galley and the cook com-</p><p>plained. </p><p> “I can’t stand the smell of him around</p><p>the place,” he growled to the first lieutenant. </p><p>“I’ve threatened to take the butcher-knife </p><p>to him, put lye in his soup, scald him. It </p><p>all does no good. He gets dirtier and dirt- </p><p>ier. Even when we’re cooking onions, I </p><p>get him strong when he’s to windward.” </p><p> The first lieutenant took one look at</p><p>Smith and transferred him to the deck </p><p>force. </p><p> “See what you can do with him, Mr.</p><p>Thorne,” was his instruction, and that </p><p>officer put Hobo Smith up to Dick Rea- </p><p>soner. </p><p> On a training-ship there are many diffi-</p><p>cult problems. Men of varied tempera- </p><p>ment and training are to be fitted in, ad- </p><p>justed, molded into a compact working </p><p>unit of force, where before they had been </p><p>individuals, each with a more or less</p><p>pampered ego. Some must learn obedi- </p><p>ence, unselfishness, the curbing of self. </p><p>Others must throw off timidity, expand </p><p>into men, become assertive of their rights. </p><p> For this task the officers and men of a</p><p>training-ship are carefully picked. Slim </p><p>Higgins was a master at signals. Henry </p><p>Cowles knew knots, and splicing. Jimmy </p><p>Wade handled the boats, and so on down </p><p>the list, each petty officer and seaman a </p><p>specialist in his line. </p><p> Dick Reasoner was known on more ships</p><p>than the Dixie. With his appeal to the </p><p>dictionary he had helped out many a man </p><p>now serving in his proper place, happy and </p><p>contented, who had started on the quick </p><p>downward road which leads to the stone </p><p>frigate and a bobtail discharge. Hence the </p><p>men called him “Dictionary Dick,” but </p><p>had a profound respect for his advice, and </p><p>sought his help in trouble. </p><p> Reasoner’s peculiar talent ran to men.</p><p>He knew them, studied them, loved them. </p><p>On other ships where the saying was </p><p>“Tell your troubles to the marines,” on </p><p>the Dixie it was “Tell your troubles to Dic- </p><p>tionary Dick.” He was large, slow-mov- </p><p>ing, older-looking than his thirty-five years, </p><p>with quick sympathetic eyes and heavy </p><p>angular features. Not a good-looking man, </p><p>but strong-jawed, patient, cool. Just the </p><p>sort of man who makes a judge in civil life, </p><p>and a master-at-arms in the Navy. Rea- </p><p>soncr was an ex-apprentice and had served </p><p>since he was eighteen. He was the official </p><p>smoother-out of tangles, the last appeal in </p><p>difficult cases, one who led much and drove </p><p>little. </p><p> Lieutenant Thorne smiled a little as he</p><p>told the master-at-arms to take charge of </p><p>Hobo Smith. Reasoner smiled in return. </p><p> “Do what you want to with him,” said</p><p>the lieutenant. “I believe the captain </p><p>wouldn’t grumble if you shot him at sun- </p><p>rise, or pushed him overboard some dark </p><p>night. That would be about all I could </p><p>think of. Perhaps you may find a way to </p><p>deal with him out of the dictionary.” </p><p> The lieutenant smiled some more, but</p><p>Reasoner did not. </p><p> “Everything is in the book,” he said sim-</p><p>ply. “Maybe there’s a cure for Smith.” </p><p> THE crew wondered what course</p><p> Reasoner would take in an effort to</p><p> fi'y' make a change in Hobo, and did not</p><p>lave long to wait. At first came a short </p><p>interview. </p><p> “What’s your name?” he asked.</p><p> He spoke with the same drawl that his</p><p>height and his slow manner indicated, but </p><p>with a certain alertness in his eyes, which </p><p>those few who lied to him knew meant an </p><p>intent keen perception, before which pre- </p><p>tense always failed. </p><p> “Hobo Smith,” said the other, shame-</p><p>lessly. </p><p> “Between us from now on it will be your</p><p>Arab </p><p>37 </p><p>real name,” said Reasoner. “Your name </p><p>is Singleton Smith. It’s a good name. </p><p>Somebody gave it to you who had high hopes </p><p>of your being an honor to it. You gave it </p><p>when you swore to follow the rules of the </p><p>Navy. That’s all the lecture. I’m going </p><p>to make a valet out of you, Singleton. </p><p>You’re going to valet yourself. That’s one </p><p>thing the Service insists on. </p><p> “Every man here, that is fit to associate</p><p>with other men, scrubs his body and his </p><p>clothes. I’ve roped off a little space up </p><p>there in the manger. You will take your </p><p>bag, hammock, ditty-box and yourself there </p><p>and stay there. If anybody speaks to you, </p><p>I’ll put them on the report. Your business </p><p>is to watch the other men, and scrub your- </p><p>self and clothes. Any morning you fail to </p><p>do it, you fail to eat.” </p><p> “You put it to him strong,” said Slim</p><p>Higgins. “What’s the idea? If he had a </p><p>spark of manhood in him as big as the </p><p>point of a sail-needle, he’d a climbed your </p><p>frame.” </p><p> “Isolation,” said Reasoner. “Every-</p><p>thing else has been tried. If it brings about </p><p>‘reflection’ it may let him get the best of </p><p>this upheaval of strata from beneath.” </p><p> “Too deep for me,” sighed Higgins.</p><p>“Beanin’ him with a marline-spike is more </p><p>to my notion.” </p><p> The novelty of having a man confined</p><p>on the forecastle, to whom they were not to </p><p>speak nor communicate with in any way, </p><p>soon wore off the crew. Hobo Smith be- </p><p>came as much a part of the deck gear as </p><p>the bitts or chains. Men remembered not </p><p>to speak to him, and then formed the habit </p><p>and forgot to speak. </p><p> When the cook came with the food, he</p><p>whistled and then shoved the plate toward </p><p>Smith with his foot. Under Reasoner’s di- </p><p>rection he rigged up his own lines for scrub </p><p>and wash clothes, and still under Reason- </p><p>er’s directions he washed and scrubbed. </p><p>At the end of a week Ills outfit was fairly </p><p>clean. </p><p> Then Reasoner did not show up for two</p><p>mornings. Hobo scrubbed the first day </p><p>and shirked the next. On the third day at </p><p>Reasoner’s appearance Hobo had made no </p><p>start toward washing, while all around him </p><p>the men were bathing ancf preparing to </p><p>scrub their clothes. </p><p> Reasoner was not impatient.</p><p> “I hate to keep a man penned up like a</p><p>dog,” he said, “and so I let you have a </p><p>chance. You could have joined the divi- </p><p>sion, Singleton, but I guess a man takes a </p><p>long time to break a bad habit.” </p><p> Without being told, Hobo took his bucket</p><p>and went for water for his scrubbing. True </p><p>to his word, Reasoner had the cook take </p><p>only water to the prisoner that day. </p><p> Another week and the ship was in port,</p><p>and the men going ashore on liberty. The </p><p>whole forward divisions held Hobo Smith </p><p>in open contempt. They referred to him </p><p>as the “life-termer,” but knew that once a </p><p>home port was reached he would be dis- </p><p>charged as undesirable. None of this </p><p>seemed to reach Smith. In his pen for- </p><p>ward he was carelessly indifferent, and his </p><p>only real discomfort was the daily scrub- </p><p>bing under the eye of Reasoner. Then </p><p>Reasoner went ashore for a day, and </p><p>found that Smith had missed the scrubbing </p><p>again. </p><p> “The man seems to have no sense of</p><p>honor,” said Lieutenant Thorne to the first </p><p>lieutenant. “Reasoner seems to have </p><p>failed in his cure this time.” </p><p> “He is at least keeping him from infect-</p><p>ing the ship,” said the first lieutenant. </p><p>“Why not have a marine watch him when </p><p>Reasoner is away?” </p><p> At the next port when Reasoner went</p><p>ashore, Lieutenant Thorne asked for the </p><p>marine sentry, and Hobo Smith found him- </p><p>self under the eyes of another master. With </p><p>Reasoner there had grown up a little morn- </p><p>ing routine which never varied. It had </p><p>been “Good morning, Singleton,” and </p><p>from a sullen silence, Smith had begun to </p><p>say “Good morning.” Never had there </p><p>been, except on the first morning, any other </p><p>order to begin work. Smith had com- </p><p>menced as soon as Reasoner appeared.</p><p> “Get busy, you scum,” ordered the sen-</p><p>try. </p><p> Smith looked the marine over and did</p><p>not answer. </p><p> “Work or you don’t eat,” taunted the</p><p>sentry. </p><p> But Smith sat down on the deck with</p><p>his back to the other and refused to scrub. </p><p>That day he had only water. </p><p> Reasoner was pleased when he returned.</p><p> “It’s a hopeful sign,” he said to Slim</p><p>Higgins. “The word is ‘defiance’. It’s a </p><p>thirty-third cousin to self-respect. If a </p><p>man has it, he may have better qualities.” </p><p> “Let us hope so,” said Slim. “But billy-</p><p>goats are long on that defiance stuff, too.” </p><p>38 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Dick Reasoner knew that he could not</p><p>keep Smith confined in his little pen for an </p><p>indefinite time. He interfered in some </p><p>measure with the freedom of the already- </p><p>crowded forecastle, and unless he could </p><p>show results some other method of dealing </p><p>with the man would have to be tried. The </p><p>way came unexpectedly. </p><p> Ashore again, seeing the sights with his</p><p>friend Slim Higgins, a poor, half-starved </p><p>puppy, wandering drunkenly on its weak </p><p>legs across the pavement, was shoved off </p><p>into the gutter by a careless foot, which </p><p>had just missed stepping on it. The little </p><p>dog whined pleadingly, with its front paws </p><p>on the curb, as it tried vainly to drag itself </p><p>back. </p><p> Slim Higgins went on by, but Reasoner</p><p>stopped. </p><p> “Looks like he’s homeless,” he said, in-</p><p>dicating the dog, which redoubled its puny </p><p>efforts to climb to the sidewalk, as it saw </p><p>some one had noticed it. </p><p> “Come on,” said Slim, “I’d think you</p><p>had enough pets on your hands with that </p><p>hobo on the ship.” </p><p> But Reasoner had extended a big hand</p><p>and helped the puppy back to firmer foot- </p><p>ing. </p><p> “I’m going to take him along,” he an-</p><p>nounced. “He’ll get run over and killed, </p><p>anyway.” </p><p> Buying a newspaper he wrapped the</p><p>dirty little dog in it, carried him out to the </p><p>ship, fed and washed him, and took liim </p><p>for an airing near where Hobo Smith sat </p><p>and looked idly out to sea. Smith had </p><p>failed to scrub again, and was doing an- </p><p>other “water only” day. </p><p> “Hello, Singleton,” greeted Reasoner,</p><p>and sat down on a chest where he could </p><p>watch developments. </p><p> “Howdy,” answered Smith obediently,</p><p>his eyes following the wandering puppy. </p><p>“Whose dog?” he asked, snapping his fin- </p><p>gers to the playful little waif.</p><p> “I found him looking for a home,” said</p><p>Reasoner, “and so I brought him along. </p><p>The first lieutenant has given permission </p><p>to have him in the first division. I’ve </p><p>named him A-rab, which the book says is a </p><p>homeless outcast.” </p><p> “Airedale,” said Smith. “Oughter make</p><p>a fine dog.” </p><p> Smith was showing more interest than</p><p>at any time since he had been on board. </p><p>The little dog had climbed into his lap. </p><p>REASONER’S plans crystallized </p><p>instantly. </p><p> “You can keep him up here with</p><p>you,” he said. “You’ve made friends </p><p>mighty quick. Let him share your rations </p><p>until he gets bigger.” Reasoner got up as </p><p>if the matter was settled. “Singleton,” he </p><p>said, “after this week you go to regular </p><p>duty.” </p><p> Smith knew from the tone what he</p><p>meant. He was to have a chance to make </p><p>good, and the dog was the prize. Smith </p><p>loved dogs. He had a queer influence over </p><p>them. Back during the old days on the </p><p>road he walked fearlessly up to the most </p><p>savage ones and made friends. Something </p><p>deep in him that was almost dead came </p><p>feebly to life. He smiled at Reasoner, with </p><p>his hand still stroking the sleeping puppy. </p><p> “Thanks,” he said, “you’re a good old</p><p>scout.” </p><p> Smith took his place in the division</p><p>humbly. The first morning at inspection </p><p>Lieutenant Thorne had him step from ranks </p><p>and turn ’round. </p><p> “Get a better fit next time,” he said, for</p><p>Smith’s uniform was clean, and his shoes </p><p>shined, and there was no fault to find. </p><p> But Smith’s place was not an easy one.</p><p>He was behind on the drills, slow at his </p><p>work, looked down upon by his shipmates. </p><p>The only thing that he did do well was to </p><p>scrub clothes, and look after Arab, the Aire- </p><p>dale puppy, who had begun to put on the </p><p>shaggy coat of his breed. </p><p> “That pup’s got sense,” confided Slim</p><p>Higgins to Reasoner. “The little microbe </p><p>knows who’s a friend to his master, and </p><p>who is not. You let me go within a yard </p><p>of him and he backs off and growls, but he </p><p>lets you handle him most as easy as Smith.” </p><p> Pets are popular on a ship, and the men</p><p>soon found that to win the dog’s favor they </p><p>must speak civilly to his master, and Hobo </p><p>Smith made a few friends, while he stead- </p><p>ily improved in his work. But when he </p><p>drew up a ditty-box on a Wednesday after- </p><p>noon to a group playing cards, he was </p><p>never asked to take a hand. No one shared </p><p>their tobacco with him. If he ran out of </p><p>soap before the monthly small stores were </p><p>issued, he could only borrow from Rea- </p><p>soner. </p><p> In the groups that went ashore he trav-</p><p>eled alone, so far as human company was </p><p>concerned, but accompanied always by his </p><p>dog. As time went on and Arab grew </p><p>Arab </p><p>39 </p><p>rangy and long-legged, Smith kept with </p><p>him more and more, and began to seek less </p><p>and less to establish a place for himself </p><p>with the crew. </p><p> Reasoner had it out with him many</p><p>times. </p><p> “What you want to do is to get a trans-</p><p>fer to some other ship. This bunch here </p><p>sized you up wrong in the beginning, and </p><p>they can’t see that you’ve changed. Son, </p><p>there’s a word for you here in the book </p><p>that’ll tell the whole story. It’s ‘forfend.’ </p><p>It means to ward off. By getting away </p><p>you’ll escape all this criticism of what you </p><p>used to be.” </p><p> “Maybe you’re right,” said Smith. “I’d</p><p>like to get away from this bunch, but </p><p>there’s the dog. If I go, Arab will have to </p><p>stay on. He’s mine, but another ship </p><p>might make me give him up. I can stand </p><p>most anything for Arab.” And the dog </p><p>beat a tattoo on the deck with his tail in </p><p>answer. </p><p> One of Smith’s most persistent enemies</p><p>on the ship was Engle, a huge recruit coal- </p><p>passer. He systematically nagged and </p><p>goaded both Smith and his dog, smearing </p><p>up Smith’s paint work with his greasy </p><p>hands, and lacking at Arab whenever the </p><p>occasion offered. His hobby was shark </p><p>fishing, and most every hour off watch, he </p><p>was in the forecastle with a line off the side. </p><p>He had found out from the complaints of </p><p>the others just the part of the ship that it </p><p>was Smith’s duty to scrub, and usually </p><p>took his station there. </p><p> Smith and his dog were playing tag the</p><p>next morning when Engle came forward. </p><p>They drew aside to let him pass. The coal- </p><p>passer had been unable to secure bait at </p><p>the galley, and a brilliant scheme to settle </p><p>two scores came to him as he saw the dog. </p><p>Without a word he stepped quickly for- </p><p>ward and grasped the puppy by the neck. </p><p> “Let him be, you’ll hurt him,” resented</p><p>Hobo Smith angrily. </p><p> “Shut up, you bum,” retorted Engle.</p><p>“I’m going to make shark bait of this pup.”</p><p> The dog hung snarling and twisting from</p><p>his hand, trying vainly to get a hold with </p><p>his teeth. </p><p> “Let him go,” cried Smith, and made a</p><p>dive for the dog. </p><p> Engle, much larger and stronger than</p><p>Smith, let him come on until he was in </p><p>close, and then holding the dog out of </p><p>reach, sent his fist crashing into Hobo’s </p><p>face, who in his anxiety over the dog, had </p><p>not tried to guard himself. The blow </p><p>knocked him backward over a ditty-box, </p><p>and he did not get up. Not until then did </p><p>the dog whine, and redouble its efforts to </p><p>bite the hand that held it. </p><p> Holding the squirming puppy between his</p><p>knees, Engle lashed it firmly to the big </p><p>shark hook, and going out on the boat- </p><p>boom, threw his line overboard. Half a </p><p>dozen men yelled to the big coal-passer to </p><p>haul the dog back aboard. Arab had made </p><p>some friends, and after they were sure that </p><p>Engle was not joking, they made protest, </p><p>but Engle defied them. </p><p> “Dog’s no good, anyhow,” he 'said, “and</p><p>the first fellow that tries to do anything </p><p>I’ll knock him off the boom to help feed the </p><p>sharks.” </p><p> As the men hung back, Reasoner came</p><p>running forward. The little dog was swim- </p><p>ming valiantly with the heavy hook, but </p><p>looked about spent. Instead of shouting </p><p>to Engle, Reasoner climbed out on the </p><p>boom. </p><p> “Shame on you,” he cried, “haul that</p><p>pup in!” </p><p> Engle did not intend to back down in the</p><p>face of those watching, so he took the fish- </p><p>line in the hand that held to the boom’s </p><p>supporting stay, and faced Reasoner de- </p><p>fiantly. </p><p> While all eyes were centered on Reasoner</p><p>and Engle, no attention was paid to Hobo </p><p>Smith. He crawled dizzily to his feet, saw </p><p>what was going on, lurched to the rail and </p><p>leaped overboard to the rescue of his pet. </p><p> Engle was the larger of the two men on</p><p>the boom, and had the advantage of posi- </p><p>tion because he held to the stay, which </p><p>came down at an angle of forty-five degrees </p><p>from the ship’s side to the end of the boom. </p><p>He could reach it for support, while Rea- </p><p>soner could not, who had only the slack </p><p>life-line. As Reasoner advanced Engle saw </p><p>an opportunity, and untied the life-line </p><p>from the stay, hoping to throw his antago- </p><p>nist off by swaying it sidewise, but Reasoner </p><p>cut the line behind him, and threw it aside, </p><p>coming at Engle without support, balanc- </p><p>ing on the narrow spar. </p><p> He had lost the slowness which charac-</p><p>terized his usual manner. His loose body </p><p>was tense, catlike, and every movement </p><p>quick and sure. Foot by foot he advanced </p><p>on the coal-passer. Engle tied the fish-line </p><p>to the stay so that he could have both </p><p>40 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>hands, and shook the boom in a final effort </p><p>to throw Reasoner off. </p><p> “Haul in,” ordered Reasoner, who had</p><p>reached striking distance. </p><p> Engle’s answer was to take a firmer grip</p><p>of the stay and kick out with both feet. </p><p> Reasoner dodged backward, balancing</p><p>himself on the shaking boom, and acted on </p><p>the suggestion that Engle had given. Be- </p><p>fore the coal-passer could quite recover, </p><p>Reasoner had rushed, and instead of strik- </p><p>ing him and both men going overboard, he </p><p>leaped into the air and caught the stay well </p><p>over Engle’s head. Then hanging from his </p><p>hands he kicked the other man off the boom. </p><p>Not until then did the master-at-arms see </p><p>that Hobo Smith had reached the dog, cut </p><p>the fish-line with his knife, and with Arab </p><p>resting on his shoulder, had made the gang- </p><p>way, and was climbing out of the water. </p><p> The assembled ship’s company had seen</p><p>the whole affair, and from it they knew that </p><p>Hobo Smith would fight anybody, and dare </p><p>most anything to save his dog, and that </p><p>Dick Reasoner would back him up. Engle </p><p>swam to the gangway, climbed up, and went </p><p>below. He had a bump on his cheek the </p><p>size of an egg where one of Reasoner’s shoes </p><p>had landed. </p><p> From then on Hobo Smith had more as-</p><p>surance. The men treated him with more </p><p>respect. He had been licked of course, but </p><p>he had shown fight against a larger man. </p><p>THE next morning at the deck </p><p>court Engle was given five days </p><p>bread and water for punishment. </p><p>The first lieutenant had arrived on the </p><p>scene in time to see the wind-up, and a full </p><p>explanation had to be given by Reasoner. </p><p>This was the beginning of bad times for </p><p>Engle. A few weeks later he picked a quar- </p><p>rel with a fireman while on watch, struck </p><p>the man over the head with a shovel, and </p><p>was given a summary court-martial with </p><p>three months loss of pay, and thirty days’ </p><p>Confinement. </p><p> “That dog of yours is to blame,” whis-</p><p>pered Engle to Smith. “When I get out of</p><p>here, I’m going to poison him.” </p><p> And Smith, his newly-found manhood</p><p>sitting uncertainly on his soul, while he </p><p>fought the prejudice of the crew, and all </p><p>his heart wrapped up in the beloved Arab, </p><p>believed the threat. </p><p> The fireman that Engle had struck did</p><p>not do well in the hospital. He took a sud- </p><p>den change for the worse. Engle’s case be- </p><p>came more serious. His thirty days up, he </p><p>was still confined. If the man died, he </p><p>would be held for murder. Again he found </p><p>a chance and whispered to Smith. </p><p> “Help me to get away, or I’ll kill the</p><p>dog.” </p><p> Just how he intended to do it while con-</p><p>fined in the brig he did not explain, but </p><p>Smith was interested only in Arab’s safety. </p><p>He asked no questions. The big coal-passer </p><p>would find a way, and the dog, now almost </p><p>full grown, was growing more precious to </p><p>him each day. </p><p> The next day as Engle passed, he re-</p><p>peated his warning, and Smith asked— </p><p> “How?”</p><p> During the next few days Engle outlined</p><p>a plan. The two could only speak a few </p><p>words as the prisoner passed forward for </p><p>his morning exercise, but at the end of the </p><p>week Engle was gone. The master-at-arms </p><p>had locked him in, after giving him his sup- </p><p>per, and the marine sentry, coming on </p><p>watch at eight o’clock, had found the brig </p><p>empty. The ship was searched from stem </p><p>to stern, but the prisoner could not be </p><p>found, which was not surprising, since the </p><p>steam launch had made a regular trip at </p><p>seven. </p><p> The first lieutenant summoned Reasoner.</p><p> “This is a serious matter, Master-at-</p><p>arms. I have just had a report from the </p><p>hospital that Riley’s condition is critical, </p><p>and here we let this coal-passer get away. </p><p>There is rank carelessness somewhere, and </p><p>the man to blame can expect no mercy from </p><p>me.” </p><p> “Aye, aye, sir,” said Reasoner. “I was</p><p>the master-at-arms on watch. I am sure </p><p>that I locked Engle in safely.” </p><p> “And he was gone when the sentries were</p><p>changed at eight. He got away soon after </p><p>you were supposed to have locked him in, </p><p>some time between supper and eight bells. </p><p>I have no accusation to make as yet, Rea- </p><p>soner; you have been a splendid petty offi- </p><p>cer, and no doubt can explain everything </p><p>satisfactorily, but Engle could not get away </p><p>unless some one was careless, and he dis- </p><p>appeared on your watch.” </p><p> The prisoner’s disappearance made a</p><p>stir on the ship. The mystery of it appealed </p><p>to the men, and the fact that Dictionary </p><p>Dick was apt to get into trouble over it in- </p><p>terested all his friends. </p><p> “Didn’t you tell me that you lost the key</p><p>m </p><p>Arab </p><p>4i </p><p>to the brig the other day?” asked Slim Hig- </p><p>gins. </p><p> “I found it in my other trousers,” said</p><p>Reasoner. </p><p> “Well, what’s your guess?” asked Slim.</p><p>“The talk that’s driftin’ forward from the </p><p>ward-room is that the first luff is goin’ to </p><p>disrate you.” </p><p> Reasoner looked at his friend steadily for</p><p>a moment. </p><p> “Slim,” he said, “I know that I turned</p><p>the key on that door and then shook it just </p><p>as I have been doing for a good many years. </p><p>I don’t know how Engle got away, but I’ve </p><p>dug out a good word from the book, and I </p><p>intend to sit quiet a little before I do any- </p><p>thing.” </p><p> “What’s the word. If I was in your fix</p><p>I’d be pouncin’ on every theory I could </p><p>think of like a gull on a table scrap.” </p><p> “Appendix, which means something</p><p>added.” </p><p> “I get you,” said Slim, who had a per-</p><p>sonal knowledge of the word, “something </p><p>more to come out.” </p><p> Hobo Smith came to Reasoner that eve-</p><p>ning. Arab trotted happily at his heels, </p><p>and greeted Reasoner as a friend and com- </p><p>rade of his master. Smith lacked the dog’s </p><p>freedom of manner. He came with hesita- </p><p>tion, more timid than he had been for </p><p>weeks. He had something on his mind </p><p>which his new outlook on life would not </p><p>permit him to sit quiet under, and so in </p><p>his own way he came to make amends. </p><p> “They are talking about disrating you</p><p>because Engle got away,” he said. </p><p> “Yes,” said Reasoner, stroking the dog’s</p><p>head. </p><p> “You’ve been a good friend to Arab and</p><p>me,” said Smith, the words coming faster </p><p>as he went along. “Engle wouldn’t have </p><p>been in trouble if you hadn’t saved Arab. </p><p>He wouldn’t have been in the brig, nor had</p><p>the scrap with the fireman.” </p><p> “What are you driving at?” interrupted</p><p>Reasoner. </p><p> “It’s our fault that trouble has come to</p><p>you,” said Smith. “I wonder if the cap- </p><p>tain would let me have Arab in the brig if </p><p>I said I let Engle out? That would clear </p><p>you, and I wouldn’t mind it so much with </p><p>Arab.” </p><p> “No,” said Reasoner, “you couldn’t keep</p><p>the dog in the brig, but what made you </p><p>offer to do this thing for me?” </p><p> Smith went on:</p><p> “I wouldn’t have Arab if it wasn’t for</p><p>you. I don’t amount to much, anyway. I </p><p>thought maybe you would let me do this to </p><p>pay back a little.” </p><p> He was telling the things he longed to</p><p>do, yet did not have the courage to carry </p><p>out, for he knew that Dictionary Dick </p><p>would not let him make the sacrifice. </p><p>Reasoner was touched. </p><p> “Get out of here,” he said. “I thank</p><p>you and Arab, but it can’t be done. The </p><p>real explanation will show up.” </p><p> But Smith was unhappy. A conscience</p><p>which he had forgotten he owned nagged </p><p>him. The next day he went ashore and </p><p>did not return with the liberty party. </p><p> “Now Smith’s gone,” said the first lieu-</p><p>tenant. “I tell you, Reasoner, you are too </p><p>easy on these fellows. It takes more than </p><p>being good to them to make sailormen. I </p><p>want to confer with the captain before I </p><p>act, but unless you can furnish some good </p><p>explanation for Engle’s walking out of the </p><p>brig, we’ll probably disrate you.” </p><p>HOBO SMITH had gone ashore </p><p>without a plan. Always a child of </p><p>chance, he thought that Engle might </p><p>providentially show up. Just what he </p><p>would do even then was not quite clear in </p><p>his mind. He was undergoing the greatest </p><p>trial of his life. Taught to five for himself </p><p>alone, and to consider nothing worth while </p><p>that concerned others, his experience on </p><p>board the Dixie had almost made him over, </p><p>but he was still in the transitory stage, and</p><p>had not emerged fully into his new life. </p><p>His big purpose in coming ashore was to </p><p>fight out this battle with liimself. </p><p> As he walked along, Arab trotting so-</p><p>berly at his heels, as if he understood the </p><p>struggle his master was having, Smith fi- </p><p>nally made a decision. Reasoner had been </p><p>too good to him. He would go back and </p><p>square things up and take the punishment. </p><p>At least Arab had been saved from Engle, </p><p>and he knew that Reasoner would lake </p><p>good care of the dog until he was free again. </p><p> The resolution made Smith start briskly</p><p>for the landing. He had just time to make </p><p>the boat and return on time. Arab sensing </p><p>the change in his master’s spirits, ran ahead </p><p>of him gayly. Suddenly he stopped, the </p><p>bristles on his spine rose, and his jaws </p><p>turned back from his rows of well-formed </p><p>teeth. He faced across the sidewalk, and </p><p>there walking calmly down the other side </p><p>42 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>in civilian clothes was Engle. Smith would </p><p>have passed him without recognition, but </p><p>the dog had picked out the hate smell and </p><p>knew his enemy in any garb. </p><p> “Keep back,” Smith warned the dog,</p><p>and then they turned to follow Engle. </p><p> The big coal-passer saw them and turned</p><p>into a narrow alley before they had followed </p><p>a block. Smith now had a plan. He would </p><p>follow Engle until he could find a police- </p><p>man and then have him arrested. He fully </p><p>expected the man to run from him. Back </p><p>in the old days when he dodged and evaded, </p><p>that would have been his own course. </p><p> But Engle, seeing no help in sight, turned</p><p>back to meet him, and Smith had a moment </p><p>of panic, tempted to take to his heels. His </p><p>dog saved him. Arab was the wrong breed </p><p>to run from danger. He advanced, giving </p><p>signs of a battle, and Smith followed. </p><p> “What do you want?” asked Engle.</p><p>“Call that dog off, and beat it about your </p><p>business or I’ll kick both your ribs in.” </p><p> “You’re going back to the ship with us,”</p><p>said Smith, trying to put a little of the brave </p><p>menace of Arab’s growls into his voice. </p><p> “Well of all the nerve!” laughed Engle.</p><p>“Scat, the two of you, before my mind </p><p>changes!” </p><p> But Arab had charged. Engle’s tone</p><p>and the wave of his hand had been challenge </p><p>enough. Straight for the throat he leaped, </p><p>a tawny streak of fury. Engle struck </p><p>out with both hands, dodging sideways, </p><p>and the dog missed. One of the coal- </p><p>passer’s big fists struck him in the side as </p><p>he passed in the air, and hurled him to the </p><p>pavement. The shock almost knocked the </p><p>breath out of him, and for a few moments he </p><p>lay partly stunned. Engle ran toward </p><p>him to finish what he had started, with a </p><p>kick from one of his heavy shoes, but an- </p><p>other and weightier antagonist had taken </p><p>a hand. </p><p> Hobo Smith had jumped to the rescue of</p><p>his dog, and was on Engle’s back raining </p><p>bloWs on his head. Engle forgot the dog</p><p>for the time, and lunging backward tried </p><p>to break the smaller man’s hold by strik- </p><p>ing his body against the wall. Smith </p><p>grunted, but held on, remembering that </p><p>when his dog had hit the pavement he had </p><p>not even whimpered. </p><p> “I’ll get you,” panted Engle. “I’ll kill</p><p>the two of you.” </p><p> But with the threat there came to Hobo</p><p>Smith that perfect thing which Reasoner </p><p>had first given him a glimpse of, and in </p><p>which Arab had further instructed him, </p><p>and which all day and during the weeks </p><p>past he had been striving for. He was </p><p>made over. Something warm and new </p><p>flooded his soul, driving out all cowardice, </p><p>timidity, fear. He was a man. A resolute </p><p>purpose guided his blows. He began to </p><p>think in the cool terms of a grim determina- </p><p>tion. </p><p> One of Engle’s straining hands let go in</p><p>its backward search for Smith’s throat. </p><p>Arab was up and charging again. This </p><p>time the dog came on a little more warily. </p><p>As Engle kicked, he circled and dodged, </p><p>watching for a chance. His adversary was </p><p>handicapped with Smith on his back. Then </p><p>as savagely as a springing wolf, he had </p><p>found an opening, leaped and drawn blood, </p><p>and was away before Engle could avenge. </p><p> Smith had squirmed away from the</p><p>other’s grip, when Arab made his attack, </p><p>and before Engle could recover had struck </p><p>him two blows in the face. Engle staggered. </p><p>The ripping jaws of the dog had torn a gash </p><p>down his right arm, and one of Smith’s </p><p>unscientific blows had reached the point of </p><p>his jaw. Half-blinded, he could not dodge </p><p>when the dog drove in again, and this time </p><p>felt the hungry jaws at his throat. </p><p> “Take him off!” Engle bellowed, as he</p><p>stumbled backward to the pavement under </p><p>the weight of a third blow from Smith, and </p><p>the impact of the dog. </p><p> “Lie still then,” ordered Smith, and pried</p><p>Arab away. </p><p> Engle’s collar and tie had saved his</p><p>throat from serious damage. A policeman </p><p>came running down the alley. At its upper </p><p>end a crowd had collected to see what was</p><p>going on. </p><p> “An escaped prisoner in civilian clothes,”</p><p>explained Smith. “I tried to arrest him, </p><p>and he resisted.” </p><p> He spoke with confidence, sure of him-</p><p>self. Arab stood between his knees, watch- </p><p>ing the fallen Engle, ready to do battle on </p><p>an instant, if his master’s knees relaxed </p><p>their light pressure. </p><p> “All right,” said the officer. “I’ll go on</p><p>out to the ship with you to make sure.” </p><p> “Thanks,” said Hobo Smith, and turned</p><p>to Engle. “Get up,” he commanded, and </p><p>the bigger man obeyed. </p><p> Hobo Smith and Arab with the hand-</p><p>cuffed Engle and the policeman missed </p><p>only one boat. When they reported on </p><p>Arab </p><p>43 </p><p>board the officer of the deck called the first </p><p>lieutenant. Smith stood aside, with his </p><p>dog resting on the deck by him, while the </p><p>policeman told the story of Engle’s cap- </p><p>ture, and the coal-passer was sent forward </p><p>under a marine guard to have his wounds </p><p>dressed before going into the brig. Then </p><p>the policeman was dismissed, and the first </p><p>lieutenant turned to Smith. </p><p> “Well, Smith,” he said, “you’ve made</p><p>good after all. You and that stray pup of </p><p>yours. What can I do for you?” </p><p> Smith hesitated. Making a decision was</p><p>one thing, living up to it another. </p><p> “Step over here where we’ll be alone,”</p><p>suggested the officer, making a wrong guess </p><p>at his reluctance. </p><p> “I want to give myself up,” said Smith</p><p>quickly. “I let Engle out. I stole Reason- </p><p>er’s key and made a duplicate. Engle </p><p>slipped out of the brig when the marine </p><p>was on the other end of the beat. I had </p><p>Arab down there and the marine stopped </p><p>a moment to pat him.” </p><p> “What for?” demanded the amazed first</p><p>lieutenant. “What did you do that for? </p><p>Didn’t Engle try to make fish-bait out of </p><p>your dog?” </p><p> And then Smith told the whole miser-</p><p>able story of Engle’s threat, his love for </p><p>the dog, and his fear that Engle would harm </p><p>Arab. Then of Reasoner’s trouble over </p><p>the escaped prisoner, his decision while </p><p>ashore to tell the truth to save his friend, </p><p>and finally a request that Reasoner have </p><p>the dog while he was being punished. </p><p> The first lieutenant was a man of wide</p><p>experience in the handling of men, but </p><p>this problem puzzled him. While he </p><p>thought, he asked questions. Smith must </p><p>be punished, of course, but how, so that </p><p>the man’s new-found spirit would be </p><p>strengthened and not broken? </p><p> “So you are doing this to save Reasoner,</p><p>who has been good to you? The captain </p><p>and I had decided to disrate him.” </p><p> “Yes sir,” answered Smith.</p><p> “What about Engle? This fireman that</p><p>he struck is much better. I may have to </p><p>restore him to duty if he behaves himself, </p><p>after he has had a chance to think it over </p><p>for a few months.” </p><p> “Arab and me can handle him,” said</p><p>Smith, with a glance at the dog, which </p><p>thumped his tail against the deck when his </p><p>name was called. </p><p> “Then,” said the first lieutenant, “be-</p><p>cause you wished to get Reasoner out of </p><p>trouble and because you are no longer </p><p>afraid of Engle, you are making this con- </p><p>fession. Is there another reason?” </p><p> “Yes sir,” said Smith. “I want to start</p><p>all over clean, and I couldn’t bear to have </p><p>this thing haunting me. Besides,” he fin- </p><p>ished, awkwardly, “Arab’s a gentleman, </p><p>and he’s got sense. He might find it out </p><p>on me.” </p><p> The first lieutenant made up his mind.</p><p>“Go forward,” he said, “and tell Rea- </p><p>soner to put you and Arab in the brig for </p><p>three days’ solitary confinement. You are </p><p>to have bread and water, and the dog a </p><p>full ration.” </p><p> “Thank you, sir,” said Smith and,</p><p>“Salute,” he ordered Arab. </p><p> The dog promptly sat up and raised a</p><p>forepaw to his nose. Then the two went </p><p>forward briskly. This was the lightest </p><p>punishment that could be given. </p><p>I I “DOGMA,” explained Reasoner to </p><p>Slim Higgins later, “is an estab- </p><p>lished principal or doctrine. In any </p><p>man’s case, the doctrine is to keep on look- </p><p>ing until you find a path to the good in </p><p>him.” </p><p> “I like ‘dogged’ just as well,” said Slim</p><p>who was looking over Dictionary Dick’s </p><p>shoulder. “It’s a couple of lines above </p><p>and means ‘stubborn.’ ” </p><p> But Reasoner had shut the book quickly.</p><p>Sometimes Slim’s levity got on his nerves. </p><p>Th&lt;? Better Mixer </p><p>/&gt;y£us£effA.3oggs </p><p>P&lt;Aiio~. </p><p>VA&lt;.fi*T/"r— </p><p>Author of “Rule ‘G’," “A Regular Rounder" etc. </p><p>m </p><p>|URFORD, superintendent of the </p><p>Western Division on the D. &amp; P. </p><p>Railroad, had before him a dis- </p><p>turbing letter. It was not an </p><p>unexpected letter; Burford knew that sooner </p><p>or later it was bound to come, because </p><p>there were not many things that escaped </p><p>General Manager Yorke’s eyes. Neverthe- </p><p>less, it was disturbing. </p><p> “I note,” the general manager had writ-</p><p>ten, “that during the past three months we </p><p>have moved but two trains of stock from </p><p>Billups. During the corresponding three </p><p>months of last year we moved from Billups </p><p>a total of twenty-five trains, or an average </p><p>of about two trains weekly. The falling </p><p>off is most serious. </p><p> “My conclusion is that the stock must be</p><p>leaving Billups via the C. &amp; M. R. I </p><p>suggest that you personally go into the </p><p>matter and see what can be done to recover </p><p>this lost business for our line.” </p><p> Burford knew just what Yorke actually</p><p>meant when he said “I suggest;” it was sim- </p><p>ply the general manager’s polite way of </p><p>saying “I command.” And Yorke, Bur- </p><p>ford was aware, expected him to make good. </p><p> The superintendent leaned back in his</p><p>chair in a quandary. The loss of the stock </p><p>business out of Billups was a thing that had </p><p>been disturbing him not a little. Within </p><p>the last twelve months he had had no less </p><p>than five different agents there with a view </p><p>of reclaiming the cattle shipments that had </p><p>become diverted to the C. &amp; M. R. But </p><p>all to no purpose. Michie, the agent there </p><p>now, he knew would never accomplish </p><p>anything; Michie was too mild. But where </p><p>to find another man, Burford didn’t know. </p><p>Yet - that, obviously, was what he must do. </p><p> Burford’s mind ran over his fist of agents.</p><p>One after another he mentally rejected— </p><p>some because not available, due to being </p><p>tied up at important posts, others because </p><p>of lack of ability or because of some pecu- </p><p>liarity of temperament. He traveled down </p><p>the fine until he came to Star City station; </p><p>he considered Joseph Reilly, agent there. </p><p> “Too young,” decided the superintendent</p><p>after a little cogitation. </p><p> He went on down the list.</p><p> And yet, after he had gone dejectedly</p><p>over all his men and had about reached the </p><p>conclusion that among them there was not </p><p>the one whom he should have, his thoughts </p><p>went back to the too-young agent at Star </p><p>City. </p><p> “Deuce take it, he’s the best available</p><p>man of the lot!” growled Burford finally, </p><p>sitting up. “The thing is this: I’ve got to </p><p>get somebody at Billups in Michie’s place. </p><p>Reilly looks to me like the best bet. What’s </p><p>the answer? The answer is, send Reilly!” </p><p> He looked at his watch, then reached for</p><p>his hat. </p><p>H </p><p>YOUR ordinary agent seldom is </p><p>greatly pleased to see his superin- </p><p>tendent coming. It usually means </p><p>trouble for somebody—and of course this </p><p>somebody invariably is the agent. But in </p><p>Joseph Reilly’s young life a superintendent </p><p>more or less was neither here nor there. </p><p>44 </p><p>The Better Mixer </p><p>45 </p><p>Young Joe greeted Superintendent Burford </p><p>easily and with no undue fluttering within </p><p>his breast when that official descended </p><p>from the early afternoon train at Star City. </p><p>“How are things?” asked Burford. </p><p>“Everything is tip-top,” answered Joe; </p><p>“business booming and all that. I oughtn’t </p><p>to kick.” He smiled a bit. “But that’s the </p><p>trouble. When everything is going good I </p><p>get restless.” </p><p> “Come in the office,” said Burford.</p><p>“Perhaps I can help you some.” </p><p> They entered the station and within the</p><p>office the superintendent took the agent’s </p><p>chair. Joe found himself another chair and </p><p>placed it near Burford. </p><p> “WTould you like to move?” began the</p><p>superintendent abruptly as soon as they </p><p>were seated. </p><p> “Moving is one of the best things I do,”</p><p>said Joe. He nodded. “Yes, sure. When </p><p>and where?” </p><p> If the superintendent expected a little</p><p>more obsequiousness, he never betrayed </p><p>the fact. Rather, he seemed to find some- </p><p>thing to relish in the easy assurance of his </p><p>agent. Burford’s eyes took on a faint </p><p>sparkle. </p><p> “Tomorrow,” he answered. “And to</p><p>Billups.” </p><p> “I’ll pack my tooth-brush and other</p><p>shirt tonight,” smiled Joe. “I’ve never </p><p>been to Billups, but I hear it’s a real live </p><p>town.” </p><p> “It’s live enough,” assured Burford.</p><p>“And we need a real live man there. Do </p><p>you think you might qualify?” </p><p> Joe smiled more widely.</p><p> “I’m much too modest-”</p><p> “Hang your modesty!” laughed Burford.</p><p>“You’re no dead one—and I know that!” </p><p>“All right, have it your own way; I’m the </p><p>live man for the live town. And then </p><p>what?”</p><p> “And then as follows.” The superin-</p><p>tendent’s face became more serious. “In </p><p>the first place,” he began, “we’ve lost a lot </p><p>of business out of Billups. A year ago we </p><p>were handling two stock trains a week out </p><p>of there, bound for South Omaha. But </p><p>just now we’re lucky if we get one in a </p><p>month. The C. &amp; M. R. also goes through </p><p>Billups, you know—and they’ve taken </p><p>practically all the cattle business away </p><p>from us. It’s to get back to our old footing </p><p>that we’re aiming at. </p><p> “Our trouble started over a claim that</p><p>a stockman named Mohr had entered </p><p>against us. Our claim department re- </p><p>fused to settle for the amount he declared </p><p>he should have. He got sore, spread his </p><p>grievance among his fellow-cattlemen, gave </p><p>us a bad name, and they all flocked over to </p><p>the C. &amp; M. R. And there they’ve stuck. </p><p> “Our service is better than the C. &amp; M.</p><p>R’s.—always has been. And it has been </p><p>pretty well established, since, that Mohr, </p><p>the man who put in the trouble-making </p><p>claim, was trying to hold us up. But nei- </p><p>ther our better service nor the establishing </p><p>of Mohr’s unjust demands has seemed to </p><p>help us. The shippers continue to stick </p><p>with our competitor, the C. &amp; M. R.” </p><p>“Why?” asked Joe. </p><p> He had been paying strict attention to</p><p>Burford’s words. </p><p> “That’s the whole thing,” said Burford,</p><p>“the answer to that why. It’s this: the </p><p>C.	&amp; M. R. has an agent up there named</p><p>McPike. Mr. McPike is the villain. He </p><p>holds ’em—the shippers, I mean.” </p><p> “How?” asked Joe.</p><p> “By personality, as near as I can find</p><p>out,” replied Burford. “He’s one great </p><p>little old mixer, Mr. McPike; and you </p><p>know how the average cattleman likes a </p><p>good mixer. He surely does hold the boys </p><p>down to his knitting.” </p><p> “I foresee,” said Joe enthusiastically,</p><p>“that an interesting time will be had by one </p><p>and all. I’m just dying to meet friend </p><p>McPike. He appeals to me.”</p><p> “He’s no fool, as you can guess,” said</p><p>Burford. “You’ll find you’ve got a sure </p><p>enough job on your hands, trying to get </p><p>some of those boys to come back to the </p><p>D.	&amp; P. I’ll confess I don’t know how</p><p>you’ll do it. I’ll not give you any instruc- </p><p>tions. You just go about it in your own </p><p>way.” </p><p> “Thanks,” said Joe. “If there’s one</p><p>tiling I’ve a fondness for it’s orders like ‘Go </p><p>about it in your own way.’ ” </p><p> “Another thing,” said Burford. “In be-</p><p>ing a good mixer this man McPike often </p><p>badly bends the rules. What I mean is, </p><p>he may sometimes take a drink, or indulge </p><p>in cards or be away from his depot without </p><p>permission. The C. &amp; M. R. I know is </p><p>aware of this: but they only wink at it.” </p><p>Burford glanced shrewdly at Reilly. “We </p><p>may have to do a little winking ourselves.” </p><p>Joe Reilly never batted an eye-lid. He </p><p>returned Burford’s gaze steadily. </p><p>46 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Exactly,” was all he said.</p><p> “Understand,” said the superintendent</p><p>quickly, “I’m trusting to your discretion.” </p><p>“I’m no saint,” assured Joe, “but I </p><p>know where to stop.” </p><p> He was chuckling, inwardly, in apprecia-</p><p>tion of Burford’s predicament. The super- </p><p>intendent did not want to seem to encourage </p><p>him to break any of the rules, and yet, if it </p><p>became necessary, neither did he want Joe </p><p>to be too prudish. </p><p> “You can trust me in that,” added Joe.</p><p>“I believe I understand just what you have </p><p>in mind.” </p><p> “I’m glad of that,” said Burford with</p><p>relief. “If there were to be any actual </p><p>wrong, I wouldn’t want you to do it. I’m </p><p>a little reluctant, anyhow. But we’ve </p><p>been sending agent after agent up there to </p><p>Billups and not one has been able to do any </p><p>good. So I’m getting desperate. If we </p><p>can once get our old business back I know </p><p>we can hold it. Your job will be to get it </p><p>started back. We’ll do the rest.” </p><p> He paused and looked earnestly at Reilly.</p><p>“I’m counting on you to be the better </p><p>mixer,” he said. “Is it a go?” </p><p> “It’s a go!” said Joseph.</p><p>Ill </p><p>BILLUPS lies in the narrow, south </p><p>end of a mighty V-shaped valley. </p><p>To the north and northwest stretch </p><p>the broadening ranges whence come the </p><p>cattlemen with their droves, seeking the </p><p>outlet to the markets. This outlet is </p><p>Billups, with its two rival railroads—the </p><p>D.	&amp; P. and the C. &amp; M. R. The D. &amp; P.</p><p>skirts the eastern end of Jhe town, the </p><p>C.	&amp; M. R. the western edge.</p><p> Ex-agent Michie and young Joseph</p><p>Reilly—the latter newly installed agent for </p><p>the D. &amp;. P.—stepped out on to the station </p><p>platform on a Friday, just before noon. </p><p>Michie was leaving; his train awaited down</p><p>at the water-tank while the engine’s tank </p><p>was filling. The ex-agent spoke guardedly </p><p>in Joseph’s ear. </p><p> “Watch that contwisted clerk of yours,”</p><p>warned Michie. “It’s my opinion that he’s </p><p>a bad one.” </p><p> “Why so?” asked Joseph.</p><p> “I believe he tells things to McPike. In</p><p>fact, I’m pretty near sure of it; I’ve seen </p><p>him talking to McPike when he thought I </p><p>wasn’t near.” </p><p> “Anything else will be appreciated,”</p><p>urged Joe. </p><p> “It’s this way. Every time I would get</p><p>one of these stubborn cowmen around here </p><p>persuaded to try our line, it seems McPike </p><p>would find it out, flag the cowman and get </p><p>him to cancel the order for cars and then </p><p>ship over the C. &amp; M. R. I believe the </p><p>clerk kept his eye on all my car orders and </p><p>would tip McPike off as to what was going </p><p>on. Doubtless McPike handed him some- </p><p>thing for the information.” </p><p> “Emmhl Sounds interesting,” said</p><p>Reilly. </p><p> The train pulled away from the water-</p><p>plug and came up to the platform. Michie </p><p>started towards his coach. </p><p> “Good-by!” said Joe. “I’ll keep in mind</p><p>what you’ve told me.” </p><p> “Good luck!” called Michie and climbed</p><p>aboard. </p><p> Consequently, that afternoon Reilly had</p><p>a conference with his office force, one Jack </p><p>Dowdall; the office force was operator, </p><p>clerk and all-’round handy man. </p><p> “You’ve been here with the D. &amp; P. how</p><p>long, Jacky?” asked Joe. </p><p> “Oh, about a year,” stated the clerk.</p><p> “Know all the folks about town?”</p><p> “Most of ’em. I been in this burg close</p><p>to two years.” </p><p> “What did you do before starting to</p><p>work with the D. &amp; P.?”</p><p> “Worked around. Was with the C. &amp;</p><p>M. R. for a while.” </p><p> “Working for McPike?”</p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “Why did you quit?”</p><p> “Not enough money.”</p><p> The youthful Dowdall yawned, rolled a</p><p>cigaret and lit it. Reilly, unobserved, </p><p>eyed the clerk sharply. From the first the </p><p>new agent had not been greatly impressed </p><p>with his office force. Dowdall was a fair </p><p>telegrapher—and that about let him out. </p><p>Now, the revelation of the force’s former </p><p>connection with McPike on the C. &amp; M. R. </p><p>gave rise to a sudden suspicion—particular- </p><p>ly in the light of what Michie had hinted at. </p><p>Joe decided to investigate further. </p><p>“What’s been the matter with these </p><p>other agents who’ve been up here lately?” </p><p>inquired Joe casually. “Why couldn’t </p><p>they haul in some business for the D. &amp; P.?” </p><p>Dowdall smiled patronizingly. </p><p> “Poor fish, all of ’em.”</p><p> “How do you mean, poor fish?”</p><p>The Better Mixer </p><p>47 </p><p> “No brains, no nerve.” The clerk gave</p><p>a little laugh, as if the thoughts of the </p><p>deficiencies of the numerous ex-agents in </p><p>some way was not unpleasant. “This </p><p>McPike is a regular hum-dinger. He’d </p><p>just tell them boys to head in; and wherever </p><p>he said, that’s where they headed ini” </p><p> “Had ’em buffaloed, eh?”</p><p> The clerk laughed aloud.</p><p> “Say, he guessed every move them poor</p><p>fish planned to make and he headed ’em off, </p><p>every time!” </p><p> “Well, what do you think about me?</p><p>Any use to try and buck him?” </p><p> Jacky smiled again. It was a gentle</p><p>smile, but the gentleness of it was almost </p><p>lost in the patronizing superiority of it; </p><p>something pitying was in it, too. </p><p> “I’ll tell you,” condescended the clerk.</p><p>“No; not a bit of use. You haven’t got </p><p>a chance.” </p><p> “You’re wrong, Jacky!” Joe’s voice</p><p>abruptly became sharp and short. “Wrong, </p><p>I say. Get your hat and coat!” </p><p> “What?” asked Dowdall, apparently</p><p>mildly surprised. </p><p> “Get your hat and coat!” ordered Joe.</p><p>“Two articles, there on a nail behind the </p><p>door.” </p><p> The clerk did as ordered. The curtness</p><p>of the new agent’s words appeared to sink </p><p>into his brain; he looked uneasy as Reilly </p><p>opened the office door. </p><p> “Get out!” said Joe shortly. “You’re</p><p>through!” </p><p> “I’m through!” cried the clerk. “What</p><p>do you mean?” </p><p> “Exactly what I said. I’ll not need you</p><p>any longer.” </p><p>“Why — why!” stuttered Dowdall. </p><p>“What’s the matter? What have I done?”</p><p>“Enough,” answered Joe calmly. “Go </p><p>and tell McPike you want your old job </p><p>back.” </p><p> Some understanding of what was in</p><p>Reilly’s mind evidently came to the clerk </p><p>at that. </p><p> “You got me wrong,” he said sullenly.</p><p>“I’m not siding in with him.” </p><p> “Maybe, Jacky—maybe,” said Joe.</p><p>“But I’m figuring the other way.” He </p><p>smiled amiably at the crestfallen Dowdall. </p><p>“Sorry, old boy. But when you’re working </p><p>for a man you want to work for him—and </p><p>not for some one else.” </p><p> A flush came into Dowdall’s face, dis-</p><p>closing that the shot had touched. Also, </p><p>a little gleam of new-found respect for </p><p>Reilly’s keenness came into his eyes, a </p><p>little gleam which he tried to hide. </p><p> “Aw, forget it!” he growled, and flung</p><p>out of the depot. </p><p> From his office window Joe watched</p><p>Dowdall stride away. Perhaps he’d been </p><p>hasty; but he thought not. He sat down </p><p>and sent a message to Burford: </p><p>Supt. Burford: </p><p> My clerk has left. Please send another.</p><p>J. Reilly. </p><p> By the time he had gotten the message</p><p>off, some fifteen minutes had passed since </p><p>the time of Dowdall’s departure. Joe con- </p><p>sidered what to do next. He had no </p><p>definite plan of campaign mapped out </p><p>and for a few moments he sat in a silent </p><p>study trying to think of some place to </p><p>start or some method to follow. It must </p><p>be a vigorous method, he decided. And </p><p>then a Tvhimsical idea came to him. </p><p> “I believe I’ll go over and see McPike!”</p><p>he suddenly exclaimed. </p><p> The more he thought of it the better</p><p>the whimsy pleased him. He had no </p><p>trains coming for at least an hour or so; </p><p>therefore he could lock up the depot for a </p><p>little time.</p><p> “By Jing, yes!” he ejaculated, springing</p><p>to his feet. “There’s nothing like getting </p><p>acquainted with a man, especially if you’re </p><p>looking for a chance to kick him on the </p><p>shins!” </p><p>IV </p><p>BEING what is known as a weak </p><p>vessel, Jack Dowdall’s actions were </p><p>often governed by, and his mind </p><p>was susceptible to, the suggestion of some </p><p>stronger will. Hence it perhaps was not </p><p>strange that after leaving the D. &amp; P. </p><p>depot he decided to go and see McPike— </p><p>as Reilly had suggested. </p><p> Dowdall proceeded quickly across town</p><p>to the station of the C. &amp; M. R. Agent </p><p>McPike sat alone in his office when Dowdall </p><p>arrived. </p><p> “Hello, Jack!” greeted McPike. Then,</p><p>perceiving the sullen expression on Dow- </p><p>dall's face. “What’s bothering you?” </p><p> “Plenty!” replied Jack. He glared into</p><p>the shrewd face of the C. &amp; M. R. agent. </p><p>“The D. &amp; P. has got another new agent; </p><p>and the first thing the blasted fool did was </p><p>to tie the can on me!” </p><p>48 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Agent McPike settled comfortably back</p><p>in his chair, the chair groaning in protest </p><p>as he did so. The C. &amp; M. R. agent was </p><p>a big man, tall and thick. There were fine </p><p>wrinldes around his eyes, as there are apt </p><p>to be around the eyes of men who laugh </p><p>much. Most folks noticed this; but some </p><p>folks noticed more the thin, almost cruel </p><p>lips of the man, set close together, hard and </p><p>straight. </p><p> “So they’ve got another one,” observed</p><p>McPike. That seemed to be the news that </p><p>interested him most. “Who is he; and </p><p>what kind of a guy?” </p><p> “Take it from me,” returned Dowdall,</p><p>“he’s a real wide-awake guy!” He fixed </p><p>his gaze determinedly on McPike. “But </p><p>that’s not why I came—just to tell you </p><p>about him. I want to know what you’ll </p><p>do to get me on the C. &amp; M. R. again.” </p><p> The wrinkles around McPike’s eyes did</p><p>not contract, but his mouth opened about </p><p>an eighth of an inch in a thin-lipped grin. </p><p> “I can’t take you on here, Jack,” he</p><p>replied complacently. “I’ve got a helper; </p><p>and one’s my limit.” </p><p> “Well, how about some other station</p><p>along the line?” </p><p> McPike shook his head.</p><p> “No—no place I know of. I understand</p><p>everybody is full up. What’s this new </p><p>guy’s name?” </p><p> “Come on, you can’t put me off that</p><p>way!” cried Dowdall peevishly. “You </p><p>could get me on if you wanted. Look what </p><p>all I did for you!” </p><p> “Keep your shirt on!” returned McPike</p><p>easily. “I guess you didn’t lose anything </p><p>on me.” He regarded Dowdall with cold, </p><p>arrogant eyes. “You might have been of </p><p>some use to me over on the D. &amp; P.; but </p><p>now you’re not.” </p><p> “Then you won’t help me any?” de-</p><p>manded Dowdall. </p><p> “Too bad, but I can’t do a thing,” said</p><p>McPike suavely, once more exhibiting his </p><p>narrow smile. </p><p> At that moment a patron came to the</p><p>open office window. </p><p> “Come out and look at this case of coffee,</p><p>Mac!” he called in to the agent. “It’s all </p><p>smashed to the devil!” </p><p> “All right,” answered McPike, “I’ll be</p><p>right along.” He rose and went out toward </p><p>the freight-house, leaving the fuming Dow- </p><p>dall alone in the office. </p><p> The telegraph instruments, lined up along</p><p> the desk at the front of the office, clicked</p><p>persistently in Dowdall’s ears as he wrath- </p><p>fully reflected over McPike’s treatment. </p><p>He had expected something better of the </p><p>C.	&amp; M. R. agent—at least a little assist-</p><p>ance in securing another job. But this </p><p>calm rebuff, this calm ignoring of all claims, </p><p>brought home to the ex-clerk the fact that, </p><p>being no longer in a position to furnish </p><p>information as to the activities of the </p><p>D.	&amp; P. agent, McPike cared nothing as</p><p>to where he drifted. The ex-clerk was </p><p>filled with vindictive thoughts—as usually </p><p>is the case of the person who finds himself </p><p>in a similar plight. </p><p> The telegraph instruments kept clattering</p><p>away in Dowdall’s ears. Being a teleg- </p><p>rapher himself and having at one time </p><p>worked in this office, he was familiar with </p><p>all the calls, and had, as well, a knowledge </p><p>of the business routine. He heard the </p><p>division office calling some other office down </p><p>the line. </p><p> Desire for vengeance crept into Dowdall’s</p><p>head. If he only could get back at McPike I </p><p>McPike really was responsible for his </p><p>having lost the job on the D. &amp; P., the </p><p>ex-clerk told himself. </p><p> A plan suddenly jumped into DowdalPs</p><p>brain. He sat up straight, then got to his </p><p>feet and walked over quickly to the window </p><p>that faced the freight-house and peered out. </p><p>McPike was not in sight. </p><p> The bold, bad scheme formed swiftly in</p><p>Dowdall’s head. Tomorrow, Saturday, he </p><p>knew was the day when the big cattle </p><p>shipments were made from Billups, the </p><p>stock-cars always being forwarded from </p><p>the division terminal yards Friday night </p><p>in time to arrive at Billups early Saturday </p><p>morning. </p><p> Dowdall glanced again out the window.</p><p>Still no McPike. Doubtless the agent </p><p>would be absent a few .minutes more, going </p><p>over the damaged case of coffee, and check- </p><p>ing up the loss. The division office was </p><p>still calling; there would be time. </p><p> The ex-clerk opened the key on the</p><p>division office wire, a mischief-making </p><p>message already formed in his brain. </p><p>THE C. &amp; M. R. station seemed </p><p>deserted when Joe Reilly arrived </p><p>there. He entered through the </p><p>rear door of the waiting-room and looked </p><p>through the open ticket window. He </p><p>beheld but one man within the office and </p><p>The Better Mixer </p><p>49 </p><p>he smiled a little as he perceived that it </p><p>was his late clerk, Dowdall. The late </p><p>clerk’s back was toward the ticket window. </p><p>Apparently he had not heard Reilly’s </p><p>entrance, for he did not turn his head or </p><p>make any other sign to disclose that he </p><p>was conscious of the D. &amp; P. agent’s </p><p>proximity. </p><p> Reilly saw Dowdall peer quickly out the</p><p>front office window. There was something </p><p>strangely furtive about the quick glance, </p><p>something sly in the very poise of the ex- </p><p>clerk’s head. Joe watched him silently, </p><p>noting the vindictive lines of Dowdall’s </p><p>half-averted face, also the working of his </p><p>uneasy fingers. And then, when the ex- </p><p>clerk all at once opened the telegraph key, </p><p>with sudden resolution showing in his </p><p>crafty countenance, Joe strained his ears </p><p>to hear what the sounder spelled as Dowdall </p><p>started a message. </p><p> The message came to an end and the</p><p>operator at the other end gave his OK. </p><p>Dowdall straightened up, his face a little </p><p>flushed, his eyes glittering triumphantly. </p><p> “There, - your hide, McPike!” he</p><p>ejaculated guardedly—but not guardedly </p><p>enough to prevent the words from reaching </p><p>Joe Reilly’s ears. “I guess maybe that’ll </p><p>fix your clock—for a little bit, anyway!” </p><p>Joe Reilly instantly and noiselessly </p><p>slipped out of the station. He did not </p><p>comprehend all that had taken place in </p><p>the C. &amp; M. R. office, but he did compre- </p><p>hend enough to give him a pretty shrewd </p><p>idea of it. He decided, swiftly, that the </p><p>beginning of his personal acquaintance with </p><p>McPike could wait. </p><p> “McPike has turned Jacky down,” re-</p><p>flected Joe, his brain. working at high </p><p>speed, “and Jacky thinks he sees a good </p><p>chance to play the devil!” Joe suppressed </p><p>a grin as a subtle plan suddenly began to </p><p>unfold before him. “All’s fair in love and </p><p>business!” he commented silently. “So </p><p>why not?” </p><p> Apparently there was no answer to the</p><p>why not, for he immediately legged it back </p><p>to the D. &amp; P. station. He entered his</p><p>office and from there sent another message. </p><p>The message was as follows: </p><p>Supt. Burpord: </p><p> Send me sixty or seventy stock-cars. Get them</p><p>here quick—before tomorrow noon if at all possible. </p><p>J. Reilly. </p><p> After the message had gone Reilly busied</p><p>4 </p><p> himself around the office. At 5:30 the</p><p>southbound limited arrived. And just as it </p><p>started to pull out Joe was not greatly </p><p>surprised to behold his erstwhile clerk come </p><p>streaking across the station platform and </p><p>pile on to one of the coaches, suitcase in </p><p>hand. </p><p>“Jacky, it seems, is leaving for parts </p><p>unknown,” said Joe. “He’s wise in that.” </p><p>And to show that he harbored no hard </p><p>feelings he waved his hand at the departing </p><p>Jacky. </p><p>V </p><p>AT A square table in a comer of </p><p>the Oasis saloon the agent of the </p><p>C.	&amp; M. R. sat opposite a drooping-</p><p>mustached individual. The hour was </p><p>around nine in the evening. The Oasis </p><p>was well filled with patrons, the patrons </p><p>being for the greater part cattle-owners, </p><p>arrived early for the morrow’s loading. </p><p>The cattle-owner’s herds would follow; </p><p>meantime they, the cattlemen, set them- </p><p>selves to a little recreation. </p><p> “I tell you, Mac,” said the drooping-</p><p>mustached man, “the boys are getting a </p><p>little bit restless. This last stunt of your </p><p>old railroad, handling the stock so slow </p><p>that they exceeded the thirty-six-hour </p><p>limit and had to have one more feed than </p><p>usual, made them pretty sore.” </p><p> “Oh, they’ll get over that, Mohr,” said</p><p>McPike with easy confidence. “We can </p><p>hold ’em.” </p><p> “Don’t you be too sure,” said Mohr</p><p>firmly. “I heard them grumbling a lot </p><p>over that extra feed bill. They’re like</p><p>everybody else—they don’t like to be </p><p>kicked in the pocketbook by a railroad. </p><p>I heard ’em saying the C. &amp; M. R. wasn’t </p><p>the only road they could ship on.” </p><p> McPike looked a little worried at that.</p><p>“It was a boner the C. &amp; M. R. pulled, </p><p>I’ll admit. And don’t think that I forgot </p><p>to tell the boss up at division headquarters </p><p>about it! He promised the next bunch’d </p><p>be handled quicker. Said he’d just raise </p><p>Cain along the line and wake the other </p><p>fellows up.” </p><p> “He’d better!” declared Mohr.</p><p> McPike leaned a trifle closer to the</p><p>table. </p><p> “The D. &amp; P. has sent another new agent</p><p>here,” he said to Mohr. He grinned mean- </p><p>ingly. “I’m figuring on his helping to put </p><p>the boys back in a good humor again.” </p><p>50 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “You don’t sayl” said Mohr.</p><p>. “Yes, sir. Fellow named Reilly. Just </p><p>got in today.” </p><p> “Well! Go on, tell me the rest.”</p><p> “I dropped a word in. Pegram’s ear this</p><p>evening. He’s going to strike up with </p><p>Reilly and steer him in here.” </p><p> Mohr looked pleased.</p><p> “Well, if you can pull off your usual stunt</p><p>before the crowd maybe the boys’ll lose all </p><p>their sore thoughts. Pull it off good, </p><p>though. What kind of a hombre is this </p><p>Reilly?” </p><p> “Young chap.” McPike smiled con-</p><p>fidently. “You just leave it to me!” </p><p> The doors at the front of the saloon swung</p><p>open and two men entered: Joseph Reilly </p><p>and a shining-faced, heavy-set man. It </p><p>was a rather boisterous entrance that the </p><p>two made. Rather, it was a somewhat </p><p>boisterous entrance that the shining-faced </p><p>man made; his voice could be heard </p><p>enthusiastically urging Reilly to come in </p><p>and meet the boys—all good friends of his. </p><p> Inside the doorway Joe Reilly stopped.</p><p>The eyes of nearly all the patrons had </p><p>turned toward the doorway, attracted by </p><p>the commotion there. Joe laid his hand </p><p>firmly on his conductor’s shoulder and cast </p><p>a calm glance around the room. </p><p> “Does this man belong to any of you</p><p>gentlemen?” he asked. </p><p> There was silence for a few seconds</p><p>among the assembled cattlemen. Then </p><p>here and there a little chuckle broke out. </p><p> “I don’t know’s he belongs to any one</p><p>in particular,” offered a grizzled old cow- </p><p>man, standing nearby. He eyed Joe with </p><p>approval. “But if he does belong to any </p><p>one, I reckon it’d be McPike.” </p><p> “McPike?” repeated Joe. “Where is</p><p>he?” </p><p> The old cowman pointed a finger to the</p><p>table in the corner where the C. &amp; M. R. </p><p>agent and Mohr were watching. </p><p> “There he is; the large gent seated to the</p><p>left.” </p><p> . Reilly caught his late conductor by the</p><p>arm and speedily led him over to the table. </p><p> “McPike,” said Joe abruptly, “here I</p><p>am! This toady of yours tried to draw me </p><p>in here. Mr. Toady, report to your </p><p>boss ” </p><p> A sudden silence had fallen in the saloon.</p><p>Men turned more attentively to the table </p><p>in the comer. Those who held glasses aloft </p><p>set them softly down on the bar. Joe </p><p>Reilly was a stranger to all of them. But </p><p>they sensed that something interesting was </p><p>coming off. </p><p> The toady stood without words, looking</p><p>from Reilly to McPike. He moistened his </p><p>lips once or twice, but no sound came from </p><p>them. </p><p> “You can’t?” said Joe shortly. “Very</p><p>well, I’ll speak myself.” He looked at the </p><p>C.	&amp; M. R. agent. “Your friend didn’t</p><p>fool me even a little bit, McPike; he’s too </p><p>clumsy. It didn’t take me a whole lot </p><p>more than a minute to guess that for some </p><p>reason other than mere friendliness he </p><p>wanted to get me in this place; and I </p><p>guessed, too, that the reason was you. All </p><p>right, here I am. What do you want?” </p><p> McPike raised his big bulk to his feet.</p><p>He couldn’t keep the astonishment out of </p><p>his eyes. Things were not going exactly as </p><p>he had planned. He suddenly realized that </p><p>he was going to have a hard time making </p><p>a fool of this man in front of the cattlemen. </p><p>The D. &amp; P.’s new agent was too aggressive; </p><p>he carried things, so to speak, right into the </p><p>enemy’s country. But McPike resolved to </p><p>make an effort. </p><p> “You’ve got a great imagination, my</p><p>boy!” he boomed, trying to throw a good- </p><p>natured note in with his patronizing air. </p><p>He wrinkled his eyes to show his merriment. </p><p>“And what would I be wanting with you?” </p><p> He drew himself to his full height. But</p><p>if his thought was intimidation, his thought </p><p>availed him nothing. </p><p> Joe Reilly looked at him with level eyes.</p><p> “I just believe I’ll tell you,” he said.</p><p>“I believe that’d be a right good plan.” </p><p> He bent forward slightly and fixed his</p><p>eyes on the C. &amp; M. R. agent. </p><p> “You wanted this, McPike!” said Joe,</p><p>his words coming with calm assurance. </p><p>“You wanted to get me in here and then, </p><p>after revealing to these men who I am, </p><p>make me act the clown while you snapped </p><p>the whip. I’ve heard of your methods with </p><p>other agents the D. &amp; P. has sent here.” </p><p> Joe looked around for a brief instant to</p><p>the interested stockmen. </p><p> “Gentlemen,” he said, “I’ll introduce</p><p>myself. My name is Reilly—Joseph </p><p>Reilly; and I’m the new agent for the </p><p>D.	&amp; P. at Billups.”</p><p> Once more there was a stillness in the</p><p>Oasis while the cattlemen quietly regarded </p><p>Reilly. And then, as before, it was the </p><p>grizzled cowman who spoke. </p><p>The Better Mixer </p><p>51 </p><p> “We’re pleased to meet you!” said the old</p><p>man; his eyes twinkled and there was a </p><p>subdued gurgling in his throat. “My </p><p>name’s Man tooth—‘Old Sam’ Mantooth.” </p><p>Joe Reilly turned a swift grin on him, </p><p>then swung back to the C. &amp; M. R. </p><p>agent. </p><p> “McPike,” he said evenly, “you can’t</p><p>do it. You can’t make me do anything. </p><p>I’m telling you, big fellow. If you think </p><p>otherwise, go to it!” </p><p> The wrinkles had disappeared from</p><p>around McPike’s eyes. The hard lines </p><p>around his thin-lipped mouth stood out; a </p><p>dull, angry red had come into his face; his </p><p>eyes flamed with rage. </p><p> “You young fool!” he roared. “You will</p><p>try to bluff me!” </p><p> He took a quick step around the end of</p><p>the table and made a lunge at Joe. </p><p> Starting from the hip, Joe drove his fist</p><p>upward. There was a sudden solid smack, </p><p>and McPike returned toward the same spot </p><p>that he had just left. But, returning, he </p><p>did not travel on his feet; the only thing </p><p>he did travel on was air. And when he </p><p>arrived it was on his back, whereon he laid </p><p>for a moment, half-dazed. </p><p> “Bless my soul!” came from Old Sam</p><p>Mantooth. “The immortal Bob F. was </p><p>right! The bigger they are the harder </p><p>they fall!” He raised his voice. “Mr. </p><p>Reilly, I’d be much pleased if you’d teach </p><p>me that.” </p><p> Joe smiled broadly at him.</p><p> “Call around at my office any day!” he</p><p>invited. </p><p> He looked down at the blinking McPike.</p><p>“You’re in a draft there, Maccy,” he </p><p>said pleasantly. “Get up or you’ll catch </p><p>cold. Then I’ll tell you something else.” </p><p>His face betraying his embarrassment, </p><p>McPike scrambled to his feet and looked </p><p>at Joe sourly. </p><p> “Before I say the something else,” pro-</p><p>ceeded Joe, “I’ll give you a chance. Have </p><p>you any observations to make, further?” </p><p>McPike swallowed hard. Murder glared </p><p>in his eyes—hate at being made to appear </p><p>so helpless before the cattlemen. The </p><p>tables had been reversed, exactly, from what </p><p>he had planned. But swallow was all </p><p>McPike did; he ventured no word. </p><p> “Well, never mind,” soothed Joe. “But</p><p>what I was going to say was this: I’d like </p><p>to lay a little wager with you that between </p><p>this and Sunday I’ll have at least seventy- </p><p>five per cent, of the cattle moving out of </p><p>Billups traveling over the D. &amp; P. What </p><p>say?” </p><p> At that McPike seemed to find his tongue.</p><p>Some of the arrogance came back into his </p><p>face. </p><p> “If you do,” he cried, “may I be damned!</p><p>There’s no smart Aleck going to come in </p><p>here and show off and then do anything like </p><p>that!” </p><p> “Nevertheless,” returned Joe evenly,</p><p>“I’m offering to lay the bet. They tell </p><p>me you’re quite a sporting man. Will you </p><p>accept a wager on that? And if so, what </p><p>will you stake on it?” </p><p> “Accept it!” he shouted. “Well I guess</p><p>yes! And I’ll tell you what I’ll stake— </p><p>I’ll stake my job against yours! If you </p><p>lose, you quit! If I lose, I quit!” </p><p> He glared with sudden triumph at</p><p>Reilly. The D. &amp; P. agent had played </p><p>right into his hand. This was a good way </p><p>to get rid of a man who in time might prove </p><p>a dangerous competitor for the cattlemen’s </p><p>patronage. </p><p> But the one day that came before Sunday</p><p>was, comparatively, a short time. McPike </p><p>was confident he could hold the stockmen </p><p>to the C. &amp; M. R. for that long despite his </p><p>recent sorry showing. And if the D. &amp; P. </p><p>agent backed down now Reilly would be </p><p>forever branded as no good sport, as dis- </p><p>playing a yellow streak. McPike felt that </p><p>he had Reilly, coming and going. </p><p> Joe Reilly merely swung ’round to the</p><p>absorbed cattlemen. </p><p> “You’ve heard the conditions,” he said</p><p>to them. “The bet’s on!” </p><p>VI </p><p>BILLUPS buzzed on Saturday </p><p>morning with talk of Friday night’s </p><p>affair in the Oasis. Naturally, the </p><p>cattlemen had not been backward in giving, </p><p>out the details. Billups received the news </p><p>with relish and then took to discussing the </p><p>matter at great length. And the final, </p><p>practically unanimous verdict was that, </p><p>while they admired Reilly’s nerve and </p><p>acclaimed his skill, they nevertheless were </p><p>convinced that he had overdone himself </p><p>in the matter of the wager. </p><p> After making such a showy beginning,</p><p>why should any man go and lay himself </p><p>open to such an anti-climax, asked Billups. </p><p>McPike, it was decided, had shown great </p><p>52 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>astuteness in drawing the terms of the bet; </p><p>it was felt that in this he had regained much </p><p>of the prestige he had temporarily lost in </p><p>the first part of the Oasis episode. That </p><p>McPike could hold the shippers to the </p><p>C.	&amp; M. R. for this one day, Billups had</p><p>not the least doubt. </p><p> It was nearly eight o’clock when McPike</p><p>reached his station on Saturday morning. </p><p>And when he did arrive there he was </p><p>surprised to find no stock-cars on the cattle- </p><p>chute sidings. McPike stared, batted his </p><p>eyes, then hurried into the office. He pulled </p><p>tie plugs from the switchboard, sat down </p><p>at his message wire key and swiftly began </p><p>to call the division office. </p><p> In a moment or two the division office</p><p>answered and McPike dashed off a message </p><p>to his superintendent. </p><p>Surf. Hibbard: </p><p> No stock-cars on hand to take care of today’s</p><p>loading. Advise quick when they will arrive. </p><p>P. H. McPike. </p><p> Twenty minutes later McPike received</p><p>an answer. </p><p>P. H. McPike: </p><p> No cars scheduled for your station account all</p><p>orders canceled by your wire of yesterday P. M. </p><p>Why do you now ask for cars? </p><p>Hibbard. </p><p> McPike regarded this message in-</p><p>credulously, holding the key open the </p><p>while. </p><p> “What in the devil!” he snorted.</p><p>“What’s he trying to do—kid me?” </p><p> He made several meaningless dots and</p><p>dashes on the wire. Then, composing </p><p>himself enough to think straight, he fired </p><p>another message to headquarters. </p><p>Supt. Hibbard: </p><p> Have postively no knowledge of any message</p><p>cancelling car orders. Will need cars today as </p><p>usual. Must have them as shippers already are </p><p>arriving with stock. </p><p>P. H. McPike. </p><p> The cattle were indeed arriving. From</p><p>his office windows McPike could see the </p><p>first bunch rounded up near one of the </p><p>stock-chutes. While he awaited his answer </p><p>another bunch arrived; and directly the </p><p>owners of the two droves came up to the </p><p>station and entered. </p><p> “Where’s the cars, Mac?” asked the first</p><p>arrival. </p><p> McPike turned a worried face around.</p><p>“They should have come in early this </p><p>morning, Scherr,” he answered. “I’ve </p><p>wired about ’em and am just waiting for a </p><p>reply. Stay ’round a minute till I see.” </p><p>The sounder began to clatter his call just </p><p>then and he answered. The operator at </p><p>headquarters started his message. </p><p>P. II. McPike: </p><p> Following message from your office was received</p><p>by us at 3:08 p.m. yesterday: “Owing to unforeseen </p><p>delays stockmen will not be able to ship tomorrow. </p><p>Cancel all orders for stock-cars. Will later advise </p><p>fully as to date needed. Signed—P. H. McPike.” </p><p>Acting on this message we canceled movement of all </p><p>stock-cars for Billups and have sent all our surplus </p><p>empties north. Impossible to forward any cars to </p><p>you today and probably not tomorrow, Monday </p><p>being earliest date we can promise. Would be glad </p><p>to have an explanation of the inconsistency shown </p><p>in your various wires. </p><p>Hibbard. </p><p> McPike fairly bounced out of his chair as</p><p>this message was completed. He let out a </p><p>yell that brought the two cattlemen running </p><p>to the window. </p><p> “What’s the matter, Mac?” called</p><p>Scherr. </p><p> “Matter!” shrieked McPike, waving the</p><p>message. “Matter!” </p><p> He filled the air with burning words for a</p><p>minute, then smacked the message down </p><p>before them.</p><p> “Read that!”</p><p> The two read the words, carefully. They</p><p>looked up in perplexity. </p><p> “What’s it mean, Mac?” asked Scherr.</p><p>“Why did you cancel the cars on us?” </p><p>“Cancel ’em!” roared McPike. “I didn’t! </p><p>Not in a thousand years. Somebody’s </p><p>playing me dirt!” </p><p> The two looked steadily at him. Sudden</p><p>suspicion came into their eyes. </p><p> “It looks that way!” said the second man</p><p>mildly. </p><p> Something in his tone caused the agent’s</p><p>face to flush angrily. </p><p> “You don’t think it was me, do you?”</p><p>he demanded. “Good God, Toomey, why </p><p>would I? I want to keep your business, not </p><p>drive it away!” </p><p> “Yes, that’s so,” put in Scherr. “You</p><p>wouldn’t be liable to do anything like that. </p><p>But sometimes these danged railroads do </p><p>funny things. Maybe your road thinks we </p><p>can just lay around and keep our cattle here </p><p>till they get ready to furnish the cars, on </p><p>Monday.” </p><p>The Better Mixer </p><p>53 </p><p> “No, sir!” protested McPike. “The</p><p>company’s not made up of such fools. I </p><p>tell you, somebody else has had a hand in </p><p>this.” </p><p> “Well, who?” asked Toomey. A half-</p><p>humorous light came into his eyes. “Maybe </p><p>that D. &amp; P. agent who made the bet with </p><p>you last night did it?” </p><p> McPike gaped at the cattlemen.</p><p> “By thunder!” he bellowed. “By thun-</p><p>der!” He smashed his fist on the window </p><p>ledge. “You’ve said it!” </p><p> “But how could he?” cut in Scherr. “He</p><p>wasn’t here in your office, was he?” </p><p>McPike’s face fell a little. </p><p> “No,” he admitted, “he wasn’t.”</p><p> He wrinkled his brows in thought for a</p><p>moment. Then all at once recollection of </p><p>Jack Dowdall’s presence in the office while </p><p>he, McPike, was out in the freight-house </p><p>checking up the damaged case of coffee </p><p>came to the C. &amp; M. R. agent. He looked </p><p>up at the two stockmen. </p><p> “It wasn’t Reilly himself!” he exclaimed.</p><p>“But his clerk was in here—that double- </p><p>faced Dowdall!” </p><p> He whirled away from the window,</p><p>slammed open the office door and emerged </p><p>into the waiting-room- where Scherr and </p><p>Toomey were. </p><p> “What now?” inquired Scherr.</p><p> “I’m going over and see that D. &amp; P.</p><p>man!” stormed McPike. “He can’t put </p><p>his clerk up to anything like that and then </p><p>get away with it!” </p><p> “Remember,” cautioned Toomey dryly,</p><p>“that boy totes a pretty fair wallop </p><p>around with him. Don’t do anything </p><p>rash.” </p><p> “Rash,-1” cried McPike. “I’m going</p><p>over—and the wallop won’t have anything </p><p>to do with this case!”</p><p> He patted his belt significantly.</p><p> “Well, we might as well go too,” said</p><p>Scherr. </p><p> He and Toomey fell in step as McPike</p><p>bolted out. </p><p> At the edge of the station platform they</p><p>met a bunch of three more shippers, just </p><p>arrived. </p><p> “Where’s our cars, Mac?” demanded one</p><p>of the new arrivals. </p><p> “Hush!” warned Toomey. “Mac’s got</p><p>something on his mind.” </p><p> The three seemed puzzled.</p><p> “But where—” began the man who had</p><p>spoken before. </p><p> “Oh, shucks!” said Toomey. “We’re on</p><p>our way to see about it. Come along.” </p><p> He winked gravely.</p><p> So the three, perceiving the wink, fell in</p><p>also. And as they hastened toward the </p><p>D.	&amp; P. station Scherr and Toomey ex-</p><p>plained briefly to them. </p><p>VII </p><p>THE early morning D. &amp; P. train </p><p>north, on Saturday, was handled </p><p>by the same crew that had been </p><p>on the southbound limited the evening </p><p>before. Just before the northbound pulled </p><p>out this Saturday a.m. the brakeman came </p><p>running to Joe Reilly with a letter. </p><p> “That clerk of yours who went south</p><p>with us yesterday gave me this letter. He </p><p>said to be sure and give it to you when I </p><p>came back up this morning,” said the </p><p>brakeman. </p><p> “Thanks,” said Joe, and held it unopened</p><p>in his hand until the train had pulled away. </p><p>Then he tore the sealed envelop open. </p><p>Within was but one sheet of paper. </p><p> Joe read what was written thereon; and</p><p>when he came to the end he whistled</p><p>softly. </p><p> “Well, maybe this will come in handy!”</p><p>he commented and stuffed the letter in his </p><p>pocket. </p><p> Somewhere around 8:30 Old Sam Man-</p><p>tooth dropped in at the depot. </p><p> “I ain’t doin’ any shipping today,” he</p><p>explained to Joe. “Just come to town to </p><p>look ’round.” He eased himself against the </p><p>window ledge. “How’s business?” </p><p> “Not so good as it will be,” smiled Joe.</p><p> Old Sam smiled also.</p><p> “Just between you and me,” he said,</p><p>“I believe McPike needs to be taken down </p><p>a peg. But it gets me how you’re figurin’ </p><p>011 winning that bet.” </p><p> “You wait and see,” advised Joe, smiling</p><p>more widely. </p><p> “I’ll sure do that!” answered Sam.</p><p>“I’ll just sort of stick around and keep my </p><p>eye open.” He regarded Joe silently for a </p><p>few seconds. “That McPike is no man to </p><p>fool with, son. You laid him out real slick </p><p>last night; but the next time you want to </p><p>watch.” </p><p> “I’ll be watching,” promised Joe.</p><p> A few minutes afterward Mantooth</p><p>strolled out. But ten minutes later he </p><p>hurried in again. </p><p>54 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “McPike’s cornin’ with a bunch!” he</p><p>announced quickly. “He’s cornin’ a’fog- </p><p>gin’!” </p><p> Joe, who had been busy at the wire, now</p><p>and then casting an expectant glance up </p><p>the track to the north, arose from his chair </p><p>at once, pulled on his coat, put on his hat </p><p>and came out of the office. </p><p> “I’m much obliged,” he said to Mantooth</p><p>as he stepped toward the waiting-room </p><p>door. “I’ll just go out and meet him.” </p><p> Sam followed.</p><p> “If you need any help—” he offered.</p><p> “Thanks, again. But I'm not expect-</p><p>ing to.” </p><p> Joe swung the door open and stepped</p><p>out. </p><p> Just outside the depot Joe and Old Sam</p><p>met McPike and his party. TheC. &amp;M. R. </p><p>agent’s eyes were snapping, his face twitch- </p><p>ing. </p><p> “So that’s the way you do things, is it?”</p><p>cried McPike, coming to a halt. “Put </p><p>your clerk up to coming in my office with a </p><p>cock-and-bull story and then while I’m out </p><p>have him send a lying message to get me all </p><p>balled up!” He thrust his head forward </p><p>wrathfully. “You’re a rotten sneak!” </p><p> Joe Reilly contemplated McPike com-</p><p>posedly. </p><p> “You surprise me!” he said coolly. “Be-</p><p>sides which, you lie!” </p><p> “Is that so?” shouted McPike. ‘Til</p><p>show you something!” </p><p> His hand jerked toward his hip.</p><p> There was a single flash and report. The</p><p>pistol that McPike had drawn flew from his </p><p>hand and fell to the platform. </p><p> “This is a cheap trick, I know,” said Joe</p><p>Reilly apologetically. “But it was about </p><p>the only thing I could do.”</p><p> McPike nursed the stinging fingers of his</p><p>otherwise unhurt gun-hand. He stared at </p><p>Reilly. The agent of the D. &amp; P. was </p><p>standing at ease, his hands nestling in the </p><p>side pockets of his coat. So lightning- </p><p>quick had been the drawing of his gun and </p><p>the shot that Joe’s movements had almost </p><p>baffled the eye. But Old Sam Mantooth’s </p><p>eye had not been baffled. </p><p> “That was real nice,” said Old Sam.</p><p>“Excuse me, Mr. Reilly, for ever being so </p><p>bold as to offer you advice.” </p><p> Away to the north the piercing whistle</p><p>of an approaching train sounded. Joe </p><p>pricked up his ears at the sound; his eyes </p><p>brightened. </p><p> “McPike,” he said, “you’ve got the</p><p>wrong idea, and I can prove it.” </p><p> From his pocket he pulled the letter that</p><p>the brakeman had handed him. He ex- </p><p>tracted and unfolded the sheet of paper. </p><p> “Here’s a little letter I received just an</p><p>hour or so ago. I’d like to have you </p><p>hear it.” </p><p> Aloud he read:</p><p>Mr. Reilly: </p><p> If McPike comes around blaming you for mixing</p><p>up his stock-car orders you show him this letter. </p><p>He’ll likely be around blaming you, but of course </p><p>you had nothing to do with it. </p><p> While in his office this afternoon I sent a message</p><p>to his superintendent to cancel all his orders for </p><p>cars. Maybe the next time lie’ll know better than </p><p>to turn down flat a man who’s done as much as </p><p>I’ve done for him. </p><p>J. Dowdall. </p><p> Joe finished reading and passed the sheet</p><p>of paper to McPike. </p><p> “I guess you know his writing,” he said;</p><p>“you can tell it’s genuine.” </p><p> McPike took the letter and examined it</p><p>closely. It was plain that he was con- </p><p>vinced. </p><p> “Dowdall beat it yesterday,” continued</p><p>Joe. “And when I received the letter I </p><p>was at first a little surprised; because </p><p>Dowdall has no cause to love me, con- </p><p>sidering that I gave him the bounce yes- </p><p>terday. But I’ve doped out since that he </p><p>wrote it through pure vanity. You see, </p><p>he wouldn’t have enjoyed his revenge real </p><p>good unless he was certain that you, </p><p>McPike, would find out it was he who’d </p><p>gummed things up for you. He wanted all </p><p>the credit for himself—wanted to show you </p><p>how he put it over you; and he figured that </p><p>you’d be coming to see me and that I’d </p><p>show you the letter. And I’ll say this for </p><p>him, that he figured it out pretty straight.” </p><p>There was a minute’s silence. McPike </p><p>was doing some heavy thinking. Things </p><p>were becoming clearer to him every </p><p>second. </p><p> “It looks to me,” spoke up Old Sam</p><p>Mantooth, “as if Mr. McPike was trying </p><p>to rope the wrong horse.” </p><p> He glanced questioningly at the men who</p><p>had come with the C. &amp; M. R. agent. </p><p> “By Judas, yes!” cried Scherr. His eyes</p><p>and the eyes of the others were.turned on </p><p>Joe with open respect. “I hope you’ll not </p><p>have any hard feelin’s against any of us </p><p>boys.” </p><p>The Discoverers </p><p>55 </p><p> “Sure not!” answered Joe promptly.</p><p> An irrepressible, friendly grin came to</p><p>his face. </p><p> “But I don't mind making a little con-</p><p>fession,” he said. “As Dowdall says, I had </p><p>nothing to do with the message he sent; </p><p>but I’ll admit I did know that he sent it.” </p><p> “You knew it?” flashed McPike.</p><p>“When?” </p><p> “Yesterday afternoon.” Joe turned his</p><p>friendly grin directly on McPike. “You </p><p>see, I thought I’d just go over and get </p><p>acquainted with you; and when I stepped </p><p>into your station, there was Dowdall, alone </p><p>in your office, sending the message. I </p><p>heard it.” </p><p> “I’ll be blasted!” cried McPike. Mat-</p><p>ters were becoming clearer still to him. </p><p>“And then you went away without waiting </p><p>to get acquainted!” </p><p> “Exactly!” returned the smiling Joe.</p><p>“I felt that was best. It’s been war be- </p><p>tween your road and mine, you know. So </p><p>I decided it’d be a foolish stunt not to grab </p><p>the break when it came my way.” </p><p> The freight from the north by now had</p><p>drawn near, its deep whistle once more </p><p>roaring out as Joe finished speaking. They </p><p>all looked up the track toward it. The </p><p>engines—for it proved to be a double- </p><p>header—swung around a long curve and </p><p>came in sight; and after the engines came </p><p>a long string of empty stock-cars. The </p><p>engines drifted down to the stock-yard sid- </p><p>ing and stopped. A brakeman jumped </p><p>down, threw the switch and gave a signal. </p><p> Joe turned to face the cattlemen.</p><p> “And in the meantime,” he said, “if you</p><p>boys are having any trouble getting your </p><p>stock out, why, here’re lots of cars. I’ll </p><p>be pleased to help, if you can use ’em.” </p><p> The cattlemen had been regarding Joe</p><p>in a rather puzzled sort of way. But at </p><p>his words their faces cleared.</p><p> “You son of a gun!” exclaimed Scherr.</p><p>“Use ’em? You bet your life! Catch us </p><p>waiting ’round here till Monday for cars </p><p>on the C. &amp; M. R! What do you say, </p><p>boys?” </p><p> “Bet your life!” cried the rest of the boys.</p><p>Scherr faced about and began to move off. </p><p>“Wait a second,” called Joe. “I just </p><p>want to say that as far as I’m concerned, </p><p>of course that little bet McPike and I laid </p><p>is off. Providing I won, I never had any </p><p>very serious intentions of demanding its </p><p>payment.” His ever-ready smile again </p><p>broke out. “Things wouldn’t be half as </p><p>interesting around here if he’d leave.” </p><p>“You son of a gun!” said Scherr again. </p><p> It seemed to be the only expression he</p><p>could'find that suited. His lean cheeks </p><p>wrinkled into a grin that matched Joe’s. </p><p> “You’re more than smooth—you’re a</p><p>dead game sport!” </p><p> He turned to the other stockmen.</p><p> “Come on!” he said. “Let’s go and get</p><p>our stuff headed over this way.” </p><p>J^~~J SATURDAY evening, just before </p><p>he left his office for the day, Super- </p><p>intendent Burford received a mes- </p><p>sage from Billups. It read: </p><p>Supt. Btofokd: </p><p> Loaded and forwarded today sixty-six cars stock,</p><p>two trains of thirty-three cars each. C. &amp; M. R. </p><p>handled none. </p><p>J. Reilly. </p><p>THE DISCOVERERS </p><p> BY CHAS. C. JONES</p><p>ARCTIC waste or tropic jungle, moun- </p><p>tain peak or ocean key, </p><p> Some to tell of fabled cities, some of</p><p> buried trove and lone,</p><p> Into earth’s remotest places, where the un-</p><p> unknown hazards be,</p><p>Men have gone—and go—a-seeking each</p><p> a something all his own.</p><p> And they talk of gold or glory, each as it</p><p> may chance to fall,</p><p>But they seek the selfsame treasure— </p><p> neither pride of fame nor pelf;</p><p> For the trail of great adventure leads her</p><p> seekers, one and all,</p><p>To that Land of High Endeavor where a </p><p> man may find—himself!</p><p>Authors of "On Guard," “The While Indians," etc. </p><p>!|HAT?” roared the governor. </p><p>“Five hundred pounds less than </p><p>last year!” </p><p>I “Five hundred and sixty-two </p><p>pounds, six shillings, your Excellency,” re- </p><p>plied his secretary. </p><p> Sir William Berkeley struck the table</p><p>with his jeweled snuff-box and rose to his </p><p>feet. He shook back the lace cuiTs from his </p><p>wrists impatiently and strode across the </p><p>room to the window. </p><p> “There were more traders?” he asked</p><p>finally, without turning. </p><p> “Two more than the year before, your</p><p>Excellency.” </p><p> “And we’ve killed off none of the savages.</p><p>Has less fur been taken, or have we not </p><p>received it?” </p><p> “There is no reason, your Excellency, to</p><p>believe that the savages have taken less. </p><p>They are eager enough for the goods.” </p><p> The governor wheeled and faced his</p><p>secretary. </p><p> “What would you do, an you were in</p><p>my place?” he demanded. </p><p> “You wish me to advise your Excellency?”</p><p>“Call it what you will. I care not </p><p>whether it be advisement or expostulation. </p><p>I know this much. All fur of the colony, </p><p>every hide and hair, is to pass through </p><p>my hands, and it does not. I am indiffer- </p><p>ent to the few paltry pounds I lose, but </p><p>there is sedition, rebellion, defiance of the </p><p>king and of the king’s will, in this.” </p><p> The secretary discreetly remained silent</p><p>while the governor paced from the table </p><p>to the window and back. The plier of </p><p>quills knew his excellency too well to </p><p>attempt speech now. Any word would </p><p>be incautious in the face of the rising </p><p>tempest. He was surprised, however, when </p><p>Sir William, his eyes thoughtful, the storm </p><p>cloud passed, suddenly stopped and asked— </p><p>“Is that disgraceful son of Captain </p><p>Jeffreys in the gaol?” </p><p> “He is, your Excellency.”</p><p> “They tell me that he has been to the</p><p>Blue Mountains, has traveled far to the </p><p>north, even to the Plymouth Company’s </p><p>lands.” </p><p> “Even farther, your Excellency, if report</p><p>be true. I have heard that he has crossed the </p><p>St. Lawrence, that he spent a year with the </p><p>French.” </p><p> “The St. Lawrence, eh? That’s where</p><p>the fur is found in plenty, and where none </p><p>escapes. And I’ve heard it said that, with </p><p>the exception of the Longhouses, the </p><p>Indians are always friendly to the French.” </p><p>Still thoughtful, the governor turned </p><p>again to the window and looked out over </p><p>the river, the far reaches of which were </p><p>tinted with that first, fresh, delicate green of </p><p>budding leaves. At last he spoke quickly, </p><p>decisively: </p><p> “Bring me the charges against this young</p><p>Jeffreys, all of them. Write them out, </p><p>clearly and at length.” </p><p> An hour later the secretary placed a</p><p>neatly copied sheet before the governor. </p><p>5&lt;&gt; </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>57 </p><p> “Now,” commanded Sir William, “have</p><p>the warder of the gaol conduct this young </p><p>rover before me at once.” </p><p> “Here, your Excellency!”</p><p> “Yes, here!” and the governor’s face</p><p>grew red with his fury. “Here in this room, </p><p>and at once!” </p><p> Sir William had read the paper through</p><p>three times before there was a knock. </p><p> “Come in!” he thundered, and the door</p><p>opened to admit his secretary. </p><p> “He has been brought, your Excellency.”</p><p>The governor looked up to see a strange </p><p>figure framed by the big-planked portal. </p><p>Not in the gold and lace and bright colors of </p><p>the gentry of Virginia was he clothed, nor </p><p>in the rough costume of an indented servant. </p><p>On his feet were moccasins, beaded, the </p><p>tops rolling over to escalloped edges. His </p><p>legs, long, straight, and not too heavy, </p><p>were encased in buckskin leggings, and </p><p>down each outer seam was a long fringe of </p><p>the leather. </p><p> He wore a shirt of woolen and over it a</p><p>buckskin jacket that reached below his </p><p>hips and around the edges, across the </p><p>shoulders and down the arms of which </p><p>were long fringes like those of the leggings. </p><p>On his head was a cap made of the skins of </p><p>mink, and hanging from the top of it was </p><p>the long, bushy tail of a gray fox. </p><p> The garb, strange as it was, held the</p><p>governor’s attention for only a moment. </p><p>The face under the brown cap, smooth- </p><p>shaven, brown, was one the handsome </p><p>Royalist himself would have envied in his </p><p>youth. The forehead was high and wide. </p><p>The eyes, gray, steady and frank, were wide </p><p>apart. The lips were full but slightly com- </p><p>pressed, and beneath was a chin that was </p><p>as square as the perfect symmetry of the </p><p>face would permit. </p><p> There was no question, no curiosity, no</p><p>cringing, in the gaze that met the gover- </p><p>nor’s. There was something stately yet </p><p>free in the poise of the head, and the lithe </p><p>figure, while it seemed molten within the</p><p>leathern garments, still had that easy </p><p>dignity and grace of carriage which dis- </p><p>tinguishes the animals the skins had once </p><p>clothed. </p><p> “Your hat, sirrah!” thundered Sir</p><p>William. </p><p> With a smile the young man in the door-</p><p>way plucked the fur helmet from his head, </p><p>and still with a smile he stood looking at </p><p>the governor. </p><p> “Begone!” commanded his Excellency</p><p> with a nod to his secretary.</p><p> The amanuensis slipped out past the</p><p> silent figure that still stood in the doorway.</p><p> “Come hither.”</p><p> The young man entered, and behind him</p><p> came two armed guards from the gaol.</p><p> “I said begone!” cried the governor.</p><p> “But, your Excellency,” expostulated</p><p> one of the men with a glance toward the</p><p> prisoner.</p><p> “Begone, and close the door to!”</p><p> “NOW, sirrah, you are Richard</p><p> Jeffreys, eh?” he continued when</p><p> he and the young man were alone.</p><p> “The same,” was the calm reply.</p><p> “The son of Captain Jeffreys of Jeffreys</p><p> Manor?”</p><p> “The same.”</p><p> Sir William picked up the paper his</p><p> secretary had prepared.</p><p> “And yet you, the son of an honorable,</p><p> God-fearing, loyal subject of the king,</p><p> a son who should be the pride of his father,</p><p> lie in gaol under the charge ot failure tc</p><p> attend church, blasphemy, failure 10 plant,</p><p> corn, illicit trade with the Indians, smug-</p><p> gling furs and seditious utterances. There is</p><p> proof enough to hang you three times over.''</p><p> “So I have been told,” agreed the young</p><p> man calmly.</p><p> “Been told! And do you have to be told</p><p> when you shatter every law of the colony?”</p><p> “I am sometimes a stranger to the colony</p><p> and its laws do not always follow me. It</p><p> would interest me greatly to read the laws</p><p> as they stand today. I am sure they</p><p> would be enlightening.”</p><p> “Read!” shouted the governor. “You</p><p> can read?”</p><p> “Assuredly.”</p><p> “And I, who have thanked God often</p><p> enough that there were no schools or</p><p> printing presses in the colony, live to see</p><p> the like of the heathen savages stand before</p><p> me with this insolent boast of his learning!”</p><p> His excellency., purple with passion, rid</p><p> himself of enough finable oaths to stand</p><p> his own proud figure upon the gallows ten</p><p> times over. He slopped only when his</p><p> vision cleared of the rage mist and he found</p><p> the young man looking at him with uncon-</p><p> cealed interest and a slight smile upon his</p><p> bps.</p><p> “It pleases me,” he said when the gov-</p><p> ernor was silent at last, “that the laws</p><p>58 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>have been so broadened that a slip of the </p><p>tongue or righteous anger can no longer </p><p>send a man dangling at a rope’s end.” </p><p> The thrust served to renew the sterm,</p><p>and through it all the young man stood </p><p>across the table, his eyes twinkling with </p><p>amusement Where his words had failed, </p><p>his attitude, his hidden laughter, served </p><p>to bring the governor to his senses. </p><p> “The rope’s end, knotted, noosed, awaits</p><p>you!’' his excellency said fiercely. “But </p><p>aside with that. Jt matters not now. </p><p>There is another reason I have for bringing </p><p>you here. They tell me you have been </p><p>to the Blue Mountains.” </p><p> “Yes, and beyondl”</p><p> “Beyondf’</p><p> Sir William’s anger fell from him as a</p><p>cloak might drop from his shoulders. He </p><p>leaned forward across the table, his eyes </p><p>eager, his bearing no longer that of the </p><p>king’s ruler of Virginia Colony. </p><p> “Then,” he said at last, his voice husky,</p><p>“have you seen the South Sea, the Red Sea, </p><p>what they call the Gulf of California?” </p><p>“No,” answered young Jeffreys, the smile </p><p>in his eyes verging upon laughter. “Had </p><p>I seen it, it might be that the noose would </p><p>be unknotted were I to lead your men </p><p>to it?” </p><p> “I would cut it with mine own sword,</p><p>for the South Sea means gold, and the king </p><p>needs gold.” </p><p> “King!”</p><p>Jeffreys stiffened and his face hardened. </p><p>“Why should the gold be the king’s?” </p><p>he asked. “Has he ever left England? </p><p>Has he ever seen this land? Have his </p><p>minions ever seen it?” </p><p> “It is the king’s domain!” snapped the</p><p>governor. “His by right of discovery, by </p><p>right of conquest, by the right God has given </p><p>him.” </p><p> “God has given him! God made that land</p><p>but he never destined it for a king. There </p><p>lies not an inch of king’s land beyond the </p><p>Blue Mountains, and there never will. </p><p>That land is too broad, too fair, too pleas- </p><p>ant. A king’s wish would be lost in it, a </p><p>king’s voice-would echo in vain among its </p><p>hills, a king’s lungs would wither if they </p><p>once inhaled the pure air that sweeps the </p><p>plains. God set aside that land for men, </p><p>and some day they will take it.” </p><p> He stopped suddenly and smiled at the</p><p>horror-stricken face of the governor. </p><p> “I feel the noose tighten,” he mocked.</p><p> “You will before tomorrow’s sun rises,”</p><p>whispered his excellency between clenched </p><p>teeth. “Where did you learn this sedition? </p><p>Your father?” </p><p> “Leave my father out of this,” answered</p><p>Jeffreys sharply. “He lives his own life. </p><p>I live mine. He was born in England. He </p><p>is a good man, true to his teachings, to this </p><p>absurd theory that a man, by divine right, </p><p>can oppress other men. </p><p> “But I was born in the colony of Virginia.</p><p>I have never seen a king, and, thank God, </p><p>no king has ever seen the land of my birth, </p><p>nor ever will. My thoughts are mine own. </p><p>I could have no others, after seeing this land </p><p>of men beyond the Blue Mountains.” </p><p> “You have preached this?” asked the</p><p>governor, the words coming with difficulty. </p><p> “There are others who think and preach</p><p>the same? Tell me. They may sever your </p><p>noose.” </p><p> Jeffreys laughed outright.</p><p> “The governor seems to wish that I cheat</p><p>the gallows,” he said, with a suggestion of </p><p>interrogation in his tone. </p><p> “I would hang you and every traitor of</p><p>your ilk with the greatest joy, and hang </p><p>you will tomorrow at dawn, unless-” </p><p> His excellency paused and Jeffreys said</p><p>with a smile: </p><p> “Unless-”</p><p> “You are young, you have wit, and with</p><p>that wit must go courage to take you past </p><p>the Blue Mountains, where no white men </p><p>have been. There is yet hope for you. </p><p>The king needs you. There is this. Have </p><p>you ever preached such sedition to others?” </p><p>“My thoughts have always been vague, </p><p>unformed. They came to my mind as </p><p>the air beyond the Blue Mountains came </p><p>to my lungs. Perhaps it is the air in that </p><p>land that breeds them. I only know it </p><p>is not so close as this in the colony. It </p><p>seems untainted. But when the thoughts </p><p>came to me I did not rush back and preach </p><p>them. Perhaps I would some time. I had </p><p>no intention of doing so today until you </p><p>drove me to it.” </p><p> “I!” cried Berkeley. “I! But let that</p><p>lie. You have not spoken so to others. </p><p>And you say your thoughts are vague. </p><p>There is something that may dispel them, </p><p>as the sun sweeps the fog from the river </p><p>in the morning. Love of life would do that.” </p><p>The governor paused and studied the </p><p>young man’s face. The laughing eyes told </p><p>him no tiling. </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>59 </p><p> “Give me your attention,” he said at last,</p><p>straightening in his chair and speaking </p><p>quickly, as if he had reached a decision and </p><p>wished the matter settled. “They tell me </p><p>you have been north, past the St. </p><p>Lawrence?” </p><p>“Yes. I spent a year with the French.” </p><p>“Then you know something of the fur </p><p>trade, of the methods they employ, of how </p><p>they keep on such amiable terms with the </p><p>savages?” </p><p> “My eyes were always open, and I had</p><p>many opportunities.” </p><p> “Good! The fur trade of Virginia is not</p><p>as it should be. There is need of a better </p><p>understanding with the Indians, though, </p><p>God knows, I have done all I could do to </p><p>placate them.” </p><p> “Placate, exactly,” interrupted Jeffreys.</p><p>“Quiet, sirrah!” shouted the governor. </p><p>“Your life is at stake. This fur business </p><p>must be controlled as the king would have </p><p>it. Unlicensed traders are visiting the </p><p>Indians. The Dutch are smuggling. One </p><p>of their ships was in the Chesapeake only </p><p>last week. A man must go among the </p><p>Indians, win them completely, and he must </p><p>catch these outlaw traders red-handed, </p><p>must find where they meet the smugglers </p><p>and bring the information that will permit </p><p>us to apprehend them.” </p><p> “Combine the offices of envoy and spy,”</p><p>smiled Jeffreys. </p><p> “Silence!” roared the governor. “There</p><p>is no spying on outlaws and traitors. This </p><p>would be in the service of the king. The </p><p>gallows are waiting for you, the gallows or </p><p>this.” </p><p> Jeffreys in no way showed surprise, but</p><p>he did turn and look out of the window, </p><p>at the broad river, placid in the late after- </p><p>noon of an early Spring day, at the sun </p><p>glinting from the freshly budding leaves. </p><p> “You are young, you love life, as I can</p><p>see now by your glance at the sunshine,” </p><p>continued the governor. “Take an oath </p><p>of allegiance to his majesty here before me,</p><p>mend your ways, and Captain Jeffreys’ son </p><p>may live to be a credit to him, to him and </p><p>to his king. No one will ever know. Come, </p><p>be quick! Say the word and you live.” </p><p>“Now?” </p><p> “This moment! My patience can not</p><p>last longer.” </p><p> “But you are asking me to make myself</p><p>over instanter, to implant in myself new </p><p>thoughts, new ideas, a new mind, a new </p><p>heart. I have always been free, wandering </p><p>where I wished, and the life has been sweet. </p><p>The ydor of a wigwam is not washed from a </p><p>man in an hour.” </p><p> “You hesitate between life and death?”</p><p>“Between death and the manner of life,” </p><p>and Jeffreys glanced out of the window at </p><p>the long shadows. “I wish three hours in </p><p>w6ich to adjust myself. My mind is slow </p><p>and can not be spurred.” </p><p> “You deserve not three minutes. But</p><p>you may wait. Only remember that the </p><p>noose is certain at dawn.” </p><p> “And I will send you word from the</p><p>gaol?” asked Jeffreys, the smile again in </p><p>his eyes. </p><p> “No. I will have you brought here.</p><p>There are other things beside the fur of </p><p>which I would speak. When that is </p><p>attended to there is the South Sea. You </p><p>not only have the opportunity of life but of </p><p>honor, of achievement for your king, and </p><p>of your king’s gratitude.” </p><p> “In three hours I will tell you.”</p><p> His excellency struck the table with his</p><p>fist and cried— </p><p> “Warder!”</p><p> The door opened and Jeffreys was led</p><p>away. </p><p>A FEW minutes later he stood </p><p>looking out between the bars of his </p><p>cell. It was the supper hour and </p><p>the street beneath him was empty of all </p><p>except two or three hurrying servants. </p><p> Jeffreys’ eyes, however, were on the tops</p><p>of the trees, where the sun still lingered. </p><p>His ears were tuned only for the twitter of </p><p>industrious nest-builders in the sycamore </p><p>across the way. It was life, budding, </p><p>joyous life, that he saw and heard all about </p><p>him, and he smiled, though not wistfully, or </p><p>longingly. </p><p> “Dick! Dick!” came a stifled cry</p><p>beneath him. </p><p> “Betsvkins!” he exclaimed even before</p><p>he looked down. “What are you doing </p><p>here?” </p><p> “Oh, Dick!” and the girl, who was no</p><p>more than seventeen, looked up with </p><p>streaming eyes and blanched face. “Is it </p><p>true? Are they going to—to—to hang you </p><p>in the morning?” </p><p> “So they say. Before the sun comes up</p><p>again. But what brings you here? You </p><p>must hasten away or there will be talk of </p><p>you.” </p><p>6o </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “I had to, Dick. Father was coming</p><p>to Jamestown this morning and I made him </p><p>bring me. He is waiting now in the </p><p>minister’s house, wondering where I am, </p><p>for I ran away. Oh, Dick! I had to see </p><p>you again! I-” </p><p> She stopped speaking and covered her</p><p>face with her hands. Even so far above her </p><p>he could hear her sobs. </p><p> “Come, come, Betsykins,” he whispered.</p><p>“You must run back. Some one will see </p><p>you. When does your father return to </p><p>Carver Manor?” </p><p> “At once.”</p><p> “Then hasten to him, for he will be</p><p>waiting.” </p><p> “But Dick. They can’t hang you! They</p><p>must not!” </p><p> “Come,” and his tone was a little im-</p><p>patient. “You must go.” </p><p> “I care not if I am seen. I had to talk</p><p>to you again, Dick.” </p><p> “And talk with me you shall, this very</p><p>night, litUe Betsy,” he whispered, his face </p><p>pressed between the bars. “I thought I </p><p>had not a friend in the colony, and now </p><p>when one comes she deserves the best, </p><p>deserves what she wishes. Come, now. </p><p>Run along to the minister’s that your father </p><p>may not be delayed. And tonight, at nine </p><p>o’clock, be in the little grove of sycamores </p><p>below your father’s wharf.” </p><p> “Dick! Don’t jest!”</p><p>“I am not jesting. Go quickly, and to- </p><p>night I’ll talk to you for fifteen minutes.” </p><p>“But Dick! You are in a cell, guarded. </p><p>And at dawn-” </p><p>Again she hid her face in her hands. </p><p>“Elizabeth,” whispered Dick sharply, </p><p>“leave at once! Some one is coming up </p><p>the street and you must not be seen talking </p><p>with a gaolbird.”</p><p> “But the guards! Those bars!”</p><p> “They are nothing, for I go on a king’s</p><p>mission,” and he laughed softly. “Remem- </p><p>ber! The sycamores at nine. I will be </p><p>waiting for you.” </p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p>THE TRYST AT THE SYCAMORES </p><p>“"\X7ELL?” demanded Governor Berkeley </p><p>» ' when the door closed and he and </p><p>Dick Jeffreys were alone. </p><p> The young man’s head was bent, his easy,</p><p>confident bearing had vanished, and he </p><p>stared down at the table between him and </p><p>his excellency. </p><p> “Does the noose have to tighten about</p><p>your neck before your wild brain will come </p><p>to itself and act?” </p><p> “It is hard to decide,” was the hesitating</p><p>answer. “You see, I do not know all that </p><p>I am to do, all that is required of me.” </p><p>“First of all, sirrah, you are required to </p><p>acknowledge your king, to swear allegiance </p><p>anew and to remain loyal to him and to </p><p>the church. That is no more than is </p><p>required of any subject of his gracious </p><p>majesty. Nay, it is a privilege of which </p><p>any one in the colony should be glad. </p><p> “Secondly, you must abandon the wild</p><p>ideas to which you so heedlessly gave voice </p><p>this afternoon. You must be loyal in </p><p>thought as well as in action.” </p><p> “And then?”</p><p> “Following that,” and the governor</p><p>leaned forward, his elbows on the table, </p><p>his haughtiness giving way to sudden </p><p>intentness, “there is the fur trade. You </p><p>have knowledge of the Indians, you under- </p><p>stand the methods of the French. You </p><p>know something of the outlaw traders who </p><p>are smuggling pelts to the Dutch. That </p><p>must be stopped, and you, with the power </p><p>of the king behind you, are to stop </p><p>it. </p><p> “That done, and it should be accom-</p><p>plished in a year, there is the matter of the</p><p>South Sea, the Red Sea of the Spanish, </p><p>the Gulf of California, the way to the </p><p>Indies. There is this kingdom of Quivira, </p><p>which the Spaniards never found, which is a </p><p>second Peru. There is gold, and there are </p><p>pearls and rubies across the Blue Moun- </p><p>tains somewhere. They can not be far, </p><p>for the Indians say that the Eastern Sea </p><p>beats against a rock from which our own </p><p>Roanoke flows. </p><p> “The French are pushing westward to the</p><p>headwaters of the St. Lawrence. Already </p><p>they have reports of the great water only a </p><p>little way beyond. We can not let them </p><p>find and take this land, these rich treasures, </p><p>while we sit idle. True, the king has sent </p><p>no commands, has not expressed a wish, </p><p>but we would not be loyal subjects were we to </p><p>cast aside opportunities for new empires.” </p><p>“I am to find these treasures for the </p><p>king?” asked Dick, looking up for the first </p><p>time. </p><p> “Would you take them for yourself, you,</p><p>a gaolbird?” </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>6l </p><p> “Would I risk the savages and strange</p><p>lands, famine and thirst, for a man I never </p><p>saw, never will see, who has done nothing </p><p>for me?” </p><p> “Egad, sirrah! Another word of that and</p><p>you will fatten the crows. I’m offering </p><p>you a chance for your life and you quibble! </p><p>Dost not know that the king is the ap- </p><p>pointed of God, that he rules by God’s </p><p>right, and that thou, a crawling worm upon </p><p>God’s footstool, art answerable to the </p><p>king?” </p><p> “Perhaps I have been away from the</p><p>colony too much,” answered Dick slowly. </p><p> He had turned toward the window.</p><p>His countenance was pensive, though in his </p><p>eyes, which the governor could not see, </p><p>was a gleam of amusement, a twinkle that </p><p>belied the seriousness of his tone when he </p><p>continued: </p><p> “I have been in many far places, among</p><p>the savages, across mountain ranges, beside </p><p>great lakes, on the banks of wide rivers, on </p><p>the edges of fertile plains. I had never </p><p>given much thought to kings and men </p><p>until then. Somehow, perhaps as the air </p><p>came to my nostrils, things came to my </p><p>mind out there. The sun was warm, the </p><p>flowers were bright and carpeted the </p><p>ground, the birds sang in the trees, the </p><p>winds faintly rustled the leaves. It was </p><p>fair, a heaven upon earth. Life was full, </p><p>complete. </p><p> “Then I remembered things as they were</p><p>in the colony, men sold to slavery because </p><p>they dared think, men better than I who </p><p>had dared oppose a king’s will, branded </p><p>because they sought that freedom I had </p><p>for the taking. I remembered the whip- </p><p>pings and the pillory here in Jamestown, </p><p>the binding laws and the cramping customs. </p><p>And yet, only half a hundred leagues away, </p><p>I was beyond the influence of kings and </p><p>kings’ laws, out where the air and sky and </p><p>water and woods were free, where a man </p><p>could think and pray and swear with only </p><p>his own consciousness of what is right to </p><p>govern him. </p><p> “And that fair land, that free land, you</p><p>ask me to go and take in the name of a king, </p><p>in the name of all that which is not free. </p><p>You ask me for the sake of my life to bind a </p><p>country and a people with the thongs </p><p>which bind Virginia, to stifle and oppress, </p><p>to enslave and degrade.” </p><p> He wheeled suddenly from the window</p><p>and leaned across the table, peering into the </p><p>purple, distorted, shocked face of Sir </p><p>William. </p><p> “Ha-^e you noticed,” he said, “that not</p><p>once, this evening or today, have I ad- </p><p>dressed you as ‘your Excellency,’ or even </p><p>is ‘sir’? I’ll tell you why. You have not </p><p>my respect. In the name of this king you </p><p>have ruled this colony. In the name of </p><p>yo'.'r own love of power, your own selfish- </p><p>ness, your own disregard for the rights, </p><p>the hearts and the minds of your fellow- </p><p>beings, you have refused the people the </p><p>right to elect their own representatives. </p><p>You have condemned men to death because </p><p>you liked not the color of their hair. You </p><p>have grown fat while honest men, men who </p><p>dared tell what they think, have slaved in </p><p>this colony without enough to eat or wear. </p><p> “I tell you, Governor Berkeley, you and</p><p>your kind have come to the wrong land. </p><p>It may be that God gave your king the right </p><p>to rule. You may believe that, or attempt </p><p>to make others believe it, if you will. But </p><p>I know that God set aside this land for men, </p><p>for kingless men, for the rule of right and </p><p>justice. And I tell you now, Governor </p><p>Berkeley, that before a hundred years have </p><p>passed men will rule this land.” </p><p> For a full minute he stared straight into</p><p>his excellency’s eyes, a procedure that only </p><p>increased the anger which already so choked </p><p>the governor he could not speak. Dick’s </p><p>own eyes were dancing, and their glee lifted </p><p>the corners of his mouth. Then suddenly, </p><p>as Sir William was about to gain sufficient </p><p>control to voice his rage, the young man </p><p>burst into a low laugh. </p><p> “There! That is said!” he cried. “A</p><p>mouth-filling speech, was it not? The </p><p>greater part of it I learned from a trapper, </p><p>a Puritan, with whom I spent a Winter </p><p>beyond New Amsterdam, or New York </p><p>I believe it is now. A queer old bookworm. </p><p>I have often wished I could try it on some</p><p>one like yourself, but I never thought </p><p>I would have the pleasure. I never </p><p>dreamed that your own avarice would </p><p>some time give me this opportunity to </p><p>speak with you alone, that your own fear </p><p>of the slipping power of kings, your dread </p><p>of the intoxication of the free air of this </p><p>land, would make you stoop to plotting </p><p>here in this room with a gaolbird. But I </p><p>have had my chance. I have taken it. </p><p>Now this other of which you speak. To </p><p>be sure, I-” </p><p> He stopped and peered again into the</p><p>62 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>governor’s face, smiled when he saw that </p><p>perplexity and lack of understanding were </p><p>effacing his excellency’s rage. </p><p>h DICK straightened, threw back his </p><p>shoulders, turned his head careless^ </p><p>toward the window. Languidly he </p><p>raised his arms. Then suddenly his hands </p><p>shot down, his body seemed to drop and the </p><p>next instant he had leaped up and forward. </p><p> Before the astonished governor could</p><p>think or move the young man was crouching </p><p>on his heels on the table directly in front of </p><p>him. His laughing face was thrust forward </p><p>to within a foot of the outraged visage. </p><p> Sir William Berkeley was no coward, but</p><p>neither was he a match for the young </p><p>athlete before him. At his first movement, </p><p>the first parting of his lips, Dick’s hands </p><p>reached out. One grasped his excellency’s </p><p>throat, the other closed his mouth and bent </p><p>back his head. </p><p> “Not a move, or your own breast shall</p><p>sheath your dagger,” whispered the laugh- </p><p>ing Dick. “Not a sound, for sounds do </p><p>not now accord with my plan. We have * </p><p>talked, and to no purpose. You offered </p><p>me a noose or a place to suckle at the breast </p><p>of the royal sow. Do you remember the </p><p>eagle an Indian brought to the tavern a </p><p>few years ago and which hung in a cage at </p><p>the door? You asked me to become as </p><p>that eagle, asked me, who have known </p><p>the free air of a free land, to submit to a </p><p>king’s fetters. And do you remember how </p><p>one day that eagle grasped the hand of a </p><p>drawer at the tavern when the cage door </p><p>was open and how he fought his way out to </p><p>freedom? </p><p> “Even now your own hand is in the</p><p>eagle’s grip. I knew this afternoon your </p><p>fear for your unjust profits in the fur trade </p><p>was greater than your desire to punish </p><p>what you term sedition. I knew you </p><p>would have me here again tonight, and I </p><p>knew that thereby you would give me my </p><p>chance.” </p><p> Sir William Berkeley’s face became</p><p>purple under the pressure. The grip of </p><p>Dick’s fingers was like that of a smith’s</p><p>vise, but now it suddenly loosened and he </p><p>whipped from his waist a long sash which </p><p>he had not worn in the afternoon. </p><p>“I will leave this with your excellency as a </p><p>memento,” he said as he loosened his other </p><p>hand and drew the sash across Sir William’s </p><p>mouth and tied it. “I got it from the </p><p>French last year. You see it is long, long </p><p>enough to bind your excellency’s arms as </p><p>well as his mouth. There! Now for the </p><p>feet. This cord from the draperies seems </p><p>destined to meet my needs.” </p><p> He leaped to the floor and in another</p><p>moment had securely fastened the feet </p><p>of the half-conscious governor to his chair. </p><p>As he straightened -up and surveyed his </p><p>work his eyes clouded. </p><p> “I require time,” he said thoughtfully.</p><p>“It might be that you will be able to utter </p><p>some sound before I have passed beyond </p><p>your reach. This drapery will serve,” and </p><p>he tore it from a window. </p><p> As he was about to swathe Sir William’s</p><p>head and shoulders in the thick curtain he </p><p>stopped and smiled into the eyes that glared </p><p>into his. </p><p> “It was great sport, your Excellency,”</p><p>he cried mockingly. “I have enjoyed this </p><p>afternoon and evening more than I had ever </p><p>expected to enjoy an entertainment. The </p><p>bear-baiting your cavaliers seem to dote </p><p>upon never approached this for pine sport. </p><p>And as for the noose of which you </p><p>boasted-” </p><p> He laughed softly and then flung the</p><p>curtain about the governor’s head and </p><p>shoulders, binding it on with the long cord </p><p>from another drapery. The work com- </p><p>pleted to his satisfaction, he bent over so </p><p>that his lips were close to the governor’s ear. </p><p> “If your Excellency wishes me, I will be</p><p>at the South Sea,” he whispered. “Some </p><p>of the king’s own will surely be brave </p><p>enough to seek me there.” </p><p> He laughed again and patted the shrouded</p><p>head. </p><p> “Thanks, many thanks, for an enjoyable</p><p>evening,” he said. “I only regret that it is </p><p>not possible for me to laugh aloud.” </p><p> He walked across to the window, opened</p><p>it, and sprang out. Crouching, keeping in </p><p>the shadows, he made his way to the river. </p><p> Dick Jeffreys had not planned heedlessly.</p><p>In the afternoon he had seen Indians on </p><p>the streets of Jamestown, Indians who, he </p><p>knew, had come by water. He was certain </p><p>where they had beached their canoes, and </p><p>five minutes after he had left Government </p><p>House he was in one and headed up-stream. </p><p>Two hours later, breathless, for he had </p><p>paddled hard, he drew in to shore at a </p><p>clump of sycamores. As he stepped out </p><p>he listened a moment and then whistled </p><p>softly. </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>63 </p><p> “Dick!” cried a voice from the darkness</p><p>above him. “Dick! Is it you? Oh, Dick!” </p><p>“Not so loud, Betsykins,” he whispered </p><p>as he climbed the bank to the girl’s side. </p><p> “Dick! How did you get away? Has</p><p>the governor turned you free?” </p><p> “Yes,” he answered as he sat down on</p><p>the bank and rocked back and forth, hold- % </p><p>ing his sides and attempting, sometimes </p><p>vainly, to stifle his laughter. </p><p> “Betsy,” he finally said, “it was the most</p><p>comical time I have ever had. The poor </p><p>old simpleton! His fur trade is getting </p><p>away from him and he wants it back. It’s </p><p>his perquisite from the king, though the </p><p>colony is supposed to have granted him </p><p>alone the right to trade. And now that </p><p>it is slipping he was willing to grant me </p><p>my head and my liberty, forget my past, if I </p><p>would but tame his Indians and spy upon </p><p>the outlaw traders and Dutch smugglers.” </p><p>“Then you are free!” the girl cried </p><p>ecstatically. “You will cease roaming and </p><p>—and talking so freely! You will settle </p><p>down, Dick?” </p><p> “If I settle down, Betsykins, it will be a</p><p>thousand leagues from Virginia. Wait until </p><p>tomorrow. The greatest roar that ever </p><p>came out of Government House will be </p><p>heard as far back as the Blue Mountains. </p><p>I wonder—I wonder—” and he broke off </p><p>to indulge in another fit of silent laughter. </p><p> “Dick!” protested Elizabeth. “Dick!</p><p>Tell me! What have you done?” </p><p>Repeating at length and with inter- </p><p>lations his conversations with Sir William </p><p>th in the afternoon and evening, stopping </p><p>often to chuckle over his thrusts and their </p><p>reception by Royalist ears, and ending </p><p>with a detailed description of how his </p><p>excellency had appeared when he leaped </p><p>on to the table and squatted close to his </p><p>astonished face, Dick related what had </p><p>happened. </p><p> During the recital Elizabeth Carver,</p><p>who had seated herself beside him on the </p><p>ground, listened with increasing fear. When </p><p>at last he had finished she did not speak,</p><p>was too shocked, too stunned, too greatly </p><p>overwhelmed by the knowledge of what his </p><p>recklessness had brought upon his head. </p><p> “I only wish,” Dick himself broke the</p><p>silence, “that I could be a mouse beneath </p><p>the tavern floor and hear the wits of James- </p><p>town recount the affair, if the wits or any </p><p>one else ever hear the true report from the </p><p>governor’s lips.” </p><p> “What are you going to do now?” asked</p><p>Elizabeth in a strained, unnatural voice. </p><p> “Lead Sir William’s trainbands a merry</p><p>chase for a week or so and then strike north </p><p>to the French settlements,” was the ready </p><p>answer. “There’s the place for adventure, </p><p>Betsykins. The savages are friendly, ex- </p><p>cept the Longhouses. Fur is plenty, and </p><p>a man may live as he wishes, without laws </p><p>teUing how to breathe as well as think.” </p><p>“And,” she asked in a strained whisper, </p><p>“you will not come back?” </p><p> “To stick my head into Sir William’s</p><p>anxious noose? To be told what I shall </p><p>eat and wear and plant and swear, how I </p><p>shall pray and what price to pay? Ha, </p><p>ha, ha!” and again he held his sides in </p><p>an effort to stifle his mirth. </p><p> “No, no, Betsykins. I’ve tasted the wine</p><p>of freedom and this Virginia sack has </p><p>become bitter. I’d feel like that panther </p><p>your brother tried to tame were I to remain </p><p>in the colony. There’s a wide land out </p><p>there to the north and west, a land where </p><p>a man may think and live and speak as he </p><p>chooses, where there never was a king and </p><p>his persecution and never will be, where a </p><p>man can be himself and not the stayed, </p><p>beruffted manikin the king and his court </p><p>would have him.” </p><p>A SUPPRESSED exclamation from </p><p>Elizabeth brought a sudden stop to </p><p>Dick’s exuberance. </p><p> “Forgive me, little friend,” he said</p><p>penitently. “I had forgotten that you are </p><p>the king’s own, Royalist to the tips of your </p><p>pretty fingers. But I couldn’t resist the </p><p>opportunity to bait Sir William. There is </p><p>a zest in placing your head inside the lion’s </p><p>mouth and jerking it out before he can </p><p>snap his jaws. And the thought of it is</p><p>so fresh I could not but tell of it. Oh, </p><p>Betsykins! Could you have but seen his </p><p>face! Even the daughter of so stanch a </p><p>cavalier as Charles Carver would have </p><p>laughed, if not Colonel Carver himself. </p><p>It—why, Betsy, what is it? Forgive me, </p><p>little friend. I’ll tell no more of it.” </p><p> For a moment he listened to the girl’s</p><p>sobs as she sat beside him in the darkness </p><p>beneath the sycamores, her hands covering </p><p>her face. The first twinge of remorse carne </p><p>to him, silenced the laughter in a heart </p><p>whose thoughtless recklessness had turned </p><p>gray the hair of his father and had deprived </p><p>him, though never to his regret, of his place </p><p>64 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>in the cavalier aristocracy of Virginia. </p><p> To Dick Jeffreys, roamer, playmate of</p><p>savages, friend of outlaw traders, there had </p><p>never been anything attractive in the </p><p>plantation life. The Summer his mother </p><p>had died, when he was fourteen, he had </p><p>first run away with the Indians. Before </p><p>he was eighteen his father, scandalized, </p><p>stern, demanding obedience, had forbidden </p><p>him to come near the plantation, and t^e </p><p>same night had sent a trusted overseer to </p><p>induce Dick to return. </p><p> Elizabeth Carver, seven years younger,</p><p>boyhood playmate, now at the dawn of </p><p>womanhood, was still a playmate to the </p><p>careless Dick, still a companion as well as </p><p>the only person in the colony who dared </p><p>risk a word with him. Even as he sat </p><p>there in the darkness, distressed by her </p><p>sobs, accusing himself for having hurt her, </p><p>she was still to him the little girl who had </p><p>joined so whole-heartedly in the games </p><p>he and her brother had arranged, the same </p><p>stanch comrade, the same worshiper of his </p><p>boyish escapades. The years had passed </p><p>lightly with Dick Jeffreys, and he thought </p><p>less of the passage of time with others. </p><p> He was altogether mystified then when</p><p>Elizabeth suddenly lifted her head and said </p><p>coldly— </p><p> “You will never come back to Virginia.”</p><p> “Not while Sir William is governor.”</p><p> “Then I will never see you again.”</p><p> “I don’t know, Betsy. I never looked</p><p>that far ahead.” </p><p> “Dick,” and her tone softened, “won’t</p><p>you ever grow up?” </p><p> “Some time, when the fun of living begins</p><p>to grow less.” </p><p> She was silent for a moment and then</p><p>she arose. </p><p> “I suppose you are going on up the</p><p>river,” she said quietly. “I must leave now. </p><p>They will wonder where I am.” </p><p> “Yes, I must be going. The trainbands</p><p>will be on the trail soon and the forest will </p><p>be a bedlam with the bloodhounds turned </p><p>loose. Oh, they’ll press close to the Blue </p><p>Mountains and peer into every thicket </p><p>to find me. It’s going to be great sport, </p><p>beating them, covering the trail, doubling, </p><p>playing the fox, almost as much sport as </p><p>baiting Sir William himself. But I must </p><p>not give them too much time. Good-by, </p><p>little-” </p><p>Suddenly the girl stepped close and </p><p>grasped his arm, clung to him in a new terror. </p><p> “Dick!” she whispered. “It’s too late!</p><p> They’ve cut you off.”</p><p> He, too, had heard the sound of poimding</p><p> hoofs on the road less than a hundred yards</p><p> back from the river. Up and down every</p><p> highway, on every stream, the hunters</p><p> were spreading. Every plantation would</p><p> ^have the news before morning. Every</p><p> path, every river, every bit of cover, would</p><p> be watched, searched, guarded. Even the</p><p> Indians, with promises of rum to spur them</p><p> on, would search for his footprints. The</p><p> bloodhounds, eager after sniffing his cot</p><p> in the gaol, would scatter through the</p><p> swamps and woods.</p><p> “Egad!” whispered Dick. “They will</p><p> give me a run for it!”</p><p> “You can’t go!” Elizabeth protested.</p><p> “It is too late. You are cut off on the river</p><p> and on the land. They are arousing your</p><p> own father’s house even now. Listen,</p><p> Dick! There is only one way. The cabin</p><p> we built when we were children, back of</p><p> the tobacco sheds. It is still there in the</p><p> pines, with its little attic which you ar-</p><p> ranged for me to hide in when we played</p><p> Indian massacre. No one ever goes near it,</p><p> or thinks of it. Wait here a few moments.</p><p> Then go there. I’ll see that you get food</p><p> and water every day.”</p><p> “No, no, Betsy!” he protested. “I can’t</p><p> hide behind a woman’s skirts. I’ve started</p><p> this— Betsy!”</p><p> He sprang forward but it was too late.</p><p> The girl had jumped down the bank and</p><p> with one thrust of her strong young arms</p><p> had sent his light canoe far out into the</p><p> current.</p><p> “It was the only way, Dick,” she panted</p><p> as she turned to face him. “It was sure</p><p> death to go on by water or by land.</p><p> They will never consider to look for you</p><p> so near Jamestown. If they see that canoe</p><p> they’ll only think you took to the forest</p><p> farther up the river. In two weeks the</p><p> search will be abandoned and you can get</p><p> to the Blue Mountains in perfect safety.”</p><p> He was silent, for he knew that she spoke</p><p> the truth, but when he did attempt to speak</p><p> she interrupted.</p><p> “I’ll see that food and water are carried</p><p> to you daily, Dick. And when I know the</p><p> search has been given up I’ll send you a</p><p> musket and powder and ball. That will</p><p> be the signal that all is well, that you may</p><p> go. Now I say good-by.”</p><p> Choking back the tears, striving to keep</p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>65 </p><p>her voice steady, she held out her hand. </p><p>He dropped to one knee and pressed it to his </p><p>lips. </p><p> “You’re a jewel, little Betsykins,” he</p><p>whispered. “If you had only been a boy!” </p><p> “Oh,” she cried, as though in sudden</p><p>pain. </p><p> With an effort she regained control of</p><p>herself and when she did speak again it </p><p>was gently, almost compassionately. </p><p> “Good-by, Dick,” she said. “I am</p><p>going to ask only one thing before you go, </p><p>for I won’t see you again. Please remember </p><p>that, no matter where you go or what you </p><p>do, no matter what you may now think </p><p>you believe or care about, that always, </p><p>always, Dick, I will have faith that you will </p><p>never forget that you are the son of a </p><p>gentleman or that you are at heart a </p><p>gentleman yourself.” </p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p>BEYOND THE BLUE MOUNTAINS </p><p>'C'OR more than a league Dick Jeffreys </p><p>-T had been pushing straight north </p><p>through the sand. His feet slipped back- </p><p>ward with each step and their soles were </p><p>blistered from the heat of the open places </p><p>where the sun beat down with all its August </p><p>intensity. His way led through scattered </p><p>patches of scrub oak, sometimes hardly high </p><p>enough to afford shelter, and across blister- </p><p>ing bare spots where no plant could find </p><p>nourishment. </p><p> “It’s worse than the sands along the</p><p>shore of Virginia and the Carolinas,” he </p><p>panted. “And I’ve heard that the Span- </p><p>iards’ country is like this and that it is easy </p><p>to die of the thirst there.” </p><p> He stopped suddenly and dropped the</p><p>butt of his musket to the ground. It was </p><p>not a halt of fear lest he had wandered into </p><p>the Spanish possessions with their attendant </p><p>dangers of death by thirst or at the hands of </p><p>Mexico’s conquerors, for Dick’s shoulders </p><p>shook and his face was contorted by his </p><p>efforts to suppress his laughter. Since</p><p>April he had not dared even sneeze. Hun- </p><p>dreds of leagues through an unknown land, </p><p>four months of dodging strange savages, </p><p>escapes innumerable, had given him a cau- </p><p>tion he had not believed possible. </p><p> “If I had done it!” he whispered when at</p><p>last he had mastered his mirth. “If, after </p><p>baiting Sir William in his own den and then </p><p>5 </p><p>telling him he could look for me at the </p><p>South Sea if he wanted to speak with me, </p><p>though I had intended to strike in the oppo- </p><p>site direction for the land of the French; if, </p><p>after his offer of my life an I would find the </p><p>land of gold for his king, and my laughing at </p><p>his offer, if, after all that, I should run west </p><p>from these devilish Conestogas and be </p><p>chased farther west by the still more devil- </p><p>ish Eries, and then west and north again by </p><p>savages who did not even permit me to stop </p><p>and ask their names-” </p><p> He stopped, again a victim of his desire to</p><p>laugh, and the tears were in his eyes when at </p><p>last he lifted his musket and started on </p><p>through the hot sand. </p><p> “If, after all that,” he whispered to him-</p><p>self, “I should blunder into this South Sea, </p><p>this Red Sea, this Gulf of California, </p><p>wouldn’t it be a joke on Sir William?” </p><p> He plunged and slipped through the sand</p><p>and brush, unmindful of the labor of travel </p><p>and of the heat in his new-found amusement. </p><p> “Wouldn’t it be a joke on Sir William and</p><p>his king,” he continued in a whisper, for a </p><p>man can not spend four months alone in the </p><p>wilderness without sometimes voicing his </p><p>thoughts aloud, “if I should find this fabled </p><p>sea and its gold and its rubies when I can’t </p><p>go back to tell them of it for fear they’ll </p><p>hang me. They’d rather have their pre- </p><p>cious notions of divine right and the like </p><p>unbattered than all the wealth of the Indies. </p><p> “Oh, well! They need not trouble them-</p><p>selves. If I keep on far enough and long </p><p>enough, and the savages are not too per- </p><p>sistent, I’ll arrive in the land of the French </p><p>somehow, and then heigh-ho! A long life </p><p>and a merry one, a free land and a kingless </p><p>one! By Winter I’ll be in my future home.” </p><p> The character of the country had changed</p><p>suddenly as he talked to himself. His eyes </p><p>were always moving, up and down, to this </p><p>side and that, never missing a depression </p><p>of the sand or the possibilities of a particu- </p><p>larly dense thicket, the shaking of a bit of </p><p>grass or the blue of the sky unmarred by a </p><p>whiff of smoke. These precautions were </p><p>second nature, as automatic and as neces- </p><p>sary to his continued existence as his res- </p><p>piration and the beating of his heart. </p><p> Consciously, however, he had not seen</p><p>the opening ahead, the sudden termination </p><p>of the scrub oak and other small growth, </p><p>until he found himself at the base of a hill of </p><p>sand. It rolled upward gently, its surface </p><p>wrinkled by waves like those on a small </p><p>66 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>lake beneath a gentle breeze. There was </p><p>no vegetation, nothing except sand. </p><p> After a hasty survey of the country to the</p><p>right and left, Dick started up the long </p><p>slope. From its crest he found a higher hill </p><p>of sand beyond, and all about him the sun </p><p>beat down in scorching fury, while from the </p><p>ground a heat almost as intense arose. </p><p> From the second hill there was nothing</p><p>to be seen except an ocean of rolling sand, </p><p>sand, hill after hill, valley after valley, and </p><p>all bare as water itself. </p><p> “I’ll have one more look from that next</p><p>hill,” thought Dick aloud. “It’s higher, </p><p>and it may be that I can see to the end of it. </p><p>If not, I’ll turn back. I’m so dry now I’m </p><p>cracking, and there’s no chance for water </p><p>in such a desert.” </p><p> He climbed slowly to the top of the third</p><p>hill, for his musket and pack were heavy </p><p>and the heat was becoming unbearable. </p><p>As his feet slipped in the last few steps he </p><p>stopped suddenly and stared. </p><p> “Mon Dicu, as Monsieur Crapaud would</p><p>say were he in my place!” exclaimed Dick. </p><p>“It is the sea, the South Sea, the Gulf of </p><p>California! I started out to find the French </p><p>and I have found the Spanish. It’s back </p><p>I’ll have to turn, for I’d rather risk the pine </p><p>splinters of the savages than the work of </p><p>those Spanish devils.” </p><p> Before him, stretching to the horizon at</p><p>the north and as far as he could see to the </p><p>east and west, was a great sheet of blue </p><p>water. Between him and the shore the </p><p>sand sloped gradually to a huge crescent </p><p>beach. He could see along this rim of sand </p><p>for leagues in both directions, but nowhere, </p><p>either on land or on the sea, was there </p><p>evidence of human occupation. </p><p> “Spaniards or no Spaniards, I’m going to</p><p>say that I’ve been to the South Sea, though </p><p>why they should call it the Red Sea I fail to </p><p>understand. I never saw water more blue, </p><p>or more of it, even in the Western ocean, for </p><p>that matter. Here’s to say I’ve waded into </p><p>it.” </p><p> He was still half a mile from the water</p><p>and the sand slipped and burned his feet. </p><p>In the excitement of his discovery he had </p><p>forgotten his thirst for the moment, but </p><p>now, with so much water before him, it re- </p><p>turned redoubled. </p><p> “Egad, and I could drink it, salt and all!”</p><p>he muttered as he trudged slowly on. </p><p> A short distance from the beach Dick’s</p><p>automatic habits of observation became </p><p>active and his mind began to turn over the </p><p>messages brought to him. </p><p> “No surf though it is an open sea.”</p><p> “No tide marks.”</p><p> “No smell like that the sea is never</p><p>without.” </p><p> He stopped at the water’s edge.</p><p> “That’s strange,” he muttered.</p><p> Then he suddenly lifted his musket above</p><p>his head and strode into the shallow water, </p><p>which lay without movement, as if prostra- </p><p>ted by the heat. </p><p> “In the name of Charles the Second, King</p><p>of England, I claim this sea and all the land </p><p>bordering thereon!” he cried. “There! </p><p>I’ve settled accounts with Sir William. </p><p>His desire is quenched. Now I must </p><p>quench my thirst.” </p><p>HE LAUGHED aloud for, though </p><p>his parched throat made of the ef- </p><p>fort little more than a cackle, there </p><p>was no one to overhear, no savage to bring </p><p>his tribe upon him. Suddenly he stopped </p><p>and looked at the water between his feet. </p><p>Then he stooped, cupj&gt;ed his hand and </p><p>brought it dripping to his Ups. </p><p> “Sweet!” he cried. “Sweet as any nectar,</p><p>though if I had eggs here I could boil them </p><p>in it. This water is as warm as that of the </p><p>James, though it is clear and pure.” </p><p> He rinsed out his mouth several times, let</p><p>a little trickle down his throat and at last </p><p>began to drink slowly from his cupped </p><p>hands. </p><p> “No Red Sea or Gulf of California is this,”</p><p>he said when he was satisfied and had risen </p><p>to look about him. “It is one of the great </p><p>lakes they told me of on the St. Lawrence, </p><p>though which one I don’t know how I’m to </p><p>learn. But anyhow it is the land of the </p><p>French. Their traders have seen all five of </p><p>them and even now will be arriving with </p><p>their goods. I have only to follow the </p><p>shores until I find traces of them, and if I </p><p>do meet savages I need not fear. They’ll </p><p>never know me from a Frenchman.” </p><p> The conviction that he had reached one</p><p>of the five great lakes of which the French </p><p>had told him, that he was at last in the land </p><p>he had sought when he had slipped out of </p><p>Virginia four months before, served to re- </p><p>vive him as much as the water. He looked </p><p>toward the east and then the west and could </p><p>see no difference in the great, curving beach. </p><p> “One way is as good as another,” he said.</p><p>“I’m as sure of finding a Frenchman on the </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>67 </p><p>left as the right, and so long as I’ve been </p><p>traveling west and north I’ll keep on.” </p><p> He turned to the left and started along</p><p>the hard sand close to the water. It was a </p><p>little damp and consequently not so hot as </p><p>the desert through which he had toiled in </p><p>the morning. The nearness of the water, </p><p>too, was a comfort, while the fact that he </p><p>was a fair sight for any eyes within miles </p><p>did not concern him. He believed he was </p><p>in a land where the savages were friendly </p><p>to the only white men they knew, the </p><p>French, and if he did encounter one he could </p><p>obtain some information as to the rendez- </p><p>vous of the traders. </p><p> Though Dick walked steadily all after-</p><p>noon he failed to find any traces of savages </p><p>or French. He did come to the end of the </p><p>sand but only to find a low, swampy country </p><p>with great stretches of coarse grass, willows </p><p>bordering the shore and the whole apparent- </p><p>ly as lifeless as the dry desert he had </p><p>crossed. At sunset he reached what ap- </p><p>peared to be a small island in the swamp, a </p><p>higher bit of ground with elms and oaks </p><p>upon it and, best of all, a mother grouse </p><p>with a flock seeking a nesting-place for the </p><p>night in the branches of an oak. </p><p> Dick waited patiently until dusk and then</p><p>swung himself up and began to whack at the </p><p>stupid birds with a light stick. He knocked </p><p>down six of the eight and was assured of </p><p>supper and breakfast. When the sun came </p><p>out of the sea in the morning he was ready </p><p>for the day’s march, and so certain was he </p><p>that he had reached the land of the French </p><p>and friendly savages he started along the </p><p>shore with a light heart and lips parted in </p><p>song. </p><p> His course had been bending more and</p><p>more until by mid-forenoon he was going </p><p>almost straight north. The low, swampy </p><p>country continued, but farther up the coast </p><p>he saw the beginning of higher ground and </p><p>beyond that high bluffs that rose from the </p><p>water. At noon, while still in the marsh, </p><p>further progress was arrested by a river. </p><p>It was too deep to ford, and there was noth- </p><p>ing at hand with which to build a raft to </p><p>float across his few possessions. While he </p><p>stood there, undecided as to his course, a</p><p>birchbark canoe swept around the bend </p><p>above him. In it were three white </p><p>men. </p><p> A smile of contentment 011 his face, for</p><p>the end of his four hazardous months had </p><p>come, Dick stood leaning on his musket, </p><p>awaiting the strangers. That they were </p><p>Frenchmen he did not doubt. Men of no </p><p>other race had ever penetrated so far to the </p><p>westward. Even at that distance he could </p><p>distinguish their gray homespun clothing, </p><p>the bright sashes without which no coureurs </p><p>de bois ever went into the wilderness, and </p><p>their peculiar “pudding-bag” caps. </p><p> That they would be friendly Dick was</p><p>equally confident. Most of them, he knew, </p><p>were outlaws like himself, men who had </p><p>preceded even the Jesuits into the far </p><p>places along the shores of the Great Lakes, </p><p>men who traded with the savages'without </p><p>that necessary permit from the king of </p><p>France. Recognizing no superiors, no laws, </p><p>no right save that of might and their own </p><p>inclinations, daring the unknown wilder- </p><p>ness and the equally unknown temper of its </p><p>savage inhabitants, their lives in tune with </p><p>the wild rapids of the rivers, the fierce </p><p>storms of the lakes and the fiercer natures </p><p>of the natives, they appeared to Dick </p><p>Jeffreys in all the romantic coloring with </p><p>which his imagination had clothed them. </p><p>He need only tell them, he knew, that he, </p><p>too, was an outlaw, a fugitive from the </p><p>wrath and stifling influence of kings, and </p><p>they would accept him. </p><p> As he stood there the canoe came straight</p><p>down the center of the river. The three </p><p>men had seen him as quickly as he had seen </p><p>them, but had not missed a stroke of their </p><p>paddles, nor had they in any way indicated </p><p>that they considered his presence unac- </p><p>countable. </p><p> When they were fifty paces away Dick</p><p>lifted his right hand and called—“Bon </p><p>jour.}&gt; </p><p> “Bon jour, bon jour,” came a friendly</p><p>answer from the men in the bow and the </p><p>middle. </p><p> The stern paddler remained silent.</p><p> Dick’s mother had received a good educa-</p><p>tion in England before she had married </p><p>Captain Jeffreys and sailed for Virginia. </p><p>One of the tilings she had insisted upon </p><p>Dick learning in his early boyhood was the </p><p>French language, and his year in New </p><p>France had served to perfect him in the </p><p>tongue. </p><p> “Wait, comrades,” he called. “Give me</p><p>a moment of your time that I may know </p><p>whether I am at the Gulf of California, the </p><p>Eastern ocean or only on one of the five big </p><p>ponds of the king of France.” </p><p> The two men in the bow of the canoe</p><p>68 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>laughed outright, but the one in the stern </p><p>demanded suspiciously- </p><p> “Who are you?”</p><p> “I,” replied Dick readily, “am like your-</p><p>self, a rover of the forests, a man without a </p><p>king, without a home and without a care, </p><p>and with the one desire—a glass of brandy, </p><p>a comrade with whom to drink it and never </p><p>a ‘blackrobe’ to repress my enjoyment of </p><p>either.” </p><p> “A coureur de bois like the rest of us!”</p><p>cried the bowman as he dug the water with </p><p>his paddle and pulled the canoe nearer </p><p>shore. </p><p> “An Englishman with too ready a</p><p>tongue!” retorted the stern paddler as he </p><p>pulled the craft the other way. “Let us be </p><p>on to the nets.” </p><p> “Come, come, Basile,” objected the man</p><p>in the bow. “Only yesterday you were </p><p>saying that there should be four of us, that </p><p>we have too much for three since Gabriel </p><p>found that brandy would not float him in </p><p>the last rapids of the Mattawan. We still </p><p>have far to go and are in need of a strong </p><p>back and another paddle. Another musket, </p><p>too, for that matter. Come, friend, get </p><p>into the canoe and we’ll lift the nets and </p><p>then talk it over.” </p><p> He had been pulling the craft closer to</p><p>shore and the bow touched the bank at </p><p>Dick’s feet. </p><p> “Of course, there is no harm in talking of</p><p>it,” agreed the Virginian. </p><p> “We want men of our own blood in this,</p><p>men we know,” growled the one addressed </p><p>as Basile. </p><p> “We know he is a man or he wouldn’t be</p><p>here with a million savages between him </p><p>and his settlement, and we care not of his </p><p>blood so that we are sure of the heart that' </p><p>pumps it!” cried the bowman. “Get in, </p><p>friend.” </p><p> Basile remained silent, though there was</p><p>an ugly look on his face. Dick glanced at</p><p>him, smiled good-naturedly, and stepped </p><p>into the canoe. </p><p> They did not speak as they shot down the</p><p>river under the impetus of four paddles. </p><p>Dick knew that here was his first opportu- </p><p>nity to prove himself, and his spruce blade </p><p>bent with the force of his arms. </p><p> “Enough!” cried Basile at last, and with</p><p>a swirl of water they brought up at a stick </p><p>floating at the mouth of the river. The net </p><p>was quickly overhauled and two score of </p><p>fish taken. Then, their paddles snapping </p><p>briskly, they turned up-stream. The two </p><p>men in the forepart of the canoe broke into </p><p>a voyageurs’ song, obscene and blasphe- </p><p>mous but with an air that quickened the </p><p>paddle strokes and seemed of its own buoy- </p><p>ancy to lift the light craft from the water. </p><p>Dick’s body tingled with the thrill of it, </p><p>swayed to its rhythm, and when they broke </p><p>into the chorus the second time he joined </p><p>them joyously. </p><p> “Silence!” whispered Basile fiercely as</p><p>they rounded a bend. “There’s some one </p><p>at the cabine.” </p><p> Quietly now, but as swiftly, they went on</p><p>between the low, marshy banks. Another </p><p>bend and they saw the river fork. On a </p><p>bit of high ground between the two streams </p><p>a white tent gleamed against the willows. </p><p>Gliding in and out of the door, shrieking as </p><p>they bore casks and bales of goods down to </p><p>their waiting canoes, were a dozen savages. </p><p> “Those thieving Miamis!” cried Basile</p><p>“At them!” </p><p>PADDLING fiercely, swearing con- </p><p>tinuously, searing oaths which Dick </p><p>had never heard before, the three </p><p>coureurs de bois shot their craft straight </p><p>toward the Indians. Dick, silent but with </p><p>leaping heart at this chance of a fray, bent </p><p>his back as effectively as the others. </p><p> The canoe did not slacken speed as it</p><p>approached the bank. One of the savages, </p><p>in the act of shakily lifting a gourd to his lips </p><p>saw the white men and shrieked a warning. </p><p>At the same instant the canoe struck and its </p><p>occupants, rising to their feet with the last </p><p>stroke, landed with an impetus that carried </p><p>them, muskets swinging about their heads,</p><p>to the door of the tent. </p><p> The savages had taken advantage of the</p><p>hour’s absence of the Frenchmen and, </p><p>though their brains were inflamed by the </p><p>liquid fire they had consumed, they were </p><p>not able to convert their blood-thirsty de- </p><p>sires into action. They swayed and tot- </p><p>tered as they gathered to meet the attack </p><p>and half of them went down in the first </p><p>rush. Three of these were on their feet </p><p>instantly, however, and when the four </p><p>white men faced about in front of their </p><p>tent they were met by a compact group of </p><p>gleaming brown bodies, flashing knives </p><p>and swinging hatchets. </p><p> Dick, his musket whirling like a flail, did</p><p>not wait for the attack but sprang forward </p><p>with an answering yell. Two savages </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>69 </p><p>went down before him, but the impetus of the </p><p>heavy weapon carried him into the center of </p><p>the group, and a knife slit open his buckskin </p><p>shirt and gashed his shoulder. Still he kept </p><p>his musket swinging, with the result that </p><p>the group was divided and the three </p><p>Frenchmen, charging together, swept one- </p><p>half before them into the river. </p><p> Back they came to join Dick, who faced</p><p>the remainder. The savages wavered and </p><p>then broke for their canoes. </p><p> “Get the goods!” cried Basile as he dashed</p><p>after them. “Unload the canoes first!” </p><p> They pursued the fleeing party so closely</p><p>there was no time for embarking, and as the </p><p>Indians did not return to the attack, the </p><p>white men unloaded the canoes and piled </p><p>the casks and bales of goods upon the bank. </p><p> In the meantime the five savages who</p><p>had been forced into the river had struggled </p><p>back to shore, all the fight gone out of them. </p><p>They held up their hands in token of sur- </p><p>render and Basile nodded toward the ca- </p><p>noes. The men filed past, lifted their craft </p><p>into the water and stepped in. </p><p> Basile began to speak quickly, sharply,</p><p>In Miami, a tongue not unlike some Dick </p><p>had known to the east. The Indians who </p><p>had retreated up the river bank returned </p><p>and deposited their weapons in the canoes. </p><p>The six of them filed past the tent to where </p><p>three of their comrades lay upon the ground. </p><p>Without examining the bodies to see </p><p>whether life had fled, they carried them to </p><p>the canoes and dropped them in. The </p><p>next moment their three barks were shoot- </p><p>ing down the river. </p><p> “Eh, Basile?” cried one of the French-</p><p>men joyously. “What do you think now? </p><p>Is he not one of us? Oh, that was-a pretty </p><p>charge he made, straight through the thick </p><p>of them. Come! Shake his hand.” </p><p> Dick had recognized in Basile the leader</p><p>of the trio, and from the first the man’s </p><p>dislike had been evident. As he faced </p><p>him now, flushed from his exertions and by </p><p>the words of the Frenchman, he saw no </p><p>lessening in hostility. Rather it seemed</p><p>to be increased, though now only Basile’s </p><p>eyes gave expression to his feeling. The </p><p>man’s evil face even broke into a forced </p><p>smile as he held out his hand. </p><p> “You fought well and showed your</p><p>courage,” he said to Dick as he stepped </p><p>forward to meet him. “I hold no objection </p><p>to your being one of us, after we have had </p><p>time to hear your story. It is a strange </p><p>thing, an Englishman so far from his </p><p>colony. None has ever been here before. </p><p>But no doubt you can explain it.” </p><p> His tone was almost gracious, but as</p><p>Dick looked into his eyes he saw that the </p><p>words were empty, that he need not seek </p><p>friendship there. </p><p> “Leon! Michel!” Basile cried sharply as</p><p> he turned to the others. “Get down the</p><p> ^river quickly and lift the net. The savages</p><p> wall be back with the darkness, as soon as</p><p> the brandy soaks out of them. We must</p><p> be off this cursed Chicagon River and down</p><p> the Riviere Des Plaines before they can find</p><p> us.”</p><p> The impatience of his tone, the peevish</p><p> authority of it, gave Dick his first clew to</p><p> the reasons back of the man’s hostility.</p><p> He was the leader, not only because of the</p><p> happy, careless attitude of the other two</p><p> and their lack of initiative, but because of</p><p> his own superior mental qualifications.</p><p> And in the young Virginian he recognized a</p><p> rival, one not amenable to discipline. Dick</p><p> laughed outright and bowed to the French-</p><p> man.</p><p> “Have no anxiety, monsieur,” he said.</p><p>“I harbor no ambitions, no aspirations ex- </p><p>cept to enjoy life as I find it.” </p><p> “See that you have no others,” growled</p><p> Basile as he turned away.</p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>“one of us” </p><p>Dick Jeffreys was left alone with </p><p>Basile when Leon and Michel went </p><p>down the Chicagon River to the lake to re- </p><p>cover their net. The Frenchman.was busy </p><p>examining and arranging the goods with </p><p>which the Indians had attempted to run off,</p><p>and the Virginian with his shoulder. The </p><p>cut was only three inches long and little </p><p>more than through the skin. When he had </p><p>bathed and bound it the canoe had returned </p><p>and all four immediately began prepara- </p><p>tions for departure. </p><p> There was no time for Dick to ask ques-</p><p> tions as to the plans of the party. The</p><p> Miamis, three of whom they knew were</p><p> badly wounded if not dead, would be back</p><p> at night with a larger party, and the urgent</p><p> need was to get as far away as possible.</p><p> As to what part of the French country he</p><p> had reached, what the three coureurs de bois</p><p> intended to do, and the explanation of his</p><p>70 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> own presence in the country, all that could</p><p> wait until a less strenuous time.</p><p> The two canoes of the party were soon</p><p>loaded and Dick took the bow of one with </p><p>Michel in the stern. His shoulder was </p><p>irritated by the exertion of paddling but he </p><p>said nothing, and their craft, though heavily </p><p>loaded and propelled against the current, </p><p>did not lag behind the other. </p><p> They paddled all afternoon without</p><p>stopping and the sun had set when at last </p><p>they turned ashore. Dick saw a well- </p><p>beaten path leading from the landing-place </p><p>out across a low prairie. </p><p> “Here’s where the toil comes, friend!”</p><p>cried Michel as he arose stiffly from the </p><p>canoe. </p><p> The men began at once to unload.</p><p> “We have a long start and can carry</p><p>across to the Riviere des Plaines before they </p><p>come half-way from the lake, even should </p><p>they be on the right track,” said Basile. </p><p>“But we must lose no time.” </p><p> Then began the first of many trips. Be-</p><p>fore the second load was portaged night had </p><p>fallen, and through the darkness they toiled </p><p>back and forth, bearing canoes, bales of </p><p>goods and casks of brandy upon their </p><p>backs. It was after midnight when the </p><p>last article had been carried across, and </p><p>even then there was no rest. The two </p><p>canoes were loaded and turned down- </p><p>stream and until after sunrise they jour- </p><p>neyed on into the southwest. </p><p> “Ah, Basile!” cried Michel when the sun</p><p>was high. “We have left the country of the </p><p>Miamis and must be in that of the Islinois, </p><p>where the thieves dare not follow. Let us </p><p>go ashore and eat and sleep.” </p><p> Basile turned his canoe toward a good</p><p>camping-spot. They cooked a meal and </p><p>then all except Leon stretched out in the </p><p>shade of some willows. Later Michel was </p><p>wakened and stood guard, and at noon they </p><p>were again in the canoes. Until darkness </p><p>descended upon the river Basile did not per- </p><p>mit lagging, and then, after a hasty meal,</p><p>all four dropped asleep in the long grass on </p><p>the bank. </p><p> The sun had risen high enough to be un-</p><p>comfortable before they wakened in the </p><p>morning, and even then they only sought </p><p>shade and slept a little longer. Dick saw </p><p>that the Frenchmen did not fear possible </p><p>pursuit by the Miamis and that they were </p><p>in no huriy to go on. </p><p> He was glad of the opportunity not only</p><p>to rest but because they could now tell him </p><p>something of where he was, where they were </p><p>going and what they intended to do. He </p><p>was happy because he had reached the land </p><p>of the French, because he had joined a band </p><p>of the courcurs de bois, but his restless spirit </p><p>was not content with a mere following of </p><p>the life of these adventurers, and he had </p><p>chosen to construe Basile’s hostility as a </p><p>challenge to the leadership of these free </p><p>spirits of the wilderness. As he had noth- </p><p>ing to conceal and recognized the value of </p><p>frankness in cementing the friendship </p><p>which he knew he had gained with Leon </p><p>and Michel, he chose the indolent hours of </p><p>the forenoon to tell of himself. </p><p> “Friends,” he began, “my coming among</p><p>you has seemed strange, and it is as much to </p><p>me as to yourselves. I will begin at the </p><p>beginning and tell of myself all that you </p><p>could care to know. </p><p> “First, my name is Richard Jeffreys,</p><p>generally called Dick, which is the English </p><p>method of saying Richard if one of that </p><p>name be a close friend. My father is </p><p>Captain Jeffreys of the colony of Virginia, </p><p>in which I was born twenty-four years ago. </p><p>Had I followed precedent I would now be a </p><p>gay cavalier, riding a good horse from plan- </p><p>tation to plantation, dressed in silks and </p><p>satins and lace and gold, a sword at my side, </p><p>a dagger in my belt and never without a </p><p>quart of sack in my belly. I would have </p><p>had slaves and a chest of money, acres of </p><p>tobacco and possibly, in time, a seat in the </p><p>House of Burgesses. </p><p> “But you see I am not. Why? Because</p><p>in Virginia a man may let his body wander </p><p>at will between tavern and plantation, be- </p><p>tween bear-baiting and carousing, while he </p><p>must leave his mind at home under a lock </p><p>and key furnished by the king. He must</p><p>think as the king prescribes, swear only as </p><p>much as the king permits, go to church or </p><p>the gallows, and even on his own land plant </p><p>what the king decides. </p><p> “I chose to cramp my body within buck-</p><p>skin and let my mind wander, to think and </p><p>swear and live as I willed, and that is how </p><p>I am here.” </p><p> “And welcome you are!” exclaimed</p><p>Michel. “Without your swinging musket </p><p>there at the forks of the Chicagon we might </p><p>have been dead men. We’ll broach a keg </p><p>to your health and the success of all of us.” </p><p> “There appears to be much still to be ex-</p><p>plained,” growled Basile. “An Englishman </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>7i </p><p>in New France smells to me too much of a </p><p>spy.” </p><p> “Listen further,” replied Dick amiably,</p><p>and answering the leader’s hostile glance </p><p>with a smile. “I was about to explain </p><p>all.” </p><p> He told of his boyhood, how he had ac-</p><p>quired a desire for the forests rather than </p><p>the settlements through his early associa- </p><p>tion with the savages, of how he had gone </p><p>north through the land of the Delawares, </p><p>through the colony of the Dutch, the land of </p><p>the Mohicans and finally to the St. </p><p>Lawrence, where he had spent a Winter </p><p>with a trader licensed by the French king. </p><p>From tales he had heard there he had first </p><p>become enamored of the life of the coureurs </p><p>de bois in that great and little-known land </p><p>to the westward on the shores of the five </p><p>great lakes. </p><p> “And who was that trader?” asked Basile</p><p>sharply, and with a cunning smile for Leon </p><p>and Michel. </p><p> “His name was Simon Bouisson,” an-</p><p>swered Dick readily, “and he traded to the </p><p>westward of Quebec.” </p><p> “Simon Bouisson!” shouted Michel in</p><p>glee. “And how, friend, did this Mon- </p><p>sieur Bouisson appear?” </p><p> “I have never been in your Paris but I</p><p>imagine that the gargoyles on one of the </p><p>famous buildings are not at all unlike </p><p>Simon,” answered Dick. </p><p> Leon and Michel rolled upon the ground</p><p>in the excess of their mirth and even Basile </p><p>joined in the laughter. </p><p> “But,” he said, “you have still to explain</p><p>how you, from the colony of Virginia, could </p><p>reach the southern shore of the Lake of the </p><p>Islinois, or Lac Mecheygan, as some call it, </p><p>when the land of the Longhouses lies direct- </p><p>ly between. The Iroquois are not in the </p><p>habit of letting any one wander at will </p><p>through their domain.” </p><p>DICK began a complete account of </p><p>his interview with Sir William</p><p>Berkeley and his escape from the </p><p>gaol. Michel and Leon broke in several </p><p>times with their laughter and applause. </p><p>But Basile, as Dick gained favor with the </p><p>others, became more dour of expression. </p><p> Without a reference to Elizabeth Carver</p><p>and her part in his escape, the young </p><p>Virginian related how he had started north- </p><p>ward to gain the Delawares’ country, only </p><p>to be driven in his canoe up the Potomac </p><p>to escape a hostile band of Paspaheghs. He </p><p>was pursued far and at last took to the </p><p>woods in the Blue Mountains, to wander </p><p>westward until he came to a river which he </p><p>had seen before and which the savages </p><p>called the Monongahela. The chance dis- </p><p>covery of a canoe permitted him to descend </p><p>this stream for a long distance without en- </p><p>countering any one. </p><p> As this route took him north and straight</p><p>toward the Iroquois country, he began to </p><p>have misgivings, when the stream was </p><p>joined by another and the one current at </p><p>last set off toward the southwest, a stream </p><p>rapidly increasing in size and the most </p><p>beautiful he had ever seen. When Dick </p><p>described its lower reaches, and the savages </p><p>from whom he escaped, Michel broke in </p><p>with the explanation: </p><p> “That is the river the Iroquois call the</p><p>Ohio, which means something like broad and </p><p>beautiful. Farther west it is known to the </p><p>savages as the Ouabashe. One of the </p><p>king’s men from Montreal, named La </p><p>Salle, traveled on it a ways some seasons </p><p>ago. Had you kept on, if the reports of </p><p>the savages be true, you would have come </p><p>to the great water, the one the savages to </p><p>the west speak of as the Misisepe.” </p><p> “And I would have been there long ere</p><p>this had it not been for some red devils I </p><p>encountered. They saw me and gave </p><p>chase, and I turned into a big river that </p><p>flowed in from the north and went up it for </p><p>more than a hundred leagues. Then one </p><p>night some knaves who, from the dress, or </p><p>lack of it, must have been brothers to the </p><p>Miamis who attacked us on the Chicagon, </p><p>got between me and my canoe. I slipped </p><p>away in the night, working north, for I </p><p>knew the French were in that direction, </p><p>and at last came out on what you have </p><p>called Lac Mecheygan, only the day before</p><p>I saw you. I believed it was the sea, until </p><p>I tasted it.” </p><p> “And now what?” asked Basile sharply.</p><p>“As you have seen and as you have </p><p>heard,” replied Dick with a smile. “I can </p><p>not go back to the English colony. Death </p><p>is certain there. Since I spent a year in </p><p>New France I have wished to lead the life </p><p>of the coureurs de bois. It appeals to me. </p><p>Freedom of thought and action, of mind </p><p>and body! No law, no rulers! Risks but </p><p>no cares, a pleasant land and more pleasant </p><p>companions! Why are you yourself a </p><p>ranger of the forests. Monsieur Basile?” </p><p>72 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “But I am French, in the land of the</p><p>French.” </p><p> Dick turned to the others with a smile.</p><p>“Does the king of France claim this </p><p>land?” he asked. “Does he know it is here. </p><p>I am sure that you have never taken re- </p><p>ports to Montreal of what you know of it.” </p><p>“Ha, ha, Basile!” cried Michel. “He </p><p>scored there. We found this land beyond </p><p>the Lac Mecheygan and we do not intend </p><p>to give it to any king. Why should we rim </p><p>the risks for fat loafers in Europe? No! </p><p>Monsieur Dick is right, and he is one of us. </p><p>It makes no difference if he is English. He </p><p>has the soul of the forest-rangers, and that </p><p>is enough for us. Eh, Leon?” </p><p> “I care not if he be Dutch or Spanish</p><p>after the way he charged the Miamis,” </p><p>agreed Leon. “We started with four. We </p><p>will end with four. Let Monsieur Dick </p><p>have Gabriel’s share. He’ll earn it before </p><p>we are through.” </p><p> Basile’s face had become black as the</p><p>others spoke, but before he could voice his </p><p>protest Dick, who had been watching him </p><p>closely, interrupted. </p><p> “I will not permit such generosity,” he</p><p>declared. “It is not right and I do not </p><p>wish it. It is the life, not the profits, I </p><p>crave. Only let me continue with you, </p><p>sharing in the labor and the risks, and I am </p><p>content. Then, the next year, perhaps.” </p><p>“He is as fair and generous as he is brave!” </p><p>cried Michel. “Come, Basile! Iron out </p><p>your face. Monsieur Dick is to be one of </p><p>us.” </p><p> “One of us, always,” agreed Leon.</p><p> The days went by, wonderful days for</p><p>the Virginian. Never before had he seen </p><p>so fair a country. The river flowed gently </p><p>between prairie banks. Trees bordered </p><p>the stream and wandered in patches and </p><p>long lines out on to the plains. The sun </p><p>shone brightly, inviting indolence. The </p><p>breezes over the land were sweet and fresh. </p><p> Each day they dropped a little farther</p><p>down the stream. Before long they en- </p><p>tered a larger river, the river of the Islinois,</p><p>Dick was informed, though none of the </p><p>Frenchmen, and no white men before them, </p><p>had ever been so far. </p><p> They feasted as they went. Wild</p><p>turkeys were in the trees. Raspberries </p><p>were ripe, and the three Frenchmen showed </p><p>Dick how to dig and boil the prairie apple, </p><p>which tasted to the Virginian much like the </p><p>potato of the colonies. Deer grazed about </p><p>them in herds. Fish of many kinds were </p><p>plentiful in die water. They saw, too, for </p><p>the first time, the pisikous, the bceufs sau- </p><p>vage, or wild cattle. Dick had never heard </p><p>of these animals, though the other three had </p><p>known of the huge beasts through savage </p><p>reports, and their first encounter brought </p><p>consternation to all four. </p><p> No longer than domestic cattle but twice</p><p>the size, with great humps on their shoulders </p><p>and massive heads in which beady eyes </p><p>were set beneath black, curving horns and </p><p>in the midst of a wealth of brown, curling </p><p>hair, they roamed the plains in great herds. </p><p>Their size, their numbers, and the ferocious </p><p>appearance of the males, sent the four men </p><p>in terror to their canoes when first en- </p><p>countered. Later Leon killed one and after </p><p>they had tasted the tongue and the meat of </p><p>the hump, and bands of the animals were </p><p>seen every day, they were accepted as </p><p>merely one of the bounties of this un- </p><p>dreamed of land. </p><p>FROM the beginning Dick fell </p><p>easily into the indolent, careless, </p><p>untrammeled life of his companions. </p><p>For hours each day, and always in the eve- </p><p>ning, they lay in the shade or beside a fire </p><p>and told tales, experiences and adventures </p><p>in far, strange places, among stranger people </p><p>in wildernesses where no white men had </p><p>ever been before. History has given to </p><p>some men the distinction of being first in </p><p>various places, but in the land of the Great </p><p>Lakes and beyond, both to the west and </p><p>north, the coureurs de bois, seeking adven- </p><p>ture, freedom and opportunities for illicit </p><p>trade with the Indians, far outstripped the </p><p>emissaries of the king of France and the </p><p>courageous Jesuits. </p><p> Dick caught at once the significance of</p><p>these stories. It was well, among them- </p><p>selves, to tell of far places, but a whisper of </p><p>them on the St. Lawrence meant prison and</p><p>perhaps worse. He learned that Leon La </p><p>Gard, with one companion, had penetrated </p><p>the rich fur country to the north of Lac </p><p>Superior, the greatest and the most distant </p><p>of the great lakes; that Michel Charon had </p><p>gone west from the same lake until he had </p><p>passed the forest and come to a great plain; </p><p>that Basile Pombert had gone south from </p><p>Lac Mecheygan, past Uie Ouabashe, or the </p><p>Ohio of the Iroquois, until he had found </p><p>savages with muskets obtained from the </p><p>Spaniards of La Floride. </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>73 </p><p> “But this Red Sea, this Gulf of California,</p><p>this land of gold and precious stones, have </p><p>any of you seen it, or been near it?” asked </p><p>Dick, his imagination inflamed by the </p><p>stories. </p><p> “Who knows?” answered Leon with a</p><p>shrug of his shoulders. “Perhaps this very </p><p>river of the Islinois enters it. Perhaps to- </p><p>morrow we will be floating upon salt water. </p><p>Along the western shore of Lac Mecheygan, </p><p>all along the shores of Lac Superior, always </p><p>the savages speak of the Misisepe, the </p><p>Michisepe, ‘the great water,’ as the Algon- </p><p>quin tongue expresses it, a land of strange </p><p>people, of huge monsters and fiery demons. </p><p> “I have never known any who have been</p><p>to it, though some have informed me that </p><p>they have been told that its waters are salt. </p><p>Once, south of Lac Superior, when among </p><p>the Outaouacs and the Hurons, who were </p><p>pursued there by the Iroquois, on a river </p><p>they called Le Noir, or the Black, I was </p><p>told that if I kept on down-stream I would </p><p>come to the Misisepe. I would have gone, </p><p>but it was late in the season.” </p><p> “There is a ‘blackrobe’ even now at</p><p>Michilimakinac called Marquette,” said </p><p>Michel, “who plans to go to this Misisepe. </p><p>We stopped there on our way to the Chica- </p><p>gon River and he asked us many questions </p><p>about where we had been and what we have </p><p>heard of the place. He has an idea it is a </p><p>river, from what he told us, and that it flows </p><p>into the Gulf of California. Even now he </p><p>awaits orders from his superior to go to look </p><p>for the ‘great water’ next year, and he ex- </p><p>pects the governor of New France to send a </p><p>man to accompany him. Then they’ll </p><p>claim it for the king.” </p><p> “And you, who have been farther than</p><p>the others, you and the other coureurs de </p><p>bois, have you never claimed what you </p><p>have found?” asked Dick. “From the Lac </p><p>Mecheygan and Lac Superior westward, it </p><p>is any man’s land, any king’s, open to the </p><p>first who sees and claims it!” </p><p> “We claim it for our own, for what that</p><p>claim be worth,” answered Michel. “Why </p><p>should we take it for a king? The king’s </p><p>men, and the king’s laws, would come in and</p><p>drive us out for our pains. There is enough </p><p>land to the east for the fawners, for the men. </p><p>with king’s licenses and favors, for the faint- </p><p>hearts who dare not go beyond the sight of a </p><p>plowed field or sound of church bells, for </p><p>those who fear they might die unshriven. </p><p>This land is for us who dare come to it, and </p><p>it will remain ours if we can keep the ‘black- </p><p>robes’ and others back. This Marquette </p><p>learned nothing from us that will be to his </p><p>advantage, and if we can first see some of </p><p>the savages on his route we may keep him </p><p>out altogether. </p><p> “No, Monsieur Dick. Remember that</p><p>you are to forget all that you see and hear. </p><p>A discreet tongue is the sign of the coureurs </p><p>de bois.” </p><p> “He has already shown that his tongue is</p><p>loose,” interrupted Basile fiercely. “I have </p><p>known from the first that there was no good </p><p>in an Englishman coming into this land. </p><p>An Englishman is too greedy to seek only </p><p>adventure. His knees are too weak from </p><p>bending to a throne to carry him so far into </p><p>savage country merely to gain freedom. </p><p>Leon! Michel! Did you not see his eyes </p><p>gleam when he asked of the Red Sea and its </p><p>gold and rubies? Did you not catch the </p><p>tone of his voice when he wanted to know if </p><p>this land of ours has been taken in the name </p><p>of a king? </p><p> “I tell you, this Monsieur Dick is an</p><p>English spy, a man who came into our </p><p>country to take it for his own king. There </p><p>was talk of it, and fear of it, when we were </p><p>on the St. Lawrence this Spring. Now we </p><p>know it.” </p><p> As Basile spoke he had risen to his feet.</p><p>His rage choked him toward the end and at </p><p>last, his eyes gleaming evilly, he drew a </p><p>knife and rushed at Dick, who still lay upon </p><p>the ground. </p><p> Basile was thick, heavy, much older than</p><p>the Virginian, and he had used a knife be- </p><p>fore. Despite his rage, his attack was not </p><p>without planning. Dick, seeing him come, </p><p>would attempt to rise to defend himself. </p><p>In that defenseless position the knife would </p><p>descend. </p><p> But Dick only pretended to rise. In-</p><p>stead he rolled into a ball and flung himself</p><p>at Basile’s feet. As the Frenchman </p><p>sprawled headlong he himself sprang up and </p><p>after him. </p><p> They had been lying at the edge of a bank</p><p>six-feet high, a deep pool directly beneath </p><p>them. Basile’s fall had carried him close </p><p>to the brink and Dick, with a push of his </p><p>foot, sent him flying out into the water. </p><p> Leon and Michel had taken no part in the</p><p>affair but now, as Dick stood there laughing </p><p>at the antics of Basile as he rose to the sur- </p><p>face, they suddenly sprang to their feet. </p><p> “The savages!” they cried in a low tone</p><p>74 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>together. “See! Over the river. The </p><p>Islinois we have been seeking.” </p><p> Dick looked across the stream. On the</p><p>farther bank, standing in the shade of some </p><p>willows, were two score or more of Indians. </p><p>CHAPTER V </p><p>THE ISLINOIS </p><p>LEON LA GARD ran at once to Dick’s </p><p>J side. </p><p> “No more fighting,” he whispered. “Pre-</p><p>tend it was only merriment.” </p><p> He bent over the bank, up which Basile</p><p>Pombert, his knife still in his hand, was </p><p>climbing to return to the attack. </p><p> “Fool!” Leon hissed. “Look across the</p><p>river. We have reached the Islinois. They </p><p>are watching us. Climb the bank and pre- </p><p>tend you were only having sport with </p><p>Monsieur Dick.” </p><p> Basile turned and saw the Indians for the</p><p>first time. Instantly his rage vanished and </p><p>the angry glint in his eyes was succeeded by </p><p>a covetous gleam that, to Dick, was even </p><p>more sinister than the frank hatred to which </p><p>he had become accustomed. </p><p> “Your hand, Dick!” he cried suddenly.</p><p>“Help me up, and laugh, all of you. Michel! </p><p>Come and join us! All of you! Clasp </p><p>hands and circle ’round. They’ll think it is </p><p>a dance to end our sport.” </p><p> Laughing uproariously, kicking their</p><p>heels as they spun about, the four joined </p><p>hands and whirled madly for a moment. </p><p>Then they swung into line and faced the </p><p>Indians across the stream. </p><p> “The calumet, Michel,” whispered Basile,</p><p>and Michel went to a pack and took out a </p><p>long-stemmed pipe which he filled with </p><p>tobacco. </p><p> “Now,” directed Basile, “you and Dick</p><p>get into a canoe and take it to their chief to </p><p>smoke. Then bring him and one or two </p><p>others back. Their tongue is much like</p><p>that of the other savages we know and you </p><p>can speak with them.” </p><p> Michel directed Dick into the stern of the</p><p>canoe and himself stood in the bow, bearing </p><p>the pipe aloft. The Frenchmen seemed to </p><p>have no fear whatever of this strange peo- </p><p>ple who undoubtedly had never seen white </p><p>men, and the Virginian, accepting their be- </p><p>lief in the friendliness of the natives, pad- </p><p>died vigorously toward the opposite shore. </p><p>As they approached, Michel holding the </p><p>mouth-piece of the pipe toward the savages, </p><p>one of them detached himself from the group </p><p>beneath the trees and stepped toward the </p><p>bank. Straight, tall, naked except for a </p><p>few ornaments, his brown skin gleaming in </p><p>the sunshine, his face expressionless, the </p><p>chief stood there in all the dignity with </p><p>which the Indian was once able to en- </p><p>shroud himself. </p><p> The bow of the canoe touched the bank</p><p>and Michel stepped out. With flint and </p><p>steel he deftly lighted the tobacco in the </p><p>stone bowl as the chief placed his lips to the </p><p>mouth-piece and puffed. Michel smoked. </p><p>Others came forward and the pipe went the </p><p>rounds. </p><p> Not a word was spoken, not even a whis-</p><p>per was heard in the closely packed group of </p><p>Indians. When Dick and Michel looked at </p><p>them they seemed to be at ease, uncon- </p><p>cerned, but their curiosity could not be en- </p><p>tirely hidden and several times the Vir- </p><p>ginian, on turning quickly, surprised stares </p><p>of amazement. </p><p> The ceremony of the pipe completed,</p><p>Michel indicated to the leader that he was </p><p>to enter the canoe and cross the river. He </p><p>did so without hesitation and in a few </p><p>minutes was being courteously welcomed </p><p>by Basile and Leon. </p><p> It was with difficulty that Dick repressed</p><p>his excitement. It had been his hope, upon </p><p>leaving Virginia, that he could work north </p><p>to the St. Lawrence and enter the fur trade. </p><p>In time he hoped to become one of the </p><p>coureurs de bois, to penetrate that amazing </p><p>country to the west of which such strange </p><p>stories were heard, to go on with some ad- </p><p>venturous companions into new lands, </p><p>among new people, to be the first some- </p><p>where.</p><p> Now, as a result of his misfortunes of the</p><p>Spring and early Summer,, he had been </p><p>driven far to the west, only to encounter at </p><p>once the very men he had sought and in the </p><p>first weeks to be, with them, the first white </p><p>men in a new wilderness, the first to see </p><p>these nations that possessed a land so fer- </p><p>tile and abundant in all that one could wish. </p><p> He looked forward eagerly to the out-</p><p>come of the present ceremonies which, he </p><p>knew, so delighted the savage heart, to the </p><p>establishment of friendly relations with </p><p>these people and the development of a pros- </p><p>perous trade. As for his trouble with </p><p>Basile, he gave it little thought. He knew </p><p>that the Frenchman, because of cleverness </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>75 </p><p>and love of power, had won to leadership </p><p>over the careless, easy-going Leon and </p><p>Michel. Dick himself had been a favorite </p><p>with these two from the beginning and a </p><p>certain aggressiveness and confidence had </p><p>aroused in Basile the fear of a rival. </p><p> It was this that lay at the bottom of the</p><p>Frenchman’s charges of spying, that had </p><p>prompted his attack that morning. Dick </p><p>in no way feared Basile. Settlement of the </p><p>question of supremacy between the two was </p><p>inevitable and its hazards were part of the </p><p>life he sought. If Basile, fired by hatred, </p><p>could let the matter drop in the presence of </p><p>the real business of the party, Dick could do </p><p>as well. Accordingly he turned his whole </p><p>attention to the ceremonies now being en- </p><p>acted. </p><p> First Basile made the chief a present of a</p><p>steel knife, exhibiting its keenness and hard- </p><p>ness. The savage’s eyes glowed with pleas- </p><p>ure and continually he tried the edge with </p><p>his thumb, laughing outright when too much </p><p>pressure caused a deep gash. </p><p> Then he was given a hatchet, the blade</p><p>of which was as sharp as that of the knife. </p><p>Basile, who had quickly taken note of the </p><p>stone-tipped arrows, stone knives and horn- </p><p>pronged war club of the chief, made the </p><p>most of the superiority of die steel. </p><p> While the presents were being tested and</p><p>admired Dick glanced across the river to dis- </p><p>cover that every savage had disappeared. </p><p>As he searched the bank, expecting some </p><p>ruse and realizing their helpless position </p><p>should the Indians become hostile, he </p><p>learned the reason. Down-stream and </p><p>moving across the plain toward the river </p><p>like a cloud shadow, only darker, and mak- </p><p>ing a noise like distant thunder, was a great </p><p>herd of bteufs sauvage. </p><p> “Basile!” cried Dick as he picked up his</p><p>musket. “See. I’ll now show them what </p><p>powder can do!” </p><p> He leaped down the bank, pushed off the</p><p>canoe and paddled quickly toward the ap- </p><p>proaching herd. In midstream he caught </p><p>sight of some of the band hiding behind a </p><p>fringe of willows at a point near which the</p><p>buffalo would reach the river. He landed </p><p>and joined them, his musket ready. </p><p> The Islinois, arrows ready, bows half-</p><p>drawn, were intent upon the game until the </p><p>white man strode in among them. At first </p><p>his coming caused some resentment but </p><p>Dick’s confident, expectant attitude, his </p><p>calm assurance and manner of holding what </p><p>they knew must be some sort of weapon, </p><p>aroused curiosity, almost forgetfulness of </p><p>the game. They gathered near him, looked </p><p>at his hair, his skin, his eyes and, not with- </p><p>out amusement, at his weapon, if weapon it </p><p>could be. Then one of them gave a low hiss </p><p>and all turned to see the edge of the herd </p><p>sweeping close to the shelter. </p><p> Immediately Dick stepped out. Not an</p><p>Indian followed, nor was an arrow loosened. </p><p>All gazed in wonder at this hunter who so </p><p>exposed himself, who stood as if looking at </p><p>the game in idle curiosity. As they </p><p>watched, the Virginian suddenly lifted the </p><p>musket to his shoulder. A roar followed. </p><p>Smoke rolled forth in a cloud. When it </p><p>lifted a monster bull lay on the ground, </p><p>kicking in his death agony. </p><p> With a bow to the hunters and a magnan-</p><p>imous wave of his hand toward the quarry, </p><p>Dick walked back toward his canoe and </p><p>paddled across the stream. </p><p> “Bravo!” cried Michel as he landed. “A</p><p>master stroke, Monsieur Dick! We could </p><p>see you plainly and you should have been </p><p>here to watch the chief’s face. He had no </p><p>more than grasped what you had done than </p><p>we presented him with a musket and he has </p><p>invited us down to the village. It’s only </p><p>two leagues down the stream and we start at </p><p>once. Mon Dieul What a haul we will </p><p>make. We haven’t broached a cask. And </p><p>when we do!” </p><p> Trying vainly to repress his emotions, the</p><p>Frenchman danced gaily back to his com- </p><p>panions beside the chief. That worthy </p><p>arose as Dick approached and held out his </p><p>hand. He spoke a few words, most of </p><p>which Dick grasped because of their simi- </p><p>larity to other Algonquin tongues. </p><p> “Come boys,” commanded Basile. “Two</p><p>of you take the chief across now so that he </p><p>can talk with his men. Then bring him</p><p>back and we’ll take him to the village in one </p><p>of the canoes. These people never use </p><p>boats and it will please him to ride upon the </p><p>water.” </p><p> Dick and Michel paddled the chief across</p><p>the river where his men crowded about him </p><p>in an excited, jabbering group, each trying </p><p>to be first to handle the mysterious weapon </p><p>their leader so proudly displayed. He is- </p><p>sued a few brief directions and then re- </p><p>turned. </p><p> Back at their camp the four white men</p><p>loaded their canoes rapidly and then, the </p><p>chief reposing in state in the center of the </p><p>76 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>craft paddled by Basile and Leon, they </p><p>turned down-river, accompanied by the </p><p>shouting, excited savages on shore. </p><p>IN LITTLE more than an hour </p><p>the village, strung along the right </p><p>bank of the river, was reached. </p><p>The noisy escort had announced their com- </p><p>ing long before and the shore was crowded </p><p>with women, children and old men. </p><p> “That’s good,” Michel whispered to Dick</p><p>with quick relief when he saw the small </p><p>number of cabincs. “The forty hunters are </p><p>all the men of the village, which means there </p><p>won’t be too many to handle.” </p><p> “You don’t expect trouble surely after</p><p>the friendly manner in which they received </p><p>us, do you?” asked the Virginian. </p><p> “There is always trouble when a savage</p><p>and brandy get together. I have heard </p><p>that there are more than a hundred thou- </p><p>sand of these people, who are the richest </p><p>and most powerful of any nation the French </p><p>have met, excepting always the Longhouses. </p><p>They grow big fields of corn and roots and </p><p>melons and squashes, there is game enough </p><p>for four times as many on these plains, and </p><p>it is said that they never know what famine </p><p>is, as is so often the case with the nations </p><p>to the north. These people sow their crops </p><p>and then go out for game, come home and </p><p>harvest what they have planted, and then </p><p>they go for the big Winter hunt. That is </p><p>what the other savages have said of them, </p><p>and it is known that they always live in </p><p>plenty.” </p><p> The canoes were landed and when Dick</p><p>climbed the bank he saw that Michel had </p><p>not stretched the truth. Compared with </p><p>the northern Indians, especially those in </p><p>the country beyond the St. Lawrence, these </p><p>were indeed a pleasant people in a land more </p><p>pleasant than he liad ever dreamed of. </p><p>As he passed through the throng lie was </p><p>impressed by the courtesy of their manner, </p><p>their happiness and contentment as ex- </p><p>pressed in sleek bodies and smiling faces. </p><p>Old and young, they seemed like happy, </p><p>frolicking children, sincere in their welcome </p><p>to the white strangers. </p><p> Dick, in his attitude toward life, was little</p><p>more than a child himself and, not only be- </p><p>cause he knew that a quick way to an In- </p><p>dian’s heart is through his child, but be- </p><p>cause this scene of contentment had cap- </p><p>tivated his spirit, he picked up a naked little </p><p>boy and tossed him into the air again and </p><p>again. At first the child was frightened, </p><p>but against Dick’s infectious smile its terror </p><p>was powerless, and when at last he swung </p><p>the youngster to his shoulder and strode off </p><p>through the village the child fastened his </p><p>fingers in his hair and chattered with </p><p>delight. </p><p> “Here,” growled Basile as Dick re-</p><p>turned to the shore. “We’d not have a </p><p>thread of anything left if we all ran off and </p><p>left these savages to do as they wished with </p><p>the canoes. You and Michel stay here and </p><p>guard them while Leon and I have a talk </p><p>with the chief. We must see what they </p><p>have to trade before we go further.” </p><p> Dick set the child down and joined</p><p>Michel. </p><p> “You have a gay heart,” said the coureur</p><p>de bois, “but there is always a time in life </p><p>when one must be serious, and we have </p><p>reached it now. The chief desires to send </p><p>off runners to inform another village down- </p><p>river of our arrival, but we don’t want any </p><p>more than we have here, and not these </p><p>unless it be worth our while.” </p><p> Dick did not reply. It was not this</p><p>unusual seriousness of the ordinarily care- </p><p>free Michel that silenced him but some- </p><p>thing sinister in the cold, calculating meth- </p><p>ods of the Frenchmen. To the Virginian </p><p>trade with the savages meant an exchange </p><p>of goods for fur and food. If these Indians </p><p>did not have much they could trade for </p><p>what there was and go on to the next </p><p>village. Why need fear greater numbers of </p><p>such friendly, happy, contented people? </p><p> He reviewed these amazing plans and ac-</p><p>tions as he sat on the bow of the canoe but </p><p>the memory of his happy hours with Michel </p><p>and Leon forced him to the conclusion that </p><p>Basile, with his scheming, his evil mind, </p><p>alone was at the bottom of any possible </p><p>knavery. The other two, indolent, light- </p><p>hearted, unaspiring, were merely tools in </p><p>the older man’s hands.</p><p> For the first time since he had joined</p><p>them Dick entertained a serious thought, </p><p>and it was in the resolution that he would </p><p>give Basile cause for his jealousy, that he </p><p>would wrest the leadership from this vil- </p><p>lainous Frenchman. </p><p> As he came to this decision Leon ran</p><p>down to the canoes. </p><p> “It’s good news,” he cried. “They have</p><p>a wealth of beaver skins and many of </p><p>smaller animals, besides dozens of fine speci- </p><p>mens of the robes of the baeufs sauvage. </p><p>Before Marquette </p><p>77 </p><p>Basile has dissuaded the chief from sum-i </p><p>moning the next village and we are to begin </p><p>trading at once. Out with the bales, boys, </p><p>all but the casks. They’ll wait until to- </p><p>night.” </p><p> The three began to unload the canoes.</p><p>Basile and the chief soon joined them and </p><p>the goods were arranged on the bank. </p><p>More presents were made to the leading </p><p>men of the village and then the trading </p><p>began. </p><p> At first Dick was inclined to be a little</p><p>ashamed of the values given and received </p><p>but he forgot it in the expression of happi- </p><p>ness upon the faces of the savages and in </p><p>the reflection that the Frenchmen had </p><p>brought the goods safely through more </p><p>than six hundred leagues of wilderness. </p><p> He and Michel were set to work baling</p><p>the furs received and for the remainder of </p><p>the day he had little time for anything else. </p><p>At sunset the goods were exhausted and the </p><p>Indians still had many furs. Basile looked </p><p>at the others and Leon and Michel nodded. </p><p>A cask was immediately brought from the </p><p>canoes and broached. Basile let a little </p><p>into a gourd and passed it to the chief, ex- </p><p>plaining that it was the strong water of the </p><p>French of which he undoubtedly had heard </p><p>from other savages, that it made the sun </p><p>shine and the rain cease, the heart gay and </p><p>the feet light. </p><p> The chief took a swallow and then</p><p>clutched his throat in sudden fear as the </p><p>potent liquor scorched and choked him. </p><p>Then, as it reached his stomach and </p><p>warmed it, he patted his abdomen and a </p><p>smile spread over his face. </p><p> Again Basile held the gourd toward him</p><p>and again the chief drank, this time greed- </p><p>ily, despite the burning sensation in his </p><p>throat. The remainder was offered to one </p><p>of the warriors who downed it at a gulp </p><p>and then grinned sheepishly when the </p><p>others laughed at the distortions of his face. </p><p> Basile, who evidently had quickly per-</p><p>fected himself in the slight change to the </p><p>Islinois tongue, now spoke to the chief at </p><p>some length. The leader, who was most</p><p>evidently feeling the effects of the brandy, </p><p>listened for a moment, caught the meaning </p><p>of what the Frenchman was saying, and </p><p>tfien turned to his people, to whom he </p><p>talked rapidly. </p><p> Immediately there was a scramble of men</p><p>hurrying to the cabins. Dick, who, be- </p><p>cause he was busy, and because of his un- </p><p>familiarity with this new branch of the </p><p>Algonquin tongue, had not understood the </p><p>exact meaning of all that was said, was </p><p>amazed to see them come running back, </p><p>their hands full of bows, arrows, spears, war </p><p>clubs, stone knives and weapons of every </p><p>conceivable sort. Basile in the meantime </p><p>had unloaded the casks and the savages </p><p>dumped the village arsenal into the two </p><p>canoes. </p><p> “Why are we doing this?” demanded</p><p>Dick when he and Michel, at Basile’s com- </p><p>mand, had paddled the two canoes across </p><p>the river and emptied their contents upon </p><p>the opposite shore. </p><p> “To save our own precious heads from</p><p>being split open tonight,” was the laughing </p><p>reply. “Such a sight as you shall see, </p><p>Dick, and such a haul as we shall make!” </p><p> “But why should we not leave the</p><p>weapons in the canoes?” asked the Vir- </p><p>ginian, who now understood that more </p><p>brandy was to be given to the savages but </p><p>that the Frenchmen, fearing violence from </p><p>the liquor-aroused natives, had made this </p><p>arrangement for their own protection. </p><p> “Because we’ll need the canoe, my</p><p>friend,” was the reply, “and see that you </p><p>do not take too much of the brandy your- </p><p>self. We will need good heads and nerves, </p><p>and stout arms, too, for there will be </p><p>leagues and leagues of paddling before we </p><p>sleep again.” </p><p>TO BE CONTINUED </p><p>Loco 01 </p><p>Love </p><p>by W.C.TuHh </p><p>Author of "A Prcvarkated Parade,” "Dough or Dynamite," etc, </p><p>|F YOU’D ’a’ cooked them two eggs </p><p>at the same time, ‘Magpie,’ mine </p><p>wouldn’t ’a’ rolled off on the floor </p><p>and busted,” says I, sad-like, look- </p><p>ing at the remains. </p><p> Magpie Simpkins rises his full height,</p><p>which is some elevation, and glares at me. </p><p> “Ike Harper,” says he, “tend to your</p><p>own cooking. A person what is as ungrate- </p><p>ful as you are can’t partake of my cooking, </p><p>neither will I break bread with such as he.” </p><p> I got my boots on, cooks me some bacon,</p><p>and eats as far from that hombre as the </p><p>room allows. A house divided can’t ring </p><p>with harmony, and love has put a breach </p><p>as wide as the Grand Canon between me </p><p>and Magpie. The little feller with the bow </p><p>and arrer has rasped us raw. </p><p> Magpie is the sheriff of our county, and</p><p>I’m his deputy. Me and that scantling- </p><p>shaped hombre have been pardners ever </p><p>since gold was discovered on bedrock, and </p><p>this is the first rift in our lute. Of course </p><p>there has been discords, but this is the first </p><p>time that the strings have all been busted! </p><p> Love cometh at strange times. Me and</p><p>Magpie have been over in the Medicine </p><p>Hills, sort of looking for an alleged rustler, </p><p>and are coming out, when we sees a nester’s </p><p>cabin with smoke coming out of the stove- </p><p>pipe. It’s an old place, and ain’t been </p><p>occupied for some time, so we decides to </p><p>investigate. </p><p> We’re a heap hungry, and when we gets</p><p>in shooting range we smells fried onions and </p><p>coffee. There’s an aroma of biscuits on the </p><p>78 </p><p>air, too, which don’t hurt our noses none. </p><p> We pilgrims into the yard, and as we</p><p>slips off our broncs the door opens, and we </p><p>sees our heart’s desire. She’s a cute little </p><p>filly. She’s slender, got a lot of eighteen- </p><p>carat hair, and blue eyes as big as the end</p><p>of a shotgun shell. </p><p> She’s got a bowl full of dough in her</p><p>hands, and she stares at us like we’re </p><p>curiosities. Sudden-like she smiles. </p><p> “I’m Sheriff Simpkins,” states Magpie,</p><p>removing his hat. </p><p> She gives a queer little squeak and drops</p><p>her bowl on the ground. </p><p> “I ain’t done nothing!” says she, sort of</p><p>vacant-like. </p><p> “Ma’am, the queen can do no wrong,”</p><p>states Magpie. “We smells the odors of </p><p>Araby, so our noses brings us hither.” </p><p>“Onions,” says she. “Don’t they smell.” </p><p>“Perfume of the gods,” says I. “I’d </p><p>wear one all the time if it wasn’t for the </p><p>looks of the thing. I’m your obedient </p><p>servant, Ike Harper. You living here </p><p>alone?” </p><p> “Yes,” she nods. “A poor, defenseless</p><p>woman. I hope there ain’t no objection to </p><p>me using this cabin. I’ll take care of it.” </p><p>“She’s yours,” pronounces Magpie. “If </p><p>anybody interferes with your habitation you </p><p>send for me.” </p><p> “And in case he’s too busy I’ll come,”</p><p>says I. “He’s a busy man. I’m sorry he </p><p>was so quick to startle yuh, and make yuh </p><p>bust your dough mug. He’s abrupt that- </p><p>away.” </p><p>Loco or Love	79</p><p> “No matter,” says she. “Won’t yuh</p><p>come in?” </p><p> Just wouldn’t we? Say! Them onions</p><p>was the greatest and the biscuits was the </p><p>lightest yuh ever seen. Coffee? Nectar of </p><p>the gods. There ain’t much furniture in </p><p>the place, but what is in there looks home- </p><p>like. She’s got a enlarged picture on the </p><p>wall, the same of which seems familiar. </p><p> “Ma’am,” says Magpie, pointing at it,”</p><p>“would yuh mind telling me who the dis- </p><p>tinguished-looking gent is?” </p><p> “Was,” says she, sad-like. “He’s gone</p><p>and-” </p><p> “Magpie,” says I, “don’t presume on</p><p>short acquaintance to stir up sad memories. </p><p>There don’t seem to be nothing sacred to </p><p>him, ma’am.” </p><p> She smiles at us, sweet-like, and nods:</p><p>“Yes, he’s gone, but his memory lingers. </p><p>He was a good man.” </p><p> “You dang well know he was,” agrees</p><p>Magpie. “If he wasn’t his picture wouldn’t </p><p>be on your walls. What did you say your </p><p>name was?” </p><p> “I didn’t say, Mister Simpkins: I am</p><p>Lily Lester.” </p><p> “Some pretty name. Call me Magpie—</p><p>pleased to meet yuh.” </p><p> “I might not decipher the call if yuh said</p><p>Mister Harper,” says I. “Maw used to </p><p>call me Honey, but Ike suits me fine.” </p><p>“Honey!” snorts Magpie. “Not comb- </p><p>honey, Ike. You ain’t used-” </p><p> “Personalities are bad form, Magpie,” I</p><p>reminds him. “Remember we’re before a </p><p>lady. Ma’am, I’d love to drop in once in </p><p>a while and see how you’re making it.” </p><p> “Do it,” says she. “I’d love to have</p><p>yuh.” </p><p> “Yes’m,” says Magpie. “I will.”</p><p> She thanks us—I don’t know what for—</p><p>and we rides away. We pilgrims off across</p><p>the hills towards Piperock, and we takes </p><p>looks at that cabin until we’re out of </p><p>sight. </p><p> “Ike, Lily is a lulu,” states Magpie.</p><p> “If that’s an expression of admiration I</p><p>remains torpid, but if that apellation of lulu </p><p>reflects on the lady in any way I resents it </p><p>a heap.” </p><p> “Get a dictionary, Ike,” he grins. “Lulu</p><p>is a Latin word meaning ‘wonderful.’ Ain’t </p><p>she a wonder? Biscuits! Onions! Ike, I </p><p>wish you’d ask her for her recipe for cooking </p><p>coffee. I sure admire coffee that I don’t </p><p>have to chew and what won’t corrode my </p><p>insides at each meal. I wonder if she con- </p><p>templates future matrimony? She don’t </p><p>need to live alone, Ike. Reckon I ain’t </p><p>beyond matrimonial redemption myself. </p><p>What do yuh think?” </p><p> “If yuh don’t like the way I cook coffee,</p><p>Magpie, you can cook it yourself. And as </p><p>far as matrimony and you are concerned, </p><p>you’d be like a three-legged turtle trying to </p><p>catch a scared wolf. There ain’t nothing </p><p>about you to catch the female fancy. </p><p> “In the first place, you’re too long. No</p><p>woman wants to look up a lodge-pole all </p><p>her life. An occasional glance at your face </p><p>ain’t going to hurt nobody, but as a steady </p><p>diet—no!” </p><p> “Faces,” he states, “ain’t so much. Brains</p><p>and companionship counts a heap more. </p><p>You suffers a heap that-away, Ike. You’re </p><p>pretty in the face—like a buffalo, and </p><p>about as companionable as a porkypine, but </p><p>when it comes to brains you ain’t got a </p><p>trump. I’ll likely ride her way very </p><p>soon.” </p><p> “Me, too. Likely tomorrow.”</p><p> “Yes, and likely yuh won’t, Ike!” he</p><p>snorts. “You’re working for me. Sabe? </p><p>You goes where I sends yuh.” </p><p> “If you think for a holy minute that I</p><p>ain’t going to have 110 leisure time, Magpie, </p><p>you think again. You get too cocky, old- </p><p>timer, and I’ll quit or take a vacation. </p><p>Sabe?” </p><p> “Don’t fly off the handle, Ike,” he ad-</p><p>vises. “Nobody ever said yuh couldn’t </p><p>have no leisure time. You hops off half- </p><p>cocked. Also you’re contrary. Did yuh </p><p>ever hear about the dog what got in the </p><p>manger? He couldn’t eat the hay, and he </p><p>wouldn’t let the bronc eat it.” </p><p> “If you figures yourself as the bronc in</p><p>that moral, Magpie, you lose. Your ears </p><p>are too long, old-timer. Where do yuh get </p><p>the idea that I can’t get the lady? I made </p><p>a living before I met you. The only thing </p><p>I ever done that I was ashamed of was the </p><p>day I pinned your star on my bosom. You </p><p>thinks just because you’re a sheriff you’re </p><p>better than most folks. You didn’t grab </p><p>any honors when you beat ‘Shep’ Allen for </p><p>sheriff. He’s blind in one eye and string- </p><p>halted in both legs. Just let me whisper </p><p>something to you, Magpie: if you don’t </p><p>grab some of these cow thieves-” </p><p> “Ike, you can desist. I’m doing all that</p><p>a mortal man can do. If I had a deputy </p><p>that was worth a cuss I’d-” </p><p>8o </p><p>Adventure </p><p> THAT’S a sample of our conversa-</p><p>tion on the way home. Being </p><p>pardners for so long, we hates to </p><p>say hateful things to each other, but in a </p><p>case like this the truth does seep out. We </p><p>gets real personal before we gets to Pipe- </p><p>rock, and finds Zeb Abernathy and “Scenery” </p><p>Sims setting in front of our office, waiting </p><p>for us. </p><p> Zeb looks just like you’d bet he would</p><p>after hearing his name, but no name on </p><p>earth could give an impression of Scenery. </p><p>When I look at him I think thusly: </p><p> “The person what built you, Scenery,</p><p>must ’a’ run mighty short of material. They </p><p>looks yuh over and says—‘It ain’t much of </p><p>a man, but I’ll put a squeak in it so growed- </p><p>up folks won’t step on it accidental-like.’” </p><p>They looks up at us as we rides in. Zeb </p><p>almost unjoins his neck trying to expecto- </p><p>rate across the street, crosses his legs and </p><p>squints— </p><p> “Any news, Magpie?”</p><p> “Hello, Zeb,” says Magpie. “Nothing</p><p>new. Heard anything?” </p><p> “Bank got robbed today,” squeaks Scenery.</p><p>“Dog-gone thing got absolutely robbed. I </p><p>been telling everybody that we ain’t got </p><p>no protection around here. Whole sheriff’s </p><p>office couldn’t find a ace in a new pack of </p><p>cards. Ain’t yuh going to do nothing?” </p><p>“I know something I’d like to do,” states </p><p>Magpie, looking down at Scenery. “You </p><p>keep your squeak in your chest and let Zeb </p><p>tells us about it. What happened, Zeb?” </p><p>“While you fellers are picking flowers </p><p>over in the lulls a feller rides into town, </p><p>throws down on the cashier with a gun and </p><p>lopes off with the treasure. He told the </p><p>cashier to give you his regards. What yuh </p><p>going to do, Magpie?” </p><p> “Cry a little,” says Magpie, tired-like.</p><p>“I don’t reckon there is much else to do. </p><p>Some of you folks gets the idea that just </p><p>because I wears a star all I got to do is </p><p>yell, ‘Come here, ye outlaws!’ and they’ll </p><p>come a-running.” </p><p> “What I want to know is what are yuh</p><p>going to do?” squeaks Scenery. “When </p><p>we elects yuh sheriff-” </p><p> “They,” corrects Magpie. “You voted</p><p>for Allen, Scenery.” </p><p> “Then I got something to be proud of.</p><p>I’m glad that folks can’t hold me respon- </p><p>sible for you.” </p><p> Him and Zeb ambles off up-town, and we</p><p>goes inside. </p><p> “There ain’t no joy in being a sheriff!”</p><p>yelps Magpie, throwing his boots over in </p><p>the corner. “Your duty sort of keeps yuh </p><p>from pulling a gun and acting free-like. </p><p>I’m going out tomorrow and get that bad, </p><p>bad-man, Ike. You watch me.” </p><p> The next morning he shaves careful-like,</p><p>and greases his boots. </p><p> “Going to try and make a mash on him?”</p><p>I asks. “You ought to have some per- </p><p>fume, Magpie. You look like a bride- </p><p>groom.” </p><p> “Ike,” says he, ignoring the compliment,</p><p>“I wants you to ride up to Sullivan Gulch, </p><p>and see if anybody’s living there. We got </p><p>to locate something or somebody pretty </p><p>soon.” </p><p> “Where you going?” I asks.</p><p> “Into the breaks between here and the</p><p>Circle-Cross.” </p><p> I rides out of Piperock with joy in my</p><p>heart, ’cause I’m going in the general direc- </p><p>tion of my heart’s desire, and Magpie has </p><p>gone the opposite. What do I care for </p><p>outlaws? Duty to me is self-preservation. </p><p> Me and Magpie meets at the door. We</p><p>nods like distant relatives, and each knocks </p><p>on our side of the door. The lady makes </p><p>us welcome, and we sets down. </p><p> “I’m so glad to see yuh,” says she, and</p><p>Magpie walks plumb across the room to </p><p>shake hands with her. </p><p> “I wish I’d ’a’ known yuh was coming</p><p>today,” she states. “I’d ’a’ had yuh bring </p><p>me some stuff from town.”</p><p> “Well, ma’am,” says Magpie, “if there’s</p><p>anything yuh want I can send Ike after it. </p><p>What’s the use of having hired men if yuh </p><p>don’t use ’em. Tell me what your heart </p><p>desires.” </p><p> “I ain’t got no time,” says I, “I’m headed</p><p>for Sullivan Gulch. I’d love to do it, </p><p>ma’am, but I’m rushed. Magpie’s just </p><p>loafing, so he’ll be glad to do it.” </p><p> Magpie glares at me and I glares right</p><p>back at him. </p><p> “How lovely,” coos this here lady. “It</p><p>will be lovely.” </p><p> “We’ll both go, Ike,” states Magpie. “I</p><p>got a little job of work in Piperock that you </p><p>can attend to while I’m bringing the stuff </p><p>back. Write out your list, ma’am, and I’ll </p><p>deliver it right to your door.” </p><p> Me and Magpie pilgrims back to Pipe-</p><p>rock in silence, buys the stuff for the lady, </p><p>and goes down to the office. </p><p> We finds Buck Masterson on the steps.</p><p>Loco or Love </p><p>81 </p><p> “Howdy, Buck,” says Magpie. “What</p><p>can I do for yuh?” </p><p> “Well, unless you improves your ways I</p><p>don’t reckon yuh can do anything,” says </p><p>Buck, sort of helpless-like. “I been </p><p>robbed!” </p><p> “Pshawl” says I. “How comes that,</p><p>Buck?” </p><p> “Feller—same one what robbed the bank,</p><p>I reckon—comes into my saloon this morn- </p><p>ing, sticks a gun in my face and annexes </p><p>what I got in the safe. Said he knowed the </p><p>sheriff was away. Say, Magpie, what in </p><p>-are you doing? Sending out proclama- </p><p>tions of your absence?” </p><p> I don’t care to listen to no such conver-</p><p>sation, so I goes inside, and pretty soon </p><p>Magpie and Buck pilgrims up-town. I </p><p>takes that stuff, throws it on a hoss, and </p><p>points for the lady of my dreams. </p><p>t”-“ I GETS almost to her place, when </p><p>Magpie overtakes me. We rides </p><p>up, deposits the stuff and partakes </p><p>of a light lunch. </p><p> “I’m a outlaw-hunter,” states Magpie,</p><p>during the meal. “It’s a precarious ex- </p><p>istence, fraught with much danger, and </p><p>takes a man of nerve.” </p><p> “Romantic,” says she. “And what does</p><p>Mister Harper do?” </p><p> “He holds my bronc.”</p><p> “While you runs,” says I. “Magpie don’t</p><p>want to be bothered with no bronc when </p><p>he gets scared, ma’am. If I was the sheriff </p><p>of this county I’d keep her swept clean of </p><p>outlaws, believe me. It irks me some to </p><p>take orders when I know they ain’t getting </p><p>us no place.” </p><p> “Do you suppose I’m in any danger liv-</p><p>ing here alone?” she asks. </p><p> “If I thought you was I couldn’t sleep,”</p><p>orates Magpie. “You need the protection </p><p>of a man. If you-”</p><p> “You hadn’t ought to be here alone,” I</p><p>states. “Of course I’d love to stay here </p><p>with you, but—there’s a preacher in Pipe- </p><p>rock, ma’am.” </p><p> “Preachers ain’t no protection,” states</p><p>Magpie. “Being sort of a legal guardian </p><p>of this here county, I’d admire to-” </p><p> “Magpie, you ain’t got no time,” I re-</p><p>minds him. “You got to investigate that </p><p>bank robbery and the one in Buck’s place. </p><p>You’ve said yourself that I ain’t no help to </p><p>you. Why don’t yuh appoint me to look </p><p>fater the weaker sex in this county?” </p><p> “Ike, after knowing you as long as I have,</p><p>I’d hate to call ’em the weaker sex.” </p><p> ‘Oh, I’m not afraid,” she states. “As</p><p>long as I’ve got two big strong men looking </p><p>after me I feel safe. I do hope you can </p><p>come often. Can’t you come tomorrow?” </p><p>“I can,” says Magpie. “Of course Ike </p><p>will have to stay and tend to the office rou- </p><p>tine work. It ain’t much but it’s got to be </p><p>done.” </p><p> “Routine work,” says I to Magpie, as</p><p>we pilgrims back. “What routine, Mag- </p><p>pie?” </p><p> “Seeing that nobody breaks into jail</p><p>without showing a warrant,” he grins. </p><p>Pretty soon he heaves a long sigh, and turns </p><p>in his saddle—“Ike, it ain’t going to be </p><p>long before you’ll be cooking grub for your- </p><p>self alone.” </p><p> “It sure ain’t,” I agrees. “I begins to-</p><p>night. Your feller-feelings are paralyzed, </p><p>Magpie Simpkins, and no more do I cook for </p><p>an ungrateful hombre like you. Dang your </p><p>slim soul! You ain’t noways good enough </p><p>for that lady.” </p><p> “Ain’t it true,” he agrees. “But I’m</p><p>getting better all the time, Ike. Didn’t </p><p>yuh notice how the tears comes to her eyes, </p><p>and how her breast heaved when I spoke </p><p>about losing sleep? And then you—dang </p><p>yuh! You has to cut in with that sky- </p><p>pilot talk when I’m getting right down to </p><p>business. If I had five minutes alone with </p><p>her I’d have her hand.” </p><p> “I’ll bet yuh would,” I agrees. “A feller</p><p>what can lie as fast as you can hadn’t </p><p>ought to take that long.” </p><p> “You’re one of the kind what makes love</p><p>by main strength and awkwardness, Ece. </p><p>Your idea of a courtship is to take a damsel </p><p>by the hair, drag her home, slam her into </p><p>a corner, and then hammer her with a boot </p><p>if she can’t cook. You say I’d lie to her. </p><p>You got to, Ike. No woman was ever told </p><p>the truth when she was proposed to. She </p><p>don’t want the truth.” </p><p> “I never beat up no woman, Magpie,”</p><p>I advises him. “Also I ain’t no second </p><p>George Washington.” </p><p> That night we cooks separate meals, and</p><p>I got all the best of it, ’cause Magpie can’t </p><p>cook. The next morning he beats me to </p><p>it. We’ve only got two eggs left, and of </p><p>course he has to let mine roll off on the </p><p>floor. Now we’re back where this tale </p><p>began, with him orating about breaking </p><p>bread with me. </p><p>82 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Old trailer,” says I, “if you baked the</p><p>bread, we couldn’t break it.” </p><p> He don’t reply—just snorts, so we eats</p><p>on opposite sides of the shack. </p><p> Some of Piperock’s prominent citizens</p><p>come down to see Magpie, and their con- </p><p>versation leads us to believe that we’re </p><p>incompetent. They hints around that they </p><p>might ’a’ made a mistake when they elects </p><p>Magpie. Magpie sighs deep-like, and tells </p><p>them to not take snap judgment, ’cause </p><p>he’s going out to get that feller right soon. </p><p>Art Miller gets Magpie of! to one side and </p><p>speaks to him in whispers. Magpie shakes </p><p>his head, emphatic-like, and Art acts dis- </p><p>gusted. After they’re gone I asks Magpie </p><p>what Art wanted. </p><p> “He’s timid. Got some gold going out</p><p>on the stage today and says he hates to </p><p>take a chance. Said it was my duty to see </p><p>that he got through safe-like. Safe-!” </p><p> “He’s right,” says I. “It’s your duty,</p><p>Magpie. I’ll go up and see if the lady </p><p>needs anything. You can’t shirk all your </p><p>responsibility.” </p><p> Magpie smokes a while and nods:</p><p> “I reckon you’re right, Ike. The office</p><p>has to protect them what needs it, so I’ll </p><p>send you. I was thinking of the pleasant </p><p>time you and me was going to have up at </p><p>that little cabin today, but since your ora- </p><p>tion about duty 1 reckon we’ll have to help </p><p>Art out. You just tell him I sent you for a </p><p>guard. Who yuh writing to, Ike?” </p><p> “You,” says I, looking up from my</p><p>labor. “This is my resignation, Magpie.” </p><p>“Coward!” says he, soft-like. </p><p> The Harper tribe are a peacefully inclined</p><p>lot of human beings, and forgiving to a </p><p>startling degree, but that word means fight. </p><p>I hits him in the neck with the ink-bottle, </p><p>and then we tangles. </p><p> When we gets through I’m on the floor</p><p>with the stove in my lap, while Magpie sets </p><p>half-way out of the door with a chair hung</p><p>around his neck. Just then Scenery Sims </p><p>sticks his head in the window, and yelps: </p><p>“What’s this? What’s this?” </p><p> I takes one of the legs off that stove, and</p><p>bounces it off his head and yells: </p><p> “A draw! You squeaky fool!”</p><p> We hears his boots just hitting the ground</p><p>at intervals of three seconds, as he labors </p><p>back up-town. </p><p> Magpie wipes some of the blood and ink</p><p>off his forehead, and glares at me. </p><p> “You’re too danged touchy!” he wails.</p><p>“We sure do look like making social calls, </p><p>now don’t we?” </p><p> “I wouldn’t face her for a million,” says</p><p>he. </p><p> “Neither would I,” says I.</p><p> I cleans my face the best I can, and</p><p>walks over to the door. I takes off my </p><p>star and tosses it on the table. </p><p> “Magpie,” says I, “I’m all through. No</p><p>more will I chase the festive outlaw. From </p><p>now on I’m going to be a common citizen, </p><p>and entitled to come down here and raise </p><p>thunder with you for not tending to your </p><p>duty. I’m wise to you, old-timer. Being </p><p>a ordinary citizen and entitled to protec- </p><p>tion I hereby audibly objects to you frit- </p><p>tering the county’s time away making love. </p><p>Remember, Magpie, I knows your secret. </p><p>Sabe?” </p><p> I goes over to the bam and saddles up.</p><p>I ain’t in no shape to fawn over a lady, but </p><p>the call of love is strong upon me and I </p><p>unconsciously rides in her direction. I for- </p><p>gets time and distance, and all of a sudden </p><p>I’m at her door and she’s smiling at me.” </p><p> “Ma’am,” says I, “I know I looks repul-</p><p>sive, but my heart is in the right place. I </p><p>been in a awful fight, and when a man’s </p><p>wounded he flies away to where his heart is.” </p><p> “Where is the sheriff?” she asks.</p><p> The question hurts, but I conceals my</p><p>grief.</p><p> “Why worry about that sandhill crane?”</p><p>I replies. “I reckon he’s forgot yuh </p><p>already, ma’am. I quit him today, and I’m </p><p>glad of it. I’m of age and fancy free, </p><p>ma’am. I know I ain’t much to look at. </p><p>I’m a regular old pelican, and I ain’t so pure </p><p>as snow, but I’m getting better—thank </p><p>yuh. When a woman comes into a man’s </p><p>life it sure cleans house with him. The </p><p>minute I sees your face I says to myself: </p><p>‘There she is, Ike. There’s the one </p><p>woman-’ ” </p><p>WE HEARS the rattle of a bronc’s </p><p>hoofs and then— </p><p> “Whoa!”</p><p> I hops to the window and sees Magpie</p><p>Simpkins, and then I ducks and yelps: </p><p> “Where can I hide? I don’t want to see</p><p>him.” </p><p> “Under the bed,” she whispers. “Hurry!”</p><p> I skids under the bunk. The blanket</p><p>hangs almost to the floor, and hides me </p><p>fine. She opens the door and lets Magpie </p><p>in. </p><p>Loco or Love </p><p>83 </p><p> “Ma’am,” says he, “I’m sorry to come to</p><p>see yuh looking like this, but I promised </p><p>yuh I’d come, and I’d ’a’ done it if it took </p><p>my last drop of blood. I had a awful fight </p><p>with a outlaw. All I had was my bare </p><p>hands and ability against his modern wea- </p><p>pons, and of course I didn’t come through </p><p>unscathed.” </p><p> “And the outlaw?” she asks, interested-</p><p>like. “What of him?” </p><p> “Ma’am,” Magpie replies, weary-like,</p><p>“he crawlcd away to die. Like a animile </p><p>wounded unto death he crawled out of </p><p>mortal sight to cash his chips.” </p><p> I hears Magpie sigh deep-like again, and</p><p>then continues: </p><p> “Ma’am, I’m—a—a common old coot.</p><p>I’ve lived alone so long that I can’t seem </p><p>to release the words that clamors in my </p><p>bosom to be spoke. Until I seen your face </p><p>I ain’t given a thought to a double rig. </p><p>I’m pure in mind and of a forgiving nature. </p><p>I asks yuh—please don’t smile, ma’am. </p><p>This is a serious chore .with me. I come </p><p>here for succor-” </p><p> “A, Magpie,” I corrects him, aloud. “A</p><p>sucker.” </p><p> There is silence for some time. I hears</p><p>Magpie’s boots scrape nervous-like on the </p><p>floor, and he clears his dry throat. </p><p> “Did—did you hear somebody speak?”</p><p>he asks. </p><p> She must ’a’ shook her head, ’cause he</p><p>shuffles his feet again and says: </p><p> “Reckon I’m getting jumpy. Well,</p><p>ma’am, what do yuh think of the proposi- </p><p>tion?” </p><p> “Where is Mister Harper today?” she</p><p>asks, ignoring his question. </p><p> I peeks out from under the bed and I sees</p><p>Magpie’s feet real close to me. There’s a </p><p>piece of rope laying between his heels and </p><p>the chair leg. Magpie is scared of snakes,</p><p>and it gives me an idea. </p><p> “Ma’am,” says he, “let’s not speak of</p><p>that person. He done me dirt. Just when </p><p>I needs him bad he up and quits me. For </p><p>why? Because he’s scared. That feller </p><p>ain’t got no nerve a-tall. So long as he can </p><p>lay around and do nothing but wear a star </p><p>he’s a hy-iu officer, but the minute he sees </p><p>a little trouble showing up he quits cold. I </p><p>hates a coward, ma’am. No man can ever </p><p>say that a Simpkins flinched when danger </p><p>came his-” </p><p> “Z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z!” says I, and begins draw-</p><p>ing that rope past his heels. </p><p> He freezes to his chair for about three</p><p>seconds, and then just hits the floor once </p><p>before he exits through the door. I rolls </p><p>out the side of the bed, slips the window </p><p>open and drops out of the back of the cabin. </p><p>I gets a glimpse of the lady’s face as I slides </p><p>over the sill, and she’s got tears running </p><p>down her face. </p><p> I figured that this here ain’t the proper</p><p>time for me to make marriage proposals </p><p>to the lady, and after taking one good </p><p>look at her face, as I flopped over the </p><p>window sill, I don’t figure that Magpie </p><p>will stand much show of getting her to sign </p><p>up for life. </p><p> My bronc has drifted around to the back,</p><p>which is the reason Magpie never saw it, </p><p>so I leads it away from there and laughs all </p><p>the way home. </p><p> I rides up to Buck Masterson’s saloon,</p><p>and meets Pete Gonyer and a stranger. </p><p>They immediate and soon surrounds me. </p><p> “Ike, this is Mister Brand,” states Pete,</p><p>and I shakes the hand of this stranger per- </p><p>son. “Mister Brand would talk with some- </p><p>body from the sheriff’s office, Ike, so I turns </p><p>him loose on you.” </p><p> Pete wanders away and me and Mister</p><p>Brand sets down on the sidewalk. He pulls </p><p>out a couple of photygrafts and hands ’em </p><p>to me. </p><p> “Look at them and see if yuh recognize</p><p>either one,” says he.</p><p> There’s something familiar about one of</p><p>them but the other one is a complete </p><p>stranger. I can’t place the other one, but </p><p>there’s a trace some place. </p><p> “That’s ‘Kid’ Corey,” says he. “This</p><p>other one is ‘Blazer’ Bailey. They’re a </p><p>clever pair. Artists in the hold-up line. </p><p>I’m a Federal officer. They been grab- </p><p>bing off a lot of registered mail lately, and </p><p>the last stunt they pulls off was over on </p><p>the main line. The Kid got hit, but some- </p><p>how they both got away and headed across </p><p>the divide in this direction. You been </p><p>having so much trouble over here that I </p><p>decides to look' into it. It may not be </p><p>them—don’t look like their work, ’cause </p><p>your cases have all been one man. </p><p> “Blazer is a big husky, but Corey</p><p>wouldn’t cause yuh to look twice. He used </p><p>to be a sort of a actor, I believe.” </p><p> “Well, I can’t help yuh much,” says I.</p><p>“Yuh see I ain’t connected with the sheriff’s </p><p>office no more. Maybe the sheriff can give </p><p>yuh some information, but I doubt it. I </p><p>84 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>know everything he does and all that I </p><p>naturally knows myself, but I can’t help </p><p>yuh none.” </p><p> “I’ve heard some uncomplimentary things</p><p>about the office,” he admits. “Folks around </p><p>here seems to bare their feelings. Much </p><p>obliged anyway, Mister Harper.” </p><p> I goes down to the office to get my effects,</p><p>when Magpie comes in. He sets down and </p><p>pretends to read a paper. </p><p> “Where yuh been?” I asks.</p><p> He yawns and folds up the paper.</p><p> “Hunting around a little.”</p><p> I sets down on the table and rolls a smoke.</p><p>“Magpie,” says I, “what do yuh know </p><p>about snakes?” </p><p> He drops the paper and sets up straight</p><p>in his chair. He’s got sort of a foolish look </p><p>about his face, and he sort of gawps at me: </p><p>“Uh-uh—snakes? I—I don’t sabe, Ike?” </p><p>“I didn’t think yuh did. A man’s a </p><p>sucker to ask questions of folks he knows </p><p>can’t answer ’em.” </p><p> He uncoils from his chair, slides his gun</p><p>around to the front and faces me. </p><p> “Ike, I got a question to ask you. Were</p><p> Just then the door bangs open, and in</p><p>comes Art Miller, all out of wind. He flops </p><p>in a chair and pants: </p><p> “I—I told yuh! The—uh—uh—stage</p><p>was huh-held up. About fuf-five miles </p><p>down the road. Took all I had—dang the </p><p>luck!” </p><p> “Mail, too?” I asks, and he nods.</p><p>“Everything, I told yuh!” </p><p> “Well, well!” says I. “That must ’a’</p><p>been Kid Corey or Blazer Bailey. Worthy </p><p>of your steel, Magpie.” </p><p> “Well, ain’t yuh going to move?” yelps</p><p>Art. “Going to let ’em get plumb away </p><p>as usual?” </p><p> “Which way did they go?”</p><p> “Towards Paradise. Yuh never can tell</p><p>which way he went after he got out of </p><p>sight.” </p><p> “Any danged fool knows that,” agrees</p><p>Magpie. “I reckon I better go after him.” </p><p>“I reckon yuh better had,” pants Art, </p><p>and then lopes back up-town. </p><p> Magpie fusses around getting ready, oil-</p><p>ing his guns and fixing a cinch on his saddle. </p><p> “You sure do go right after ’em, Mag-</p><p>pie,” says I. “You ought to be called </p><p>‘Sudden’ Simpkins. Don’t let me hurryyuh. </p><p>I’ll go away so yuh can oil your boots and </p><p>shave. Haste makes waste, Magpie.” </p><p>I GOES up-town, and she’s boiling. </p><p>They’re organizing a posse to work </p><p>independent of the sheriff’s office, </p><p>)ut I don’t join. I got sweeter things to </p><p>think of than killing or incarcerating my </p><p>feller men. The little feller without no </p><p>pants on, carrying a bow and arrer seems to </p><p>beckon me. </p><p> I forks my bronc and rides north, linger-</p><p>ing along, building air-castles and so forth. </p><p>My bronc ain’t none too energetic, and we </p><p>consumes plenty of time. </p><p> I dips into a canon and rides up a cow</p><p>trail, when a man with a pack-animile cuts </p><p>my path, and I recognizes Magpie Simp- </p><p>kins. I keeps behind him, and pretty soon </p><p>he gets off his bronc and seems to be </p><p>picking up something off the ground. I </p><p>rides up slow behind him, and rolls a </p><p>smoke. The son-of-a-gun is so busy he </p><p>don’t hear me until I clears my throat and </p><p>then he whirls around with Ms hands full </p><p>of flowers. </p><p> We looks at each other for half a minute,</p><p>and then he grins, sort of foolish-like and </p><p>holds out his hands: </p><p> “Daisies,” says he. “Daisies.”</p><p> “Not today, little girl,” says I. “I ain’t</p><p>got no water to put ’em in.” </p><p> “Dang fool,” he snorts.</p><p> “That’s what I thought when I rode up,”</p><p>I agrees. “From the looks of your pack </p><p>I’d say you was on a protracted trip. I </p><p>thought Art said the robber went south.” </p><p>“Uh-huli,” he nods, smelling his bouquet. </p><p>“I got to deliver this load before I’m free to </p><p>hunt outlaws, Ike.” </p><p> “For her?” I asks, and he nods.</p><p> “She’s paying for it, ain’t she?”</p><p> “Do you think I’d let her?” he snaps.</p><p>“A feller’s got to do something for his </p><p>sweetheart, ain’t he? I paid for that other </p><p>load, too.” </p><p> “I’m going down and kill that store-</p><p>keeper,” says I. “I did, too.” </p><p> “Haw!” says Magpie, when I begins to</p><p>laugh. </p><p> He hauls out a roll of bills, and spits on</p><p>his thumb. </p><p> “How much did yuh pay, Mister Har-</p><p>per?” </p><p> “Seventeen-fifty,” says I, and he counts</p><p>it out and hands it to me. “That squares </p><p>it. I don’t want her under obligations to </p><p>no other man. Sabe?” </p><p> “You think for a minute that you can</p><p>buy me off?” says I. “You think my </p><p>Loco or Love </p><p>85 </p><p>heart’s love is for sale—for seventeen- </p><p>fifty? When did you get a mortgage on the </p><p>lady, Mister Simpkins?” </p><p> “We’ve come to an understanding,” he</p><p>states. “She accepts my protection, ex- </p><p>clusive. Well, I must be going on. Adios.” </p><p>He moves on and I rides with him. It </p><p>sort of irritates him, and he swings around </p><p>in his saddle. </p><p> “Harper,” says he—that’s the first time</p><p>he ever called me just Harper—“Harper, </p><p>you’ve heard that old saying, ‘Three is a </p><p>crowd? Well, I don’t like crowds. Sabe?” </p><p>“The back-trail is open,” says I. “You </p><p>can’t give me orders.” </p><p> “Dang you, Ike!” he wails. “Ain’t you</p><p>got no finer feelings?” </p><p> “Not since I lived with you, Magpie.</p><p>Yrou’d blunt a piledriver.” </p><p> We sets there and glares at each other for</p><p>a spell. I rolls a smoke, and he follers suit. </p><p> “No bowels of compassion?” he asks, sad-</p><p>like. </p><p> “Not a gut.”</p><p> “Ike,” says he, after a while, “will you</p><p>do me a favor? Just for old times’ sake, </p><p>Ike?” </p><p> “Shoot,” says I.</p><p> “Well, Ike, I—I—I sort of got—well,</p><p>she’s beginning to see tilings my way, and </p><p>all I asks is ten minutes alone with her. </p><p>You stay away for ten minutes after I goes </p><p>inside, and then you can come in and con- </p><p>gratulate the happy couple. Will yuh do </p><p>it, Ike?” </p><p> “That’s a mighty big favor, Magpie,” I</p><p>observes after sufficient thought. “You </p><p>and me been more or less friendly for years </p><p>and years, Magpie, and—well, I’ll do it. </p><p>I’ll give yuh ten minutes start of me. Cut </p><p>your wolf loose and go a-howling.” </p><p> “Ike,” says he, with tears in his voice,</p><p>“you’ll never regret it. As soon as we’re</p><p>married I’ll have you up to supper.” </p><p> “If you can propose in ten minutes, Mag-</p><p>pie, I’ll cook for you all the rest of your </p><p>life for nothing. Propose in ten minutes! </p><p>Why, you can’t spit inside of fifteen. Go </p><p>ahead and have it over with.” </p><p> We pilgrims on until we tops a hill above</p><p>her cabin. I stops there and lets Magpie </p><p>go on down. I’m to stick there until I </p><p>figures that I can make the cabin ten </p><p>minutes after he goes inside. </p><p> I rolls a smoke and watches him take his</p><p>animile around to the back, and then open </p><p>the door and walk right inside. </p><p> “Getting danged familiar,” says I to my</p><p>bronc. “Going in without knocking.” </p><p> I’m glancing around the landscape, when</p><p>I sees two men on hosses cut across behind </p><p>me not a quarter of a mile away. Sudden- </p><p>like I sees some more off to my left. They’re </p><p>acting queer, so I spurs my bronc for a </p><p>better place to see. </p><p> Zow-w-w-w. Flup-p-p-p.</p><p> A bullet goes past my ear, and another</p><p>sticks into the ground a few feet short and </p><p>fills my bronc’s eyes full of sand. </p><p> “Bronc,” says I, “somebody desires our</p><p>de-mise. Let’s away.” </p><p> I sticks the spurs in his ribs, and races</p><p>down the hill. That cabin is the best cover </p><p>in sight and, while I may be a little ahead </p><p>of time, I feels that Magpie will forgive me. </p><p> I hits that door just ahead of a handful</p><p>of lead and sort of busts up the courtship. </p><p>The lady looks sort of sick, and when I </p><p>busts in Magpie pulls his guns. </p><p> “Everybody get down low!” I yelps.</p><p>“Who and what is it, Ike?” asks Magpie, </p><p>ducking when a bullet dusts some of the </p><p>mud from between the logs near his face. </p><p> “Danged if I know! They smokes me</p><p>up and chases me here.” </p><p> “Save me!” yelps the lady, sprawling on</p><p>the bunk. “I’m sick as-!”</p><p> Such language makes me glance up, but</p><p>I glues my eyes back to that crack again, </p><p>where I got some chinking pushed out. I </p><p>sees a bronc’s legs, so I elevates the muzzle </p><p>of my gun and salutes him. </p><p>A COUPLE of bullets whispers </p><p>through the logs, so I rolls over </p><p>past the bed. My elbow bumps on </p><p>something, and I glances down. </p><p> “Come here!” I yells. “Here’s a cellar!”</p><p>and I begins tugging at the carpet what </p><p>covers the door. If the carpet hadn’t been </p><p>ripped I’d ’a’ never found it. Magpie </p><p>skids over to me on his hands and knees, </p><p>and begins heaving on the handle. </p><p> “Don’t!” yelps the lady. “Don’t go down</p><p>there! There’s a—a—snake down there!” </p><p>“Preferable to hot lead,” I yells, and </p><p>slips over the square hole in the floor. </p><p> Magpie don’t wait to crawl down—he</p><p>hopped. Bang. A gun explodes right at </p><p>my lower extremity, and I feels that I got </p><p>to buy a new pair of suspenders. It sure </p><p>was close. I lets loose and drops about </p><p>seven feet. The door drops back and we’re </p><p>in darkness. </p><p>86 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Did I fall on yuh, Ike?” asks Magpie.</p><p>“You did not,” says I, groping around. </p><p>“Well, I fell on somebody,” he pro- </p><p>claims. “Got a match handy?” </p><p> I lights a match and sees Magpie setting</p><p>on a man’s stummick. The feller looks sort </p><p>of yaller in the face, and I don’t think he’s </p><p>got much fight left in his carcass. He’s </p><p>still got a gun in his hand, the same of which </p><p>we removes. Magpie looks him over and </p><p>snaps some bracelets on his wrists. </p><p> “Safety first, Ike,” says he. Another</p><p>match shows a rifle against the wall. Sud- </p><p>den-like Magpie remembers. </p><p>“Gosh, Ike! We’ve forgot the lady!” </p><p>There’s a box down there, which we hauls </p><p>over under the door. Magpie climbs up </p><p>and lifts the trap so we can see, and it sure </p><p>is some tableau. </p><p> The door is open. There stands that</p><p>feller Brand, with a grin on his face, and </p><p>behind him is all the Piperock population </p><p>that can crowd in. The lady is standing </p><p>there against the wall, and all to once she </p><p>drops her hand. </p><p> Bang, This Brand person’s gun comes</p><p>up and explodes, and the lady falls on her </p><p>face. Magpie moves some quick. He </p><p>flops out of that cellar, whirls on the crowd </p><p>with a gun in each hand. </p><p> “You danged coward!” he yelps at Brand.</p><p>“Shoot a defenseless woman, will yuh! </p><p>Drop your guns!” </p><p> Every gun in sight hit the ground, and</p><p>the lady staggers to her feet. </p><p> “Give me a gun,” she pants at Magpie,</p><p>but Magpie just stares at her. </p><p> I takes a look and stares a few lines my-</p><p>self. Her hair is on her shoulder—plumb </p><p>off her head, and the hair of her head is </p><p>brown and parted on the side. </p><p> “Uh—uh—” stutters Magpie.</p><p> Brand steps over and takes the guns out</p><p>of Magpie’s unresisting hands. Brand</p><p>turns to the partly scalped person: </p><p>“Better set down, Kid. You got plenty </p><p>of nerve, but we seem to have got you this </p><p>time, eh? Little pale around the gills.” </p><p>“Pale around the gills, eh?” snarls the </p><p>person. “Dang you, Brand, you would be </p><p>too. That blasted fresh sheriff busted in a </p><p>while ago without knocking and I had to </p><p>swaller my chew. I been too sick to fight.” </p><p>“Where’s Blazer?” </p><p> “In the cellar with irons on,” says I.</p><p>“We’d ’a’ had this Kid Corey, too, if yuh </p><p>hadn’t been so blasted previous. Any time </p><p>yuh don’t think this sheriff’s office is on the </p><p>job yuh got another think coming.” </p><p> “I suppose that’s why Simpkins threw a</p><p>gun down on me when I shot at the Kid,” </p><p>laughs Brand. “Did I hit yuh, Kid?” </p><p> “No, dang yuh! It burnt my ribs, so I</p><p>drops safe. I’m j ust getting over one chunk </p><p>of lead in the shoulder. That’s why I had </p><p>to let my hand down, Brand. It hurt like </p><p>thunder. I told that fool of a Blazer to lay </p><p>low with me, but he thought we had some </p><p>easy pickings around here. I kept cases </p><p>on the sheriff’s office, that’s about all I was </p><p>able to do. Didn’t I make a good female?” </p><p>“Magpie ain’t to blame,” says I. “I’d </p><p>’a’ likely fell, too, if I’d 'a’ been as sus- </p><p>ceptible as Magpie. He was wise to Blazer, </p><p>but not to the Kid. I reckon the money </p><p>is in that box in the cellar, ain’t it, Kid?” </p><p>“There ain’t no use lying about it—it is,” </p><p>he states. </p><p> “What I’d like to know is this,” states</p><p>Ricky Henderson, “who was we shooting </p><p>at? Was it Blazer or the Kid?” </p><p> “Neither one,” says I. “You was shoot-</p><p>ing at me. Danged fools try to take the </p><p>law in their own hands and mess tilings up. </p><p>Think the sheriff don’t know his business, </p><p>and—gosh, I sure do hate a posse.” </p><p> We deposits the Kid and Blazer in jail,</p><p>and then me and Magpie goes back to our </p><p>shack. I puts on some water for coffee, and </p><p>then turns to Magpie. </p><p> “Shall I make coffee like she did?” I asks.</p><p> Magpie lays his hat on the table.</p><p> “Ike, you make it according to the old</p><p>formula. I’m sick for a cup of real coffee.” </p><p>He smokes for a while and then— </p><p> “Ike, old-timer, we been a pair of fools.”</p><p>“Have been,” I agrees. “Lucky fools, </p><p>Magpie. Luck in finding that trap-door: </p><p>lucky that I didn’t give you ten whole </p><p>minutes alone with her—him. You might </p><p>’a’ proposed, Magpie. Aw, yes, you would, </p><p>old-timer, ’cause you was loco with love. </p><p>Did yuh kiss her—him, Magpie?” </p><p> “No-o-o. I was going to, Ike—honest</p><p>to gosh! But I sudden-like recognized that </p><p>picture, which we deciphers to be her dear </p><p>departed, and then I didn’t. Sabe?” </p><p> “Oh, ho! So you lost heart when yuh</p><p>recognized him, eh? Who was he?” </p><p> “Well, Ike, she didn’t lie about it—now,</p><p>did she? She only said he was a good man. </p><p>He sure was, Ike. Best they ever made.” </p><p>“I’ll bite. Magpie. Who was he?” </p><p>“Abraham Lincoln.” </p><p>Blood of tiu&gt; Allisons </p><p>Lyf/apsAuryZielx? </p><p>Author of “Tennessee Joe,” “The Bully of the Big Santee,” etc. </p><p>m </p><p>|E WAS eleven years ofd, and he </p><p>belonged to the aristocracy of </p><p>Tennessee’s mountains, on his </p><p>mother’s side of the house; his </p><p>father had been a good-looking and good- </p><p>natured, lazy North Carolina hillman to </p><p>whom a hound dog was of as much value </p><p>as a woman—which, after all, is saying </p><p>very little against his regard for women. </p><p>He lived, this boy, with his pretty widowed </p><p>young mother in a small cabin near the </p><p>head of the rather thickly settled valley </p><p>that is called Little Jerusalem, of which </p><p>“Daredevil” Delaney was king. </p><p> His mother sewed for their living, there-</p><p>fore they were poor enough. His wardrobe </p><p>consisted of two hickory shirts, two pairs </p><p>of brown jeans knee-trousers with four </p><p>genuine pockets to each, two suits of home- </p><p>made underwear, one pair of very red sus- </p><p>penders, and a gone-to-seed felt hat that </p><p>he wore turned straight up in front, des- </p><p>perado fashion. He scorned to chew to- </p><p>bacco, run from anybody, or tell an out- </p><p>right lie; and he swore fluently as a sort </p><p>of safety-valve, but his silent and patient </p><p>mother didn’t know it. This was the one </p><p>secret that he had ever kept from her. </p><p> Buckner Newland was his name. They</p><p>called him “Buck,” and he was inordinately </p><p>proud of it. It made him feel like a man. </p><p> Buck walked, this still and hazy October</p><p>afternoon, down the crooked and stony road </p><p>that led down the crooked and stony creek, </p><p>until he came to a small field of ripe corn. </p><p>87 </p><p>There he filched the biggest cornstalk he </p><p>could find, and then he hastened over to </p><p>the narrow stream, sat himself down beside </p><p>it, opened his bone-handled barlow knife </p><p>and began to whittle out the parts of a </p><p>water-wheel. </p><p> Made and set in the water correctly, you</p><p>know, a cornstalk water-wheel with a stick- </p><p>weed axle will run almost forever, unless</p><p>the creek gets up. Buck knew exactly how </p><p>to make and set them in the water correct- </p><p>ly. He was now planning to put one every </p><p>twenty yards the entire length of the </p><p>stream. </p><p> Suddenly his knife slipped and cut his</p><p>finger. He was just finishing. </p><p> “- the thing!” Buck exclaimed.</p><p> Quickly he felt a pang of guilt, and he</p><p>looked around to see whether anybody had </p><p>heard him who would tell his mother. </p><p>Though he frequently disobeyed her, being </p><p>blood of her blood and bone of her bone, </p><p>he held her in great reverence; she was the </p><p>whole world to him. </p><p> And there behind him, at the side of the</p><p>road, smiling just a little, was a strange </p><p>man of about thirty, who sat astride a sleek </p><p>and well-saddled black horse. The man </p><p>was dressed in blue serge, with a blue flannel </p><p>shirt and a slim black four-in-hand tie; he </p><p>wore a broad-rimmed black hat, and leggings </p><p>of yellow leather; he was sunburned and </p><p>strong-looking, and his teeth were big and </p><p>white and beautiful. </p><p> ‘All right!” snapped Buck, defiantly.</p><p>88 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> That was the Allison in him, which,</p><p>happily, predominated. </p><p> Then the stranger saw the boy’s bleeding</p><p>finger, and he seemed rather concerned. </p><p>He threw his horse’s rein over its head, </p><p>dismounted springily, drew a white hand- </p><p>kerchief from his pocket and advanced </p><p>upon Buck. </p><p> “Le’s tie it up, son,” he drawled in the</p><p>drawl of the hills. “And ef I was you, </p><p>son, I wouldn’t cuss no more. It sounds </p><p>rotten.” </p><p> Buck never forgot that he liked that man</p><p>the very first time he saw him. He sub- </p><p>mitted to having his finger bandaged. </p><p>Then he turned to the task of putting the </p><p>water-wheel .into the creek, and the man </p><p>watched him with interest. The wheel </p><p>soon began to run musically. </p><p> “Listen!” said Buck, enthused. “Listen</p><p>at ’er! Clippety-clippety-clip! Don’t she </p><p>go purty?” </p><p> “It shore does,” smiled the strange man.</p><p>He smiled easily. “What’s ye name, son?” </p><p>“Buck. Buck Newland.” </p><p> The other’s face became serious, went just</p><p>a trifle white. </p><p> “Newland,” he muttered, “Newland.</p><p>What was ye mother’s fust name?” </p><p> “Maty.”</p><p> “Which used to be Mary Allison? She</p><p>used to live here; she married Tom New- </p><p>land, o’ Nawth Ca’liner, and went home </p><p>with him to live, and Tom died; and she </p><p>moved back here a few days ago—am I </p><p>right, Buck?” </p><p> “Yeuh; ye’re shore right. Mother takes</p><p>in sewin’; the’s more folks lives here to sew </p><p>for, ye see, ’an the’ was lived in Nawth </p><p>Ca’liner. Mister, might I ax what yore </p><p>name is?” </p><p> The man watched the lad’s countenance</p><p>closely when he gave it— </p><p> “Delaney.”</p><p> But the name meant nothing to the boy.</p><p>Buck looked once more at the flying water- </p><p>wheel, then he grinned up at his companion: </p><p>“How’ll ye swap knives?” </p><p> “Even, and sight unseen,” came readily,</p><p>though he had already seen Buck’s. “Give </p><p>ye mine for your’n. Are ye game?” </p><p> “My middle name is game,” said Buck.</p><p>He swapped a fifteen-cent barlow for a </p><p>handsome dollar-and-a-half, stag-handled </p><p>jackknife! </p><p> “Ye don’t mean it!” cried Buck.</p><p> Again Delaney smiled.</p><p> “I reckon I do, son. So long, and good</p><p>luck!” </p><p> With that he mounted his horse and</p><p>galloped away. </p><p> It was the finest of all the knives that</p><p>Buck had ever seen. It drowned out all </p><p>interest in the monopoly of cornstalk water- </p><p>wheels that he had planned; even the finger </p><p>he had cut with the old barlow was for- </p><p>gotten. He ran toward home to show his </p><p>prize of prizes to his mother. </p><p> “Looky here!” he exclaimed as he dashed</p><p>in at the open cabin doorway. </p><p> Then he stopped short. There, talking</p><p>with his mother, was Little Jerusalem’s </p><p>herb-digger, fortune-teller, and newspaper, </p><p>old and wrinkled Granny Hood, with her </p><p>pipe of clay and her sourwood staff. She </p><p>was smoking like a burning brush-heap. </p><p>Buck saw that she wore a dark calico dress, </p><p>a red bandanna, and a red undershirt—at </p><p>least. </p><p> “What is it, Bucky boy?” asked Mary</p><p>Newland. </p><p> He went to her and showed her the knife,</p><p>He told her all that he had to tell about </p><p>his new friend. Mary Newland turned a </p><p>little pale at the name, even as Delaney </p><p>had gone a little pale at hers. She took </p><p>the handsome knife to the fire that smol- </p><p>dered in the wide-mouthed stone fireplace, </p><p>and consigned it to the live coals; then</p><p>she unwrapped the crimson-stained hand- </p><p>kerchief from her son’s injured finger and </p><p>was about to throw it, too, into the fire, </p><p>when Granny Hood called shrilly: </p><p> “Don’t Mary! It’s bad luck! It’s bad</p><p>luck to burn blood!” </p><p> Mary Newland dropped the handker-</p><p>chief to the hearth. Perhaps, she reasoned, </p><p>it would be better to wash it and send it </p><p>back, to let him know that she didn’t care </p><p>to be under obligations to him for even the </p><p>wrapping of a finger. </p><p>BUCK wondered at this. To Buck </p><p>it was the un-understandable. Dur- </p><p>ing all that century of time, his </p><p>mother had never said a word. The look </p><p>in her eyes had kept him from uttering a </p><p>protest. He turned to Granny Hood, as </p><p>though he expected her to tell him what </p><p>was the matter. The old scandal-monger </p><p>was by no means loath. </p><p> “That was Daredevil Delaney, boy,”</p><p>she croaked, “and he’s a plumb bad man. </p><p>He’s rich; he heired his daddy’s farm and </p><p>Blood of the Allisons </p><p>89 </p><p>big frame house at the lower end o’ this </p><p>here valley, whar he lives with his maw. </p><p>He owns timber, and cattle, sheeps, and </p><p>hosses. He’s as wild as a buck deer, and </p><p>he fights like a wildcat what a mad dawg </p><p>has bit, and he robs. The law don’t seem </p><p>to be able to git any proof on him. And </p><p>yit, I did hear o’ the county sheriff afore </p><p>this’n a sayin’ ’at Daredevil made about </p><p>the best law they could have out here-” </p><p> At this point Mary Newland interrupted</p><p>in a tremulous, white voice: </p><p> “That’ll be enough about Hale Delaney,</p><p>I	reckon, Granny Hood. Maybe you didn’t</p><p>know it, but I don’t ’low his name spoke in </p><p>my house, Granny.” </p><p> The peppery old woman rose on her long</p><p>staff, half-angry, and turned toward the </p><p>door. But she stopped and faced about. </p><p> “He was a fine young man ontel ye</p><p>throwed him down, Mary, and you know </p><p>it as well’s ye know night’s dark. He </p><p>hain’t never keered for nothin’ sence that </p><p>day. I reckon I won’t bother ye no more.” </p><p>“And I reckon I won’t cry about it,” </p><p>was the spicy reply of the young widow. </p><p> Granny Hood stamped her way out on</p><p>her sourwood staff. Mrs. Newland went </p><p>back to her sewing, but she seemed to do </p><p>everything wrong. Even Buck noticed it. </p><p>Finally a question took form in his mind, </p><p>and he decided to risk asking it. </p><p> “Mother, what made ye throw him</p><p>down?” </p><p> “It was afore I was married,” she said</p><p>solemnly. “We had the wo’st quarrel </p><p>in the world. I swore I never would speak </p><p>to him no more, and I never have. And I </p><p>never will.” </p><p> The truth of the matter was that she</p><p>had married for spite, as women—more </p><p>especially women of the mountains—do </p><p>now and then. For herself she had made </p><p>a thorny bed, but she had lain in it well, </p><p>oh, exceedingly well; which went far to</p><p>prove the soul of a martyr saint deep </p><p>down in the woman. She had the intense </p><p>nature, and the corresponding temper of </p><p>lightning-fire, of a people who had fought </p><p>themselves well nigh to extinction; and </p><p>she was still angry at Daredevil Delaney </p><p>because she loved him above everything, </p><p>except Buck, on earth. But she wouldn’t </p><p>admit it to herself. Never! You know how </p><p>women are with their love affairs. </p><p> Contrary to Granny Hood’s opinion</p><p>of the matter, Mary Allison’s “throwing </p><p>him down” had not made Delaney the </p><p>man he was. Had he married her, he would </p><p>have been the same wild, good-natured and </p><p>rollicking, free-blooded daredevil that he </p><p>was, though he probably wouldn’t have </p><p>gambled any. The greatest result of her </p><p>refusing to be his wife had been only that he </p><p>had remained unmarried. </p><p> Now this Delaney was not what one</p><p>might call bad. He simply saw that the </p><p>people of his neighborhood and neighboring </p><p>neighborhoods lived with a fair semblance </p><p>of correctness, that was all. If a man </p><p>was not providing for his family, he had a </p><p>warning; if he did not immediately mend </p><p>his ways, Daredevil Delaney gave him a </p><p>whipping that he did not soon forget. </p><p>Delaney caused men to pay their debts, </p><p>support the preacher, and buy more corn- </p><p>meal and bacon than yellow-corn whisky. </p><p> Of course, he had his enemies as well as</p><p>his friends; and, of course, there had been </p><p>committed grave crimes that had been </p><p>put at his door—which was inevitable, and </p><p>which often had placed him in jeopardy and </p><p>made his position one scarcely to be </p><p>envied. </p><p> “Mother,” suddenly asked Buck, “are</p><p>ye sick? Ye look like ye was.” </p><p> Mary Newland that was Mary Allison</p><p>turned her eyes upward from the sewing </p><p>that was now so difficult for her to do. </p><p> “I—I think I am, a little. I think I ought</p><p>’o walk out some, maybe/’ </p><p> She rose and dropped her sewing to her</p><p>chair; she put on her blue gingham bonnet, </p><p>and started for the door. </p><p>“Le’s go down to see my flutter-wheel,” </p><p>suggested Buck. “Y’ought ’o see it agoin’ </p><p>clippety-clippety-clip. Will ye, mother?” </p><p>“Maybe you’d better stay around home,” </p><p>said Mary Newland. </p><p> She passed across the threshold, and went</p><p>slowly toward the gate. </p><p> The boy stood in the cabin doorway and</p><p>watched her go with keen disappointment </p><p>in his clear brown eyes. It was very unlike </p><p>her to refuse to let him accompany her </p><p>anywhere. Buck did not know that, down </p><p>the valley and up a silent, hemlock-filled </p><p>cove, there was an old trysting-place that </p><p>was still to her a shrine—a great and </p><p>beautiful white beech tree laden with </p><p>golden yellow leaves, and under it a </p><p>bubbling spring bordered with sword-ferns </p><p>and laurel, while cut in the bark of the tree </p><p>were the almost grown-over initials, M. A. </p><p>90 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>and H. D. Nor did Buck know that the </p><p>old shrine was calling, calling to his mother </p><p>as it had never, never called before. </p><p> The lad walked down to the ripe corn-</p><p>field, took another big cornstalk, went back </p><p>to the cabin and borrowed a table-knife </p><p>from the cupboard, and made a cornstalk </p><p>fiddle. It was after sundown when Mary </p><p>Newland returned. </p><p> The following morning, she washed and</p><p>ironed Daredevil Delaney’s handkerchief— </p><p>and she did a job to be proud of—wrapped </p><p>it in a page of an old story-paper, and sent </p><p>Buck to the Delaney home with it. </p><p> “Go right to the house, and come right</p><p>back,” she instructed. “Don’t stay, and </p><p>don’t talk to ’em.” </p><p> “Wellum,” said Buck.</p><p> Once in the crooked road, Buck decided</p><p>that he was utterly too weary to walk such </p><p>a great distance—it was fully a mile; there- </p><p>fore he broke off a long, frostbitten iron- </p><p>weed for a sleek black horse, mounted it, </p><p>and rode at a gallop most of the way to the </p><p>Delaney frame house at the lower end of </p><p>the valley. The house set a hundred yards </p><p>from the road, and there were apple-trees </p><p>before it and to either side of it and march- </p><p>ing up the gentle slope behind it. It had </p><p>been painted white, and honeysuckles ran </p><p>over the front porch. A hound ran out </p><p>and growled at him, and the voice of </p><p>Daredevil Delaney promptly scolded it </p><p>back. </p><p> “Come on in, son,” said Delaney. “I</p><p>won’t let him bite ye.” </p><p> Buck went on. Delaney sat on the porch,</p><p>plaiting a rawhide band for his hat; he rose </p><p>and pushed his chair toward the boy. Buck </p><p>shook his head, and tossed the little package </p><p>into the other’s hands. Then he turned to </p><p>go- </p><p> “Wait, Buck,” smiled Delaney; and Buck</p><p>forgot orders from headquarters and waited. </p><p> To him that voice was magic; to him that</p><p>man stood for all that was big and line, </p><p>noble and bold. </p><p> Delaney began to open the package.</p><p>When he saw and recognized his own </p><p>handkerchief, now snow-white and im- </p><p>maculate and folded so very precisely, he </p><p>muttered under his breath— </p><p> “Allison.”</p><p> His strong face at once became a study.</p><p>It was almost as though he saw a ray of </p><p>hope. He went on, aloud— </p><p> “She wasn’t mad, was she, son?”</p><p> Again Buck forgot his instructions. He</p><p>answered readily: </p><p> “Yeuh, she was mad. She burnt up that</p><p>knife you gi’ me, and now I ain’t got no </p><p>more knife ’an a rabbit. Granny Hood </p><p>she said yore name was Daredevil; is it?” </p><p>Delaney ignored the question, and drew </p><p>a fifteen-cent, bone-handled barlow from </p><p>one of his trousers pockets. </p><p> “It shore ain’t fair for me to keep this</p><p>when you’ve got none,” he drawled; “here, </p><p>take it, Buck.” </p><p> The boy accepted it very gladly.</p><p> “Now wait,” said Delaney, “ontel I come</p><p>back.” </p><p>HE WENT into the house. </p><p>Through an open window in the </p><p>old-fashioned parlor, Buck saw him </p><p>place the folded handkerchief reverently </p><p>between the leaves of a big family Bible, </p><p>as though it were some frail, dead flower </p><p>connected with memories that were sacred. </p><p>Three minutes later, and Delaney came </p><p>back with his smiling little old mother, and </p><p>in her hands she carried a molasses cake </p><p>and a paper bag of red apples. </p><p> “This is her boy,” said Delaney. “He</p><p>looks like her, now don’t he?” </p><p> “As much as beans,” the feeble old</p><p>woman laughed weakly. She gave Buck </p><p>the bag of apples and the molasses cake, </p><p>and continued: “Sonny, tell ye mother </p><p>I’d be pow’ful glad ef she’d come to see me. </p><p>Tell her I’d come to see her, ef I jest</p><p>wasn’t so porely. La, la! But Mary Alli- </p><p>son used to be so purty that the sight of her </p><p>would might’ nigh it cyore sore eyes! I’d </p><p>shore like to see her, sonny.” </p><p> “She’s a heap purtier now ’an she ever</p><p>was,” declared Buck. “She gits purtier </p><p>and purtier ever}' day. Wimmen like her </p><p>don’t never git ugly—Lord, no! Some- </p><p>times I quit aplayin’ and go to the house </p><p>jest to have a look at her, she’s that con- </p><p>sarned purty-” </p><p> A bass voice that Buck had never heard</p><p>before interrupted, and it came from some- </p><p>where not far beyond the vines that almost </p><p>walled in the porch: </p><p> “I beg your pardon, Daredevil, and I sure</p><p>do hate to do it, but I got to arrest you in </p><p>the name o’ the law.” </p><p> It was one of the high sheriff’s lowland</p><p>deputies, and he walked heavily to the top </p><p>of the porch steps. Delaney’s countenance </p><p>flashed less serious. He almost smiled. </p><p>Blood of the Allisons </p><p>91 </p><p> “I reckon,” he replied, “ye don’t mind a</p><p>tellin’ me what I done.” </p><p> “You’re accused of beating old Curtis</p><p>Holden until he died from it, and robbing </p><p>him. Curtis Holden himself said so, told </p><p>a dozen before he winked out. It was </p><p>yesterday afternoon about four o’clock, in </p><p>Holden’s sitting-room.” </p><p> Delaney’s face now became serious again.</p><p>“Look here, Emmett, you know I </p><p>wouldn’t beat a’ old man like that. You </p><p>know I never done it. Holden might ha’ </p><p>reely thought it was me, what with his </p><p>imaginin’s and his nighsightedness and my </p><p>repitation, but it shore wasn’t me. I’m </p><p>white, Emmett, and you know it.” </p><p> “To tell you the truth, I don’t believe</p><p>you did it,” Emmett admitted; “but orders </p><p>are orders, and I got to arrest you.” </p><p> “I beg leave to differ with ye,” snapped</p><p>out Delaney. “To be arrested is to be sent </p><p>to the State prison for life—if I ain’t hung— </p><p>for somethin’ I didn’t do. To git down to </p><p>facts, you ain’t man enough, Emmett, to </p><p>put irons on me; and you wouldn’t shoot me, </p><p>acause you yoreself don’t believe I done it; </p><p>so how are ye agoin’ to arrest me, Emmett?” </p><p>The deputy did not draw a weapon </p><p>because he believed that he could accom- </p><p>plish more by means of his great strength </p><p>alone. Delaney was unarmed, and Emmett </p><p>was a big man; besides, Delaney knew </p><p>that the other wouldn’t shoot. Emmett </p><p>turned to the much-troubled Mrs. Delaney. </p><p> “Please step into the house,” he requested</p><p>kindly. </p><p> “Go, mother,” said the mountaineer;</p><p>and she went. </p><p> Buck Newland stood like a post, his face</p><p>as serious as a mask of Napoleon, and </p><p>watched every movement of the deputy as </p><p>he took handcuffs from his belt and ad- </p><p>vanced upon his man. Delaney’s eyes </p><p>flashed at the sight of the disgraceful irons; </p><p>he went suddenly white as he put out his </p><p>wrists as though to receive the manacles. </p><p>A look of satisfaction spread over Emmett’s </p><p>countenance. But Delaney seized the irons,</p><p>tore them from the other’s hands, and </p><p>jammed them into one of his own rear </p><p>trousers pockets! </p><p> For one second Emmett stared in sur-</p><p>prise. They sprang to the ground and </p><p>faced each other. To run from one man </p><p>was much against Delaney’s liking, though </p><p>the officer now had drawn a weapon. </p><p>Delaney dove under with the lithe quickness </p><p>of a panther; with his left hand he caught </p><p>Emmett’s gun-wrist, and with his right </p><p>he wrenched the revolver free; then he </p><p>struck the deputy a chest blow that stag- </p><p>gered him, stepped backward, and threw </p><p>the revolver over apple-trees and into a </p><p>blackberry thicket. </p><p> At this, the lowlander did a thing an</p><p>officer of the law never should have done: </p><p>he flew into a rage, gritted out an oath, and </p><p>struck at the hillman with a punch that </p><p>might have broken bones if it had landed. </p><p>From that moment it became a good, round </p><p>battle. Emmett was the stronger of the </p><p>two, but his adversary was electric. </p><p> They squared themselves and put up</p><p>their guards, much as lumberjack fighters </p><p>do. Buck stepped to the ground; his </p><p>molasses cake was squeezed almost flat </p><p>under one arm, and his face was flushed </p><p>with fiery interest. Emmett put himself </p><p>on the offensive at once; he struck, feinted, </p><p>struck again and landed on the other’s </p><p>shoulder, spinning him around. </p><p> “Hit him!” fairly screamed Buck. “Why</p><p>don’t ye bust him, Daredevil?” </p><p> Delaney recovered himself in a way that</p><p>delighted the boy. He had to fight now, </p><p>and for his life; to run from an unarmed </p><p>man was unthinkable, and he couldn’t be </p><p>arrested. He darted in, cleverly and de- </p><p>liberately slapped Emmett on the jaw and </p><p>drew Emmett’s arms upward, then broke </p><p>under with a mighty blow and drove the </p><p>deputy backward twenty feet. </p><p> “Dawg-gone!” yelled Buck. “That was</p><p>a lulu!” </p><p> By this time Emmett had forgotten all</p><p>about arresting Delaney; to the deputy </p><p>it had become a personal matter. He came </p><p>back with a hoarse bellow, like a maddened</p><p>bull, and struck half a dozen blows that </p><p>landed on nothing more solid than air. </p><p>Delaney gave him a punch on the point of </p><p>the jaw, and it dazed him for a moment. </p><p> “Pour it to him!” cried Buck. “Pour</p><p>it to him, Daredevil! Ye’ve shore got him </p><p>now, ef ye’ll only pour it to him!” </p><p> Emmett went at his adversary again,</p><p>and, using a part of Delaney’s own battling </p><p>tactics, knocked Delaney flat. The hill- </p><p>man lay there, supine, as though he were </p><p>unconscious, for a few seconds, and the </p><p>panting deputy watched him closely. Buck </p><p>Newland put the molasses cake and the </p><p>apples on the porch, took out his barlow </p><p>knife and opened it. </p><p>92 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Don’t ye hit him,” he told Emmett,</p><p>“while he’s down. Ef ye do, I’ll cut a hole </p><p>in ye.” </p><p> Delaney rose, came to life like a steel</p><p>spring, and the real battle began. For five </p><p>minutes they battered each other, and blood </p><p>flowed from their faces. Then Emmett </p><p>sought for a clench; his wind was weakening, </p><p>while Delaney was going faster than ever. </p><p>Delaney slipped on the grass, and Emmett </p><p>leaped to his back. But Delaney straighten- </p><p>ed his legs and had the giant on his hip; a </p><p>supreme effort, and the big lowlander was </p><p>thrown over Delaney’s head and into a heap. </p><p> Another moment, and the mountaineer</p><p>had taken the manacles from his pocket </p><p>and snapped them on Emmett’s wrists! </p><p> “You’re a man,” he said, smiling and</p><p>panting at the same time, “that I’d haf </p><p>to kill, to whip. I don’t want to kill ye, </p><p>Emmett. I’d sudgest that ye go back to </p><p>Sheriff Hanley and explain to him what a </p><p>merry job he’s agoin’ to have a-takin’ Hale </p><p>Delaney to jail.” </p><p> Without a word in reply, Emmett rose</p><p>and walked down the road, mounted his </p><p>horse, and rode toward Johnsville in the </p><p>flat country. When he was out of sight, </p><p>Delaney turned to Buck. </p><p> “How’d ye like that, son?”</p><p> “Fine!” Buck answered. “I wisht I was</p><p>a man.” </p><p> “But I hope ye’ll have more plain com-</p><p>mon sense ’an I’ve had, son,” muttered </p><p>Daredevil Delaney, very seriously, “when </p><p>ye’re a man.” </p><p> He sat down on the steps, bent his head,</p><p>and was very still. He was a fool for </p><p>having made the name he had made for </p><p>himself. To leave his invalid mother </p><p>entirely was a thing he could not do, and </p><p>they would arrest him sooner or later; </p><p>and when they did arrest him, his repu- </p><p>tation would cost him his life. </p><p> Mrs. Delaney came out and sat down on</p><p>the step above him. She put a wrinkled</p><p>old hand on his thick black hair, and she </p><p>too was very still. </p><p> The silence was too much for Buck. He</p><p>took up the presents the mother of Dare- </p><p>devil Delaney had given him, went down </p><p>to the dusty road, mounted his ironweed </p><p>horse and galloped toward home. To take </p><p>the cake and the fruit to his mother would </p><p>be to lose them, he knew; so he stopped at </p><p>the water-wheel and made a cache there </p><p>among the stones. </p><p> He didn’t show her the barlow knife,</p><p>either; he didn’t dare. But he told her </p><p>all that which Mrs. Delaney had said to </p><p>tell her, and he gave a very vivid account </p><p>of the fight. And the latter-named was </p><p>quite sufficient to cause Mary Newland to </p><p>scorch the bread they had for dinner. </p><p>CURTIS HOLDEN was not gen- </p><p>erally loved like a brother, but he </p><p>was an old man, and sentiment over </p><p>the county ran high against Hale Delaney. </p><p>Officers were soon combing the big hills for </p><p>him, and a substantial reward was offered. </p><p>Delaney remained in the Little Jerusalem </p><p>neighborhood, and he was put to his wits’ </p><p>end, day and night, to provide food for </p><p>himself and to elude the men who hunted </p><p>him singly and by twos and threes. It was </p><p>not the officers that he feared; the enemies </p><p>who hunted him for the sake of the reward, </p><p>the Judases—it was those whom he feared. </p><p>They knew the fastnesses of the mountains, </p><p>even as he knew them. </p><p> Then the meanest and most villainous of</p><p>all those enemies discovered Daredevil </p><p>Delaney’s hiding-place. It was high up </p><p>on the side of the western mountain, in a </p><p>nest of cliffs and boulders, and it was </p><p>impregnable to two, four, or six. Ten men </p><p>might take Delaney from that retreat, but </p><p>that would split the reward into ten parts. </p><p>This long-haired and lanky, cunning enemy </p><p>figured for hours to find out how many </p><p>times ten would go into a thousand, and </p><p>shook his head when he finally knew. Then </p><p>he laid a plan. </p><p> He had his slatternly third wife go to</p><p>Buckner Newland, the only boy in Little </p><p>Jerusalem who didn’t know her, with a </p><p>smooth tale. She found Buck playing </p><p>beside the cornstalk water-wheel, as usual. </p><p> “Listen at her,” said Buck. “Clippety-</p><p>clippety-clip! Don’t she go purty?” </p><p> “Sonny,” the woman began wheedlingly,</p><p>“do you know Daredevil Delaney?” </p><p>“Yeuh,” nodded Buck. “And I like </p><p>him wuss’n ’most anything. Why? They </p><p>ain’t got him, have they?” </p><p> “No, they ain’t got him. Well, his</p><p>mother she’s awful sick. About to die. </p><p>She wants him to sneak home to see her </p><p>jest as quick as ever he can. D’ye reckon </p><p>ye could find him and tell him? He </p><p>wouldn’t hide from you. He wouldn’t be </p><p>askeered o’ you, ye see. Tell him his </p><p>Cousin Lucy sent ye.” </p><p>Blood of the Allisons </p><p>93 </p><p> According to the plan, Delaney would</p><p>walk into the hands of the high sheriff. </p><p>For Delaney was the man to go to his </p><p>mother, if she were dying and sent for him, </p><p>though he hung for it. There were a num- </p><p>ber of tilings he held dearer than his life. </p><p> “Are you his Cousin Lucy?” asked the</p><p>boy. </p><p> “Yes,” hed Mrs. Tinker Davis III.</p><p>“Will ye go, sonny?” </p><p> “Ef I knowed,” said Buck, “whar to</p><p>look.” </p><p> The woman pointed.</p><p> “Ye see them big rocks away off up</p><p>yander? Ye might go up thar and look. </p><p>It’s shore a likely place.” </p><p> “I’ll go, shore,” Buck told her.</p><p> He rose, crossed the little stream on</p><p>stones, and dove into the laurels, and the </p><p>woman went down the road. In spite of </p><p>the ruggedness of the mountainside, and </p><p>in spite of the newly fallen chestnut burrs </p><p>that now and then pricked his feet painfully, </p><p>the boy reached the temporary haunt of </p><p>his god after an hour of traveling. </p><p> Instead of his finding Delaney, naturally,</p><p>Delaney found him. Buck had climbed </p><p>to the top of a low cliff, and was searching </p><p>the city of boulders above with all his eyes, </p><p>when Delaney spoke from a point a short </p><p>distance to his left. </p><p> “Well, son?”</p><p> The hunted man was pale and starved-</p><p>looking, and his gaze was so piercing that </p><p>it almost scared Buck Newland. Perched </p><p>on the brink of that little precipice, Buck </p><p>delivered the message of Mrs. Tinker Davis </p><p>III. word for word. Now the outlawed </p><p>Delaney had a Cousin Lucy, of course. </p><p> “What sort o’ lookin’ woman was she?”</p><p>he immediately wanted to know. </p><p> “She was dressed in yeller and red, and</p><p>she toted a spicewood toothbresh in her</p><p>mouth, and she had a wart on her nose.” </p><p>The man before Buck smiled worriedly. </p><p>“Wart on her nose; eh? Unlucky wart, </p><p>Missis Tinker Davis,” he growled. “That’s </p><p>shore a lowdown trick to try to play on me. </p><p>Anybody that’d try to do a trick like that, </p><p>Buck, is a—ought ’o be killed plumb dead. </p><p>Buck, you do me this here favor; go straight </p><p>to Missis Tinker Davis, the polecat, and </p><p>tell her I’ll make her wisht I’d tarred and </p><p>feathered her man, ef I live. Now be </p><p>keerful-” </p><p> A groan broke from his throat. Buck</p><p>had started back down the little cliff, and </p><p>Buck bad lost his hold and fallen. There </p><p>was no outcry, and this fact frightened </p><p>Daredevil Delaney. He rushed to the </p><p>brink and peered over. Crumpled down </p><p>there on the dead leaves was the inert figure </p><p>of his one-time sweetheart’s barefooted, </p><p>tow-headed boy, with a tiny trickle of </p><p>crimson lying across his white and up- </p><p>turned face. </p><p> Delaney climbed down hurriedly. He</p><p>knelt and took Buck’s head and shoulders </p><p>to his knee, and with his handkerchief wiped </p><p>away the blood that had come from a </p><p>wound in the lad’s temple. </p><p> “Son,” he mumbled agonizedly, thickly,</p><p>tears filling his eyes, “son! Ye ain’t dead, </p><p>are ye, son?” </p><p> There was no answer. He put his ear</p><p>to the youthful chest, and heard laintiy </p><p>the beating of the youthful heart. He </p><p>believed Buck was dying; the heartbeats </p><p>were much too faint, it seemed to him. </p><p> “Ef Tinker Davis don’t pay for this,”</p><p>he said in a voice that was bleak, “oh ef </p><p>Tinker Davis don’t pay for this!” </p><p> For to him it was no accident. He</p><p>gathered the limp little body up in his </p><p>arms, with the law and its minions and all </p><p>his enemies forgotten, and began to move </p><p>rapidly, with the surefootedness of a </p><p>panther, down the rugged steep and into </p><p>danger. He well knew how that life he </p><p>held against his breast was valued. If it </p><p>went out for him—for his sake—he well </p><p>knew what that would mean, too. A </p><p>prayer went up from the soul of him that</p><p>the boy might live, and at the bottom of it </p><p>there was nothing selfish. </p><p> He crossed the brook at the water-wheel,</p><p>waded it with his boots on when he might </p><p>have crossed on stones, and he noted </p><p>absently that the wheel was still running—• </p><p>clippety-clippety-clip. Into the crooked </p><p>road he turned, and Sheriff Hanley, hidden </p><p>alone a little away down the valley, saw </p><p>him and put spurs to his horse. Riding </p><p>up beside Delaney, he leveled his revolver </p><p>at the small of his back. </p><p> “You’re under arrest, Daredevil. I’ve</p><p>got you.” </p><p> Delaney didn’t stop. He turned a white</p><p>and desperate face toward the officer. </p><p>“Come on wi’ me, Sheriff,” he replied. </p><p>“You can have me as soon as I’ve took this </p><p>boy home. I never have broke a promise.” </p><p>Sheriff Hanley leaned over and snatched </p><p>his prisoner’s revolver from its holster as </p><p>94 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>he rode on beside him. At the Newlands’ </p><p>gate he dismounted and left his horse with </p><p>its rein hanging, and followed the other man </p><p>into the cabin. Mary Newland rose at </p><p>their sudden entrance, and her sewing </p><p>dropped to the floor. Delaney went </p><p>straight to the bed, and put the raglike </p><p>form down on an old pieced coverlet. </p><p> “He fell—” he began, and could say no</p><p>more. </p><p> Buck's mother knelt beside him, and</p><p>just then Buck came to. His wound was </p><p>not serious. For a moment he stared at one </p><p>and then at the other of the two men. He </p><p>knew the sheriff; the officer had been </p><p>pointed out to him. Quickly he put </p><p>things together, and he understood fully. </p><p>Then he fastened accusing eyes on the face </p><p>of the representative of the law, and his </p><p>voice came slowly, in words that cut— </p><p> “Mister Sheriff, ye’re a-yeller dawg.”</p><p> “Buck,” his mother reproved, half-</p><p>sobbing. </p><p> Delaney, filled with gratitude, looked at</p><p>the woman. She rose, and returned the </p><p>look. It was a very peculiar look. Then </p><p>the officer put his hand on his man’s </p><p>shoulder, and Delaney muttered this: </p><p> “I said ye could have me. So ye can.”</p><p>They took Daredevil Delaney to Johns- </p><p>ville, where they lodged him in the strongest </p><p>cell they had. Many, many were those </p><p>who visited the jail for a glimpse of him. </p><p>A newspaper man came up from Knoxville, </p><p>tried to get him to talk and tried to photo- </p><p>graph him—and failed all around. </p><p> Court was in session at Johnsville, and</p><p>Delaney’s trial was called without delay. </p><p>The sentiment of the general public had </p><p>grown even higher against him, and those </p><p>who were considered versed in such matters </p><p>openly predicted that he would soon </p><p>straighten out a hangman’s rope. </p><p>THE day of the trial was hazy, and </p><p>the snap of Autumn was in the air. </p><p>Everybody that was anybody in </p><p>Little Jerusalem went; Buck Newland and</p><p>his mother rode in chairs in the back of old </p><p>Abner Lane’s ox-wagon. Half of Mary </p><p>Newland had been trying to persuade her </p><p>that she wouldn’t help Hale Delaney to </p><p>save his immortal soul, while the other </p><p>half had been telling her that she must </p><p>save him—if she could. Perhaps this was </p><p>why she sat down with her boy midway </p><p>of the crowded courthouse. </p><p> An elderly man with billygoat whiskers</p><p>and a broad, bare upper lip sat next to the </p><p>young widow and her son, chewed store- </p><p>bought tobacco and spat through a knot- </p><p>hole in the floor, and berated Daredevil </p><p>Delaney for all he was worth. One-half </p><p>of Buck’s pretty mother rejoiced at it, and </p><p>the other half resented it. All of Buck </p><p>resented it bitterly. </p><p> “You’d be askeered to talk that way,”</p><p>suddenly blurted the lad, “ef he wasn’t </p><p>whar .he’s at. And you wouldn’t talk that </p><p>away ef I was as big as you, neither.” </p><p>“Buck!” said Mary Newland. </p><p> She had never heard him declare himself</p><p>so strongly in favor of Delaney before. </p><p> “That little rat’s pizen mean,” the billy-</p><p>goat-bearded man laughed to his neighbor. </p><p> “I ain’t no rat!” flared the boy, spirit-</p><p>edly—and out came his barlow knife; it was </p><p>the Allison in him. “And ef ye call me </p><p>that any more, I’ll shore cut ye to the </p><p>windpipe!” </p><p> “Buck!” Mary Newland moaned,</p><p>shocked; but she needn’t have been sur- </p><p>prised, for it was only the Allison in him. </p><p> He wasn’t called a rat again. She caught</p><p>him by the arm, and drew him over to </p><p>her. </p><p> “Son,” she whispered queerly, “do ye like</p><p>Hale Delaney?” </p><p> Buck looked her squarely in the eyes.</p><p> “Like him? I love him.”</p><p> Then the trial began. The evidence was</p><p>most damaging. Curtis Holden’s dying </p><p>statement counted heavily. Counsel for </p><p>the defense proved that Holden was half- </p><p>blind, and that it was nearly dark in </p><p>Holden’s sitting-room at four o’clock in</p><p>the afternoon, but all that seemed to </p><p>impress the jury but little. Delaney’s </p><p>reputation was very bad. </p><p> It was short. Soon the judge was</p><p>charging the jury, and it was not in favor </p><p>of the accused. </p><p> Just as the charge was being finished,</p><p>Mary Newland rose—and Buck followed </p><p>her—and went up to the judge. She was </p><p>sworn, and she took the witness stand for </p><p>the prisoner, who could hardly believe he </p><p>saw correctly. And there she did that </p><p>which to the woman of the mountains is </p><p>next to death: she bravely told the world </p><p>of her early love affair with. Hale Delaney, </p><p>and of their bitter quarrel; of her marrying </p><p>for spite, and of her lying for five years in </p><p>the bed of thorns she had made; of her </p><p>Heathens </p><p>95 </p><p>struggle to support herself and her son; of </p><p>the burning of the knife that Hale Delaney </p><p>had given to the boy. </p><p> Then she told of her going to the old</p><p>beech at the bubbling spring, the old beech </p><p>that had their initials cut in its white bark; </p><p>she told of watching Delaney renew those </p><p>initials with the knife that had been her </p><p>boy’s, and of watching him for a long time </p><p>while he sat there and thought of the very </p><p>things that were in her own mind. </p><p> And that had been from three to five o’clock</p><p>on the afternoon of October fourth, the very </p><p>time of Curtis Holden’s assault and robbery! </p><p> Mary Newland withstood the most</p><p>grilling cross-questioning; they couldn’t </p><p>entangle her. Counsel for the defense </p><p>made his argument again, and this time it </p><p>had strength with the jury. Delaney was </p><p>acquitted; received a kindly lecture from the </p><p>judge, and promised to remember it. </p><p> When he looked for Mary Newland that</p><p>had been Mary Allison, she was gone back </p><p>to her cabin in Little Jerusalem. He </p><p>bought a marriage license and followed her. </p><p> Buck Newland and his mother sat by a</p><p>bright log fire, roasting chestnuts, that </p><p>chill mountain evening, when a rap came </p><p>at the door. Buck called out a cordial </p><p>“Come in!” The door opened, and Hale </p><p>Delaney entered; he walked straight to </p><p>the stone hearth, knelt before her who had </p><p>been his first and only sweetheart, and took </p><p>up both her hands. </p><p> “This is the fust time I’ve ever bent my</p><p>knees to anything mortal in the universe, </p><p>Mary,” he said. “I’m askin’ ye to </p><p>marry me.” </p><p> Allison looked across to Allison. The</p><p>boy’s eyes twinkled hopefully in the fire- </p><p>light, and she remembered his saying in </p><p>the courthouse: “I love him.” She lifted </p><p>the kneeling man’s hands to her lips and </p><p>kissed them; she bent her head to his </p><p>shoulder, happy because hate was dead. </p><p> “I’ve burnt enough blood,” she told him.</p><p>“I’ll marry ye, Hale.” </p><p> The next week Delaney was made a</p><p>deputy sheriff, and the week after that </p><p>he arrested Tinker Davis for the robbery </p><p>and murder of Curtis Holden. And Mrs. </p><p>Tinker Davis III. wished, before it was </p><p>over, that Daredevil Delaney had tarred </p><p>and feathered her husband instead. </p><p>Heathens </p><p>btf Gordon Y&gt;ung </p><p>Author of “The Serpent's Phrase," “Ms Wonders to Perform,'' etc. </p><p>MHE young stranger—Rideout was </p><p>his name, a nephew of “Buck” </p><p>Rideout, the planter—sat on </p><p>the outrigger of a beached </p><p>canoe and stared at the dark-hued Tavau, </p><p>who stood some distance away as she coyly </p><p>poked the sand with her toes and glanced </p><p>up from time to time with artful shyness. </p><p> “Women,” said “Lean Jake,” removing</p><p>his pipe and scratching his chin with the </p><p>mouthpiece, “women is all alike.” </p><p> Having delivered that favorite bit of</p><p>wisdom, he replaced the pipe and continued </p><p>to watch Rideout, who was ready enough </p><p>to carry the flirtation forward, but hesi- </p><p>tated a little, being embarrassed by the </p><p>96 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>presence of Jake and myself as we stretched </p><p>in the shade beside the shanty bar and idly </p><p>looked on. </p><p> “Nice boy,” Jake said some minutes later</p><p>after the enticing Tavau had walked out </p><p>of sight in the pandanus grove with the </p><p>breeze immodestly pulling her calico gown </p><p>against her body; and after Rideout had </p><p>followed her, but with an effort to appear </p><p>merely wandering at random. </p><p> “Nice boy,” Jake repeated, “but he’s</p><p>leamin’ fast—leamin’ fast.” </p><p> Jake called it “lar-r-nnin’,” and disguised</p><p>many other words in much the same way; </p><p>but he spoke from the wisdom of sixty-odd </p><p>years, more than forty of them spent below </p><p>the equator. For all of his years, he was </p><p>built like six feet some inches of taut </p><p>hawser. An old-time sailor he was, but </p><p>beardless, slow of movement and speech, </p><p>and as full of yarns as ever a man was who </p><p>has roved. No doubt some of those yarns </p><p>were true. </p><p> “But he’s leamin’ fast,” Jake went on,</p><p>nodding his head toward the grove. “He’s </p><p>twenty-some hours on the island and hasn’t </p><p>been bit by a cannibal yet. He thought </p><p>they’d be ugly as the pictures always is </p><p>that missionaries send back to help raise </p><p>funds, and then Tavau gets her eyes on him. </p><p>And he just simply can’t hardly believe his </p><p>own eyes ’cause she acts like some of the </p><p>girls back home—only does it better. Yes. </p><p>He’s leamin’ fast. </p><p> “And he thinks the devil won’t sign him</p><p>up for no longer cruise on the sulfur lake </p><p>for an hour or so with this heathen than for </p><p>hours or so with other Marys he’s forgot </p><p>quick-like; and her bein’ a heathen it don’t </p><p>make no difference no-how. Uh-huh, he’s </p><p>got a lot to learn, too.” </p><p> The Rev. Ollivant and his niece, Miss</p><p>Rankin, would have been shocked to know </p><p>that Jake called Tavau a heathen; for </p><p>didn’t she wear a calico gown instead of a </p><p>yellow tipula and lavolava? The mission- </p><p>aries thought the wrapper much more </p><p>civilized than a breast-cloth, usually tucked </p><p>under the chin to be out of the way, or else</p><p>failing its purpose with every puff of wind </p><p>when not tucked up; and the lavolava </p><p>had never been devised that did not appear </p><p>on the verge of dropping from the shapely </p><p>legs it concealed. </p><p> “Uh-huh, he’s got a lot to learn,” Jake</p><p>repeated-..thoughtfully, again glancing to- </p><p>ward the grove. </p><p>JAKE had a wild and extravagant </p><p>yarn for special confidences about </p><p>having known and fought under the </p><p>chief who had been Tavau’s grandfather; </p><p>of having held a musket to the heads of an </p><p>enemy boat-crew as he sailed away in the </p><p>starless night for whatever port God willed, </p><p>to keep Tavau’s grandmother, Numoo, </p><p>from being the prize as she had been the </p><p>cause of that obscure Homeric war wherein </p><p>her husband fell beneath a jagged club. </p><p> Numoo must have been a fiery and</p><p>resolute woman if she did not only what </p><p>Jake, but legend as well, reported of her. </p><p>She was said to have stood watch with the </p><p>musket when Jake needs must sleep; and </p><p>the ancient gods of her Tongian people </p><p>answered her prayers, for the canoe reached </p><p>a not unfriendly island where Numoo was </p><p>welcomed and the crew, at. her vengeful </p><p>request, was promptly beheaded. </p><p> Numoo married a chief and at last</p><p>succeeded in nagging him.into war for her </p><p>revenge; but he fared badly because the </p><p>missionaries were busy in his domain and </p><p>reported him to the British Government </p><p>as a turbulent, blood-thirsty fellow who had </p><p>killed some of their converts. A gunboat </p><p>scattered his war canoes and Numoo was </p><p>again a widow. </p><p> She prayed that the unborn child would</p><p>be a son, and went daily deep into the forest </p><p>to an idol hidden from the jealous mission- </p><p>aries; but the bulging-eyed god answered </p><p>her with a daughter, whom, to keep from </p><p>the missionaries, she carried to another </p><p>island and raised in the faith of her tribal </p><p>gods. The white men — traders, beach- </p><p>combers, colonists and inevitable mission- </p><p>aries—crowded even that island; but the </p><p>daughter, Naima, was instructed in the old </p><p>Tongian faith. As she grew up into her </p><p>teens she was wooed in the divers ways of </p><p>the white men, with, however, less success </p><p>than the amorous adventurers often have.</p><p> But to make Lean Jake’s epic brief:</p><p>after the mother’s death Naima married </p><p>the handsomest of the unconverted natives, </p><p>who happened to be a Samoan; and to the </p><p>great amusement and scandal of the island </p><p>a few years later she clubbed him out of his </p><p>own hut when the missionaries finally saved </p><p>his soul, largely through the efficacy of a </p><p>job—so delightful to Samoan vanity—of </p><p>bossing in the construction of some thatched </p><p>huts for the missionary station. But Tavau, </p><p>the seven-year old daughter, was forcibly </p><p>Heathens </p><p>97 </p><p>taken from the incorrigibly heathenish </p><p>mother and given into Christian hands; </p><p>and later she was sent to the Rev. Ollivant </p><p>and his niece as a mission girl at Niko. </p><p> That was ten years before; but in the</p><p>South Seas seven years plus ten bring a </p><p>girl to maturity of body and to all the </p><p>instinctive subtleties of womanhood every- </p><p>where. </p><p> There is another dramatic chapter to</p><p>this history, a chapter that I suspected of </p><p>being apochryphal and added for the </p><p>benefit of the big German trader, Schwartz. </p><p>Ever since Tavau came to Niko he had </p><p>been after her; and Jake opportunely </p><p>either invented or remembered the chapter </p><p>in which Tavau’s mother, shortly before </p><p>her death, had driven a fishing spear into </p><p>the belly of an overly gallant trader who, </p><p>inevitably enough, had been a German— </p><p>since Jake detested all German traders and </p><p>planters—but who, by a most remarkable </p><p>coincidence, had been named Schwartz. </p><p> “I never seen him myself,” Jake had</p><p>drawled to the group of listeners in the </p><p>shanty bar as he finished this new episode </p><p>of his oft-reeited Odyssey, “but Schwartz, </p><p>just supposin’ you pull up your shirt-tail </p><p>and let’s have a look?” </p><p> Schwartz cursed angrily and stamped out,</p><p>almost shaking the earth with his bulky </p><p>tread, while our laughter followed him into </p><p>the moonlight. All of us thought that </p><p>Jake had neatly put over an elaborate </p><p>joke, and Schwartz was not popular. </p><p>TAVAU was half-Samoan, and the </p><p>Samoans are the coquettes of the </p><p>South Seas. The Tongans them- </p><p>selves—though not quite civilized, or rather </p><p>Christianized—are a paradox: in wrath </p><p>they are undoubtedly as fierce as any tribe </p><p>that touches the Pacific, but their disposi- </p><p>tion is such as to have won for their group </p><p>of islands the geographical designation of </p><p>“friendly.” </p><p> Tavau was an outrageous flirt for all of</p><p>her calico wrapper, hymnals and quaint </p><p>tutoring of native tots in Biblical lore. </p><p>When anywhere near the missionaries or</p><p>elder converts, this precious little hypocrite </p><p>of seventeen tropical Summers was un- </p><p>smiling and serious as a nun; but with </p><p>half a chance she flirted, and for the same </p><p>reason that a parakeet suns and preens its </p><p>brilliant feathers. </p><p> Tavau knew all of Jake’s story, possibly</p><p> excepting the apocryphal chapter; and she</p><p>often queried him for infinite details as to </p><p>her mother and grandparents, though </p><p>perhaps in her inmost mind she doubted, </p><p>as some of us did, the entire tale. The </p><p>Rev. Ollivant and the efficient Miss Rankin </p><p>solemnly assured her that it was unlikely </p><p>there was a word of truth in the story. </p><p>But Tavau, hungering for the legends of </p><p>her scattered tribe, quested among Jake’s </p><p>memories for more and more details, when, </p><p>as frequently, she crept to his side in some </p><p>remote thicket. There she stared wistfully </p><p>into the shadows while he repeated the old, </p><p>old tale. </p><p> What all else Jake may have talked about</p><p>to her I do not know; but often he said </p><p>something like this to me: these mission- </p><p>aries come out here from people that have </p><p>had two thousand years of the Bible and </p><p>aren’t Christians yet. They expect these </p><p>heathens to take a bath, put on Mother </p><p>Hubbards and never again feel the wild </p><p>blood that can’t be got rid of except by a </p><p>knife that opens their veins and lets it </p><p>run out. </p><p> “Ever see a Christian nigger when the</p><p>wood drum booms the devil-devil dance? </p><p>He’s just like a good healthy fish that sud- </p><p>denly wakes up and finds he’s been sleeping </p><p>on the beach about ten feet above where </p><p>the little waves are running along over </p><p>the sand, whispering and looking for him. </p><p>And there’s the forest, older than the Bible, </p><p>where every leaf’s a tongue chanting the </p><p>ancient songs—where the ghosts of old </p><p>cannibal chiefs are darting through the </p><p>shadows, beating drums and sounding </p><p>conches that white men can’t hear. And </p><p>we white men—don’t we get it so strong </p><p>that we come tumbling out of the cities, </p><p>forget the prayers learned in the cradle, </p><p>and go knocking about the world? </p><p> “It takes mighty little to make a</p><p>heathen—mighty little in this climate,” </p><p>Jake usually said when bringing one of his</p><p>ethnological lectures to an end. </p><p>II </p><p>IT WAS some time before Jake </p><p>and I realized that we had that </p><p>afternoon watched the first scene </p><p>of a little South Sea drama. A few days </p><p>later a Queensland labor-trader put into </p><p>Niko short-handed from a little skirmish </p><p>with reluctant laborers over at Santa </p><p>98	Adventure</p><p>Cruz—the natives there were cannibals, </p><p>fierce and wary—and Jake was taken on as </p><p>mate and I went along. </p><p> When we came back the village hummed</p><p>with gossip and rumors. </p><p> Buck Rideout was the richest planter</p><p>on ten islands. He thought missionaries </p><p>were only one degree removed from witch- </p><p>doctors, but he was a stern moral man </p><p>himself and had contempt for “white </p><p>niggers," as he called the fathers of half- </p><p>breeds, whether or not there had been a </p><p>marriage ceremony. </p><p> Some of the gossips said that young</p><p>Rideout had knocked his uncle down in a </p><p>quarrel over Tavau. </p><p> This rumor was founded largely on the</p><p>fact that Buck Rideout had worn a bandage </p><p>about his head when he came wrathfully </p><p>to the Rev. Ollivant and told him that if </p><p>he did not keep that young Mary-preacher </p><p>from his nephew there would be one female </p><p>less to sing-sing at prayer-meeting. </p><p> However, regarding the cause for the</p><p>bandage, some—the less scandal-loving on </p><p>the island—said that a ripe coconut had </p><p>fallen on his head. </p><p> Anyway, he came to complain of Tavau,</p><p>and her name was bandied on the beach. </p><p> “They’ve got her locked up tighter ’an</p><p>a clam in its shell and they’re after sendin’ </p><p>her off on the missionary ship that’s due </p><p>next month,” one fellow indignantly ex- </p><p>plained to me. “Just as though ever’ girl </p><p>in the parish back up there where they </p><p>make missionaries don’t go for a moonlight </p><p>stroll with some lad that likes her and </p><p>her him.” </p><p> We who loafed on the beach were what</p><p>is called in some quarters pretty “broad- </p><p>minded;” and in our indignation nobody </p><p>referred to the fact that converted native </p><p>girls are forbidden to go out after sundown, </p><p>and that Tavau had resorted rather fluently </p><p>to pious lies to get out—saying she was </p><p>to visit a sick sister-Christian or to tell </p><p>Bible stories to a doubting household. </p><p>And not once did I hear anybody suggest </p><p>that both the Rev. Ollivant and Miss</p><p>Rankin were painfully aware of the ease </p><p>with which white men parted from native </p><p>girls, and that the missionaries might really </p><p>be on the watch-out for Tavau’s comfort </p><p>of mind as well as security of soul. </p><p> True enough, young Rideout was not a</p><p>beach-comber, trader, or even a planter. </p><p>He was just a stripling of twenty or there- </p><p> about, full of the curious impulses and</p><p>strange intensities of youth, who had come </p><p>out to live with his bachelor uncle and, </p><p>eventually, to inherit the plantation. </p><p> The Rev. Ollivant had only past experi-</p><p>ences to guide him; and among those had </p><p>never been such a figure as this boy, who </p><p>was neither fugitive, adventurer nor </p><p>tourist. </p><p> Some man who wrote a book that was</p><p>left around one time where I had nobody </p><p>to talk to and nothing else to read, said </p><p>that from infancy to maturity the human </p><p>being reflects in a minute way the entire </p><p>evolutionary history of the race. </p><p> I remember only three of his many</p><p>citations: one was that the new-born </p><p>infant has strength enough in its tiny </p><p>fingers to support its weight by clinging </p><p>to a trapeze, which is a throw-back to </p><p>arboreal days when our ancestors lived </p><p>in trees and the babe had to hang on to </p><p>its mother or drop; another was that the </p><p>instinctive cruelty of children of about </p><p>eight to fifteen, their urge to play at </p><p>fighting and their joy in weapons, reflects </p><p>the savagery through which the race has </p><p>passed; and the other, that the extravagant </p><p>sentimentality and emotional devotion of </p><p>the youth from around sixteen to twenty </p><p>when he is in love—as he usually is— </p><p>attests the shadowy presence in his brain </p><p>cells of the famous old knights errant who, </p><p>in the age of chivalry, jousted mightily </p><p>with their ladies’ garter, or veil, or glove, </p><p>at the lance’s haft, and quixotically for- </p><p>swore even principalities to win the smile </p><p>and hand of some maid who capriciously </p><p>put them to strange quests and vows. </p><p> Young Rideout was not over twenty and</p><p>I reflected that the knights errant must be </p><p>holding a magnificent tourney under his </p><p>cranium if he would crack an ax handle </p><p>over the head of his uncle, endanger the</p><p>very valuable plantation, and set the beach </p><p>gleefully a-roar with his talk of “real love,” </p><p>all because a native girl, who, but for a </p><p>little less fulness of the lips, was not unlike </p><p>hundreds back in the bush that danced, </p><p>howling and naked, in the moonlight feast </p><p>of cannibals. </p><p> But even with all the reports I heard,</p><p>Jake gathered something more and swore </p><p>that he believed it, too. However, Schwartz </p><p>being a German, I knew that Jake would </p><p>believe anything to his discredit. The </p><p>report that Jake believed came straight </p><p>■ Heathens </p><p>99 </p><p>from a reliable source—or as straight as </p><p>anything ever could come from the mission </p><p>to the bar shanty. </p><p> That is, Ollivant told the native preacher,</p><p>who was overheard swearing his wife to </p><p>secrecy by one of the mission girls, who </p><p>told a boy that she wished to favor, who </p><p>told his elder brother because naturally </p><p>he had to tell somebody; and the brother </p><p>told Jake for a secret drink of gin. That </p><p>wise law, enforced by the full majesty of </p><p>British authority, which permits a white </p><p>man all the liquor on earth if he can get it, </p><p>but which makes the punishment severe </p><p>for giving or selling so much as a drop to </p><p>a native, assures the beach-comber of always </p><p>having the wherewith to extract favors </p><p>from black boys. </p><p> It seemed that Schwartz, ever with his</p><p>eyes on Tavau, was quick to suspect that </p><p>she had tossed her witchery over young </p><p>Rideout. Schwartz, bulky as ah ox and </p><p>with a beard that was likely to get tangled </p><p>in the bush at night, had begun soft- </p><p>footedly to spy on her. </p><p> “Him fella Torti,” was as near as Jake’s</p><p>informant could manage the German’s </p><p>name; but the rest of the story had come </p><p>in native dialect, for Jake knew enough </p><p>native dialects to have filled a half-dozen </p><p>South Sea dictionaries. </p><p> Schwartz had discovered that when</p><p>Tavau was supposed to be proselyting, </p><p>or even when supposed to be on her mat </p><p>asleep, she stole out and met Rideout. </p><p> “Instead of doing as anybody but a</p><p>Deutscher would have done,” Jake con- </p><p>temptuously told me, “and have kicked </p><p>the boy to - and away from her and </p><p>sat down hisself, the Deutscher went to </p><p>Ollivant and says he believes it his duty </p><p>to inform the missionary of what’s going </p><p>on, because he, Schwartz mind you, is a </p><p>Christian, though rheumatism don’t let </p><p>him get to church often as he would like. </p><p>Yes. Schwartz believes in looking out for </p><p>native morals-” </p><p> Jake expatiated most of the night on</p><p>Schwartz’s tale-bearing; and convinced </p><p>himself while trying to» convince me that </p><p>Schwartz—“Tip’cal Deutscher”—had car- </p><p>ried his story to the missionary with a good </p><p>deal of cunning. Jake said that Schwartz </p><p>reasoned this way: here is a good chance </p><p>for me to let the missionary know what a </p><p>fine Christian gentleman I am; and with </p><p>Tavau’s reputation badly soiled, it will </p><p>appear magnanimous of me later on to offer </p><p>to marry her. The missionary will be </p><p>grateful to me because he will want to be </p><p>rid of her any way—so she will be pushed </p><p>right into my arms. </p><p> “And,” Jake concluded, “what’s one</p><p>marriage more or less to a Deutscher!” </p><p> I did not take any stock in Jake’s de-</p><p>ductions, or in the circumambulated story </p><p>on which they were based—not until about </p><p>a week before the mission ship was due, </p><p>when the shanty bar rang with laughter </p><p>over the latest and best joke. </p><p> How the truth of the matter got out</p><p>I never knew; but undoubtedly by a relay </p><p>of native mouths, ending with a drink or </p><p>two of gin for the last. Anyway the report </p><p>we heard was as near the truth as anything </p><p>ever is in the South Seas; and along toward </p><p>midnight a few of the more reckless fellows </p><p>made their way to Schwartz’s shack and </p><p>endeavored to offer condolences through </p><p>the walls of plaited palm leaves. </p><p> It seems that Schwartz, knowing that</p><p>the mission ship on which Tavau was to </p><p>be sent away would be along soon, saw </p><p>there was no time to lose, and fitting </p><p>himself out with some attention to personal </p><p>appearance, he had gone to the Rev. </p><p>Ollivant and offered to relieve him of all </p><p>anxiety as to Tavau’s future. </p><p>THE missionary could be hood- </p><p>winked and taken in by the dullest </p><p>native, but he knew pretty much </p><p>about whites. He was ordinarily a gentle, </p><p>soothing soul, with a hard substratum of </p><p>stubbornness, however, and a wholly un- </p><p>suspected ability to express himself in </p><p>anger. </p><p> He had blasted Schwartz with the wrath</p><p>of the prophets; and, as eminently became</p><p>his calling, he had spoken nothing but the </p><p>truth in telling Schwartz that he was a </p><p>“venomous hypocrite,” “a secret-drinking </p><p>whisky barrel of iniquity,” that it were </p><p>better to lay any girl, native or white, “in </p><p>her unhallowed grave” than to give her </p><p>into his “lecherous arms.” </p><p> And in the course of his comments,</p><p>however, the Rev. Ollivant disclosed the </p><p>information that Tavau was not being sent </p><p>away because she was no longer loved in </p><p>the mission, or because she was “dis- </p><p>graced”—for she was loved and she wasn’t </p><p>disgraced—but because young Rideout was </p><p>unreasonably set on marrying her against </p><p>m </p><p>IOO </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the wishes and orders of his guardian </p><p>uncle; but that if Tavau were to be given </p><p>in marriage to anybody it would certainly </p><p>be to the young man who had “beseeched” </p><p>her hand with “the light of purity in his </p><p>tearful eyes” and a “heart undefiled with </p><p>beastial lust.” </p><p> Schwartz had been rather bewildered.</p><p>It is hard for a German to believe that </p><p>things can go otherwise than the way he </p><p>plans that they shall; but it did dawn on </p><p>him finally that the missionary had an- </p><p>swered in the negative, and returning to his </p><p>shack he had taken to his low-built bed with </p><p>a bottle of whisky. </p><p> The condolence delegation shied a few</p><p>shells against the matting that served as </p><p>walls to let Schwartz know that it had </p><p>arrived. </p><p> “Oh, Schwartzy, we come to dance at the</p><p>weddin’ that ain’t to be,” some one called. </p><p> “Too bad, Schwartz, when you took a</p><p>bath and all that,” another contributed. </p><p> “Nobody loves a fat man,” another fiend</p><p>chanted, and was loudly corrected by— </p><p>“A fat Christian shentleman, you mean.” </p><p>“Gottdam go vay,” Schwartz bellowed, </p><p>growling and muttering. </p><p> A reply was what the condolence dele-</p><p>gation wanted; and it jeered, mocked and </p><p>taunted, goading the big trader into fury. </p><p> But this sport soon grew stale: Schwartz</p><p>only repeated the same oaths and made </p><p>the same threats, and the tormentors had </p><p>used up their jibes. </p><p> Then somebody with a sense of the</p><p>dramatic called out convincingly: </p><p> “Oh, Schwartz, young Rideout’s here.</p><p>Come on out and congratulate him. Be a </p><p>sport, come on.” </p><p> No answer followed, but the muttering</p><p>stopped behind the mats. </p><p> “Rideout says if you don’t leave his girl</p><p>alone he’ll tie your heels to the back of</p><p>your neck and leave you out in the bush,” </p><p>another imaginative fellow added. </p><p> A huge, almost naked, bushy-faced white</p><p>figure burst from the house. </p><p> “Vere iss he! Vere iss he?” Schwartz</p><p>cried, brandishing a large automatic. </p><p> “There he is,” one of the thoughtless</p><p>grinning devils shouted, pointing at a </p><p>sailor who had come along to see the fun, and </p><p>who had stood discreetly in the back-ground. </p><p> At the first shot the sailor—an innocent</p><p>stranger to our port—went into the air </p><p>with a yell and came down some fifteen feet </p><p>away with steam up and sails crowded; </p><p>and he traveled so fast that, as one of the </p><p>fellows afterward said, you had to throw </p><p>your glance about forty feet ahead to see </p><p>him go by. </p><p> Schwartz floundered forward, cursing</p><p>and shooting drunkenly. He soon stopped </p><p>for breath and the lack of a target, then </p><p>blundered back toward his shack, calling </p><p>upon God to hear his oaths and strike him </p><p>dead if he failed to cut Rideout’s heart </p><p>away and eat it! </p><p> “Uh-huh,” said Lean Jake when he</p><p>heard of it,” it takes mighty little to make </p><p>a heathen. Mighty little in this climate. </p><p>And that Deutscher got murder in him. </p><p>Uh-huh.” </p><p> The missionary ship having run for a week</p><p>before a gale arrived a day or two sooner </p><p>than was expected. </p><p> That afternoon Lean Jake sat on his sea-</p><p>chest oiling his long pearl-handled, single- </p><p>action old revolver; and as usual when </p><p>caring for the veteran companion of his </p><p>roaming days, he was oddly silent. It was </p><p>as though intercourse incommunicable to a </p><p>third party was passing between them, </p><p>and despite its years in that land of torpid </p><p>dampness where metal oxidizes as quickly </p><p>as clothes mildew, not a fleck or scar of rust </p><p>was on it. </p><p> From time to time he would go to the</p><p>doorway and view the weather with a sea- </p><p>man’s eyes; but he made no comment </p><p>until I hopefully suggested that it would</p><p>clear up. He answered— </p><p> “You’re right—worse luck,” and not</p><p>another word did I get out of him until </p><p>after sundown when he said casually, </p><p>“I’m going for a little walk. Maybe a </p><p>week ’fore I’m back. Maybe more. Maybe </p><p>a month.” </p><p> It was a month or so before I really</p><p>understood, but early the next morning </p><p>I had my suspicions. </p><p> Young Rideout and Tavau had eloped</p><p>during the night and disappeared into the </p><p>bush. </p><p> There was a great to-do—much running</p><p>about and searching. Though the drizzle </p><p>had lasted until around midnight—when a </p><p>brilliant moon came out—there was not </p><p>much trouble in finding the trail; but the </p><p>footprints of the boy and girl had vanished </p><p>as if by magic after a few miles. The </p><p>vanishing point, I surmised, was where </p><p>Jake had met them. Though a sailor and </p><p>Heathens </p><p>101 </p><p>a good one, he was crafty in forest lore; </p><p>whereas those two children, if left to them- </p><p>selves, would have splashed about miserably </p><p>all through the night and have been over- </p><p>taken shortly after sunrise. They would </p><p>probably never have thought of wading </p><p>up-stream. </p><p> The search was hard and earnest. Buck</p><p>Rideout offered twenty pounds to whoever </p><p>found his nephew. The missionaries were </p><p>as agitated over Tavau as they were over </p><p>the boy, for though there were no cannibal </p><p>tribes living back in those hills, canoes full </p><p>of them frequently blown out of their course </p><p>arrived from other islands, sometimes from </p><p>long distances, and held dances and feasts. </p><p> A large searching-party started out, some</p><p>intent on the reward and others enjoying </p><p>the excitement. The native boys scam- </p><p>pered gleefully through the brush; and I </p><p>did not believe there was one among them </p><p>who, if he had come upon the fugitives, </p><p>would not have at once warned and aided </p><p>them. It might have been different if </p><p>the boys’ minds could have visualized the </p><p>beads, calico, tobacco, fishing hooks, mir- </p><p>rors and ironware that twenty pounds </p><p>represented. </p><p> The searchers soon split into a score of</p><p>parlies, rushing about in twos, threes and </p><p>half-dozens; and for the most part having a </p><p>lark of a time, though the missionaries and </p><p>Buck Rideout were threatening and en- </p><p>treating. </p><p> Near where the trail vanished I suddenly</p><p>came upon Schwartz arguing earnestly with </p><p>Iako, a withered old bushman, who, though </p><p>peaceable enough, held aloof from the “One </p><p>God” people; but he had come along on </p><p>the search for the same reason that black </p><p>boys or white follow the crowd. Iako was </p><p>not liked by the missionaries—it being </p><p>reported that he was one of those ancient </p><p>fellows who made a practise of slipping </p><p>out through the forest to the hidden and </p><p>deserted shrines of the old tribal gods. </p><p>And as I moved by unseen my listening ears </p><p>caught falling from Schwartz’s mouth </p><p>extravagant promises of tobacco and even </p><p>brandy for some service or other which </p><p>I did not hear mentioned.</p><p> It was a month before the search stopped.</p><p>It never really stopped, for to this day I </p><p>believe boys go slipping through the forest </p><p>wondering where are the bones of Tavau </p><p>and her white lover. But in even less than </p><p>a month the searchers lost hope. Evidence </p><p>that sent most everybody scampering back </p><p>out of possible dangers was found of war- </p><p>parties from savage islands. </p><p> Their beached canoes had been seen in</p><p>the distance from the hill-tops; and though </p><p>Rideout, Ollivant and some of the mission- </p><p>aries from the ship, with armed and braver </p><p>natives, later went from one end of the </p><p>island to the other, they could not. come </p><p>upon either the savages whose canoes had </p><p>been seen from afar, or traces of the boy </p><p>and girl. It was supposed that young </p><p>Rideout and Tavau had been captured and </p><p>. . . One doesn’t think of what happens </p><p>afterward. </p><p> During that time when there was much</p><p>excitement and so many parties were out </p><p>for days together, the absence of any one </p><p>from the village was only casually noticed, </p><p>if at all, and was no cause for comment. </p><p> It was only when the searching was about</p><p>over, and almost everybody was back and </p><p>loafing around as usual, that the beach </p><p>began to wonder what had become of </p><p>Schwartz and Lean Jake. </p><p> Then I awoke one morning and found</p><p>Jake, who was about as noiseless as a cat </p><p>anyway, stretched on his bunk. </p><p> A labor-recruiting schooner, which did not</p><p>seem very anxious for Niko’s boys, however, </p><p>had slipped into the harbor during the night; </p><p>and I judged that Jake had come on her, in </p><p>view of the fact that she was a stranger and </p><p>could not have got a pilot until moftiing. She </p><p>would have had to wait outside if there had </p><p>not been somebody on board who knew the </p><p>reefs and channels as well as Jake did. </p><p> It was some time before I could get him to</p><p>talk. For days he wandered off or sat around </p><p>meditatively smoking, sometimes staring out </p><p>across the sea at the strange schooner, some- </p><p>times standing with arms folded behind him </p><p>and looking into the shadowy depths of the </p><p>forest that climbed up and up until it crested</p><p>the mountains. </p><p> On the fourth morning the recruiting-</p><p>schooner stood out to sea. Jake watched </p><p>her out of sight, then called to me. ■ </p><p>III </p><p>I NEVER knew Lean Jake to tell </p><p>a lie that I wouldn’t have readily </p><p>told myself; but I have sometimes </p><p>felt that his sense of the dramatic in his </p><p>narratives was never embarrassed by what </p><p>actually happened. Judge for yourself: </p><p>102 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Tavau had sent him a note several days</p><p>before the missionary ship had arrived, </p><p>saying that she and Rideout would elope </p><p>and take to the bush the first night that </p><p>the ship put into the harbor. She knew </p><p>that it would be gone again in a few days </p><p>and would not return for three months. </p><p>In the name of Namoo, her grandmother, </p><p>to whom Jake forty years before had given </p><p>a fighting allegiance, she invoked his help— </p><p>and got it. Jake had already taken a strong </p><p>fancy to the boy, and always he had been </p><p>Tavau’s slave. </p><p> As I had surmised, he arranged to meet</p><p>them at a point where the trailers could not </p><p>possibly associate his footprints with theirs. </p><p>They entered a stream and waded for miles </p><p>and hours until reasonably sure of having </p><p>evaded pursuit because the natives—all </p><p>except the bushmen who are rarely found </p><p>except on the larger islands—are not adepts </p><p>in forest lore. Then the little party struck </p><p>out over a pig trail. </p><p> At first Tavau had drawn the calico</p><p>wrapper high and tucked it around her </p><p>waist to be out of the way of her legs; </p><p>but it kept getting loose, so she tore it off </p><p>and wound it into a short lava-lava. When </p><p>the moon came out she snatched a handful </p><p>of scarlet flowers from an hibiscus and </p><p>stuck them into her hair. Then from some- </p><p>where in her memory there stirred the old </p><p>tribal songs of war and love that Naima, </p><p>her mother, had chanted to her from the </p><p>time she first lay crooning on a mat; and </p><p>as the moon lifted itself to the dome of the </p><p>sky, she rushed into a grassy open space </p><p>and leaped about, swaying her body and </p><p>throwing her hands to the rhythm of the </p><p>wild songs. </p><p> Rideout stood and watched her. He had</p><p>never seen anything like it. Then the </p><p>magic of the moon, of youth and love and </p><p>the joy of having her at last, loosened his </p><p>bashfulness before Jake, and he began to </p><p>sing out and playfully to sway the ax he </p><p>carried—“to build their nest with back in </p><p>the bush,” he had told Jake. He tried to </p><p>catch her, and soon he was leaping about </p><p>and whooping almost as madly as she. </p><p> Around and around they circled and spun,</p><p>wild with youth and love, and instinctively </p><p>celebrating their joy in that same bounding </p><p>play and rhythmic shouting that no doubt </p><p>startled the newly-created animals in the </p><p>forests of Eden when the father and mother </p><p>of us all first awoke and found themselves </p><p>alive. Then tired, exhausted, they sprang </p><p>at each other with open arms; and they </p><p>sank to the grass, gripped in a mutually </p><p>tense embrace, and lay panting with mouth </p><p>against mouth. </p><p> “ ’T was safe as any place for the night,”</p><p>Jake explained, “and they was too tired </p><p>for the damp to hurt ’em, so I got in a dry </p><p>spot under a banyan and dozed off.” </p><p> The next morning the boy and girl said</p><p>that they were too stiff and sore to move, </p><p>and coaxed Jake to let them rest in the </p><p>warm sun; so, knowing that the searching- </p><p>party had not had time to get within range </p><p>of the sound, he shot a pig for breakfast, </p><p>and the first word that popped from </p><p>Tavau’s laughing bps as he brought it in </p><p>was “bokolo”—instantly with her warning </p><p>eyes she told Jake not to let the boy know </p><p>what it meant. “Long pig” is a cannibal’s </p><p>Anglicized euphemism for human flesh, and </p><p>“bokolo” is the native’s word for the same </p><p>thing. </p><p> Tavau threw away the drab, wet, tom</p><p>calico and wove herself a heavy garland </p><p>of leaves—a kind of lava-lava; and when </p><p>Jake left them to climb a peak nearby and </p><p>scan the coast on the opposite side of the </p><p>island from the village, she was making </p><p>fun of Rideout’s mud - spattered, tom, </p><p>stained, white duck trousers, and her </p><p>nimble fingers were busy on a lava-lava of </p><p>pandanus leaves—for him! </p><p> When Jake came back Schwartz lay on</p><p>the grass, his head cleft to the chin, and </p><p>the boy, naked but for the girdle of leaves </p><p>about his loins, was squatting over the </p><p>bloody ax and staring dully at the dead </p><p>man. </p><p> Tavau vainly petted and praised and</p><p>scolded, but the boy’s brain was numbed: </p><p>the knowledge of what he had done over- </p><p>powered and stupefied that unhardened, </p><p>sensitive mind, schooled ancestrally for a </p><p>thousand years in the commandment— </p><p>“Thou shalt not kill.”</p><p> Iako was squatting beside him, grinning</p><p>ecstatically with bared toothless gums, and </p><p>cackling praise. </p><p> “Im fella stop along palienti goot kaikai,”</p><p>the old savage shouted at Jake, and pointed </p><p>to the corpse. </p><p> He had suggested that one horrible, and</p><p>nearly unmentionable thing that makes the </p><p>blood of even the most evil white man run </p><p>cold—kaikai is to eat! </p><p> Jake would have killed Iako on the spot—</p><p>Heathens </p><p>103 </p><p>and came near to doing it—if Tavau had </p><p>not begun to pour out the story which </p><p>told how that grinning old savage had, after </p><p>all, really .saved Rideout’s life. Iako had </p><p>explained it all to her. </p><p> Schwartz had hired Iako to trail them</p><p>down for him, and had made no secret of </p><p>the hope to kill Rideout on sight. Precious </p><p>little Iako cared whether one white man </p><p>killed another. Schwartz had promised </p><p>big pay in terms that Iako could under- </p><p>stand, and the old bushman had merely </p><p>followed up-stream, mile after mile, until </p><p>his sharp eyes found their trail leaving the </p><p>water as he had known he must find it </p><p>eventually if he did not overlook the mark- </p><p>ings. And a bushman overlooks nothing. </p><p> But as they sneaked upon the boy and</p><p>girl, Iako had heard Tavau chanting one of </p><p>the old, old fetish songs; and coming closer </p><p>lie had seen Rideout leaping about as Iako </p><p>himself had leaped before many a maiden </p><p>in the long ago. He was an exile, a lone- </p><p>some outlander among the Christianized </p><p>natives of Niko, and the thought had burst </p><p>within his head that if the “One God” </p><p>people took converts from natives, maybe </p><p>the old gods that he still worshiped could </p><p>be restored to power and prestige by taking </p><p>converts from the whites. </p><p> Schwartz, evidently aware that he was</p><p>a poor shot, seemed intent on creeping as </p><p>close as he could before firing. </p><p> Iako suddenly jerked the gun from his</p><p>hand and screamed a warning, at the same </p><p>time darting away and attempting to shoot </p><p>Schwartz. But it was a bewitched weapon </p><p>—an automatic with an unreleased safety, </p><p>of which the old savage knew nothing. </p><p> Schwartz was badly frightened and had</p><p>started to run, but when Tavau tauntingly </p><p>leaped near him, he had turned, snatched </p><p>up a heavy stick cut for the fire and dashed </p><p>at Rideout. </p><p> The boy, who never in his life had had</p><p>other than a playground fight, stood help- </p><p>less, aghast; but Tavau sprang between </p><p>them and tugged at the powerful German’s </p><p>arm.</p><p> Schwartz shifted the club and held her,</p><p>passionately pulling her up to his bearded </p><p>mouth. </p><p> She screamed.</p><p> Then young Rideout wildly caught op the</p><p>ax and struck. </p><p> In her struggles against Schwartz, Tavau</p><p>had torn the shirt from his breast; and as </p><p>he lay on the grass there was exposed on </p><p>his right side, just below the ribs, a long, </p><p>uneven scar as though—years before—a </p><p>jagged weapon had torn at his abdomen. </p><p> Jake hurried them away as isoon as pos-</p><p>sible, not because he was afraid they would </p><p>be found—for only an accident, or eyes </p><p>sharp as Iako’s could bring any one to that </p><p>particular spot—but because he had sighted </p><p>a canoe on the distant beach; and besides </p><p>he felt that the boy would go mad if he </p><p>stared much longer at the dead man. </p><p> | THAT night Jake left Rideout, who</p><p>teas* was even then a little out of his </p><p>ljZ_Sihead, and Tavau well back in the </p><p>bush while he and Iako crept forward in the </p><p>moonlight to see who had come in the canoe </p><p>and what they were doing. </p><p> It was pretty near as he had suspected</p><p>and exactly as he had guessed when Iako’s </p><p>sharp eyes identified the gorged, sleeping </p><p>figures lying about on the beach as tribes- </p><p>men from an island slightly east of Niko </p><p>who held an inveterate grudge against the </p><p>Santa Cruzians. A big raid had been made </p><p>on Santa Cruz and scores of prisoners taken </p><p>from the Quosoli tribe; but a heavy gale </p><p>coming up on the trip home, the fleet of </p><p>war-canoes had been scattered, and the </p><p>warriors in this one, dashed from their </p><p>course and hungry, had put in at the north- </p><p>western shore of Niko to hold a feast. </p><p> Prisoners had evidently been plentiful,</p><p>for six were left alive, securely tied, and </p><p>stretched in a row, while about them the </p><p>food-drunken guards slept like the rest of </p><p>the war-party. </p><p> Iako and Jake cut the prisoners loose;</p><p>then with difficulty convinced them that </p><p>it was dangerous to try to slaughter the</p><p>sleeping enemies that would be aroused </p><p>if a single blow wounded instead of killed. </p><p> Tavau and Rideout were brought down</p><p>to the canoe which was shoved off without </p><p>so much as a yell from the stranded warriors </p><p>who, anyway, were likely enough picked </p><p>up in a day or two by other members of </p><p>the scattered war-fleet. </p><p> The Quosoli, a bad lot themselves, made</p><p>straight for home; and a favorable wind </p><p>helped them along. Jake remained awake </p><p>most of the time, alertly on watch, for </p><p>though the Quosoli said that they were </p><p>grateful a Quosoli is likely to say many </p><p>things that he does not mean. </p><p> Tavau was frantic with worry over</p><p>104 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Rideout who sat for hours on hours with </p><p>an idiotic stare in his eyes. She argued </p><p>and scolded, and like a true maid of the </p><p>South Seas, was unashamed to show before </p><p>the crew how intensely she loved the boy. </p><p> Commandeering what mats there were</p><p>to make him comfortable, seizing the nearly </p><p>empty bamboo water-pipes and telling the </p><p>thirsty crew to drink out of the ocean, she </p><p>fussed over him like a mother over a sick </p><p>baby. And all the while she drew won- </p><p>derful pictures of the idyllic life they would </p><p>live in the bush of Santa Cruz; and some- </p><p>times at night, when the air was cool, </p><p>stirred a flicker of response with her </p><p>caresses and buoyant words. </p><p> Also hour after hour old Iako sat clucking</p><p>and chattering, happy to be among people </p><p>who worshiped gods that could be seen </p><p>and talked to, and not a vague Fellow top- </p><p>side the sky bowl. </p><p> They reached the island of the Quosoli,</p><p>whose village sets at Bundy Bay—Bloody </p><p>Bay, it is often called, and which in spite </p><p>of the massacres that had taken place was </p><p>often visited by labor-recruiters. </p><p> The party no sooner landed than the</p><p>savages, brandishing spears and seven-foot </p><p>bows, wanted to eat the foreigners, black </p><p>and white; but the returning Quosoli </p><p>explained to a little wizened old chief </p><p>whose mummy-like chest was covered by </p><p>the insignia of rank—a white disk, large </p><p>as a dinner-plate, cut from a giant clam </p><p>shell—and he took them as his guests. </p><p>That is, he took all except Iako, whom, so </p><p>Jake thought, they promptly carried off </p><p>and cooked, for he was not seen again; </p><p>and that night a big feast was held for the </p><p>returned warriors. </p><p> Moreover, Tonogo, the chief’s eldest son,</p><p>a stalwart fellow twice his father’s size with </p><p>a stone ring big as a doughnut through his </p><p>nose, came around smacking his greasy lips </p><p>and staring amorously at Tavau while he </p><p>proffered a revolting hunk of steaming meat </p><p>on a tray of fresh plantain leaves. Jake </p><p>said that he could tell by the odor that it </p><p>wasn’t pork. </p><p> Tavau merely ignored him at first, then as</p><p>he persisted, tearing away a piece of the meat </p><p>with his fingers and pressing it against her </p><p>mouth, her temper flared and she angrily told </p><p>him to go away. But her blazing anger only </p><p>made her the more beautiful, for her bare </p><p>breast heaved and the bright eyes snapped </p><p>as her head was thrown back haughtily. </p><p> Tonogo grinned, dropped the piece of</p><p>meat into his own mouth and stared ad- </p><p>miringly while he leisurely chewed on it. </p><p> He turned to Jake and said in the</p><p>wretched patois that natives conceive as </p><p>being English: </p><p> “Bimeby me fella kaikai Englis fella.</p><p>Make Mary stop along Tonogo. You fella </p><p>stop along him.” </p><p> And having some humor in him he</p><p>laughed, but not pleasantly, for he evi- </p><p>dently meant what he said, i. e., that when </p><p>the time came and he got ready, he would </p><p>kill the boy, Rideout, and Jake, too, then </p><p>take the girl. </p><p> Rideout was sick and fairly out of his</p><p>head. Tonogo could see that. He went </p><p>away, then came back with a witch-doctor </p><p>whom Tavau would not let get within an </p><p>arm’s length of the boy—not even when the </p><p>old chief himself, strangely solicitous over </p><p>his guest, appeared and assured her that </p><p>this particular witch-doctor held high </p><p>powers of life and death. </p><p> “Which was pretty much so,” Jake said,</p><p>“for there be no slicker poisoners than the </p><p>Quosoli devil-devil doctors.” </p><p> Jake surmised that the old chief was</p><p>cunningly hospitable to them because he, </p><p>the chief, had reason to believe that a Brit- </p><p>ish gunboat was coming along in the slow </p><p>but angry way that British gunboats have </p><p>of coming after a missionary has been killed; </p><p>and Jake gathered from words dropped </p><p>here and there that a new missionary had— </p><p>as usual among the Quosoli—been killed </p><p>some three months before, but that the </p><p>chief hoped the “Government” would </p><p>believe he had died of dysentery, especially </p><p>if two white men were found alive and well </p><p>treated in the tribe. </p><p> The Quosoli are dirty, treacherous, amaz-</p><p>ingly cunning, and as ugly-faced as a race </p><p>of poisoners are likely to be. They are </p><p>notoriously inveterate cannibals, filthy and </p><p>lazy; and on the first night Jake overheard </p><p>Tavau praying impatiently in English to </p><p>the “One God” to make her boy well so she </p><p>could have him, and to send plenty hell-fire </p><p>and like-Job-boils on the dirty witch- </p><p>doctor that brought crushed spiders in a </p><p>skull bowl to smear the sick boy with; </p><p>and very emphatic was her request that a </p><p>similar visitation plague Tonogo, who had </p><p>squatted around talking love while she sat </p><p>fanning the feverish face of the boy that </p><p>had her heart. She further called attention </p><p>Heathens </p><p>105 </p><p>to the fact that this was a no-good island and </p><p>that she wanted plenty quick to get off it. </p><p> The next morning she told Jake the same</p><p>thing. She was sure that the boy was </p><p>going to die if he did not get away. There </p><p>was also much more dangerous than mere </p><p>illness, to be feared; but he was worse, </p><p>too—he was weak and crazy as a bat. </p><p> Tonogo came around and grinningly</p><p>touched the ringlet of hair he had twisted </p><p>with fiber cord so that it dangled stiffly </p><p>down the side of his face, and he said some- </p><p>thing which Jake did not catch. But </p><p>Tavau turned almost pale. </p><p> The twisted ringlet indicated that be-</p><p>tween midnight and dawn Tonogo had taken </p><p>an inexorable vow, one that he could never </p><p>forget with that ringlet dangling remind- </p><p>ingly against the side of his face; one that </p><p>he must accomplish or perish in the attempt. </p><p>And the ringlet could never be cut until the </p><p>vow was fulfilled. </p><p> Tavau did not send him away that</p><p>morning. He squatted beside her and </p><p>talked. She laughed a few times. Flies </p><p>settled undisturbed on Rideout’s face as </p><p>she looked half-smilingly into Tonogo’s. </p><p>The next morning they went off together </p><p>and were gone most of the day. </p><p> Jake said that the savage in her just oozed</p><p>out and covered her from that time on. </p><p> The following night there was another</p><p>feast—a stray bushman had been caught— </p><p>and against Jake’s urging, Tavau decked </p><p>herself out in flowers and threaded shells </p><p>and joined the dancing girls. </p><p> After that Jake heard no more prayers</p><p>to the “One God,” nor further complaints </p><p>about the no-good island, and she was the </p><p>wildest heathen on the beach; though </p><p>occasionally she would rush in with Tonogo, </p><p>glowering, at her heels and stroke Rideout’s </p><p>face for a moment, begging him to recognize </p><p>her. </p><p> Jake said it was a clever play to heighten</p><p>Tonogo’s jealousy—and it did. </p><p> Jake tried to guard Rideout night and</p><p>day, even picking out the green cocoanuts </p><p>from which he drank lest Tonogo, aided </p><p>by the witch-doctor, might poison the boy. </p><p>If a missionary could die of “dysentery” </p><p>after being brained by a war club, why not </p><p>this stranger if he passed out quietly under </p><p>the witch-doctor’s charm? Jake would </p><p>still have been left to show the “Govern- </p><p>ment” that the Quosoli did not harm white </p><p>men. </p><p>BUT a labor-recruiter put into the </p><p>bay before the gunboat. The skip- </p><p>per was new to the South Seas, but </p><p>he was careful, as most men had to be in </p><p>those days if they grew old; and he did </p><p>not come on shore at all, but parleyed </p><p>with the disarmed natives on his deck </p><p>when they swarmed into the roped-off </p><p>quarters. </p><p> The old chief firmly refused to let Jake</p><p>go on board or even go down to the beach </p><p>where he might be seen from the ship; and </p><p>a guard, headed by Tonogo himself, was put </p><p>over the hut. Rideout could hardly stand </p><p>on his feet so there was little fear of his </p><p>getting in range of the white man’s magic </p><p>eyes—binoculars. Tavau could go where </p><p>she pleased. </p><p> Tonogo, as if to make assurance doubly</p><p>sure regarding Jake, sent him and tlie guard </p><p>back into the bush and clear out of sight of </p><p>the village. </p><p> Jake was certain that he would find</p><p>Rideout dead when he returned, for it </p><p>seemed too favorable a chance for Tonogo </p><p>to overlook. But Jake knew there was no </p><p>possibility of evading the watchful savages. </p><p>He propped himself against a palm bole </p><p>and sat there motionless until late in the </p><p>afternoon, when another party of warriors </p><p>joined that which had squatted sus- </p><p>piciously around him. Then he was told </p><p>to get up and come with them; and as </p><p>though afraid that he might make trouble, </p><p>several of the savages took the pains to </p><p>keep their spears near his back. </p><p> They rushed him along the neck of</p><p>land circling the harbor, ordered him into </p><p>a canoe and made him lie down; then set </p><p>out frantically for the schooner which was </p><p>getting under way. He could get no </p><p>answers for his questions, though he knew</p><p>very well that somebody was fooling with </p><p>the orders of the old chief who had not </p><p>wanted the labor-recruiters to think white </p><p>men could live overnight among the </p><p>Quosoli. He wanted the gunboat to think </p><p>so; but labor-recruiters were discouraged </p><p>in every way. </p><p> The schooner hove to and waited.</p><p> The skipper, looking over the side, showed</p><p>no surprise at seeing a white man in the </p><p>bottom of the canoe. </p><p> As soon as Jake went over the ladder the</p><p>skipper explained that he had only pre- </p><p>tended to stand out to sea to make the </p><p>“niggers hurry and fetch you,” adding that </p><p>io6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the sick white boy was already on board— </p><p>thereby drawing a volley of questions from </p><p>the amazed Jake. </p><p> The skipper said that Tavau and a big</p><p>buck with a green bracelet hanging from </p><p>his nose, and a pigtail of wool bobbing down </p><p>the side of his face, had been out to the </p><p>schooner that morning, and wanted to know </p><p>if he, the skipper, would take away two </p><p>white men. </p><p> The skipper said that “nothing but an</p><p>affidavit from a priest” would make him </p><p>really believe that two white men were </p><p>alive on the island; but the girl had spoken </p><p>English quite clearly, and judging from her </p><p>unusual beauty and the jealous eyes of </p><p>the big nigger, she spoke pretty much the </p><p>truth. The skipper said that she had </p><p>laughed and affectionately patted the big </p><p>black’s arm from time to time as he stood </p><p>by her, listening watchfully, but unable to </p><p>catch more than a word here and there, </p><p>if even so much. </p><p> Tavau told the skipper that Tonogo,</p><p>son of the chief, had vowed to have her </p><p>as his woman or kill the two white men; </p><p>but that he was willing to let them escape </p><p>if she married him because the old chief </p><p>would make a roar if they were killed, but </p><p>not quite so big a roar if they escaped— </p><p>which seemed to the skipper, from all he </p><p>had heard about the island, a complete </p><p>reversal of Quosoli psychology. </p><p> Tavau said that she loved both white</p><p>men: the lean one because he had been </p><p>good to her grandmother, from which the </p><p>skipper—much to Jake’s disgust—got the </p><p>impression that Jake had given the old </p><p>lady plenty of tobacco in her toothless </p><p>dotage; but that she loved the young, </p><p>handsome one because “he was him” and </p><p>it couldn’t be helped, but that he was </p><p>terribly bad off now and was going to be </p><p>worse off if he got well; therefore it was </p><p>all right to marry Tonogo plenty-quick, </p><p>which wasn’t so bad in a way because he </p><p>would soon be chief, and she could always </p><p>kill him if he wasn’t good to her—but he </p><p>would be, for, as the skipper could see, he </p><p>had a kind, handsome face. </p><p> And the skipper said to Jake that it was</p><p>only something that he didn’t quite under- </p><p>stand in the girl’s eyes that kept him from </p><p>laughing outright: he swore that for an </p><p>instant he saw tears there; but Jake scorn- </p><p>fully told him that when he had been below </p><p>the line forty-odd years he would know that </p><p>heathens never shed tears, not even when </p><p>they cried all night. The skipper finally </p><p>compromised with the suggestion that </p><p>maybe it was tobacco smoke or something </p><p>that had got in her eyes for a moment, for </p><p>after all it couldn’t have been real tears </p><p>because she laughed right away after she </p><p>said it. </p><p> She had done another queer thing too,</p><p>for though she spoke English almost like </p><p>a white girl, she had lapsed into the trader’s </p><p>argot, understood by natives from the </p><p>Solomons to the Carolines, to tell the </p><p>skipper that she did not like the “One God” </p><p>any more because she had prayed to Him, </p><p>and Tonogo had had the witch-man do his </p><p>praying to the Quosoli gods; and they </p><p>were the more powerful, for hadn’t he got </p><p>what he asked for, and she failed, so that </p><p>now she loved Tonogo very much? </p><p> Then as she and the big buck started to</p><p>leave the ship she had asked the skipper </p><p>for his knife; and he gave it to her, thinking </p><p>she wanted it as a present—the natives </p><p>are always begging something or other— </p><p>but she took it and quickly cut off the </p><p>dangling pig-tail of hair on the big buck </p><p>nigger’s head, and Tonogo had grinned </p><p>approvingly. Then she offered the knife </p><p>back to the skipper, who, however, told her </p><p>to keep it, and they climbed over the side </p><p>into the waiting canoe and shoved off. </p><p> Broth and medicine from the ship’s chest</p><p>brought Rideout around to a bit of strength </p><p>and his senses in a few days, but he could </p><p>not forget Schwartz at any hour of the day </p><p>or night, though he did not remember </p><p>hardly anything after the fight up in the </p><p>hills. </p><p> He wanted Tavau.</p><p> He would not be quiet when he found</p><p>that she was not on the ship, and nearly </p><p>went out of his head again when Jake told </p><p>him how Tonogo had roused the wild blood </p><p>in her so that she had gone right back to</p><p>devil-devil dancing and idol-worship like </p><p>her wild grandmothers before her. </p><p> “I always thought Tavau was different,”</p><p>Jake said tenderly to the boy. “I did for </p><p>a fact. But being forty-odd years down </p><p>here I ought t’ have known better. Once </p><p>a heathen, always a heathen—and her </p><p>having such a grandmother and mother. </p><p>Anyhow it takes too long for religion to </p><p>soak through black skins and get down </p><p>where it does a lot o’ good. It’s been </p><p>soaking in the hides of us whites for two </p><p>Heathens </p><p>107 </p><p>thousand-odd years and it ain’t reached </p><p>all our hearts yet. But it’s live and learn, </p><p>my boy—an’ learnin’ costs a lot o’ brain- </p><p>aches and unweeped tears—’specially in this </p><p>climate. </p><p> “Now Schwartz was just a drunken</p><p>Deutscher. Just pretend I killed him. I’d </p><p>a-done it and with joy, so don’t let that </p><p>worry you none. And Tavau—she was </p><p>just a nigger, and she fooled us all just like </p><p>women does no matter what their color </p><p>is.” </p><p> A labor-trade, or recruiting, schooner</p><p>travels pretty much to suit itself; and the </p><p>skipper dropped some two hundred miles </p><p>off his course to bring Jake and Rideout </p><p>to Niko. </p><p> But Rideout did not come on shore.</p><p> Jake had gone over and had a talk with</p><p>the uncle; and Buck was mad and had a </p><p>good deal to say; but, all things con- </p><p>sidered, he agreed with Jake that it was </p><p>best for Niko not to learn what had hap- </p><p>pened, and after Buck had gone on board </p><p>to see the boy he thought maybe the boy </p><p>would be just as well off with a cousin back </p><p>in Liverpool who had wanted to bring him </p><p>up in his business. And Buck made </p><p>arrangements with the skipper to see that </p><p>the boy got to Sydney from where he could </p><p>take a boat home. </p><p>IV </p><p> THAT was the story as Jake told</p><p> it to me.</p><p> But a few days later a British</p><p>gunboat put into Niko, after a visit to </p><p>Bloody Bay over in the Santa Cruz group. </p><p> The sailors that gathered at the shanty</p><p>bar said that they had not shelled the </p><p>village because they found that the mission- </p><p>ary hadn’t been killed at all, but had died </p><p>of dysentery—just like lots of fool mission- </p><p>aries do, and then their friends make a howl </p><p>to the Government and say cannibals </p><p>ate ’em. </p><p> Why, the sailors had found the Quosoli</p><p>the friendliest tribe anywhere. True, their </p><p>experience with natives was not great </p><p>because their gunboat had only recently </p><p>been sent into the South Seas for duty, </p><p>but they guessed they knew when even </p><p>riggers were friendly. </p><p> But a funny thing had happened a day</p><p>or two before they got there. The pretty </p><p>young wife of the chief’s son had killed </p><p>herself—driven a knife right into her heart, </p><p>and everybody in the tribe was afraid to </p><p>touch her body—funny thing—because </p><p>never in the memory of the oldest man </p><p>in the tribe had a woman done that—• </p><p>killed herself, you know; and there she lay, </p><p>right on the mat in a new hut the chief’s </p><p>son had just built—still beautiful, she was, </p><p>though two days dead in that climate. </p><p> A party from the gunboat had given her</p><p>a decent burial; and the captain had said </p><p>a prayer because he was a religious man </p><p>and believed heathens had souls. More- </p><p>over, he had been overheard saying to his </p><p>first officer that anybody could see that she </p><p>was different from the Quosoli women. </p><p>But none of the natives would talk about </p><p>her, or where or how or when she came, </p><p>because she was tapoo—a woman who had </p><p>killed herself. </p><p> And the sailors, drinking there in the</p><p>shanty bar, appealed to Jake to know if </p><p>in his forty-odd years he had ever heard of </p><p>such a thing before. </p><p> But Jake, staring dully straight ahead of</p><p>him, got up and went out into the night, </p><p>and did not answer. </p><p>A New Keeper </p><p> of ihe Wampum</p><p> by/Iug/t Poncfoxfw</p><p>Author of "An Express from Ligonier,” “The Skidi Feed the Evening Star," etc. </p><p>WIM CAMERON, a blond giant of </p><p>a man, whose reputation as a </p><p>forest-ranger was second only to </p><p>that of Jo Martin’s, rested on </p><p>one elbow in the sweet June grass and sur- </p><p>veyed his long, powerful limbs complacently. </p><p>As his gaze shifted to Martin, his compan- </p><p>ion on many a scout, his mouth twitched </p><p>with a little smile, then hardened. Martin, </p><p>slight of build and several inches under </p><p>Cameron’s stature, sat with his lithe body </p><p>curving forward over his knees and was </p><p>staring at the toes of his moccasins. His </p><p>dark features wore an expression of deep </p><p>dejection. </p><p> All day the two had lounged about the</p><p>Blanchard cabin, standing guard till </p><p>Blanchard returned from the little mill at </p><p>Devens Farms. Inside the open door </p><p>Betty Blanchard tossed her pretty head as </p><p>she helped her mother, and proudly told </p><p>herself there was not another girl on all </p><p>the New York frontier in this Summer of </p><p>177S who could boast two such cavaliers. </p><p> Both men knew the girl was a coquette</p><p>and loved her the more distractedly for the </p><p>tantalizing fault; and both inwardly vowed </p><p>their loitering should end once Blanchard </p><p>returned. For with the father to act as </p><p>intermediary' the girl would be brought </p><p>to book and announce her choice. Border </p><p>wooings were bruskly terminated at </p><p>times in these stirring days, when Sir </p><p>Henry Clinton was retreating from Phila- </p><p>delphia to New York with General Wash- </p><p>ington at his heels. “Big Cameron” was </p><p>confident the girl was as good as his wife. </p><p>Martin believed the same, but would not </p><p>withdraw until told as much by the maid. </p><p> “Think I’ll scout up Oriskany way again.</p><p>Ain’t been there since we had the brush with </p><p>the Mohawks,” lazily remarked Cameron </p><p>after a long silence. “Go along?” </p><p> Before the girl came between them this</p><p>question would not have been put; each </p><p>taking it for granted the two of them must </p><p>follow the same trail.</p><p> “Don’t think so,” jerkily replied Martin</p><p>without lifting his head. “Mebbe I’ll drift </p><p>out Mich’limack’nac way.” </p><p> Cameron’s pleasant face clouded for a</p><p>moment: he and Martin had had some </p><p>rare old times together. Of course old ties </p><p>must loosen when a ranger settled down </p><p>with a wife. But, Lord, how the trail would </p><p>call him in the years to come. Then he </p><p>caught a flutter of Betty’s skirts as she </p><p>switched by the door and he could only </p><p>think of the maid. Another period of </p><p>silence, and then both men were on their </p><p>feet, bowing and scraping, only to find </p><p>it was the mother and not the girl. Mrs. </p><p>Blanchard smiled and the girl snickered </p><p>inside the cabin. </p><p> “Look after Betty while I go up to</p><p>Cotton’s,” said Mrs. Blanchard. “Don’t </p><p>let the Injuns carry her off.” </p><p> “The whole Iroquois League can’t harm</p><p>a hair of her head,” cried Big Cameron. </p><p> “I reckon she’ll be here when you git</p><p>back,” quietly assured Martin. </p><p> With a smile for each to show her im-</p><p>partiality Mrs. Blanchard walked up the </p><p>river trail that led to the nearest neighbor’s; </p><p>and the two men, still standing, looked at </p><p>each other coldly. </p><p>108 </p><p>A New Keeper of the Wampum </p><p>109 </p><p> Martin spoke first, saying:</p><p> “Cameron, we’ve followed our last trail</p><p>together. I’m tired of uncertainties. Let’s </p><p>have it settled.” </p><p> Cameron dropped into the grass, re-</p><p>plying— </p><p> “I’m in no hurry.”</p><p> “I am,” grimly retorted Martin; and the</p><p>face he showed at the door was haggard </p><p>and determined. “Betty, come here and </p><p>settle something for us,” he peremptorily </p><p>demanded. </p><p> All their words had fed through the small,</p><p>square hole serving as a window. Perhaps </p><p>the girl resented Martin’s arbitrary tone </p><p>and manner. Anyway, there were danger </p><p>signals in her cheeks as she appeared in the </p><p>doorway and with hands on her hips bent </p><p>her gaze on the two men. Martin, although </p><p>usually nonplussed in her presence, desper- </p><p>ately requested: </p><p> “Which is it, Betsy? Him or me? Let’s</p><p>have it settled and done with.” </p><p> The girl’s eyes snapped ominously and</p><p>she «oldly returned— </p><p> “Lor’! Jo Martin; I never knew any-</p><p>thing had been commenced.” </p><p> “Mebbe not. That means two fools</p><p>’stead of one. But here’s Cameron, who </p><p>I fetched here last Winter. Here’s me; </p><p>who’s been coming; here for a year every </p><p>chance I could git. Which one’s wasting </p><p>his time? Say which shall stop coming.” </p><p>“I never asked either of you to come </p><p>here,” she slowly answered. “Quite a few </p><p>forest -rangers go up and down the Schoharie </p><p>and stop to see us. The trail’s open at both </p><p>ends for them that want to come—for them </p><p>who’re keen to go.” </p><p> Cameron chuckled. Martin’s dark face</p><p>grew hot and he declared— </p><p> “Well, the trail’s closed for me unless</p><p>you say for Jim Cameron to stay away.” </p><p>Oblivious to the fact a new world was</p><p>being created from the primeval solitudes, </p><p>that the destiny of a continent was being </p><p>indexed by such sturdy characters as they, </p><p>the girl braced her slender shoulders and </p><p>sharply informed: </p><p> “It’ll never be for you, nor no man, to</p><p>say who shall come and who shall keep </p><p>clear of Blanchard’s. Mister Cameron has </p><p>more sense than to talk that way.” </p><p> “Cameron,” choked Martin, his eyes</p><p>growing lurid under the taunting smile of </p><p>the big fellow. He checked himself with </p><p>difficulty and muttered, “so it’s Cameron, </p><p>eh? Three’s a crowd. I’ll be going.” </p><p>“But, Jo, you’re acting silly,” she pro- </p><p>tested as he turned away. “Ain’t Jim </p><p>Cameron always been your friend? Can’t </p><p>you see it’s wicked for you two to fall out </p><p>this way?” </p><p> “I ain’t doing any falling out,” defended</p><p>Cameron, feeling a trifle uneasy at the </p><p>thought of walking the forests alone after </p><p>all the years of Martin’s companionship. </p><p> Over his shoulder Martin passionately</p><p>shot back: </p><p> “He was my friend till I fetched him here.</p><p>He knew how I felt. But that didn’t bother </p><p>him any once he’d seen you.” </p><p> “If you’re going to look at it that way,</p><p>Jo Martin, why should anything bother </p><p>me?” cried Cameron. “Think you can go </p><p>through the world and blaze trees what </p><p>take your liking and expect folks not to </p><p>touch ’em even if you can’t chop ’em down? </p><p>Now you’ve put a name to it, I’ll say that </p><p>since I seen Betty nothing else can ever </p><p>count.” </p><p> Martin made no response, but dropped</p><p>his long rifle across his left arm and hurried </p><p>up the trail, his cup of misery overflowing. </p><p>THE gracious warmth of the June </p><p>sun could not dispel the blighting </p><p>paralysis from the valleys of the </p><p>Mohawk and Schoharie. Only the Blanch- </p><p>ard and Cotton families remained in this </p><p>section, and they had been repeatedly </p><p>warned to fall back to the settlements. </p><p> Aside from their Anglo-Saxon tenacity</p><p>to start a harvest the seasonal assurance of </p><p>fecundity found no crops planted. No </p><p>hopeful husbandmen were plying the ad- </p><p>vantage of the month. From Fonda’s Bush </p><p>to the eastern waters of the Susquehanna </p><p>a strange apathy rested on the land; and </p><p>fields grew rank with trash, orchards </p><p>blossomed with no chance of being har- </p><p>vested, while spiders spun webs in the </p><p>doorways of abandoned homes. </p><p> Dread of the Iroquois had put a stop to all</p><p>peaceful pursuits along the border. Fear </p><p>of the Long House and their white allies </p><p>had brought a hush to the country; and </p><p>only those were abroad who fought for or </p><p>against King George upon his throne. </p><p>Mothers quieted their children’s whimper- </p><p>ing by whispering the one word “Iroquois.” </p><p>Troublous times. A strange time for </p><p>wooing a maid, with the brooding calm </p><p>more wearing on men’s nerves than the </p><p>no </p><p>Adventure </p><p>crash of actual battle. The few border </p><p>folks who dwelt outside the forts, such as </p><p>the Blanchards and Cottons, might well </p><p>tremble of nights and expect to hear the </p><p>pattering reconnaissance of the red men, </p><p>followed by their horrible screams as they </p><p>sounded the doom of their victims. </p><p> According to Martin’s views, however,</p><p>the times were not out of joint. He was </p><p>accustomed to these waves of terror. </p><p>Settlers alternately flocked to their little </p><p>farms and fled in terror to the nearest </p><p>garrison post. Indians always had been </p><p>a factor in the ranger’s life and their </p><p>depredations could scarcely interfere with </p><p>flights of amiable fancy. </p><p> Now he was flogged on by one wild desire;</p><p>to leave the country and in new regions and </p><p>amid new perils strive to forget. His mind </p><p>boiled with rage at Cameron, and he cursed </p><p>the Winter’s day he had led the giant to </p><p>the Blanchard cabin. Prior to that Betty </p><p>had been glad enough to see him. He was </p><p>enraged at the girl, too, for playing with </p><p>his love. If Cameron had been wiped out </p><p>in that last fight on the Oriskany—but that </p><p>was too evil a thought, especially seeing it </p><p>was useless. </p><p> He had been an hour on the trail when</p><p>the pounding of hoofs ahead aroused him </p><p>from his black thoughts. He drew aside, </p><p>dully wondering who might be riding so </p><p>hard and fast. With an exclamation of </p><p>alarm he jumped to the middle of the trail </p><p>and raised his hand for her to stop; for it </p><p>was Mrs. Blanchard. She pointed behind </p><p>her and gestured for him to run back; and </p><p>there was the glare of insanity in her </p><p>eyes. </p><p> Behind her ran one of the Cotton boys,</p><p>striving to cling to the stirrup, and his face </p><p>was ghastly with fright. As Mrs. Blanch- </p><p>ard swept by, screaming something the </p><p>ranger did not catch, the boy tripped and </p><p>sprawled at his feet. On swept horse and </p><p>rider. </p><p> Yanking the boy to his feet Martin</p><p>shook him fiercely and stilled his blubbering. </p><p>When he could speak the lad gasped: </p><p> “Iroquois! Devens Farms! The miller</p><p>and Blanchard killed. Miller’s hired man </p><p>made our cabin and fetched the word. </p><p>Our fambly’s started for the settlement. </p><p>Father give Mrs. Blanchard the hoss to </p><p>git home. I’m to go with ’em. The red </p><p>hellions will be along any minute.” </p><p> He broke off and with a faint scream</p><p>pointed up the trail, then turned and </p><p>scuttled off. </p><p> Martin beheld a shaft of smoke slowly</p><p>rising above the forest crown. The Iro- </p><p>quois had reached the Cotton clearing and </p><p>were at work. The tragedy made him </p><p>forget his own troubles. Blanchard dead! </p><p>It seemed impossible. He always had </p><p>liked the man. He carefully selected a </p><p>position on the river-bank and slipped </p><p>several Inlets into his mouth. They </p><p>would come down the trail and if he could </p><p>hold them back a bit Mrs. Blanchard and </p><p>Betty would stand a good chance of </p><p>escaping. </p><p> The volume of smoke increased and he</p><p>thought the faint breeze brought on its </p><p>fragrant breath the sound of triumphant </p><p>yells, but it might have been the murmur- </p><p>ing of the river. Minutes passed, each </p><p>sixty seconds adding to the fugitives’ </p><p>security, then with much awkward plunging </p><p>a cow came down the trail, behind her ran </p><p>two savages, their painted faces making </p><p>them devils. Martin picked off the rear- </p><p>most with a ball through his shaven head, </p><p>but before he could reload and bag the </p><p>other a rifle cracked near-by and the fleeing </p><p>savage crashed on his face. </p><p> Martin looked ’round and beheld Cam- i</p><p>eron reloading. </p><p> “The women?” he barked.</p><p> “Making east with the boy. They know</p><p>the way. Thought I could do more good </p><p>up here.” </p><p> “You oughter gone with ’em,” growled</p><p>Martin. </p><p> “Guess I know what to do when it comes</p><p>to taking care of Betty,” snarled the big </p><p>fellow.</p><p> “You can go to-after this is over.</p><p>I never ’lowed to fight by your side ag’in,” </p><p>growled Martin. </p><p> Cameron’s big face grimaced with rage,</p><p>then he clicked a bullet against his white </p><p>teeth and glared up the trail. Now they </p><p>were coming, a hideous, whooping throng, </p><p>with the leader wildly brandishing a gray </p><p>scalp. Martin shuddered and prayed Betty </p><p>might never see it, and forthwith bowled </p><p>over the bearer. A second later Cameron </p><p>brought down another; but instead of </p><p>holding back, the Iroquois came on, taking </p><p>a chance, there were but two, and knowing </p><p>they would not have time to reload. </p><p> Martin ducked low and ran toward them,</p><p>rising and discharging his two pistols into </p><p>A New Keeper of the Wampum </p><p>in </p><p>their midst and throwing them into con- </p><p>fusion. But Cameron, relying on his great </p><p>strength, rushed up the open trail, bellowing </p><p>like a bull and using his rifle for a club and </p><p>breaking it on a skull at the first swing. </p><p>An Indian landed on Martin’s back and a </p><p>hand clutched his scalplock. Ducking low </p><p>he threw his assailant over his head and </p><p>knifed him just as another warrior dashed </p><p>into him full-tilt. He glimpsed Cameron </p><p>going down beneath a mass of savages, </p><p>then rolled into the river, taking his assail- </p><p>ant with him. </p><p> MARTIN lay in the bush with his</p><p>rifle covering the doorway of the </p><p>Blanchard cabin. He knew Betty </p><p>and her mother reached Schenectady. He </p><p>believed Cameron must have died that day </p><p>in the ttail, although he had found no </p><p>determining proof after searching the woods </p><p>from Devens Farms to this clearing. While </p><p>he prowled through forest and deserted </p><p>farmsteads he had felt guilty of trying on a </p><p>dead man’s shoes. Were he positive Cam- </p><p>eron were alive he would have lost no time </p><p>in making for far-off Michilimackinac. </p><p>Now the cabin held his attention because </p><p>he had detected a movement inside. He </p><p>hoped it might be a straggling Iroquois </p><p>bent on loot. </p><p> Again something stirred inside, and a</p><p>sudden horror enveloped him. What if </p><p>Big Cameron had escaped, and, like him- </p><p>self, had wandered back to his sweetheart’s </p><p>home? The girl was in Dutch Schenectady, </p><p>and if Cameron be alive and here. . . . </p><p>The ranger tried to push the thought from </p><p>him, yet all the time telling himself that </p><p>should the big fellow die on the doorsill </p><p>of the abandoned cabin it would be charged </p><p>up to the Iroquois. </p><p> He had accepted his loss of the girl as</p><p>final till after the fight in the trail, when </p><p>he took it for granted his former friend had </p><p>gone to his death. Believing that, he had </p><p>permitted a bit of hope to grow up in </p><p>his heart. But if intuition were right, and </p><p>Cameron were here. . . And again he </p><p>endeavored to retreat deeper into the bush </p><p>and away from the horrible temptation. </p><p>Something in his soul shrieked out for him </p><p>to kill the beastly thought, while louder and</p><p>louder his mad love dinned in his ears— </p><p> “With Cameron dead you may win her.”</p><p> A figure began drawing toward the</p><p>doorway and a familiar coonskin cap </p><p>emerged from the shadows, the cap Cam- </p><p>eron wore the day Blanchard was killed. </p><p>With a loud groan Martin threw down his </p><p>rifle and clenched his hands and thrust the </p><p>bloody opportunity from him! </p><p> “Who’s there?” asked a voice.</p><p> With a gasp of incredulity Martin</p><p>crawled from cover and glared at the pale </p><p>face and sorrow-filled eyes of Betty Blan- </p><p>chard. And she was wearing the cap Cam- </p><p>eron had left behind when he ran up the </p><p>trail to check the onrush of the Iroquois. </p><p>Recognizing him she lowered the rifle she </p><p>had held in readiness, and demanded— </p><p> “Jo Martin, where’s your friend, Jim</p><p>Cameron?” </p><p> He plucked at the fringe of his hunting-</p><p>shirt and tried to find words. She con- </p><p>tinued : </p><p> “You two were together the day the</p><p>Injuns came. Where is he?” </p><p> “I don’t know. He went down with a</p><p>dozen on top of him,” he dully answered. </p><p>“Dead, prob’ly. I had troubles of my own </p><p>’bout that time.” </p><p> “He is not dead,” she astounded him by</p><p>informing. “He was taken alive. I want </p><p>to know where he’s held prisoner. He was </p><p>last heard of at Cayuga Castle.” </p><p> “At Gayagaanhe!” exclaimed Martin.</p><p>“Who says that?” </p><p> “Black Bear, the friendly Oneida my</p><p>father saved from freezing two Winters </p><p>ago. He talked with me in Schenectady. </p><p>He was carrying dispatches from Colonel </p><p>Gansevoort at Fort Stanwix. He said one </p><p>of our Oneida scouts brought the news </p><p>to Stanwix. He must be rescued. He </p><p>must be ransomed.” </p><p> And she sank down in the doorway as</p><p>though very weak. </p><p> “Ransomed? They’d rather have him</p><p>than all the goods and rum a dozen bateaus </p><p>could float up the Mohawk.” </p><p> “He must be freed,” she muttered in a</p><p>peculiar little sing-song. “He fought that </p><p>mother and me might escape. Black Bear </p><p>said they would probably take him to </p><p>Onondaga—for the torture. Oh, that must </p><p>not be, that must not be! I went to the </p><p>officers in Schenectady. They could do </p><p>nothing. So I came here, thinking to find </p><p>some of our rangers. We have a little </p><p>store of silver in Albany. We’ll give it </p><p>all gladly to get him free.” </p><p> He thought rapidly while she was speak-</p><p>ing. Had he not met her Cameron would </p><p>112 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>have been done to death at Onondaga </p><p>without his knowledge, and in the course </p><p>of time she would learn to welcome his love. </p><p>Now he believed he must drive a bargain, </p><p>or lose the one chance. </p><p> He looked aside to escape her clear gaze</p><p>and doggedly began— </p><p> “What’ll you give to have Cameron</p><p>rescued?” </p><p> “Anything,” was the prompt answer.</p><p>“Which means nothing but a little silver. </p><p>See here, Betty, I’ve hated Cameron ever </p><p>since he came between you and me. If </p><p>the Iroquois take him to Onondaga and </p><p>he still lives there is one small chance for </p><p>him, providing the man who goes to get </p><p>him uses the scheme I have in my head </p><p>and is willing to risk the stake. If that </p><p>man goes and fails there will be two fires </p><p>lighted in front of the council-house instead </p><p>of one.” </p><p> She shivered at his words and twisted her</p><p>hands convulsively. </p><p> “I can’t send a man to his death,” she</p><p>muttered. </p><p> “If the price is right for his going and</p><p>he goes and fails he can’t find no fault. </p><p>It’s part of the bargain—the price if he </p><p>wins.” </p><p> “I don’t understand what you mean.”</p><p>Still refusing to meet her gaze he hoarsely </p><p>completed: </p><p> “With what I know of Onondaga, coupled</p><p>to the plan simmering in my mind, I’d stand </p><p>a better chance of fetching him out then </p><p>any man I know of. But I have my price. </p><p>If I git him clear will you forget you ever </p><p>loved him, and marry me?” </p><p> She eyed him wildly for nearly a minute,</p><p>then whispered— </p><p> “You’d—you’d make me marry you even</p><p>if I liked some one else better?” </p><p> His tanned face burned with shame, but</p><p>he doggedly replied:</p><p> “I ain’t making any one marry me.</p><p>We’re talking of ransoming Cameron. </p><p>The Injuns won’t dicker. You can ransom </p><p>him from me. If I fail, you pay no price. </p><p>I’ll take you to Stanwix and you can offer </p><p>all yours and your mother’s silver to the </p><p>men there for them to go and git him. </p><p>None will try to earn the price. And </p><p>Gansevoort will send you down the Mohawk </p><p>to Schenectady on the first bateau. </p><p> “Only three days ago two soldiers</p><p>were butchered within sight of the garrison. </p><p>Night and day they prowl about the fort </p><p>and even our Oneidas keep close to cover. </p><p>You can reckon how much worse it would </p><p>be to try and sneak into Onondaga. And </p><p>yet it might be done—but I know of no </p><p>man but myself who would try it, let alone </p><p>doing it. And I don’t want your silver.” </p><p>“You’d make a woman marry you?” she </p><p>fiercely cried. </p><p> The scorn in her voice stung him to</p><p>greater passion. </p><p> “I’d make you,” he gritted. “You</p><p>seemed to like me till I brought him here. </p><p>Then you picked him. Then you sent me </p><p>packing. You’ve had your way, picking </p><p>and choosing. Cameron would do the </p><p>same as I if our positions was swapped </p><p>’round. Didn’t he say that after seeing </p><p>you that nothing else counted? Well, he’s </p><p>trapped. Why should I risk my hair for </p><p>the man who’s bested me in the only game </p><p>I ever set my heart on winning? ” </p><p> “But to take a woman that wayl” she</p><p>moaned. </p><p> “If it’s the only way, and the woman is</p><p>you—yes.” </p><p> “And I’d always hate you for it,” she</p><p>passionately cried. “You ought to feel </p><p>ashamed enough to die for saying such </p><p>things to me. You must be mad. I’ll go </p><p>to Stanwix. Surely there’ll be one man </p><p>there, red or white.” </p><p> “And be sent down the river under guard</p><p>to your mother. And meanwhile the </p><p>Iroquois will be roasting Cameron.” </p><p> “Don’t, don’t!” she begged, clapping her</p><p>hands to her face to shut out some vision. </p><p> A fury seized upon him as he observed</p><p>her grief for Cameron. He wanted to </p><p>punish her for preferring Cameron, and </p><p>began babbling: </p><p> “They’ll cut off his finger-nails with clam-</p><p>shells. They’ll make him last for days </p><p>and-” </p><p> She leaped to her feet and clutched him</p><p>by the wrists, and in a broken voice cried: </p><p>“Are you a devil? Mohawk or Seneca? </p><p>Aye, look away from me arid never look at </p><p>a decent woman again. Listen to me, </p><p>for you can’t stop your ears as you hide </p><p>your eyes. I’ll not go to Stanwix to be </p><p>sent down the river. I’ll go to Onondaga. </p><p>I’ll go after Cameron myself. And if I die, </p><p>the Iroquois can’t be more cruel than you </p><p>have been.” </p><p> Her anguish brought him to his senses</p><p>and his better self. As he stole a glance </p><p>at her hard, set face a new fear gripped </p><p>A New Keeper of the Wampum </p><p>113 </p><p>him. She had her father’s spirit; and did </p><p>she determine to enter the gloomy depths </p><p>of the Onondaga woods no one could pre- </p><p>vent her. </p><p> “I have been mad,” he faintly confessed.</p><p>“But it was all for love of you, Betty </p><p>Blanchard. For my poor love for you. </p><p>I’ll go after Cameron—and there shall be </p><p>no price.” </p><p>SIR WILLIAM JOHNSON, former </p><p>Indian superintendent for the Crown </p><p>and a mighty influence in the Long </p><p>House, was dead these four years. By </p><p>dying at the outbreak of the Revolutionary </p><p>War he had escaped the necessity of making </p><p>the great decision which the war would </p><p>have demanded of him. Whether he would </p><p>have cast his lot with the Royal Govern- </p><p>ment, which had given him his all, or would </p><p>have swung his red brood to the defense </p><p>of the colonies he so loved, or would have </p><p>essayed to hold his fierce children neutral, </p><p>who can say? He died when the Summer </p><p>was mellow and warm along the Mohawk, </p><p>hastened to his grave, his friends believed, </p><p>by the question ever confronting his soul. </p><p> Could his spirit return to his old haunts</p><p>this Mid-Summer day he would have found </p><p>to be widely scattered the dusky race that </p><p>had given gentle names to wood and </p><p>stream, from the Sacondaga to the Genesee. </p><p>For more than three centuries the Iroquois </p><p>were the Romans of the new world, con- </p><p>quering, colonizing and assimilating. And </p><p>yet not entirely Roman, for there was a </p><p>suggestion of the Saxon in their federal </p><p>system of government, their care to prevent </p><p>a concentration of power, and their efforts </p><p>to develop the individual, and promote </p><p>personal liberty. If not for the coming of </p><p>the white race they would have shared the </p><p>Western world with the Aztecs. </p><p> But the fallen fortunes of the Long House</p><p>interested Jo Martin none as he stole </p><p>through the interlacing lights and shadows </p><p>of the silent forest. That a mighty race </p><p>was fighting its last fight never dawned </p><p>upon his intelligence as he scanned the </p><p>damp forest floor for the imprint of a hostile </p><p>moccasin. Even had his mind been re- </p><p>ceptive to philosophical musings he would</p><p>have deemed it madness to suggest that </p><p>race, language and history were virtually </p><p>doomed to extinction within the life of three </p><p>generations. </p><p> The ranger was purely objective. His</p><p>thoughts refused to quit the girl Betty. </p><p>His wicked madness had passed from him </p><p>and he knew it was better for him to join </p><p>Cameron at the stake than to leave any </p><p>trick untried. He had behaved mon- </p><p>strously, and only the rescue of Cameron </p><p>could palliate his offense. He passed near </p><p>enough to Fort Stanwix to hear the dull </p><p>pur-r-r of a drum, then turned south to </p><p>avoid the skulking savages he knew were </p><p>fringing the post. It was not till several </p><p>miles from Stanwix and well within hostile </p><p>country that he became conscious of being </p><p>trailed. </p><p> He must have made his discovery sub-</p><p>consciously, for one moment he was flitting </p><p>down a forest aisle, his heart in an ache for </p><p>the wrong he had done Betty Blanchard, </p><p>and the next he was behind a tree. He had </p><p>heard nor seen nothing that he knew of; </p><p>yet the moment he was behind the tree </p><p>he was noiselessly working his way under </p><p>a tangle of wild-grape vines and rejoicing </p><p>to find his body slipping down a declivity. </p><p>Completing the descent he found himself </p><p>in a little gulley and at once started to run </p><p>along this. </p><p> When he deemed it prudent to emerge</p><p>from the gulley he took time to wonder </p><p>why his tracker had not sounded an alarm. </p><p>As he mulled over this puzzling phase of </p><p>the situation an Indian brave suddenly </p><p>stepped before him and raised an empty </p><p>hand in a token of well-meaning. Before </p><p>Martin could think to take the defensive </p><p>his startled eyes noted the painted Oneida </p><p>totem on the savage’s chest, and in great </p><p>relief asked— </p><p> “Why does the Black Bear of the Oneidas</p><p>follow his white brother?” </p><p> “The white girl whose eyes are the color</p><p>of the cornflower asked the Bear to find </p><p>the white man who dares walk alone </p><p>through the Long House. The Black </p><p>Bear owes a life to the father of the white </p><p>girl. He met her on the Mohawk. She </p><p>grows thin like a starved deer, and white,</p><p>like the first snow. She said -find and give </p><p>this talk to the white man who goes to </p><p>find the man Cameron.” 1 </p><p> As he spoke this in the Oneida tongue</p><p>he produced from his paint-bag a small </p><p>roll of birchbark tied with a blue ribbon, </p><p>and Martin’s heart skipped a beat at the </p><p>sight of the ribbon. In accepting it he read </p><p>the words, “For Jas. Cameron,” written </p><p>with a charred stick on the outside. </p><p>H4 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “She sends this by me to Cameron?”</p><p>asked Martin. </p><p> “To the man Cameron, who now is held</p><p>at Onondaga,” grunted the Oneida. </p><p> He had hardly spoken before he was</p><p>vanishing into a tangle of bushes. Martin </p><p>gaped blankly for a moment, the abrupt </p><p>disappearance preventing various queries </p><p>he desired to put. A soft kiss back of him </p><p>brought him to the right-about, his hand </p><p>on his ax. The Black Bear’s visage showed </p><p>for a moment from beneath some under- </p><p>brush and he was pointing behind the </p><p>ranger. Martin lost no time in taking his </p><p>cue to efface himself, but it required several </p><p>minutes to locate the danger, a dusky form </p><p>slipping from tree to tree. Farther back </p><p>were other forms. He had the Oneida </p><p>to thank for escaping a surprise attack. </p><p> Securing the roll of bark in his belt he</p><p>concentrated all his cunning on escaping. </p><p>He was convinced there were but a handful </p><p>of the enemy, else there would have been </p><p>a loud outcry and an attempt to encircle </p><p>him. Returning to the gulley he utilized </p><p>its cover for a hot sprint. When a long </p><p>drawn-out yell warned him the Iroquois </p><p>had discovered where he descended to the </p><p>gulley he climbed the bank and struck off </p><p>at top speed toward the eastern end of </p><p>Oneida Lake. </p><p> He had now penetrated well behind the</p><p>mass of warriors surrounding Stanwix </p><p>and every stride was plunging him deeper </p><p>into the Iroquois country. But given his </p><p>liberty until night and he believed the odds </p><p>were in his favor; for he was on familiar </p><p>ground and had various hiding-places. It </p><p>was growing dusk when he caught the soft </p><p>lap-lap of the lake and knew the race was </p><p>won. At no time during his flight had he </p><p>glimpsed Black Bear of the Oneida Bear clan. </p><p>FOR years a wooden structure </p><p>known as the Royal Blockhouse </p><p>stood at this end of the lake. It </p><p>had withstood many Indian assaults but </p><p>for more than a decade had been abandoned </p><p>by troops and left to the elements. The </p><p>early morning mists were rising in tenuous </p><p>shapes from the lake, suggesting quadrilles</p><p>by ghosts, when Martin peered through a </p><p>loop-hole and studied the silent woods. </p><p> Satisfied no enemy was lurking behind</p><p>the forest screen he passed the open door </p><p>and its silken barrier of spider-webs and </p><p>proceeded to the end of the building nearest </p><p>the lake. Here he removed a section of a </p><p>log, cunningly prepared for such an emer- </p><p>gency, and passed into the sweet air. A </p><p>thicket of saplings concealed him as he rose </p><p>to his feet, and the grove extended to the </p><p>shore of the lake. Stealing to the water </p><p>the ranger spread his blanket on the ground </p><p>and disrobed to the waist, hung a trade </p><p>mirror before him and emptied a paint-bag </p><p>between his crossed legs. </p><p> The brushes of bark he made more pliable</p><p>by chewing them. Next he mixed his </p><p>paints and proceeded to transform himself </p><p>into an aborigine. On his breast he </p><p>painted a Cayuga totem, a bear standing </p><p>erect, the clan of the bear being common </p><p>to the tribes of the Long House. Although </p><p>he had utilized his cache of paints in the </p><p>blockhouse more than once for turning </p><p>himself into a savage it required time and </p><p>patience to hack off his long hair and </p><p>partially shave his head. But when he </p><p>had finished Jo Martin, ranger, was gone </p><p>and Dancing Black Bear, Cayuga, stood </p><p>in his place. </p><p> Now that he was ready for the final test</p><p>of his scheme his courage weakened. Not </p><p>that he feared for himself, for he would </p><p>have gone to the stake if by so doing he </p><p>could fully atone for the black thoughts </p><p>he had harbored. He worried lest the </p><p>Oneida’s intelligence was wrong, and that </p><p>Cameron had been put to death at Gaya- </p><p>gaanhe. The success of his bizarre scheme </p><p>demanded that his rival be at Onondaga, </p><p>where the Great Council-Fire ever burned. </p><p> So for once his heart grew glad when he</p><p>discovered Indians approaching from the </p><p>direction of Stanwix. He knew they were </p><p>hurrying to Onondaga and that only one </p><p>errand could call them there—to enjoy the </p><p>spectacle of a white man put to the torture. </p><p>As they moved in a course parallel to his </p><p>and as there was no danger of their crossing </p><p>his trail he secured a vantage-point and </p><p>watched them. They were Mohawks, and </p><p>filed by with the precision of a machine</p><p>and with no more noise than a snake would </p><p>make. One warrior carried two scalps </p><p>stretched on hoops, and the ranger knew </p><p>these trophies were furnished by the </p><p>soldiers killed a few days before. </p><p> Throughout the long afternoon and</p><p>under the stars of early evening the painted </p><p>white man hung to the heels of the Mo- </p><p>hawks. When the glow of fires bloomed </p><p>rosily ahead he knew the great adventure </p><p>A New Keeper of the Wampum </p><p>115 </p><p>was about to be staged; for he was on the </p><p>outskirts of dread Onondaga. A loud </p><p>chorus of welcome was given the Mohawks, </p><p>and, as though the man Cameron’s ordeal </p><p>had been postponed till this arrival, there </p><p>next rose a monotonous chanting. </p><p> Confident because of his paint and the</p><p>obscurity of the night Martin glided closer </p><p>and gained a position near the great bark </p><p>council-house and crouched in some bushes. </p><p>The council-house stood on a gentle slope, </p><p>overlooking the place of torture. An old </p><p>man, the hereditary keeper of the wampum, </p><p>stood in the doorway awaiting the spec- </p><p>tacle, his slight figure sharply outlined by </p><p>the flaming torch in the wall behind him. </p><p> Groups of warriors were congregating</p><p>near the torture-stake and the ring of fire </p><p>surrounding, but not touching it. This </p><p>flaming circle contained the calendar of </p><p>Cameron’s mortal life; for the ranger knew </p><p>his rival would be brought forth when the </p><p>dancing fire had subsided into beds of coals. </p><p> Leaving his long rifle in the brush,</p><p>Martin dropped his blanket from his </p><p>shoulders and allowed it to hang from his </p><p>loins. Then he struck boldly into the </p><p>open. The Mohawk who carried the </p><p>scalps taken at Stanwix gave him greeting, </p><p>which the ranger returned and passed on. </p><p>The Mohawk, without suspecting the truth, </p><p>was impelled to follow him. Martin dis- </p><p>cerned this much and came to a halt as </p><p>though waiting to enjoy the preliminaries. </p><p>Every nerve was strung as taut as the cord </p><p>of a war bow as he fancied himself in danger </p><p>of discovery even before he could fairly </p><p>enter upon his project. </p><p> He had no time to give to finesse if he</p><p>were to make a try for Cameron’s life, for </p><p>already the flames were shortening and the </p><p>ridge of coals climbing higher. Groups of </p><p>the various tribes were steadily growing </p><p>larger, Seneca, Onondaga, Cayuga and </p><p>Mohawk. Now the groups extended and </p><p>came in contact, forming a large and com- </p><p>pact body. Wizened hags were coursing </p><p>back and forth in a frenzy of blood-lusting </p><p>and contributing the only note of im- </p><p>patience. </p><p> “He killed my son at Oriskany! Let me</p><p>fondle him! Let me play with him!” </p><p>shrieked the leader of the witch band. </p><p> The cry was caught up and tossed about</p><p>with fiendish gusto. Despite the warmth </p><p>of the night Martin felt chilly, for he had </p><p>been with Cameron at Oriskany. </p><p> The warriors held themselves in dignified</p><p>restraint, although their eyes glittered </p><p>brightly as dry fuel was thrown on various </p><p>fires to illuminate the scene. Martin </p><p>searched the assemblage closely and was </p><p>relieved at not beholding Walter Butler, </p><p>tutelary devil to the Senecas. A warrior </p><p>beside the ranger grunted loudly and </p><p>smacked his lips in satisfaction. </p><p> Following the direction of his gaze</p><p>Martin trembled at beholding the tall, </p><p>superb figure of Cameron advancing through </p><p>an aisle of warriors, stripped to the buff, </p><p>his arms fastened behind his back. His </p><p>blond head was held high, but the dew of </p><p>death glistened on his forehead. That </p><p>his eyes narrowed at sight of the stake and </p><p>ring of coals discredited his manhood none. </p><p>Two warriors walked beside him, holding </p><p>him by the arms to prevent his drawing </p><p>back. With a sudden twist of his massive </p><p>shoulders he shunted these aside, and with </p><p>steady step continued his approach. </p><p> “Ho! Ho!” resounded in approval from</p><p>many throats. </p><p> “A man comes to die!” cried an aged</p><p>chief. </p><p> “Ho! Ho! A man comes to die!” The</p><p>fierce shout rolled down the valley and </p><p>through the black arches of the forest. </p><p> The Mohawk with the scalps pressed</p><p>forward to obtain a better view of the </p><p>entertainment. Martin edged toward the </p><p>council-house. Again the Mohawk felt a </p><p>vague misgiving tainting his pleasure, and </p><p>he took a step after the masquerader. </p><p>Whereat Martin gutturally cried: </p><p> “Ho! Ho! We owe the brave man</p><p>thanks!” </p><p> The Mohawk halted and resumed watch-</p><p>ing the prisoner. As a preface to the </p><p>more exquisite torture a young brave</p><p>seized one of Cameron’s hands and thrust </p><p>a finger deep into the bowl of a lighted pipe. </p><p>With no betrayal of pain the prisoner </p><p>stared complacently over the heads of his </p><p>captors for a moment, then kicked out </p><p>behind him and hurled his tormentor into </p><p>the coals. </p><p> Yells of joy greeted the warrior’s dis-</p><p>comfiture, as gasping for breath he crawled </p><p>from the fiery mass like a scorched snake. </p><p>Martin felt a twinge of the old comradeship </p><p>warm his blood; and within himself he </p><p>muttered— </p><p> “ ’Fore God, he’s a brave man!”</p><p> “Ho! Ho! A brave man comes to die</p><p>116 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the death of brave men!” shouted the </p><p>savages; and axes were held aloft in honor- </p><p>able salute to the victim. </p><p> Martin dropped back and passed through</p><p>the outer circle. </p><p> He was safe from all eyes except those of</p><p>the Mohawk. The latter could not rid </p><p>himself of the feeling that the Cayuga was </p><p>acting in a peculiar manner in withdrawing </p><p>from the delectable spectacle. Martin, </p><p>however, could not afford to waste another </p><p>minute; and being in the shadows he ran </p><p>swiftly to the rear of the council-house. </p><p>He knew the Mohawk was following him </p><p>but did not stay his steps till at the end </p><p>of the shed, in which the Onondagas stored </p><p>their Winter’s wood and war supplies for </p><p>the league. </p><p> “Why does my brother come here when</p><p>a man is about to die?” challenged the </p><p>Mohawk, placing a heavy hand on Martin’s </p><p>shoulder. </p><p> With a swing of his ax Martin felled him</p><p>lifeless, and grunted: </p><p> “Right, my nosey friend. A man has</p><p>died.” </p><p> Rolling the body under a bush he entered</p><p>the shed and after stumbling over some logs </p><p>found what he knew was always stored </p><p>there. Picking up a keg he groped through </p><p>the darkness to the door opening into the </p><p>council-house. Throwing this back he sped </p><p>down the long passageway till he reached </p><p>the edge of the torch-light. There he </p><p>deposited the keg on the floor. The </p><p>keeper of the wampum sensed his presence, </p><p>and, turning, discovered him. </p><p> “Go out!” the sachem angrily com-</p><p>manded. “You can not bring rum here.” </p><p>And pointed to the keg. “Has the Cayuga’s </p><p>ears grown so thick he never heard that the </p><p>wampum of the Six Nations is kept </p><p>here?” </p><p> Martin bowed meekly before the rebuke</p><p>and picking up the keg advanced as though </p><p>to leave by the front door, only on reaching </p><p>the door he quickly closed it. Stupefied</p><p>by such behavior the aged guardian blinked </p><p>foolishly for a few moments, then sought to </p><p>cry out. A blanket dropped over his head </p><p>and smothered him. He was dazed by the </p><p>time Martin finished tying him up. The </p><p>ranger next knocked the head from the keg, </p><p>then taking the torch began searching the </p><p>various apartments opening off the central </p><p>passageway. In the third room he entered </p><p>he found what he so eagerly desired. </p><p>STHE night was hideous with the </p><p>horrible din of the blood-mad. </p><p>The screaming hags were fighting </p><p>ike demons to get at the prisoner, and they </p><p>would have spoiled the play prematurely </p><p>if not held back by force. Cameron’s feet </p><p>were hobbled with a small chain. Then </p><p>two warriors, protecting themselves against </p><p>the heat with robes of green hide, dragged </p><p>him to the edge of the coals and forced him </p><p>to a sitting posture. The heat scorched </p><p>the bare flesh. Cameron’s eyes became </p><p>distended and his tongue worked des- </p><p>perately to find moisture in his dry </p><p>mouth. </p><p> This slow baking process, continued for</p><p>some minutes, was so cunningly regulated </p><p>as to do the victim no serious harm, albeit </p><p>inflicting exquisite pain. At last one of the </p><p>torturers, as though moved by compassion, </p><p>held out a small kettle of water while the </p><p>other yanked Cameron to his feet. Cam- </p><p>eron greedily lunged his head forward to </p><p>secure a mouthful. The warrior snatched </p><p>it back, drank heartily and poured what </p><p>remained on to the ground. This bit of </p><p>play, a mere preliminary to the real and </p><p>lasting agony, was greeted with prolonged </p><p>howls of approval. Cameron bit his hps </p><p>and braced his shoulders. </p><p> “Ho! Ho!” roared the onlookers.</p><p> Again the prisoner was forced close to</p><p>the coals, this time so near that his flesh </p><p>began to shrivel. Then he was drawn </p><p>back a pace and another brave offered </p><p>him water. Cameron ignored the kettle </p><p>until it was pressed almost against his </p><p>lips, when his suffering drove him to try </p><p>once more. This time he was permitted </p><p>to bury his mouth in the fluid only to jerk </p><p>back his head with a groan of pain. It was </p><p>scalding hot. </p><p> “Ho! Ho! The white man does not like</p><p>the drink of the Iroquois,” exulted the </p><p>warrior. </p><p> A crescendo of fiendish approval lasted</p><p>for nearly a minute and was only stilled </p><p>when the deep voice of the master of </p><p>ceremonies called for silence. This was </p><p>the signal for the torture to begin in </p><p>earnest. Two braves seized the victim </p><p>and made a chain fast about his waist and </p><p>prepared to hurl him inside the glowing </p><p>circle. The stake, a large sapling trimmed </p><p>of its branches, was sizzling as the heat dried </p><p>up the oozing sap. </p><p> The savage spectators glared expectantly.</p><p>A New Keeper of the Wampum </p><p>117 </p><p>Even the brood of hags ceased their clamor. </p><p>Now was come the real test between the </p><p>prisoner’s defiant bearing and the resources </p><p>of the Iroquois. It was to be a duel, such </p><p>as the Indians ever loved to witness; </p><p>shrinking flesh and raw nerves against all </p><p>the devices for inflicting physical suffering </p><p>the diabolism of the Long House could put </p><p>in practise. </p><p> When the chain was firmly fastened</p><p>about Cameron’s waist the warriors bent </p><p>their knees and made ready to hurl him </p><p>inside the fatal ring. From the opposite </p><p>side a brave drew a long breath and leaped </p><p>the hurdle of coals to catch the slack of </p><p>the chain and make it secure about the </p><p>stake. But something shot over the vic- </p><p>tim’s head and twined like a snake about </p><p>the neck of the brave. </p><p> With a yelp of astonishment the young</p><p>brave tore the thing loose and leaped from </p><p>the circle. As he held it above his head </p><p>the spectators glared incredulously. The </p><p>warriors holding Cameron released him to </p><p>gape in amazement, and he worked back </p><p>from the fierce heat unrebuked. A new </p><p>and unthinkable climax had been thrust </p><p>into the scene. </p><p> What so miraculously dropped from the</p><p>velvet heavens was a wampum belt, and, </p><p>at that, one the Iroquois recognized as a </p><p>cherished possession of the federated tribes. </p><p>It was seven rows of beads wide and several </p><p>hundred beads long. It contained the </p><p>figure of a man at one end and a cross at </p><p>the other, both in white against a dark </p><p>ground, and connected by a single row of </p><p>white beads. There was none who did not </p><p>identify it as a French belt, the markings </p><p>recording the great distance the envoy </p><p>traveled in order to present his “talk” to </p><p>the Long House. </p><p> But the reasons for the envoy’s coming,</p><p>as “talked” by him into the wampum, was </p><p>known only to the hereditary keeper of </p><p>the wampum. It was in wampum that </p><p>the Six Nations recorded their speeches, </p><p>treaties, laws, tribal and intertribal history. </p><p>It was the last step before hieroglyphics, </p><p>and perhaps on a par with and yet more </p><p>subtle than picture-writing. The pattern</p><p>of the beads associated the sign or object </p><p>with some historical fact or epochal idea. </p><p>Therefore the office of the hereditary keeper </p><p>was semi-sacred and its inviolability was </p><p>to be maintained at all costs. </p><p> While each savage mind was struggling</p><p>to find an explanation for the belt flying </p><p>through the night there rang out a mocking </p><p>voice up the slope, the words falling like the </p><p>crack of a whip. </p><p> “Ho! Ho! A white man comes to trade!”</p><p>it proclaimed. </p><p> With an inarticulate, primitive cry of rage</p><p>the Iroquois emerged from their stupor. </p><p> “Ho! Ho!” continued the mocking voice.</p><p>“Who trades for kanasa (wampum)? Who </p><p>will give white flesh for white and black </p><p>and purple wampum? Six strings is the </p><p>price of a life. The white man offers seven </p><p>strings.” </p><p> The stake and its victim were forgotten</p><p>as the Indians fixed their astounded gaze </p><p>on the figure of Martin standing in the </p><p>brightly illumined doorway of the council. </p><p>If not for his confession that his flesh was </p><p>white they would have accepted him for </p><p>a Cayuga, with the totem of a dancing bear </p><p>showing on his oily chest. </p><p> “Ho! Who trades for Onondaga belts?</p><p>Who trades for the records of the Long </p><p>House?” </p><p> With a terrific yell the savages sprang</p><p>forward in a mass, now realizing a stranger </p><p>stood in the place of the keeper of the </p><p>sacred wampum; but before they could </p><p>swarm up the slope and wipe out the </p><p>profanation Martin pulled the keg into </p><p>view and held his pistol to it, loudly </p><p>warning: </p><p> “Keep back, ye dogs! Keep far back,</p><p>or I blow up this council-house and your </p><p>wampum. This is gunpowder.” </p><p> As he spoke his left hand piled the</p><p>precious records about the keg. </p><p> The onrush halted abruptly. Having</p><p>impressed upon the Iroquois the need of </p><p>prudence Martin resumed his taunts and</p><p>boisterously called out: </p><p> “I see six strings of purple beads bound</p><p>together—the Six Nations.” And he held </p><p>up the cluster of strings symbolic of the </p><p>Long House. “Here are seven of purple </p><p>and a handful of white—the voice of the </p><p>Onondagas. And strings that speak for </p><p>the Cayugas, the Mohawks and the Senecas. </p><p>Who has a white man called Cameron to </p><p>trade for strings and belts of wampum?” </p><p> A tall savage, wearing the insignia of the</p><p>hereditary chiefship of the Onondaga Bear </p><p>clan, lifted his right hand, palm outward, </p><p>and slowly advanced beyond his fellows to </p><p>act as spokesman, as befitted him who </p><p>headed the roll of the federal chiefs. </p><p>118 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “What does the white man do here,</p><p>painted like a Cayuga?” he demanded. </p><p> “He comes to trade with Wathatotarho,”</p><p>answered Martin, giving him his official </p><p>name and title. </p><p> “What has he to trade?”</p><p> “Belts of the Onondaga, of every tribe</p><p>in the Six Nations; the records of the Long </p><p>House. For good measure he will throw </p><p>in the hereditary keeper of the wampum.” </p><p>As he spoke Martin reached aside and </p><p>dragged a kicking bundle into view. </p><p> Wathatotarho faced the warriors and</p><p>solemnly announced: </p><p> “He has been touched by the Great</p><p>Spirit. He shall go in peace.” </p><p> “Ho, he shall go in peace,” was the</p><p>rumbling response. </p><p> “The Great Spirit sent the white man</p><p>here in an Indian skin to trade with the </p><p>Iroquois,” calmly corrected the ranger. </p><p>“He must remain till he has made a bargain. </p><p>Many moons ago the French talked with </p><p>you with thirty-six belts, the greatest </p><p>wampum talk ever held till now. Behold! </p><p>I talk to you with more than a hundred </p><p>belts. I talk with this one, sent to the </p><p>Long House long ago by the Wagunhas </p><p>(Ottawa); I talk with this one, black, with </p><p>rows of white between, with the white </p><p>council-fire in the middle, and the white </p><p>road, leading to Johnson Hall—Sir William </p><p>Johnson’s friendship belt, given when he </p><p>first met the Iroquois.” </p><p> There rose dolorous howls from the</p><p>Mohawks, who still mourned the dead </p><p>superintendent. Martin held up another, </p><p>ragged at the ends, obviously an ancient </p><p>belt, and said: </p><p> “Or I talk with this, a peace belt sent the</p><p>Onondaga by the Cherokee Nation. Who </p><p>wants to buy? I give kanasa for a white </p><p>man called Cameron.” </p><p> “The white man has gunpowder in the</p><p>keg?” from Wathatotarho.</p><p> For an answer Martin selected a small</p><p>belt such as the Senecas used in the White </p><p>Dog Sacrifice, and dipped it in a gourd of </p><p>water and then sprinkled it liberally with </p><p>the powder. Wadding it into a ball he </p><p>suddenly hurled it toward the fire. With </p><p>cries of dismay a dozen hands stretched out </p><p>to catch the consecrated object, but failed, </p><p>and the belt fell at the edge of the coals. </p><p>Instantly there came a surish and a bright </p><p>flash that removed all doubt as to the nature </p><p>of the black sand. </p><p> “Back of this council-house is a dead</p><p>Mohawk dog. Take that belt in payment,” </p><p>cried Martin. </p><p> The savages stared aghast. Mutterings</p><p>of ferocious rage rippled through the dark </p><p>ranks, and several braves at the ends of the </p><p>lines detached themselves and slipped into </p><p>the undergrowth. Martin pulled the keg </p><p>and belts back from the door and warned: </p><p>“Listen, ye Iroquois, to my last words. </p><p>The man Cameron is to be set free now, </p><p>or I blow myself and this council-house and </p><p>these belts into the sky. Call back your </p><p>young men who foolishly think to take me </p><p>by surprise. Your answer? Shall I fire?” </p><p>And he tightened his grip on the pistol. </p><p> Wathatotarho threw up both hands in a</p><p>gesture of surrender. </p><p> “The man Cameron shall go with you.</p><p>Take him and leave us our wampum.” </p><p>With an exclamation of joy Cameron </p><p>advanced up the slope with no hand at- </p><p>tempting to stay his steps, but he became </p><p>bewildered when the ranger sharply ordered </p><p>him to halt. </p><p> “It’s one of their tricks, Jim Cameron,”</p><p>fiercely explained Martin. “Stay where </p><p>you are till they bring your clothes. They </p><p>must take you to Fort Stanwix. On </p><p>arriving send back a written word that I </p><p>may know you are safe.” </p><p> “Jo Martin! Old Jo!” choked the big</p><p>fellow, rubbing his eyes. </p><p> “Dancing Black Bear of the Cayugas!”</p><p>corrected Martin frigidly. “Here’s some- </p><p>thing I was to give you. Take it, and </p><p>be-”</p><p> Then to Wathatotarho:</p><p> “Let your braves take the prisoner to</p><p>Stanwix and guard him from harm. He </p><p>will send a talking paper to me. Then, </p><p>and not till then, you shall have back your </p><p>belts and your wampum-keeper.” </p><p> With that he closed the door and made</p><p>it fast. </p><p>“THE white man has his talking </p><p>paper. Why does he not leave us </p><p>in peace?” demanded Wathatotarho </p><p>outside the closed door. </p><p> Martin reread the scrawl which had been</p><p>shoved under the door. He knew it was </p><p>genuine, for Cameron had written: </p><p>We fought side by side at Oriskany and on the </p><p>river trail to Cotton’s. </p><p> Jim Cameron,</p><p> Ft. Stanwix.</p><p>A. New Keeper of the Wampum </p><p>1191 </p><p> Striking his ax against the door the</p><p>ranger ordered— </p><p> “Stand far away, Wathatotarho.”</p><p> The chief retired to the long line of</p><p>warriors. It was night and several fires </p><p>brought the long lines into half-relief. And </p><p>Martin knew the lines completely encircled </p><p>the council-house. As he heard the chief </p><p>retreat the ranger stooped over the sachem </p><p>and pressed the point of his knife to the </p><p>man’s throat, and, removing the gag, </p><p>hissed: </p><p> “Say again the words, ‘He’s in the shed.’</p><p>But say them softly.” </p><p> The sachem groaned in a paroxysm of-</p><p>rage, limbered up his jaws and did as told. </p><p>Martin clapped back the gag and tested </p><p>his imitation of the sachem’s voice. There </p><p>was a peculiar, shrill, crackling note that </p><p>was hard to get, but he believed he had it. </p><p>Already he had adorned himself with the </p><p>sachem’s necklace of beads and other </p><p>insignia, and by means of the paint-bag </p><p>had counterfeited the sachem’s facial deco- </p><p>rations. He also had further thinned his </p><p>hair by a Spartan use of the knife and was </p><p>now ready to trust his luck to the night. </p><p> Placing a kettle of water beside the</p><p>powder and throwing the sachem’s painted </p><p>skin cloak over his shoulders he sagged </p><p>his shoulders and bent his back in a sem- </p><p>blance of old age. Then he drew a deep </p><p>breath and threw back the door violently. </p><p> Wathatotarho and his warriors surged</p><p>forward as the door flew open, then remem- </p><p>bered the keg and fell back. But instead </p><p>of the intruder’s erect figure they beheld </p><p>the bowed form of the hereditary keeper </p><p>of the wampum; and even as they gazed </p><p>and wondered how he became free he seized </p><p>the kettle of water and dashed it over the </p><p>powder and in a shrill voice screeched: </p><p>“He’s in the shed! The powder is wet.” </p><p>And with one frightened glance over his </p><p>shoulder he scuttled down the slope toward </p><p>the savages. </p><p>■	“AN ATTACK,” yelled a sentinel</p><p>as a splutter of rifle-shots aroused</p><p>the woods before Fort Stanwix. </p><p>“Don’t shoot!” yelled Cameron, knock- </p><p>ing up the rifle as a painted savage reeled </p><p>into the opening with a war arrow flapping </p><p>from his left shoulder. “It’s Jo Martin. </p><p>Come on, fellers!” </p><p> And he dropped over the stockade with</p><p>several scouts at his heels. </p><p> Martin, streaked with blood and sweat</p><p>and dirt, hobbled . toward them. Out of </p><p>the forest burst three Iroquois, a Mohawk, </p><p>an Onandaga, and a Seneca, each striving </p><p>to count a coup by securing the mad white </p><p>man’s scalp. They were at Martin’s heels </p><p>while Cameron and his followers were </p><p>several hundred yards distant. Martin </p><p>realized he must do his own fighting for a </p><p>bit longer. He wheeled, and holding the </p><p>long rifle with one hand shot the Onondaga, </p><p>who went down with a gush of blood </p><p>stifling his death-cry. </p><p> Dropping the rifle and summoning all</p><p>his strength the ranger plucked the ax </p><p>from his belt and spun it in a glittering </p><p>circle full into the face of the Seneca, who </p><p>dropped with no semblance of features left. </p><p>The Mohawk hurled his ax and missed and </p><p>turned to flee, but tripped and sprawled </p><p>headlong. As he regained his feet Cameron </p><p>caught him by the neck, and, thus holding </p><p>him, swung him clear of the ground and </p><p>about his head and hurled him with </p><p>sickening force against a stump. </p><p> They carried Martin, more dead than</p><p>alive, inside the fort and placed him on a </p><p>pallet. His shoulders and chest bore testi- </p><p>mony to the fight he had made in winning </p><p>through to Stanwix. As they washed </p><p>and dressed his wounds he opened his eyes </p><p>and scowled feebly on beholding Cameron. </p><p> “Don’t say it, Jo,” huskily begged</p><p>Cameron. “The birchbark she sent me. </p><p>Listen. It says, ‘I love the man who </p><p>fetched you back.’ Betty sent it. She </p><p>wouldn’t give me an answer the day I went </p><p>to help you hold ’em back on the river trail. </p><p>But it was you—you all the time.” </p><p> There was a flutter of skirts through the</p><p>open door and Cameron was pushed aside </p><p>that Betty herself might kneel by the </p><p>ranger and lay her cheek against his hid- </p><p>eously painted face.</p><p> “Always you, Jo,” she sobbed. “But</p><p>you angered me by trying to dictate. A </p><p>maid’s a maid but once—and shouldn’t be </p><p>hurried. Then you said you’d force me </p><p>to marry you—and never made love to </p><p>me—or gave me a chance.” </p><p> Cameron reached over the girl’s shoulder</p><p>and seized the ranger’s right hand, saying: </p><p> “You saved me from the stake, Jo.</p><p>Yoq’ve got the girl I wanted. I owe you a </p><p>life, Jo. It’s yours at the call. Good luck </p><p>and good fortune—I’m off for Mich’- </p><p>limack’nac.” </p><p>Ebr the Flag </p><p>A Four-Pat^ Siorvf </p><p>Conclusion </p><p>jby T/tomas Addison </p><p>“The Boss of Powdetvitte," “G 2—Defective," etc. </p><p>CHAPTER XXV </p><p>Tine SIGNAL FROM THE WOODS </p><p>mILLY went up to the roof and </p><p>loosed the flag; the pole had with- </p><p>stood the storm bravely. He re- </p><p>ported that he could see nothing </p><p>of the Germans. But this was not strange. </p><p>The binocular could sweep the distant </p><p>reaches of the Santa Marta road, but close </p><p>at hand the trees prevented a view of the </p><p>ravine on either side. To the west the hill </p><p>dropped away forbiddingly to the lower </p><p>lands. To the east was the gentle slope of </p><p>the old coffee field. Farther east where </p><p>the footbridge was to be found, according </p><p>to Diego, a stretch of the primeval forest </p><p>intervened. And to the south the forest </p><p>again blocked the view. </p><p> They lunched, and afterward the four</p><p>of them gathered in the living-room to </p><p>discuss the situation. They had decided </p><p>that it was unnecessary to keep a watch </p><p>at Kaufman’s door. He could not break </p><p>it down without making a commotion that </p><p>would raise the dead, and his barred windows </p><p>guarded against escape in that direction. </p><p> The rain was over. Sam was patrolling</p><p>the grounds with a loaded Mauser. Tia </p><p>Matilde was bringing into the dining-room </p><p>pantry the supplies she had cooked. Tio </p><p>Diego had gone to his hut on the edge of </p><p>the woods on some errand of his own. </p><p>Winifred threw open the shutters of the </p><p>living-room. </p><p> “We can close them at a moment’s</p><p>notice,” she said. “It is like a tomb in </p><p>here with only these peepholes to let the </p><p>light in.” </p><p> Jimmy had broached the cigars brought</p><p>from Cortina. They were mild and Brewer, </p><p>who smoked only occasionally, was drawing </p><p>on one with what small relish the hour </p><p>permitted. He was standing at a front </p><p>window looking out. Billy, sprawled in</p><p>inelegant comfort in an easy chair, re- </p><p>marked sagely— </p><p> “What we ought to have done was to-</p><p>hustle out and chop that bridge down.” </p><p>Brewer glanced around at him. </p><p> “It would only have delayed them, Billy.</p><p>They would have gone back to the ford, </p><p>and waited until they could get across.” </p><p>“It seems to me that if they had known </p><p>about the bridge they would be here by </p><p>now,” advanced Winifred. “They have </p><p>had time for it.” </p><p> Brewer made a motion of assent.</p><p> “Yes. And there is another thing. I</p><p>may have been wrong in my conclusions. </p><p>The men I saw might very well have been </p><p>on their way to Santa Marta, not here. </p><p>I can give no reason for thinking they were </p><p>Germans. I simply had a feeling that they </p><p>were.” </p><p> He deprecated this feeble logic with a</p><p>meager smile. </p><p> “If I could get over to the other side of</p><p>the ravine I’d soon find out if there were </p><p>any Germans there,” observed Jimmy. </p><p> He brushed the ash from his cigar, scowl-</p><p>120 </p><p>For the Flag </p><p>121 </p><p>ing and grimacing thoughtfully. </p><p> “Yes, and get nabbed by them,” Billy</p><p>scoffed. </p><p> “Oh, maybe not. I’d try it higher up,</p><p>and work down to them through the woods.” </p><p> Billy grunted his disfavor of the plan.</p><p> “Come again, father. Diego says it will</p><p>be night before any one can cross. That </p><p>was some sprinkle we had, if it was short. </p><p>And if it’s a boat you are thinking of, there </p><p>isn’t any. I asked Diego.” </p><p> “I might swim it.”</p><p> “Ever try swimming in a mill race?</p><p>You don’t know what a babbling little </p><p>brook can be in this country after a cloud- </p><p>burst. And if you could do it they’d pot </p><p>you before you were half over. A neat way </p><p>to rob the Perry millions of an heir. Gee </p><p>whiz!” </p><p> Brewer slewed around abruptly to the</p><p>window. Jimmy spoke up quickly. </p><p> “You are a cheerful hand to have about,</p><p>dear child. A real inspiration in a time of </p><p>trouble. I’m glad I brought you along.” </p><p> He managed a careless laugh, and with it,</p><p>covertly, a black look at Billy. The boy </p><p>stared at him. What had he said to bring </p><p>this glowering visitation on himself? He </p><p>was on the point of injuredly demanding </p><p>an explanation when an interruption turned </p><p>the thoughts of all into other channels. </p><p>Sam appeared at the window where Brewer </p><p>was standing. He had come around the </p><p>house from the west side. His manner </p><p>was mysterious. </p><p> “I ain’t let him see I’se a-pryin’ on him,</p><p>but ’pears like Mister Coughem he carryin’ </p><p>on wif somebuddy over yander.” He </p><p>jerked a Gargantuan thumb in the direc- </p><p>tion of the woods that ran along the </p><p>southern edge of the coffee field. He’s </p><p>done t’rowed open de shutters, an’ he’s </p><p>floutin’ er rag out de winder. ’Tain’t jes’ </p><p>to ’muse himse’f, I ’low, yit I kain’t make </p><p>out nobuddy over dar.”</p><p> They were all crowded around the window</p><p>now. </p><p> “It was the Germans you saw, father,”</p><p>exclaimed Winifred. “They found the </p><p>bridge.” </p><p> “I wish I could know how many there</p><p>are,” mused Brewer. “They won’t try to </p><p>parley with us after the reception we gave </p><p>them on their first visit.” </p><p> “I am going up on the roof. Perhaps</p><p>I can see them,” Jimmy said. He sigaed to </p><p>Billy to follow him. </p><p> “They may shoot you!” cried Winifred.</p><p>“Don’t go up.” </p><p> “I won’t show myself more than I can</p><p>help,” he assured her. “I doubt if they </p><p>carry anything but pistols, and it’s a far </p><p>shot from the woods.” </p><p> The field-glass was in the chair where</p><p>Billy had dropped it when he came down </p><p>from his survey before lunch. Jimmy </p><p>seized it. He was about to mount the </p><p>ladder, with Billy to support it, when it </p><p>occurred to him that he would better have </p><p>a peep at Kaufman first. He tiptoed to his </p><p>door, and pushed the slide back gently. </p><p> If the imperial envoy had been signaling</p><p>to any one he was not at this moment so </p><p>engaged. He was at his southeast window, </p><p>stock still, and muttering to himself, </p><p>slowly, with curious silences intervening. </p><p>As he watched, Jimmy saw Kaufman nod </p><p>to himself, and raise his hand. There was </p><p>a towel in it. He reached his arm through </p><p>the bars, and went through a sequence of </p><p>motions—up and down, and from side to </p><p>side in, it appeared, some sort of pre- </p><p>established order. </p><p> Jimmy closed the slide and returned to</p><p>Billy. He told him what he had seen. </p><p> “Wig-wagging!” the boy exclaimed.</p><p>“There’s army training for you! I bet it is </p><p>Neiderlein talking to him. We ought to </p><p>stop it, Jimmy. Kaufman is telling him </p><p>what to do.” </p><p> “Let Brewer know,” Jimmy bade him.</p><p>“I can manage to get up here, I reckon,</p><p>without a fall.” </p><p> Billy ran off. Jimmy climbed the ladder.</p><p>He lifted a wing of the skylight until he </p><p>could push his head through the opening. </p><p>The ladder wobbled crazily under him, </p><p>and he clutched at the skylight casing to </p><p>save himself. Then, of a sudden, he found </p><p>his footing firmer. The ladder was being </p><p>steadied from below. </p><p> “I am holding it,” said a voice. It was</p><p>Winifred. </p><p> Jimmy looked down at her.</p><p> “Thank you,” he returned. “I was</p><p>making a mess of it. Billy told you about </p><p>Kaufman?” </p><p> “Yes. He and father are planning some-</p><p>thing. Do be careful up there. Don’t </p><p>let them see you.” </p><p> “I don’t think they can. I won’t keep</p><p>you long.” </p><p> He rested his elbows on the coaming and</p><p>conned the coffee field and the adjoining </p><p>122 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>wood with the binocular. If Kaufman </p><p>had ceased his signaling there would in all </p><p>likelihood be a response unless—and this </p><p>was possible—the minister’s message was </p><p>final. In such case no one would show him- </p><p>self in the open, Jimmy decided. </p><p> “Do you see any one?” Winifred called</p><p>up to him. </p><p> He lowered the glass as he replied.</p><p> “Not a soul. They’ve done talking, for</p><p>the time anyway. I think I’ll come down. </p><p>Ha! Wait a minute.” </p><p> He had put the glass to his eyes for a last</p><p>look. Something moved in the field of </p><p>vision—an animal of sofne kind, he thought </p><p>at first, skulking in the brush at the verge </p><p>of the woods. It was moving away from </p><p>the trees in a line that would take it along </p><p>the bottom of the hill and in the direction </p><p>of the ravine. Jimmy revised his initial </p><p>impression. </p><p> “That’s no four-footed beast,” he mur-</p><p>mured. </p><p>A SMALL clear space amid the </p><p>bushes lay in the path of the </p><p>prowler. Jimmy centered his gaze </p><p>on it. The thing came to it, and darted </p><p>across. It was a man, bent double and </p><p>running. He was immediately swallowed </p><p>up in the farther bushes. One of the </p><p>Germans, of course. Any one on a peace- </p><p>able errand would not act in this way. </p><p> Jimmy turned his glass to the woods.</p><p>If there were others following he wanted </p><p>to know how many. But nothing stirred. </p><p>He swept the coffee field again; there was </p><p>no movement in it. The man was lost to </p><p>view. </p><p> The sound of hammering jarred the still-</p><p>ness. It startled Jimmy. He drew his </p><p>head in from the skylight and questioned </p><p>Winifred. She was holding the ladder with </p><p>rigid arms, bracing it against his sudden </p><p>shift of balance. </p><p> “What is it—that noise?” he asked.</p><p> “Father and Billy are nailing Herr Kauf-</p><p>man’s shutters up. A board on the out- </p><p>side.” </p><p> Jimmy grinned.</p><p> “Incommunicado. Fine!” He started</p><p>down. “Well, I saw the chap. He was </p><p>running toward the ravine. There are no </p><p>others, or at any rate they didn’t show </p><p>themselves.” He stood beside her now </p><p>on the floor. “Thank you for your help.” </p><p> She waved it aside.</p><p> “If we are to succeed each must help</p><p>where he can. Why was the man running </p><p>to the ravine? Can you guess? What </p><p>could he want there if they came over on </p><p>the bridge? They can’t bring the caracross.” </p><p>“It is what I’d like to know,” rejoined </p><p>Jimmy. “It couldn’t be that only one </p><p>of them tried the bridge. And yet if all </p><p>came why is that fellow heading for the </p><p>river?” </p><p> The hammering started up again, and</p><p>from Kaufman’s room proceeded harsh cries </p><p>of. expostulation. </p><p> “There are three windows,” commented</p><p>Winifred. “They are at the second.” </p><p>Jimmy was thinking of that skulking </p><p>figure in the bushes. </p><p> “I’m going to see what he’s up to,” he</p><p>announced. “No, not Herr Kaufman; I </p><p>can hear what he’s up to,” he laughed. “I </p><p>mean that other Hun. I am going down </p><p>to the river.” </p><p> He ran into the living-room and picked</p><p>up his revolver from the table. Winifred </p><p>followed him to the door. </p><p> “Do you think it wise?” she asked. Her</p><p>eyes were troubled. “Because you saw only </p><p>one man it doesn’t indicate that he is alone. </p><p>The others may be waiting for him. You </p><p>may fall into a trap.” </p><p> “But,” he argued, “we decided, didn’t</p><p>we, that if they had come by the bridge </p><p>there would be nothing to call them to the </p><p>ravine—not while the water is high.” </p><p> “I don’t know what to say,” she answered</p><p>with an anxious frown. “Only it seems to</p><p>me that you are running a risk with no </p><p>advantage to be gained. It seems to me </p><p>that our part is to wait for what may </p><p>happen. We are on the defensive.” </p><p> “Yes, but if I can find out what is doing</p><p>down there we shall be doubly armed. To </p><p>know what the other fellow is going to do </p><p>before he does it is some advantage, isn’t </p><p>it?” He smiled at her whimsically. “I’ll </p><p>keep both eyes open, one in front and one </p><p>' behind. He won’t catch me asleep, that </p><p>chap.” </p><p>She said nothing. She saw that he was </p><p>bent on going, and she stepped aside from </p><p>the door. He paused and held out his hand. </p><p>“Will you wish me luck, Winifred?” </p><p> It was the second time that he had called</p><p>her by her given name, yet she showed </p><p>no resentment. She accepted it as a con- </p><p>dition of the strange intimacy in which </p><p>events had placed them. </p><p>For the Flag </p><p>123 </p><p> “I shall watch for you to come back,”</p><p>she said simply, and let her hand rest </p><p>briefly in his. </p><p> He had left the house and was crossing</p><p>to the fringe of trees on the brow of the hill </p><p>when he heard her call to him— </p><p> “Mr. Perry!”</p><p> He turned. She sat at a window of the</p><p>living-room. She had drawn to one of </p><p>the shutters, and had paused with the other </p><p>half-closed. </p><p> “If you have trouble fire a shot,” she</p><p>finished. </p><p> He returned a step or two.</p><p> “That was clear,” he said. “But the</p><p>first part—please repeat it.” </p><p> “The first part?” She did not under-</p><p>stand. </p><p> “Yes. The name. Mr. Smith is ‘Billy’</p><p>to his friends. I claim a similar recognition </p><p>from mine. I am ‘Jimmy’ to those I </p><p>care for.” </p><p> He had come back still other steps as he</p><p>spoke. He was ten yards from her. She </p><p>regarded him with a detached air, as might </p><p>one who is asked to solve a complex problem </p><p>suddenly presented. In the stress of the </p><p>time that was upon them he had stopped </p><p>for this—a token of an assured friendship </p><p>that could never be. How should she </p><p>answer him? The solution was as old as </p><p>Mother Eve. She said, speaking gravely </p><p>and distinctly— </p><p> “If you get into trouble, Jimmy, fire a</p><p>shot to let us know.” </p><p> The shutter closed. Jimmy started anew</p><p>on his quest. A smile was on his lips, but </p><p>not of triumph; it went deeper than </p><p>that. </p><p>CHAPTER XXVI </p><p>WHAT DIEGO FOUND </p><p>KAUFMAN, in a supreme access of rage, </p><p>had emptied his water pitcher on </p><p>Brewer and Billy as they were nailing up </p><p>the last of the three windows; and he had </p><p>applied epithets to them in his own tongue </p><p>that Billy in common decency had refrained </p><p>from interpreting to Brewer. The latter, </p><p>however, sensed the reason for his silence. </p><p>He said: </p><p> “I am going in to speak to this fellow,</p><p>Billy. Come with me.” </p><p> Kaufman greeted them with a rabid look.</p><p>He burst out at Billy in a flood of German. </p><p>Brewer interfered, his eyes narrowing on </p><p>the man. </p><p>“You can speak English—do it!” he </p><p>snapped. </p><p> Kaufman paid no regard to him. He</p><p>continued his animadversions to Billy, who </p><p>in a way of his own, brought to pass what </p><p>Brewer had failed to do. He compelled </p><p>the German to employ his English in self- </p><p>defense. </p><p> “He says,” Billy reported to Brewer with</p><p>nice enunciation, “that his eyes are not </p><p>strong, and he appreciates the darkening </p><p>of the room for him.” </p><p> “That is not so! It is a lie!” bellowed</p><p>the diplomat. He shook a furious finger </p><p>at the recreant youth. “You are a Ger- </p><p>man, and you are faithless to your blood— </p><p>a miserable renegade!” </p><p> “Hold up there!” Billy’s chin protruded</p><p>belligerently. “I’m not a German, not </p><p>any more than Roosevelt is a Dutchman. </p><p>Get me straight. I’m an American, born, </p><p>bred and brought up under the flag that </p><p>floats above this house—the Stars and </p><p>Stripes of America.” </p><p> ‘ Der Teufel hole Amerikal” shrieked the</p><p>other. </p><p> “And,” continued Billy, unmindful of</p><p>the objurgation, “what German blood is in </p><p>me is clean—straight from the honest soil— </p><p>and I’m proud of it. But for the murdering </p><p>Kaiser who has made the German name a</p><p>stink in the world I say—to hell with him </p><p>and all his brood!” </p><p> The imperial envoy staggered under this</p><p>blasphemy. He strove to speak, but only </p><p>swallowed horribly. Brewer spoke instead. </p><p> “I wish to inform you, Kaufman, that</p><p>there will be no more wig-wagging from this </p><p>house. If you put a hand out of one of </p><p>these windows the negro Sam will chop </p><p>it off.” </p><p> This definite way of stating the alterna-</p><p>tive made its impress on the minister. It </p><p>brought him down to the realities of his </p><p>plight. He had been quick to see that </p><p>through the shutter peepholes he could </p><p>still signal to his people. But now! The </p><p>image of the black Goliath rose before him </p><p>and chilled his blood. </p><p> “I think that’s all,” Brewer added.</p><p> He looked at Billy, and they moved to</p><p>the door. Kaufman called to them </p><p>explosively. </p><p>“A moment! I have friends at hand. </p><p>You will save yourselves from harm if you </p><p>124 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>stop where you are in this outrage. Re- </p><p>store me to liberty, and my friends will go </p><p>away. You have my official word for it.” </p><p>Brewer contemplated him with a </p><p>strangely interested air. </p><p> “Your official word, you say?”</p><p> “Jal”</p><p> “A promise in the Kaiser’s name?”</p><p> “Ja! Ja!”</p><p> Brewer swung to his heel, and drew open</p><p>the door. </p><p> “Come,” he said to Billy. “He offers</p><p>us only brass.” </p><p> With the roar of a maddened bull Kauf-</p><p>man hurled himself at them. Billy was </p><p>standing back of Brewer in the room. He </p><p>jumped aside and stuck out a foot. The </p><p>representative of Imperial Germany came </p><p>down in a most democratic sprawl. He </p><p>was not hurt, they saw; he was only wofully </p><p>stripped of his bravado and breath. </p><p> Billy grinned at Brewer.</p><p> “Shall we go now?” he suggested.</p><p>For answer Brewer motioned him out </p><p>and bolted the door. Winifred came run- </p><p>ning from her room to meet them. She </p><p>had heard the crash of Kaufman’s fall. </p><p>“What was it?”-she inquired anxiously. </p><p>“An overturned chair,” Brewer told her. </p><p>She knew it was an evasion to quiet her </p><p>alarm, and it pleased her. She did not </p><p>press the question, and they went together </p><p>to the living-room. </p><p> “Where is Jimmy?” Billy queried. “Not</p><p>on the roof all this time?” </p><p> She recounted what had taken place.</p><p> “I told Sam to let us know if he heard a</p><p>shot,” she ended. </p><p> Brewer looked grave.</p><p> “I don’t like it,” he said. “It was a</p><p>foolish thing to do.” </p><p> Billy, who could entertain the adventure</p><p>in an alluring light, did not agree with him. </p><p>But he would not contradict him openly. </p><p> “It wouldn’t be a bad thing to know</p><p>how many we’ve got to handle,” he ad- </p><p>vanced. “What I can’t make out is why </p><p>the dickens they don’t come at us. There’s </p><p>nothing to prevent. What’s holding them </p><p>off? Maybe Jimmy can tell us when he </p><p>gets back.” </p><p> Some one knocked at the shutters of the</p><p>east window. Winifred had closed them </p><p>all when Jimmy left. Brewer crossed to </p><p>the window and reconnoitered the outside. </p><p>It was Sam, and with him was Tio Diego. </p><p>Brewer threw open the shutters. </p><p> Sam pointed to the peasant.</p><p> “Dere’s somethin’ he got on his min’,</p><p>Boss, an’ I kain’t make head er tail on it. </p><p>If dey’d only speak so’s people could </p><p>un’erstan’ w’at dey’s aimin’ at it’d save er </p><p>heap er trubbel.” </p><p>DIEGO shrugged hopelessly. He </p><p>knew that Brewer’s Spanish was a </p><p>thing of verbal shreds and tatters, </p><p>and his daughter’s was but little better. </p><p>But—as Billy appeared—here was a Chris- </p><p>tian who could speak the language of the </p><p>blessed saints, if not with the entire ex- </p><p>cellence of one born and cradled in it. </p><p>He erupted into a passionate recital, in </p><p>which shoulders, hands, and every facial </p><p>muscle took a part. Billy stopped him from </p><p>time to time to translate to the others. In </p><p>substance Diego’s story was this: </p><p> He had gone to his hut for tobacco to</p><p>make cigarets. He got to thinking of the </p><p>old footbridge at the south end of the </p><p>ravine; it seemed that what he had said </p><p>about it to the Americans was considered </p><p>important. He decided to go and see if it </p><p>was still there. </p><p> He followed an old, little-known trail,</p><p>for it was the short way to the bridge. It </p><p>led across the Santa Marta road, and then </p><p>again into the forest until it brought up </p><p>at the ravine. One could, of course, follow </p><p>the stream from the ford, but that was the </p><p>long way around and the more difficult.</p><p> Well, when finally he came out on the</p><p>river there was no bridge. It had gone. </p><p>There was some wreckage of it on the bank </p><p>where it had torn away from its anchorage, </p><p>but the bridge itself was not there. He ex- </p><p>amined the wreckage, and the fractures were </p><p>fresh. He looked about him. There were </p><p>scrambling muddy marks on the rocks— </p><p>quite fresh—and back a little were foot- </p><p>prints in the soft earth. A man’s—one </p><p>only—one single man. </p><p> It was easy now to tell what had hap-</p><p>pened. The bridge was old, it was weak, </p><p>it was rotten. And the storm had shaken </p><p>it. The man started over on it. He was half- </p><p>way when it began to give. It was as safe </p><p>to advance as to retreat. He went on, and </p><p>by the grace of his patron saint reached the </p><p>bank and threw himself down on it as the </p><p>bridge broke and fell. </p><p> That was all. Diego had followed the</p><p>footprints a few rods. The man was going </p><p>north along the river. Diego had turned </p><p>For the Flag </p><p>125 </p><p>back and hurried home to tell what he had </p><p>seen. </p><p> Billy took from his pocket one of the</p><p>silver dollars he had extracted from the </p><p>reluctant Whittaker and handed it to </p><p>Diego. He commended him for what he </p><p>had done, and bade him stay close to the </p><p>house for the rest of the day. They might </p><p>have need of him. </p><p> “Well, we have learned that there is</p><p>only one man on this side,” said Winifred. </p><p>“The others must have gone back to the </p><p>ford on the opposite side as they came.” </p><p> A little sigh of relief, of which she herself</p><p>was unaware, escaped her. </p><p> “I wonder if it was Neiderlein who got</p><p>across?” speculated Billy. “It was a </p><p>leader’s job, and he is the legation head </p><p>in the absence of Kaufman. Huh, Jimmy </p><p>can take care of him all right.” </p><p> He helped himself to a cigar from the box</p><p>on the table, and sat down. Brewer was </p><p>pacing the room meditatively. Winifred </p><p>remained by the window, looking out. Sam </p><p>had resumed his patrol of the grounds. </p><p>Brewer halted abruptly. </p><p> “You say, Winny, that Perry was to fire</p><p>a shot if he met with trouble?” </p><p> “Yes. He promised to.”</p><p> “What was his plan? He must have</p><p>had one.” </p><p> “I don’t know, father. He said he was</p><p>going to find out what the man was up to. </p><p>I did not ask him how he hoped to do it.” </p><p>Her eyes went to the watch on her wrist. </p><p>“He has been gone thirty-two minutes.” </p><p>This scrupulous exactitude brought an </p><p>odd glance from her father. Even Billy </p><p>turned his head and regarded her inquisi- </p><p>tively. But she was not conscious of the </p><p>scrutiny. Her gaze was on the out-of-doors </p><p>again, her attitude alert and tense. Brewer </p><p>glanced at her a second time, and took up </p><p>his walk about the room. The minutes </p><p>dragged by. Billy put his cigar aside and </p><p>stirred uneasily in his chair.</p><p> “Confound it,” he rapped out, “this is</p><p>getting on my nerves. It’s like waiting for </p><p>dinner when you’ve got to catch a train. </p><p>He’s gone an hour, hasn’t he, Miss Wini- </p><p>fred?” </p><p> “Yes.” Her voice was sharp and short.</p><p>“I could crawl to the river and back in </p><p>that time,” grumbled Billy. </p><p> He got up and began handling the</p><p>Mausers stacked in a comer, going over </p><p>them to see if all were loaded, though he </p><p>knew well that they were, having seen to it </p><p>himself with Jimmy. But he was restless. </p><p>He wanted action, any demand on him but </p><p>the grinding requirement of passive expec- </p><p>tancy. </p><p> “The difficulty is,” said Brewer out of the</p><p>silence he had been wrapped in, “that if he </p><p>fires a shot it will be hard to locate it </p><p>accurately. Sound is deceptive.” </p><p> “I’m betting he don’t have to fire,”</p><p>Billy argued. “Jimmy can take care of </p><p>himself. He’ll be back all smiling. It’s </p><p>just this darned waiting that hurts.” </p><p>Winifred left the window. She walked </p><p>mutely past the two to the door. Brewer’s </p><p>eyes followed her. </p><p> “Where are you going, Winny?” he</p><p>inquired. </p><p> “To my room. I am tired,” she said</p><p>without looking at him, and went out. </p><p> Brewer’s gaze remained fastened on the</p><p>empty doorway. His expression was som- </p><p>ber. Billy abandoned the guns and spoke </p><p>to him. He turned with a quick intake of </p><p>his breath. </p><p> “Now that she is gone, what do you</p><p>think of it, sir?” Billy asked. “That bunch </p><p>could have knocked together some sort of </p><p>a raft, you know, and come across. It’s </p><p>not impossible. And Jimmy may have </p><p>stumbled right into them without being able </p><p>to fire his gun.” </p><p> “I was thinking of that,” Brewer admitted.</p><p>“And, Billy, if it’s so what can we do? </p><p>I’ve been thinking of that also. They will </p><p>be coming here. They are five at least,</p><p>perhaps six—the car was filled with men— </p><p>and if either of us go it will leave only two </p><p>to hold the house. We can’t count on </p><p>Diego; he has no real interest in us. And </p><p>Winifred—she is brave, but after all a </p><p>woman. If they should break in—well, </p><p>they are Germans!” </p><p> “No, no! We can’t take that chance!”</p><p>cried the boy. “Jimmy would be the first </p><p>to damn us if we did. We—we will just </p><p>have to wait, Mr. Brewer. We’ve got to </p><p>do it!” </p><p> They tried to settle down to it quietly,</p><p>but the task was too hard for them. Brewer </p><p>rose from his chair and began pacing the </p><p>floor again. Then Billy bounced to his feet. </p><p>“I’m going to the roof. Maybe I’ll see </p><p>something. Anything is better than this.” </p><p>Brewer steadied the ladder for him. </p><p>Billy did not stop on the last rung; he drew </p><p>himself up to the tiles, and stood there </p><p>126 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>scanning the country with the binocular. </p><p>Brewer stepped to Winifred’s door. He </p><p>knocked, but there was no response. He </p><p>opened it, and looked in. She was lying </p><p>on the bed, her face in the pillows. </p><p> “Winny!” he called softly.</p><p> She did not answer. He would not have</p><p>approached her in this way, she knew, if </p><p>he had news to tell. He lingered a moment </p><p>voiceless, then closed the door and came </p><p>away. </p><p> Brewer waited by the ladder for Billy.</p><p>His face was contorted with pain, the pain </p><p>that bites deeper than any bodily ill. He </p><p>was roused by Billy’s foot on the ladder. </p><p> “Could you see anything of them?” he</p><p>questioned wearily. </p><p> Billy shook his head.</p><p> “Not a sign.” When he was down he</p><p>said brokenly: “Mr. Brewer, it—it’s getting </p><p>to be more than I can stand. They have </p><p>got Jimmy—I know it—and we can’t do a </p><p>thing!” </p><p> The boy dropped on a chair and covered</p><p>his brimming eyes with his hands. </p><p>CHAPTER XXVII </p><p>IN THE ENEMY’S HANDS </p><p>THERE were two courses Jimmy could </p><p>pursue in his hunt for the man he had </p><p>seen from the housetop. One was to pro- </p><p>ceed openly down the drive on the east side </p><p>of the hill to the Santa Marta Road, and </p><p>follow it leisurely to the ravine as though he </p><p>were merely curious to see the stage of the </p><p>water, and was without suspicion of enemy </p><p>proximity. </p><p> The other was to go down the north side</p><p>of the hill, and through the scrub to the </p><p>river. From there he could work east along </p><p>the bank. The boldness of the first ap- </p><p>pealed to him, but as he thought on it he </p><p>realized that the man he sought would not </p><p>be likely to show himself if he saw any one </p><p>approaching on the public highway. Either</p><p>that or, if there were others with him, he </p><p>might be ambushed and taken prisoner. </p><p>He decided on the second course. </p><p> It was slow going down the rocky hill</p><p>and in the thorny scrub, and it was hor- </p><p>ribly hot; but he won through and found </p><p>himself in the dense thickets on the ravine </p><p>brink. The water, he noted, was falling </p><p>rapidly though it was still a boiling flood. </p><p> He laughed at the thought he had enter-</p><p>tained of swimming it; he had never ac- </p><p>quired distinction in the art, and this </p><p>demanded skill as well as strength. He </p><p>worked his way heedfully in the direction </p><p>of the Santa Marta Road, and came out </p><p>finally on a little jut of clear ground just </p><p>above the pitch of the road to the ford. It </p><p>was screened from the river by a growth </p><p>of ironwood bushes and twining sarsaparilla, </p><p>but on the road side there was nothing that </p><p>offered stand-up concealment. </p><p> Jimmy threw himself flat and crawled</p><p>toward the brim. Some one directly below </p><p>was calling across the stream. Answering </p><p>voices came, and the language was German. </p><p>Jimmy wanted to find out how many men </p><p>were on this side and how many on the </p><p>other. By worming carefully to the verge </p><p>of the tiny precipice he could see around </p><p>the screen of bushes, he thought, and could </p><p>look down also on the road. </p><p> A luxuriant flowering plant that he did</p><p>not know swayed outward from the verge. </p><p>Its large glossy leaves, raised tier on tier, </p><p>would afford him protection. He crept </p><p>toward it, gained it—and clutched at it </p><p>wildly. The overshot edge of ground, weak- </p><p>ened by the rain, was giving way. Jimmy </p><p>tried to save himself by a backward flop; </p><p>but the leverage was gone. He came down </p><p>to the road sliding on his shoulder head- </p><p>foremost in a porridge of mud. </p><p> “The devil!” he spurted out in angry</p><p>dismay, and repeated it—“The devil take </p><p>it!” </p><p> A shout rose from the opposite bank. A</p><p>voice near at hand spoke in hard English. </p><p> “So! You could not wait for us to come.</p><p>Well, we have one less to deal with. Do </p><p>not move!”</p><p> It was Sub-Lieutenant Karl Hecht of</p><p>Arraca, and he was alone. None of his men </p><p>was on this side. A cold smile played on </p><p>his blond features, and in his hand as he </p><p>explored Jimmy’s pockets was an unpleasant </p><p>instrument pf swift destruction. That he </p><p>would shoot if resistance was offered Jimmy </p><p>perfectly understood. </p><p> “You win the first round,” he said.</p><p>“It’s in my right-hand pocket, what you are </p><p>looking for.” </p><p> The exploring fingers came away not</p><p>only with his revolver, but with his card- </p><p>case and the letters that were in his breast </p><p>pocket. </p><p> “Get up!” ordered his captor. “Step off</p><p>to the right, to that tree over there.” </p><p>For the Flag </p><p>127 </p><p> Jimmy obeyed. Hecht followed him</p><p>closely. They plunged through a serried </p><p>growth of brush off the road and came to </p><p>the tree. The spot commanded a view of </p><p>the ford and the Germans on the other side. </p><p>There were four of them. They were watch- </p><p>ing him, Jimmy could see, but they did not </p><p>cry out any more. This man evidently was </p><p>their leader. Was he Neiderlein? </p><p> Hecht pointed to a flat stone in the outer</p><p>shade of the tree. </p><p> “Sit down,” he directed. For himself he</p><p>selected the base of the tree with the trunk </p><p>for a back. They were well-curtained from </p><p>the road. Hecht was guarding against a </p><p>chance interference. He looked into the </p><p>card-case, fingered the banknotes it con- </p><p>tained, and tossed it over to Jimmy. The </p><p>other matter he examined with care. They </p><p>were letters from home and the two cable- </p><p>grams from Perry, Sr. He read them all </p><p>with sedulous attention, lifting a wary </p><p>eye frequently to his vis-a-vis. </p><p> Jimmy could make no protest at this</p><p>scrutiny of his intimate affairs. He re- </p><p>flected grimly that he was a prisoner of </p><p>war, in precisely the situation that he him- </p><p>self had placed the Imperial German minis- </p><p>ter. He had, it was true, refrained from </p><p>going through Kaufman’s pockets, but it </p><p>was a weak obedience to scruples that war- </p><p>fare took no account of. He could claim no </p><p>indulgence for it. </p><p> Another thought came to Jimmy. He</p><p>was more than a prisoner of war—he was a </p><p>spy. And spies were dealt with summarily </p><p>in a state of war. Here was a small off- </p><p>shoot of the great conflict in which his </p><p>country was involved, and it was he who </p><p>had promoted it. By the rules of the game </p><p>he could expect no leniency from his foe. </p><p> He secretly surveyed the man by the</p><p>tree. He was of his own build, and wiry </p><p>and hard as nails. Without the gun laid </p><p>handily at his side he would be a tough </p><p>customer to tackle, though this to Jimmy </p><p>would have been no deterrent; even odds </p><p>was all he asked. If only that gun. . . . </p><p> Hecht spoke to him. He had finished</p><p>his perusal of the letters. They contained </p><p>nothing of moment to him, but he decided </p><p>to keep them. He flipped one of the cable- </p><p>grams with his finger before stowing it away. </p><p> “Too slow—eh, Perry—going home to</p><p>enlist? You did it here.” </p><p> “I am of an impatient nature,” Jimmy</p><p>answered placidly. He did not intend to </p><p>let this Hun rag him, whatever came. </p><p>“You have the advantage of me,” he con- </p><p>tinued. “Do you prefer to have me address </p><p>you as X, or as a definite quantity?” </p><p> The German considered the request.</p><p>The humor of it passed him by; he saw only </p><p>the practical side. </p><p> “Lieutenant Hecht of the Imperial Re-</p><p>serves,” he replied bruskly. </p><p> Jimmy raised his brows.</p><p> “Oh, I had thought you were that fellow</p><p>Neiderlein. You got across on the bridge, of </p><p>course. Why didn’t your men come with </p><p>you?” </p><p> “It broke. I made it just in time.”</p><p> “That was a pity,” commented Jimmy.</p><p>He went on leaving the other to take the </p><p>remark as he would—“If I am not too in- </p><p>quisitive, Lieutenant Hecht, I would like </p><p>further information—now that you’ve got </p><p>me what are you going to do with me?” </p><p>HECHT did not answer. His </p><p>attention was directed to the men </p><p>across the river. One of them was </p><p>down at the water’s edge looking out over </p><p>the current. He turned to his companions </p><p>and made an affirmative sign. </p><p> “If he’s thinking of swimming it,”</p><p>Jimmy said conversationally to Hecht, </p><p>“he’d better go up a way. He’d have a </p><p>chance of landing here then.” </p><p> The lieutenant regarded him with a glim-</p><p>mer of interest. This American was not </p><p>readily disturbed, it appeared. </p><p> “You are the one who carried off his</p><p>Excellency last night,” he accused suddenly. </p><p> “Am I? Thank you for acquainting me</p><p>with it.” Jimmy bowed to him. </p><p> “Why did you do it?” demanded Hecht.</p><p> “Oh, just for a joke,” rejoined Jimmy</p><p>carelessly. </p><p> The German’s look grew black.</p><p> “You wished to know what I’m going to</p><p>do with you,” he spat out. “One of two </p><p>things—exchange you for his Excellency, or </p><p>shoot you.” </p><p> Jimmy felt the blood crowd back on his</p><p>heart, for he was convinced that the threat </p><p>was not an idle one. Hecht meant it. But </p><p>to surrender Kaufman to save his own </p><p>skin was a thing he would not do. And, </p><p>curiously, in a lightning flash there was </p><p>limned in his mind the thin, stooped form of </p><p>Brewer, the expatriate, his hand lifted to the </p><p>flag, his voice challenging as he cried out— </p><p>“Let them come and haul it down!” </p><p>128 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Jimmy smiled palely as he replied to the</p><p>Teuton. </p><p> “I do not find either proposition agree-</p><p>able, Mr. Lieutenant.” </p><p> “It will be one or the other,” Hecht</p><p>asserted. </p><p> “That,” returned Jimmy evenly, “is</p><p>your affair. I am done with it.” </p><p> “It is for your friends to say,” jeered</p><p>Hecht. “I shall submit it to them with the </p><p>assurance that if they do not accede I will </p><p>execute you in plain view of them. After- </p><p>ward we will take his Excellency anyway.” </p><p>“Not alive. I will bet with you on that, </p><p>and make it ten to one in your favor.” </p><p> Hecht stared at him, grunted something</p><p>in his own tongue, and lapsed into silence. </p><p>Jimmy had stuffed some cigars in his pocket </p><p>before leaving the house. They were broken </p><p>badly, but he found one that was yet </p><p>smokable, lit it, and with his hands clasped </p><p>easily about his knee puffed away with as- </p><p>sumed indifference to his fate. </p><p> Though the day was well advanced—it</p><p>was four o’clock—the heat was growing </p><p>instead of diminishing with the declining </p><p>sun. It was a still, dry, suffocating heat, </p><p>settling down like a vast blanket over the </p><p>earth. To Jimmy it seemed as if there was </p><p>a portent of evil in it, though this, perhaps, </p><p>could be attributed to his mental state. </p><p> His gaze wandered to the opposite rim of</p><p>the ravine. No one of the Germans was in </p><p>sight. His gaze came back to Hecht. He </p><p>was still staring at him. Now he asked: </p><p>“So you took me for Herr Neiderlein? </p><p>Do you not know him?” </p><p> “I am happy to say that I do not.”</p><p>“Then why did you take me for him?” </p><p>“We rather looked for him, that’s all. </p><p>We thought his man Landeker, who came </p><p>this morning, had given him such a glowing </p><p>report of our hospitality that Neiderlein </p><p>would want a taste of it himself. I suppose </p><p>it was Landeker who posted you on the lay </p><p>of the land out here, or—” Jimmy ventured </p><p>a random shot—“was it my esteemed</p><p>friend "and proclaimed countrywoman, Miss </p><p>Mary Taylor?” </p><p> Jimmy fancied he saw a change in the</p><p>stolid face of the man, but if Hecht intended </p><p>a reply it was cut off by a hail from the </p><p>river. The Germans were swimming down. </p><p>One of them, in fact, was landing at a spot </p><p>below the tree. Hecht stood up. He </p><p>flipped the sweat from his forehead with a </p><p>curse at the heat. </p><p> “You sit still or the birds will pick your</p><p>bones on that rock,” he growled at Jimmy. </p><p> The first German came up steaming from</p><p>the river, for the enveloping heat had al- </p><p>ready seized on him. In five minutes he </p><p>would be dry as tinder, pistol, cartridge </p><p>belt and all. Hecht uttered a command, </p><p>and the man went off into the brush. The </p><p>others came up one by one, big, burly </p><p>customers. Hecht put a question to them, </p><p>and after a general searching of pockets one </p><p>produced a length of whipcord. The first </p><p>man returned. He held in his hand a </p><p>smooth, straight, freshly cut stick about </p><p>two feet long, and an inch thick. Hecht </p><p>addressed the group briefly. From an </p><p>occasional gesture in the direction of the </p><p>hacienda Jimmy judged that he was out- </p><p>lining a plan of assault. </p><p> Hecht finished, and two of the men</p><p>stepped over to the stone where Jimmy sat. </p><p>One was the man with the stick, and the </p><p>other the man with the cord. Jimmy’s </p><p>pulse drummed in his ears, and his jaws set </p><p>like a vise. </p><p> “Stand up you, Perry!” Hecht ordered</p><p>in a brutal tone. </p><p> Jimmy jumped up with a suddenness,</p><p>and a straight out from the shoulder right </p><p>and left that sent the two men reeling. </p><p>He went for Hecht. No thought of the gun </p><p>Hecht held restrained him—he but wanted </p><p>to reach the fellow and beat him down in </p><p>the dirt. But instead he went down him- </p><p>self. One of the other men had leaped on </p><p>him, and clinched in a mighty embrace they </p><p>rolled on the ground. </p><p> Five minutes later Jimmy, dazed and</p><p>bleeding, was raised to his feet. He could </p><p>not get up by himself, for through the hol- </p><p>low of his drawn back arms a stick was</p><p>thrust, and his hands were forced together </p><p>in front of him and pinioned with the </p><p>braided whipcord. A hammer blow could </p><p>not have budged the stick. </p><p> Hecht did not give him a glance. He</p><p>sent a man on ahead to scout the road, </p><p>and after an interval the party followed. </p><p>Hecht led. A man was on each side of </p><p>Jimmy, and roughly helped him through </p><p>the brush. A third man brought up the </p><p>rear. In this wise they came to the </p><p>hacienda gate. The fifth man joined </p><p>them here. They turned off to the left, </p><p>and sheltered by the scrub in the coffee </p><p>field made their way toward the woods on </p><p>the south of the house. Jimmy could see </p><p>For the Flag </p><p>129 </p><p>the flag on the roof drooping lifelessly in </p><p>the baking air. His heart swelled at the </p><p>sight. </p><p> But what Jimmy could not see was Billy</p><p>crouched in the skylight opening sweeping </p><p>the approaches to the house with the </p><p>binocular. It was the third time he had </p><p>gone up there since Jimmy left, each </p><p>previous time bringing only a sickening </p><p>sense of utter futility. Now, though, as </p><p>he mechanically quartered the ground </p><p>below, his glass caught a movement far </p><p>down in the corner of the field. He waited, </p><p>scarcely breathing, until in another space </p><p>he descried the advancing party. He </p><p>shouted the news to Brewer in a queer high </p><p>voice. </p><p> “I’ve found them! They are making for</p><p>the woods. They are going to come at us </p><p>from that side.” </p><p> There was a pause. Winifred had run</p><p>out from her room at the sound of his shrill </p><p>cry. She stood at her father’s side by the </p><p>ladder, her hands clasped to her breast. A </p><p>groan broke from the boy above. </p><p> “They’ve got Jimmy! He’s in the midst</p><p>of them. There’s something wrong with </p><p>him. God, I see now! His arms are tied. </p><p>A rifle, Mr. Brewer. I’ll shoot—no, no. </p><p>I might hit Jimmy. And they are gone! </p><p>They’ve reached the woods.” </p><p>HECHT kept just within the shelter </p><p>of the trees so that he could hold </p><p>the house in view. It brought him </p><p>presently to Tio Diego’s hut. The old man </p><p>was in the act of scurrying from the place. </p><p>A call from Hecht, and a leveled pistol </p><p>brought him back. He was trembling to </p><p>his toes, and when he saw Jimmy, bound </p><p>and begrimed, his seamed face went the </p><p>color of lead. Hecht motioned him into </p><p>the hut. The others remained outside. </p><p>Jimmy noticed that they placed themselves </p><p>to the lee of him, and he understood the </p><p>reason; they were using him as a shield </p><p>against the shuttered, silent house. </p><p> Hecht came out shortly. He had</p><p>scrawled a note in pencil on the back of </p><p>one of Jimmy’s envelopes.</p><p> “You may care to hear this,” he said</p><p>harshly. </p><p> He read what he had written.</p><p> In the name of the Imperial German Govern-</p><p>ment I demand the surrender of his Excellency, </p><p>Herr Adolph Kaufman, the Imperial Minister to the </p><p>State of Zanhoria. In exchange shall be delivered </p><p>9 </p><p>to you the person of James Perry now in my hands. </p><p>Failure to comply within one hour will result in </p><p>the immediate execution of the said James Perry </p><p>on the spot where he stands. </p><p> Jimmy gave him a slow, mocking look.</p><p> “You will get Kaufman when you haul</p><p>down that flag—not before,” he drawled. </p><p> Hecht handed the missive to Diego.</p><p> “Go and bring me an answer,” he said to</p><p>him in Spanish. </p><p> The peasant cringed away. Jimmy</p><p>shouted after him in such Spanish as he </p><p>could muster on the instant: </p><p> “Diego! Digalejamds—jant&amp;s. Never—</p><p>never-” </p><p> Hecht struck him in the mouth with his</p><p>open hand. </p><p>CHAPTER XXVIII </p><p>A JOURNEY FOR TWO </p><p>A FTER Don Luis left him Enrique sat </p><p>for many minutes pondering what he </p><p>had learned. All the inflammatory passions </p><p>of his nature were in a seething turmoil. </p><p>Finally he got up and sought his own room. </p><p>He dressed for the street, and departed </p><p>from the house in his car. He drove </p><p>straight to Ortega’s office in the Calle </p><p>Central. Ortega was not there. </p><p> “Of course,” he muttered as he drove</p><p>away. “I should have known. Good God, </p><p>how hot it is!” </p><p> He drove east until he reached the out-</p><p>skirts of the city. Before him rose a tower- </p><p>ing adobe wall. Barely peeping above it</p><p>were the eaves of a great oblong building </p><p>of solid stone. It was the State prison. </p><p>Backed to that encircling adobe wall many </p><p>a political offendant had faced a firing- </p><p>squad in years past. </p><p> At the gate an armed sentry stepped</p><p>out from the guard-house and stopped the </p><p>car. Segovia made his name and errand </p><p>known, and after telephonic communication </p><p>with the prison the man informed him that </p><p>he could proceed. </p><p> It was not the general office he was re-</p><p>ceived in. The room was evidently set </p><p>apart for a specific purpose. It was quite </p><p>bare except for a thick matting on the floor, </p><p>a few plain chairs, and a large flat desk by </p><p>the window. Ortega sat at this desk. A </p><p>man with a notebook in his hand was leaving </p><p>the room by a door opposite that through </p><p>which Segovia was ushered in. Beyond </p><p>130 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the desk, in the comer, was placed a screen </p><p>behind which was a table for the man with </p><p>the notebook when an interview was to be </p><p>secretly recorded. </p><p> Ortega greeted Segovia with an incurious</p><p>smile. He had surmised his errand when </p><p>his name was telephoned from the gate. </p><p>He said, in his calm, unemotional way: </p><p>“Yes, she is here. Your uncle has been </p><p>talking with you?” </p><p> Segovia nodded. For the time he could</p><p>find no words. He remained standing </p><p>before the desk. The other’s leisurely </p><p>scrutiny of him brought the red to his brow. </p><p>Don Emilio was, of course, thinking of the </p><p>fool’s part he had played. </p><p> “He told you, I presume,” pursued</p><p>Ortega with a reflective air, “that it was </p><p>Mrs. Isaacs who sent the note about the </p><p>wireless; that it was Mrs. Isaacs who </p><p>learned from Morales who stole the Wash- </p><p>ington dispatch; that it was Mrs. Isaacs </p><p>who planned with his Excellency, the </p><p>American minister, the little affair in </p><p>Dolores Street; that, in brief, it is Mrs. </p><p>Isaacs, suspected by none of us, who has </p><p>enabled the Government to nip this plot </p><p>and bring the plotters to justice. Don </p><p>Luis has told you this, has he not, my </p><p>friend?” </p><p> “Yes,” broke out Segovia, “he has.</p><p>Must I acknowledge to you, as I did to him, </p><p>that I was a blind fool? It is not for that </p><p>I came, but I will do it, if it suits your </p><p>humor, for I have a favor to ask of you.” </p><p>Ortega made a deprecatory motion with </p><p>his hand. </p><p> “My dear fellow, one does not require</p><p>acknowledgment of a patent fact. The </p><p>favor. You wish to see her?” </p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “Why?”</p><p> There was an eloquent pause. The bald</p><p>question drove home to Segovia. He had </p><p>come away under the scourge of a black </p><p>desire to face this perfidious woman, to heap </p><p>on her words that would bring her to her</p><p>knees before him, make her eat of the dust </p><p>at his feet. And then what? What had </p><p>he in his heart to do? His fingers worked </p><p>unpleasantly, like claws; his lips curled </p><p>back from his teeth; his body stiffened </p><p>into the rigidity of a wild beast about to </p><p>spring. </p><p> Ortega was Latin himself, and he knew</p><p>the signs. They did not revolt him; he </p><p>felt indeed a current of sympathy for the </p><p>boy; but his years and training—more the </p><p>latter than the former—had taught him </p><p>the folly of playing to his passions. He said </p><p>quietly: </p><p> “Why anticipate? She will be shot with</p><p>the others.” </p><p> “She is to be shot!”</p><p> Enrique’s fingers slackened. There was</p><p>a relaxation in all his body. The moment </p><p>before he could have killed Mary Taylor </p><p>with his own hands; now he was suddenly </p><p>cleansed of the desire in the flood of a new </p><p>emotion. What in his unreasoning madness </p><p>seemed an act of righteous retribution, in </p><p>the cold light of Ortega’s announcement </p><p>stood out solely as a base personal revenge. </p><p>After all, Mary Taylor had simply worked </p><p>in her country’s behalf as Mrs. Isaacs had </p><p>worked in behalf of hers. </p><p> “She is to be shot!” he repeated dully.</p><p>“Why, you can’t do that. She is a German </p><p>citizen, and we are not at war with Ger- </p><p>many.” </p><p> “We are,” Ortega contradicted. “The</p><p>President has issued the proclamation. </p><p>Kaufman’s passports are waiting for him. </p><p>We have had enough of these plotting </p><p>Germans. We intend to smoke out that </p><p>nest of theirs on the Negro, and send them </p><p>packing.” </p><p> “But what she has done is ante-factum,”</p><p>Segovia insisted, his mind unable to enter- </p><p>tain but the one hideous objective lliat </p><p>confronted it. “You can’t-” </p><p> “We can and will,” interrupted the super-</p><p>intendent. “We are not standing on points </p><p>of law these days, Enrique—not with the </p><p>German empire. It knows no law.” He</p><p>asked abruptly: “Do you wish to see her </p><p>now, this Ella Prietz?” </p><p> “No! God, no!”</p><p> Enrique recoiled from the thought.</p><p>What were the petty wounds to his self- </p><p>esteem compared with the fate that was </p><p>stalking to meet this woman? He could </p><p>visualize it in every dreadful detail—the </p><p>cold gray of the breaking day; the blank, </p><p>bullet-pitted wall; the fine, supple figure </p><p>placed before it; the leveled guns; the </p><p>word of command. . . . </p><p> “No, no!” he cried again. “I have no</p><p>account against her. It is wiped away.” </p><p> He took a few perturbed steps about the</p><p>room. </p><p> “That is well,” said Don Emilio soberly.</p><p>“Now we will proceed to other matters. </p><p>Herr Kaufman’s detention is no longer </p><p>For the Flag </p><p>131 </p><p>necessary. If we had delayed a little— </p><p>but on the whole the step is not to be re- </p><p>gretted. We were rid of the man at a </p><p>crucial moment today. Will you go out </p><p>there at dark, Enrique, and let Jimmy know </p><p>what has occurred? I will put a closed car </p><p>at your disposal to bring them back— </p><p>Kaufman, and those two fine boys. It will </p><p>be best to return them under cover of </p><p>night.” </p><p> “I will go,” assented Segovia indiffer-</p><p>ently. He did not care now what Jimmy </p><p>might think, for he was lost to the con- </p><p>sideration of his own poor vanity. He </p><p>little dreamed that at this same hour </p><p>Jimmy also was in peril of his life. </p><p>SOME one rapped for admittance </p><p>on the door. At the superintend- </p><p>ent’s bidding a prison guard entered. </p><p>He crossed to the desk and spoke in a low </p><p>tone. Ortega gave him a brief word in </p><p>reply. He viewed Segovia thoughtfully </p><p>when the guard was gone, and said: </p><p> “The first of our expected guests this</p><p>evening has arrived, the Senor Don Manuel </p><p>Morales. Sit down, Enrique. I believe </p><p>I would like to have you stay.” </p><p> A gleam of interest lighted the young</p><p>man’s somber eyes. It was not for Morales </p><p>—he was a black traitor, and deserved the </p><p>fate reserved for him. But he would speak </p><p>of Mary Taylor—it was inevitable that he </p><p>should—and it was this that invested him </p><p>with transitory interest for Enrique. He </p><p>took the seat Ortega indicated. It was a </p><p>little to one side, and back of the super- </p><p>intendent’s chair. The man with the </p><p>notebook entered in response to a button </p><p>call, and disappeared behind the screen. </p><p>Another button call and the door fronting </p><p>the desk opened. Morales was thrust in </p><p>and the door closed. </p><p> The heat was oppressive, but it was not</p><p>altogether this that made the sweat bubble </p><p>out on the banker’s pasty face, and drip </p><p>down from his hairless crown. His beady </p><p>eyes quested about the room, passed </p><p>Segovia over and came to a fascinated stare </p><p>on the quiet man leaning back with folded </p><p>arms at the desk.</p><p> “Kindly come forward, senor,” requested</p><p>the superintendent blandly. </p><p> The short, heavy figure moved as di-</p><p>rected. No sound came from him but a </p><p>stertorous laboring of the lungs. </p><p> “You are distressed, senor,” went on the</p><p>superintendent. “Is there, perhaps, some- </p><p>thing that I can do to relieve you?” </p><p> He was playing with him as a cat a</p><p>mouse. </p><p> “An annoying mistake has been made,</p><p>Senor Superintendent,” Morales forced </p><p>from his dry lips, though the voicing of it </p><p>was scarcely above a whisper. “I do not </p><p>know why I am brought here. -1 have been </p><p>told nothing.” </p><p> “In that case I shall be glad to supply</p><p>the omission,” Ortega answered suavely. </p><p>“We are informed that you have plotted </p><p>with Herr Kaufman, the German envoy, </p><p>to overturn the present Government of </p><p>Zanhoria and place General Peralta in </p><p>power. Does this enlighten you, senor?” </p><p>The banker had, with an enormous effort, </p><p>regained a measure of control over himself. </p><p>He was reacting to man’s primal instinct </p><p>to fight for his life. And he was misled by </p><p>his inquisitor’s mild manner. His voice </p><p>rose in strength as he replied. </p><p> “None of this is so. It is an outrage that</p><p>a person of position should be haled before </p><p>you in this way. Disgraceful! Some ma- </p><p>licious scoundrel has defamed me. I de- </p><p>mand the proof, Senor Superintendent.” </p><p>Ortega spread his palms apart. </p><p> “Ah, now you have asked a question.”</p><p>He appeared to reflect a moment. “Did </p><p>not Miss Prietz acquaint you with her loss </p><p>last night?” </p><p> A tremor ran through Morales’ frame.</p><p> “I do not understand,” he declared.</p><p>Through the heavy fear that sat upon him </p><p>a distinct bewilderment was manifest. </p><p> Ortega saw that in this at least the man</p><p>was honest. The woman had not told him, </p><p>afraid, perhaps, for her life. She had fled</p><p>to the legation and told her story there, </p><p>and they—now that the fat was in the </p><p>fire—had not cared what became of their </p><p>Zanhorian tools. </p><p> “You do not know Miss Prietz?” he</p><p>inquired, apparently astonished. </p><p> Morales was dumb.</p><p> “Ah, then I don’t wonder that you fail</p><p>to understand,” continued Don Emilio </p><p>softly. “Miss Prietz was dispossessed last </p><p>night of certain papers she was charged </p><p>by General Peralta to deliver into Herr </p><p>Kaufman’s hand. Among these papers was </p><p>a list of the general’s supporters in Cortina, </p><p>and the preferments promised them if the </p><p>revolution succeeded. Do you comprehend </p><p>now, senor?” </p><p>132 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Morales’ assumed bravado had dropped</p><p>from him as the last leaf from the naked </p><p>tree. His face was a shocking picture— </p><p>the color of rancid tallow, and with the </p><p>muscles of it working as though there were </p><p>living worms writhing under the skin. </p><p>Enrique turned from the doomed traitor. </p><p>He felt not pity for him; it was sickening </p><p>disgust. And yet it killed in him also </p><p>the final throb of compassion for Mary </p><p>Taylor. She had used Morales, and denied </p><p>him his one opportunity of escape. Ortega </p><p>with a singular synchronism of thought was </p><p>saying this very thing. </p><p> “Miss Prietz should have mentioned it,</p><p>Seiior,” he purred. “It deprived you of a </p><p>chance—your car, the open road and away. </p><p>It was thoughtless of Miss Prietz. Treach- </p><p>erous, one might even call it.” </p><p> Morales raised an aspen hand.</p><p> “Enough!” he cried hoarsely. He swal-</p><p>lowed with difficulty. “You have taken </p><p>her, too? She is here?” </p><p> Ortega abandoned the r61e he had played.</p><p>He sat erect at his desk. His expression </p><p>was stem and relentless. </p><p> “Yes,” he replied, “she is here. She was</p><p>taken in the attempt to leave the city. </p><p>She will be tried and shot with the rest of </p><p>you.” </p><p> Morales nodded, impatiently one would</p><p>say. </p><p> “Yes, yes! I know. I know what to</p><p>expect.” </p><p> He came a step nearer the desk. His</p><p>little eyes were glittering. He steadied </p><p>his twitching nerves as best he could, and </p><p>he said: </p><p> “Senor Ortega, there is a thing she can</p><p>tell that is of much importance to the State. </p><p>I can make her tell it, and in reparation </p><p>for—for-” </p><p> “I understand,” cut in the superintend-</p><p>ent. “Why not tell it yourself, Morales?” </p><p> “Because I know only part. But with</p><p>that I can force her to speak. You have </p><p>a witness—the Senor Lieutenant here— </p><p>and if you will have her brought in-” </p><p> He paused and waited.</p><p> Ortega considered him keenly. His</p><p>finger pressed a button. To the guard who </p><p>answered: </p><p> “Bring to me Ella Prietz,” he directed.</p><p>He looked at Enrique. “There is the </p><p>screen if you wish, Seiior Segovia. You can </p><p>hear distinctly what passes.” </p><p> Enrique made a half-movement to rise.</p><p>He caught Morales’ gaze fixed on him, and </p><p>stayed. Why should he let the man think </p><p>that he cared? </p><p> There was a stir at the door, and Mary</p><p>Taylor was led in. At Ortega’s signal the </p><p>guard withdrew. The young woman’s eyes </p><p>went first to Segovia, then to the two </p><p>others. She was pale, and calm, and </p><p>collected. And she was silent. She had </p><p>been questioned by this police official </p><p>before. She had nothing to say then; </p><p>she had nothing to say now. Ortega spoke </p><p>to the banker. </p><p> “Well, senor?”</p><p> Morales responded with a short gesture.</p><p>He walked slowly over to where the girl </p><p>stood by the door. He stopped a few feet </p><p>from her. </p><p> “We are fortunately met, Miss Prietz,”</p><p>he said in wheedling tones. “I have been </p><p>told that we are going on a journey, a </p><p>number of us, all friends. In view of your </p><p>devoted consideration for me in particular </p><p>I thought that if we went together first— </p><p>you and I—in fond companionship-” </p><p> “God in heaven!” screamed Segovia.</p><p> Ortega was on his feet, leaping toward</p><p>the crazed man. The stenographer ran </p><p>from behind the screen. But all too late. </p><p>A shot split the air, and another. Morales </p><p>toppled over with a choking grunt, a bullet </p><p>through his temple. Mary Taylor sank </p><p>slowly down. Her hands were to her </p><p>breast. Her head drooped lower and lower,</p><p>and as Enrique reached her it fell upon his </p><p>outstretched arm, saving it from the floor. </p><p>Her clouding eyes dwelt 011 him for the </p><p>beat of a clock to and fro. </p><p> “Forgive,” she breathed, and was gone</p><p>on her journey. </p><p> The door was crowded with faces peering</p><p>in. Ortega swept them with a withering </p><p>glance. His mood was harsh, for his own </p><p>judgment had betrayed him. </p><p> “You fools!” he lashed out. “Because he</p><p>was not a common cutthroat you did not </p><p>think to search him for a weapon!” </p><p>THE Lincoln lay well under a mile </p><p>■	1 nu 11 .j off the mouth of the Rio Negro.</p><p>She had been towed to this position </p><p>by El Terror after a conference between </p><p>Lieutenant Norris and Admiral Terrozas, </p><p>at which the admiral had imparted certain </p><p>knowledge he possessed of Colonel Ludolf’s </p><p>plans to cover Peralta’s landing. The </p><p>Lincoln’s guns were trained on the river, </p><p>m: </p><p>For the Flag </p><p>133 </p><p>and her searchlights would scour it through </p><p>the night. Any craft from the lumber camp </p><p>that might attempt the open sea would </p><p>be blown out of the water. The Lincoln’s </p><p>wings were clipped, but not her claws. </p><p>And furthermore, in response to her calls, </p><p>a swift United States destroyer was on the </p><p>way to the scene. </p><p> El Terror meanwhile was scouting along</p><p>an arc that embraced the possible landings </p><p>for the Sea Bird on the coast. Admiral </p><p>Terrozas was inflated with his conquest of </p><p>the U, and inflamed with the desire to add </p><p>to his patriot laurels. </p><p>CHAPTER XXIX </p><p>A COUNTER-ULTIMATUM </p><p>IN THE farmhouse Winifred stood in </p><p>the subdued light of the shuttered </p><p>dining-room looking out through a peep- </p><p>hole at the scene before the hut. She wore </p><p>a belt from which hung a pistol. Billy stood </p><p>beside her at the companion por;t. A rifle </p><p>was in his hand. Brewer was at the window </p><p>nearer the hall. He, too, held a rifle. Old </p><p>Tia Matilde sat crumpled up in a chair </p><p>against the wall by the pantry door. Sam </p><p>was not present. He was on guard in the </p><p>front rooms lest a surprise attack come </p><p>from that direction. </p><p> The heat was sweltering in the closed</p><p>room, but the three at the windows were </p><p>oblivious of it for the time. They had </p><p>heard the words Jimmy shouted to Diego, </p><p>and they saw the blow on the mouth Hecht </p><p>gave his defenseless prisoner. Until then— </p><p>all their talk and preparation to the con- </p><p>trary—the actual spilling of blood in this </p><p>emprise had to Winifred seemed somehow </p><p>a thing remote and without true imminence. </p><p>Now, in one breath, it took on the full </p><p>body of reality. She could kill that man </p><p>out there! </p><p> “Oh, the coward beast, the coward</p><p>beast!” she cried. “A—ah!” </p><p> Jimmy, bound though he was, had made</p><p>a rush at Hecht. It was, of course, a vain </p><p>effort. The German stepped aside and </p><p>launched a fist into the broad of Jimmy’s</p><p>back as he hurtled by. It sent him pitching </p><p>headlong in through the door of the </p><p>hut. </p><p> The Mauser in Billy’s hand was up in a</p><p>flash. There was a snarling, unhuman </p><p>sound in his throat. </p><p> “He’ll pay for that, - him!” he said</p><p>thickly. </p><p> He was thrusting the rifle through the</p><p>port when Brewer called to him. </p><p> “Don’t! Later he will pay. Let us see</p><p>first what Diego brings. It may decide </p><p>our actions.” </p><p> Billy reluctantly lowered his gun. The</p><p>wisdom of Brewer’s position was apparent. </p><p> “To think of Jimmy—Jimmy Perry—</p><p>being knocked about in that way,” he </p><p>muttered. </p><p> Winifred was silent. But her eyes were</p><p>flames. Brewer had gone to the outer door </p><p>and was opening it to Diego. He closed </p><p>and locked it after the peasant, and signed </p><p>to him to enter the dining-room. He </p><p>followed him in and held out his hand. </p><p> “Give it to me,” he ordered.</p><p> Diego delivered to him the envelop on</p><p>which Hecht had indited his ultimatum. </p><p>The old man was shaking with fear and </p><p>excitement. He went and stood dumbly </p><p>by Tia Matilde. Brewer read out the </p><p>note to the others. They were all very </p><p>still when he finished, and very white. </p><p>Winifred was the first to speak. Her voice </p><p>was file-hard, rasping, out of key. </p><p> “I know what Jimmy meant. ‘Never!</p><p>Never!’ We are not to surrender that man </p><p>in there.” </p><p> Her finger pointed to Kaufman’s door</p><p>across the hall. Had it been the opening </p><p>to the den of a deadly reptile there could </p><p>not have been more of abhorrence in the </p><p>gesture. </p><p> “One hour!” faltered Billy. “One hour!</p><p>It is five o’clock. At six—Mr. Brewer, </p><p>we’ve got to give him up! They will shoot</p><p>Jimmy before our eyes. It would be the </p><p>same as if we—ourselves—murdered him.” </p><p> Brewer did not answer. He was sunk</p><p>in thought. </p><p> “If they would do it,” he murmured.</p><p>“If there was a way to get them to do it.” </p><p> Winifred was studying him intently.</p><p> “Tell me, father. What are you think-</p><p>ing?” she demanded. </p><p> He looked at her vaguely, obsessed with</p><p>the idea he had evolved. He spoke as </p><p>though she had disputed him. </p><p> “The trouble is, Winny, it lacks a motive.</p><p>Don’t you see? There is no inducement </p><p>for making the exchange. An old man for </p><p>a young man—they wouldn’t do it.” </p><p> Winifred drew in a long breath. He</p><p>would save Jimmy, and he would die </p><p>134 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>rather than surrender Kaufman. Even in </p><p>this moment of extremity a fierce gladness </p><p>filled her. She ran to him and caught his </p><p>hand. She bowed her head to it and </p><p>kissed it. </p><p> “My father! Oh, my dear father!” The</p><p>swelling note of a great tenderness and a </p><p>great pride was in her voice. “I would not </p><p>let you do it. Ah, no, no!” </p><p> He threw off partially his abstraction.</p><p>His arm went about her. </p><p> “If it only could be done, Winny, if it</p><p>only could! You could hold out, the four </p><p>of you, and I—I would be to some extent </p><p>canceling-” </p><p> She hushed him with her finger to his</p><p>lips. Her thought was of Billy, though </p><p>the boy’s thought was on neither of them. </p><p>It was with Jimmy—out there, bound and </p><p>helpless, kicked about brutally, his life </p><p>hanging on the decision they should make </p><p>in here. He was at the window again </p><p>watching the hut. </p><p> “They would not do it, father,” Winifred</p><p>contended. “And Jimmy, he would not </p><p>consent. Don’t you know that he would </p><p>not? We must think up another way to </p><p>save him. And we must not delay, father. </p><p>The minutes are flying.” </p><p> Billy swung around to them.</p><p> “I tell you we must let Kaufman go,”</p><p>he cried stubbornly. “There is no other </p><p>way. They may not wait. They may </p><p>shoot Jimmy before the hour is up.” </p><p> “Cuidadol”</p><p> It was a croaking whisper from Tio Diego.</p><p>He had come forward a little from the wall. </p><p>His arm was outstretched toward Kauf- </p><p>man’s room. The minister had succeeded </p><p>in clawing back the slide, and was peering </p><p>at them. He had overheard Billy. </p><p> “Swine!” he shouted. “You would let</p><p>me smother in this accursed hole. But I </p><p>have heard. Ja! And I have seen. I</p><p>know my men. I know what they will do. </p><p>Release me, and the scoundrel shall five. </p><p>Release me-” </p><p> Kaufman dropped away from the opening</p><p>with a squeal of fright. Winifred had </p><p>snatched the pistol from her belt and fired— </p><p>point-blank at him, he believed. But the </p><p>bullet-hole, high above where his head had </p><p>been, indicated her intent. It was to </p><p>produce exactly the effect that followed; </p><p>he would keep away from the door after this. </p><p>Billy gritted out— </p><p> “I wish you had killed him!”</p><p> The tiger is in every woman, and it leaps</p><p>forth when she is aroused. Winifred’s </p><p>face was flushed with the surge of suddenly </p><p>unleashed passions. If Jimmy was to die </p><p>he should be avenged. </p><p> “The next time-”</p><p> She did not finish, but moved to the</p><p>nearest window, and gaze'd darkly at the </p><p>hut. It was too far away for Hecht and </p><p>his crew to have heard the shot distinctly. </p><p>The thick walls of the house would muffle </p><p>it. They were standing around discussing </p><p>something in their ponderous German </p><p>fashion. Jimmy was nowhere to be seen. </p><p>Was he lying inside there, felled to the </p><p>ground by Hecht’s barbarous blow? Her </p><p>heart grew hot within her. </p><p> Sam had come running up to see what</p><p>the trouble was. Brewer sent him back </p><p>to his post, and crossed over to Kaufman’s </p><p>room. He drew the bolt and opened the </p><p>door, and he surveyed the minister with </p><p>an oddly meditative air, as one might </p><p>consider to what use he could put an un- </p><p>familiar implement offered to his hand. </p><p>Kaufman did not speak. He had retired </p><p>to the other end of the room completely </p><p>unnerved for the moment. His fingers </p><p>clutched at his thick neck as if he were </p><p>stifling. </p><p>BREWER’S expression changed. </p><p>It became alert, elated almost. He </p><p>closed the door, pushed the panel to, </p><p>and returned with a lively step to the </p><p>dining-room. </p><p> “I’ve got it!” he announced. “They</p><p>won’t dare to carry out their threat.” </p><p>Winifred turned to him wonderingly, </p><p>afraid to believe. Billy clamored for him </p><p>to proceed. </p><p> “What is it, sir? For God’s sake be</p><p>quick!” </p><p> “I shall answer their note. I shall say</p><p>to them that if they do not return Jimmy </p><p>to us unharmed we shall hang Kaufman </p><p>by the neck from the ridge-piece of the </p><p>porch. We need but the rope, and that </p><p>is in the yard—this old woman’s clothes- </p><p>line. I will go and get it, for they must </p><p>have visible evidence that we are prepared </p><p>to act on our word.” </p><p> “And by Heaven we will!” shrilled Billy.</p><p>“Only I will go, not you, sir.” </p><p> He was alive with hope again. He was</p><p>running to the door when Winifred stayed </p><p>him. </p><p> 1</p><p>For the Flag	135</p><p> “Neither of you shall go,” she declared.</p><p>“To see a man gathering in the rope would </p><p>raise suspicion in them. But to see a </p><p>woman do it will only puzzle them. I am </p><p>going.” </p><p> They protested vehemently. These men</p><p>were Germans. They would as lief shoot </p><p>down a woman as a man. She should </p><p>not go. </p><p> Winifred made an end to argument with</p><p>an imperious hand. </p><p> “I will do it! Can you not shoot if they</p><p>make a move? Let me pass.” </p><p> Her look compelled hem. Her step</p><p>was even and deliberate. Inside at the </p><p>windows two Mausers covered the hut. </p><p>There would be a deadly reckoning for the </p><p>Hun who raised a hand against that small, </p><p>slim form. </p><p> The girl detached the line from the</p><p>supports, going from post to post in a </p><p>business-like manner. She coiled the line </p><p>methodically as she went along. She felt </p><p>singularly devoid of fear, singularly intent </p><p>on this one thing she was doing. Her </p><p>thoughts did not go beyond it. </p><p> The Germans were standing perfectly</p><p>still, watching her. They had ceased </p><p>talking. She was a dozen yards nearer </p><p>them when her task, so far, was ended. </p><p>She did not cast a glance in their direction. </p><p>Apparently they did not exist for her. She </p><p>walked back to the house with the same </p><p>deliberate step, and they watched her in </p><p>the same bewildered silence. The extraor- </p><p>dinary procedure held them as in a spell. </p><p>They were unable to fathom what it fore- </p><p>told; and it was this that Winifred had </p><p>counted on. </p><p> But now that they could not see her</p><p>hands she was busy with the line, working </p><p>swiftly, surely. She came to the porch and </p><p>paused. Brewer called to her urgently </p><p>from his port in the shutter. He seemed </p><p>to know what she intended. </p><p> “Child! Comein. I am in agony for you.”</p><p> She did not heed him. The ridge-piece</p><p>projected several inches from the porch. </p><p>At the end it was hewn into a knob in a </p><p>rough attempt at an ornamental finish. </p><p>Winifred gaged it with her eye. It was </p><p>eight feet above her from the topmost </p><p>step. She hesitated, then with her whole </p><p>will to succeed she cast the coiled line up </p><p>at the beam. It was a ten-strike! The </p><p>line fell across the beam and down on the </p><p>farther side. </p><p> She pulled at the end she had retained</p><p>in her hand, and a slip-noose dangled in the </p><p>air. She looked, then, at the Germans, </p><p>her head scornfully high, and went into </p><p>the house. Even then the men made not </p><p>a sound. They did not understand, for to </p><p>associate the imperial envoy’s neck with </p><p>that pendent cord was a thing so incon- </p><p>ceivable that it could not find lodgment in </p><p>their skulls. </p><p> “Oh, girl, girl! I could kiss your shoes</p><p>for that!” cried out Billy. </p><p> She answered with a strained smile, and</p><p>sank weakly into a chair. Her knees all </p><p>at once had given way. Brewer was at </p><p>the table writing. He had slit open the </p><p>envelop on which Hecht’s message was in- </p><p>scribed, and was penciling on the inner side </p><p>his counter-ultimatum. </p><p> Billy in the interim was talking rapidly</p><p>with Diego, though he still held his place </p><p>at the window to keep the Germans in view. </p><p>A project that had been forming in his </p><p>mind had taken definite shape. At a stage </p><p>of their talk the old peasant drew from </p><p>under his dingy shirt a long, keen sheath- </p><p>knife. He felt the edge, wagging his head </p><p>knowingly, and replaced it with care. In </p><p>his lack-luster eyes was a gleam of cupidity, </p><p>a passion that masters fear. If all went well </p><p>he was a made man. He would have a farm </p><p>of his own. Billy had pledged it to him </p><p>in Jimmy’s name. </p><p> Brewer stood up. He beckoned to Di-</p><p>ego. </p><p> “Not yet,” interjected Billy. “I want</p><p>ten minutes the start of him. We have </p><p>half an hour left, and I’ve got a plan. It </p><p>may pan out. Anyway I’m going to try it. </p><p>Neiderlein isn’t with that bunch over there, </p><p>or Landeker. I’ve never seen any of them</p><p>before. Well, my scheme is to join them </p><p>and turn Jimmy loose.” </p><p> Winifred caught at her breath.</p><p> “Billy! They will find you out.”</p><p> “Don’t interrupt,” he barked at her, and</p><p>went on in sharp, short sentences. “I’m a </p><p>Cortina German, and in the know. Neider- </p><p>lein has sent me. News! Peralta has been </p><p>taken. An American war-ship got him. </p><p>The city is in arms against the Germans. </p><p>Hecht is not to bring'Kaufman back there. </p><p>Something like that—I’ll fix it up right.” </p><p>“But Kaufman will see you with them. </p><p>He will call out and warn them, if he can </p><p>make them understand at this distance,” </p><p>objected Winifred. </p><p>136 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “He won’t have time. Listen now.</p><p>I am going out at the front, down the hill, </p><p>then across the field toward the woods. </p><p>I’ll be hallooing for Hecht. He’ll answer. </p><p>He’ll have to. And then is the time to send </p><p>Diego with the note. A little after won’t </p><p>hurt. And we will keep piling up the con- </p><p>fusion. </p><p> “When you see me with Hecht at the hut,</p><p>talking, turn Sam out the back door. </p><p>Have him shake his fist at the house— </p><p>yell—cuss—make a row. You will shoot </p><p>at him, and he will run. Keep shooting. </p><p>He can stagger as if he’s hit, but he must </p><p>run on. He will circle around to the hut, </p><p>and when he gets there he must knock </p><p>the first man down he can reach. Diego </p><p>will have set Jimmy free and slipped him </p><p>a gun. I’ll take care of Hecht. Do you </p><p>get my idea? There’ll be three of us to </p><p>five; four, if Diego counts. Not such a </p><p>bad break for us, especially if we get the </p><p>drop on them.” </p><p> Winifred had risen to her feet.</p><p> “You will be killed—all of you!” she</p><p>gasped. </p><p> And yet in spite of the dread a faint hope</p><p>was beating at her heart. </p><p> “Have you thought of the risk, Billy?”</p><p>It was Brewer’s only approach to dis- </p><p>suasion. </p><p> There was a fixed resolve in the boy’s</p><p>look as he answered. </p><p> “I have. But I’m not going to sit here,</p><p>and let them keep Jimmy tied up like a dog. </p><p>Your plan checks them, but it doesn’t give </p><p>us Jimmy back. We can’t go on with a </p><p>stalemate forever. And they will carry </p><p>him along if they decide to leave. I don’t </p><p>intend to wait for that. I’m off! Take </p><p>this Mauser, Winifred. A pail of water, </p><p>somebody. I’ve swum the river, and my </p><p>clothes have got to show it.” </p><p>CHAPTER XXX </p><p>XIIE FIGHT AT THE HUT </p><p>JIMMY did not go down under Hecht’s </p><p>blow. A rough, straddle-legged table </p><p>planted firmly in the dirt floor of the hut </p><p>saved him. He sprawled across it, groveled </p><p>on it, and regained his footing. In the </p><p>grievous heat the water rained unhindered </p><p>from his face on to his fettered hands. </p><p>They were swollen and numb. The stick </p><p>at his back bit into him until his spine </p><p>was near to cracking with it. But he </p><p>minded it not. A murderous wrath con- </p><p>sumed him. He wanted, more than life, </p><p>to get at Hecht; not with any weapon of </p><p>man’s make, but with those nature had </p><p>given him—his naked fists. He wanted to </p><p>feel the impact of them on Hecht’s flesh, </p><p>battering it to a pulp. </p><p> The fit passed. Blind passion would not</p><p>get him anywhere, and he had need of all </p><p>his wits. He looked about him. There </p><p>was an opening in the wall on each side that </p><p>answered for a window. At the rear a door </p><p>led out directly into the forest. There was </p><p>no escape for him in that direction. Bound </p><p>as he was it would be useless to attempt it. </p><p>They would take him before he had gone </p><p>two rods. </p><p> A stool was on the other side of the table.</p><p>It was all that Jimmy noted of the squalid </p><p>furnishings. He went around to it and </p><p>sat down. It was a change of position, </p><p>nothing more. It brought him little ease </p><p>of body; the table was high and he could </p><p>not rest even a rigid elbow on it. But from </p><p>this point he could view what went on </p><p>before the door and, beyond, he could see </p><p>the house. </p><p> He wondered what answer they would</p><p>make to Hecht’s message, and if Diego had </p><p>repeated to them the charge he had called </p><p>after him. The man was frightened out </p><p>of his skin; he might not have heard, or, </p><p>hearing, might have let the words go in </p><p>one ear and out the other. Would Brewer, </p><p>in this event, surrender Kaufman? Jimmy </p><p>prayed that he would not. It would mean </p><p>that the flag must come down, and solely </p><p>because of his own pig-headed folly. He </p><p>cursed himself as he thought of it. He </p><p>would rather die, far rather, than to live </p><p>on in the knowledge that it was for him </p><p>those starry folds were lowered. And yet </p><p>to die trussed up like a barnyard fowl ready </p><p>for the oven. . . .</p><p> They were talking in low tones out in</p><p>front of the hut, possibly for the reason </p><p>that they fancied he was conversant with </p><p>German. Aside from this a wide stillness </p><p>reigned. Not a sound of bird or beast </p><p>broke upon it, not a whispering murmur </p><p>from the tall tree-tops all about. It seemed </p><p>like the quiet of a world hushed in a dread, </p><p>expectant pause. </p><p> Jimmy saw the door of the house open</p><p>and Winifred come forth. He rose, his </p><p>heart in his mouth. He lost sight of her </p><p>For the Flag </p><p>137 </p><p>as she moved toward the kitchen, and he </p><p>stepped quietly over to the window on his </p><p>left that he might keep her in view. Like </p><p>those others in front he was mystified by </p><p>her actions. Yet he knew that some vital </p><p>urge impelled her. His breath came short </p><p>and hard as he watched, and it went out </p><p>in a long sigh of immeasurable relief when </p><p>she was once again at the door. He watched </p><p>her, as did the others, cast the rope over </p><p>the ridge-piece, and dimly he began to </p><p>understand. Then, as she turned and for </p><p>the first time cast a glance at the Germans, </p><p>the whole truth burst in on him. </p><p> “That is their answer,” he exclaimed.</p><p>“And oh, isn’t she plucky!” </p><p> He returned to the stool to think on what</p><p>would follow. Brewer would send his </p><p>defiance to Hecht, and then what? What </p><p>would be the next move? Hecht would not </p><p>dare to shoot him now, but he would keep </p><p>him a prisoner just the same. Where was </p><p>the way out for either side from the im- </p><p>passe? </p><p> Hecht came to the door while he was</p><p>studying the problem and flung a question </p><p>at him. </p><p> “Have you moved his excellency to</p><p>another room?” </p><p> “Are you speaking of the man Kaufman?”</p><p>counter-questioned Jimmy coolly. </p><p> Hecht gave him a poisonous look.</p><p> “I am speaking of Herr Adolph Kaufman,</p><p>the Imperial-” </p><p> “Never the mind the rattle to his tail,”</p><p>cut in Jimmy. “No, they haven’t moved </p><p>him.” </p><p> “Then why are the windows closed?”</p><p> “To keep the flies out, or in, I’ve for-</p><p>gotten which.” </p><p> Hecht took a menacing step toward him.</p><p>Jimmy did not stir, but he pinned his eyes </p><p>on the German with an expression that </p><p>involuntarily halted him.</p><p> “If,” he said, “you have any idea of</p><p>striking me again, I wouldn’t, Hecht. </p><p>You don’t want to add to my score against </p><p>you; for when I get at you—as I will— </p><p>I shall stop just short of beating out your </p><p>brains. Another blow, and I won’t stop at </p><p>that.” </p><p> “When you get at me!” Hecht laughed</p><p>his contempt. “If in half an hour Herr </p><p>Kaufman is not released you will be lying </p><p>out there with a hole in your head, Perry. </p><p>That is as near as you will come to getting </p><p>at me. I can promise you that.” </p><p> Jimmy looked him over coldly.</p><p> “It’s a waste of breath, I suppose, but</p><p>I will make you a proposition, Hecht—it’s </p><p>your only chance to deliver Kaufman. </p><p>Cut this cord and stand up before me with </p><p>your fists. Do me in, and you shall have </p><p>your man; I pledge my word to it. If </p><p>I do you in I’m to go free. Now, if you are </p><p>not entirely the dirty coward you’ve shown </p><p>yourself to be you will take me up. If </p><p>you don’t, and you shoot me, you will see </p><p>Kaufman swinging at the end of that rope </p><p>over there the minute afterward. That’s </p><p>what it’s for, Hecht. I can promise you </p><p>that.” </p><p> This monstrous statement swept the</p><p>Teuton’s mind of the personal implication </p><p>the challenge carried. The Kaiser’s envoy </p><p>to be hanged by the neck like a common </p><p>malefactor! It was beyond the pale of </p><p>reason; it was an impossibility! He stared </p><p>at Jimmy, seeking in him some evidence </p><p>of impaired sanity. Jimmy guessed his </p><p>thought. </p><p> “If you don’t believe it, Hecht, take me</p><p>out and shoot me,” he taunted. “It is </p><p>plain that you are not man enough to </p><p>settle this thing as I’ve proposed. You </p><p>are the kind we read about—baby-killers!” </p><p> For one instant Jimmy’s life hung by a</p><p>thread. The German’s hand went to his </p><p>pistol. He drew it ha!f-forth from his belt, </p><p>hesitated, and with an oath thrust it back. </p><p>The dangling rope over there beyond had </p><p>flashed on his mental vision. </p><p> From a distance in the coffee-field came</p><p>a call:</p><p> “Leutnant Herr Hecht! Leutnant Ilerr</p><p>Hecht!” </p><p> A man looked in at the door, and spoke</p><p>to the lieutenant. He went out in haste. </p><p>Jimmy heard the call again, nearer by, and </p><p>heard Hecht answer—a harsh command, </p><p>it seemed to him. Silence ensued; a wait, </p><p>probably, for whoever it was to come up. </p><p> And then, issuing from the house, Jim-</p><p>my saw Tio Diego. He moved sluggishly </p><p>toward the hut, as though loath to arrive. </p><p>There was something white in his hand— </p><p>a slip of paper. All at once his step livened, </p><p>but Jimmy forgot him in the amazing scene </p><p>that claimed his eyes. </p><p> Billy passed before the door with Hecht.</p><p>They were talking in German, Hecht </p><p>gruffly questioning, Billy replying with </p><p>dramatic vigor. Not for the wink of an </p><p>eyelash did his glance stray the prisoner’s </p><p>133 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>way. They paused a little to the left of </p><p>the entrance. Jimmy could catch a glimpse </p><p>of Hecht gesticulating violently. The re- </p><p>maining Germans gradually approached the </p><p>spot, curiosity drawing them. </p><p> And now Diego arrived, cringing servilely.</p><p>He extended the note to Hecht, and cowered </p><p>away, but not toward the house. Inch by </p><p>inch, as the Germans crowded up to their </p><p>leader to hear the message read, Diego </p><p>neared the door of the hut. Jimmy might </p><p>have been of stone for any movement that </p><p>he made. A drama was being played in </p><p>which there was a part reserved for him. </p><p>This he understood, and he knew that </p><p>presently it would be revealed to him. </p><p> Diego’s back showed at the edge of the</p><p>door. If a chance eye had been directed </p><p>to him he was merely leaning against the </p><p>wall humbly waiting for their excellencies </p><p>to have their will of him. But of a sudden </p><p>his back straightened. An outcry had </p><p>proceeded from the house. A great voice </p><p>rent the air, and pistol-shots followed. </p><p>With a catlike bound Diego was inside the </p><p>hut. The slash of a knife, and Jimmy was </p><p>free and Diego at the door again. </p><p>JIMMY thrashed his numbed arms </p><p>against his sides. He toiled with </p><p>his hands, one with the other, and </p><p>bit into them with his teeth until the blood </p><p>flowed. Life came surging back into them, </p><p>and he was at last able to grasp the revolver </p><p>Diego had left for him on the table. He </p><p>jumped over to the window. Sam was </p><p>running toward the hut. He came on </p><p>bellowing like a stampeded steer. Jimmy </p><p>heard Billy’s voice raised excitedly to Hecht, </p><p>and conjectured that he was trying to allay </p><p>the other’s distrust of the remarkable </p><p>proceeding. </p><p> “Billy will give me a signal—surely—</p><p>surelyt” Jimmy breathed. </p><p> Sam had stopped running. He was</p><p>within a few feet of the watching group. </p><p>Jimmy slipped around to the door, keeping </p><p>close to the wall. Diego had moved away. </p><p>He was standing behind a big German </p><p>whose hand was on his gun. Diego’s hand </p><p>was in his shirt bosom.</p><p> Sam was up to them now—in the midst</p><p>of them. He was laboring, it seemed, for </p><p>speech. But his was not a speaking part; </p><p>if he had been told what to say he could </p><p>not have remembered it in this hasty role </p><p>he had assumed. He raised his hand in an </p><p>uncouth attempt at a military salute—and </p><p>it and the other hand, doubled into huge </p><p>granite fists, crashed full into the faces of </p><p>the two nearest Germans. They went </p><p>down like slaughtered beeves. With the </p><p>action Billy’s automatic was jabbed into </p><p>Hecht’s stomach. </p><p> “Now, Jimmy!” he shouted. And,</p><p>“Hands up!” to Hecht. </p><p> Jimmy was already out and at work.</p><p>Sam’s attack had been a sufficient signal </p><p>for him. Diego’s man was reeling with a </p><p>gushing knife-wound deep in his neck— </p><p>dying on his feet. The peasant, his courage </p><p>suddenly gone, was in full flight for the </p><p>shelter of the woods. The fifth man had </p><p>fired at him, and missed. He wheeled at </p><p>Jimmy’s appearance, and they both let go </p><p>at the same instant. Jimmy felt a searing </p><p>streak on his temple. The German’s pistol- </p><p>arm dropped. A strangling cough distorted </p><p>his features. He doubled up and came in a </p><p>lump to the ground. The other German </p><p>fell over, kicked convulsively, and lay quiet. </p><p> Jimmy put his hand to his head. Blood</p><p>was on it when he took it away. It had </p><p>been a narrow squeak for him. He started </p><p>over where Billy held Hecht at pistol-point. </p><p>Sam was rising up from the two Huns he </p><p>had felled. They had come to, but the </p><p>negro had their weapons corraled. </p><p> “Jes’ drawin’ deir teeth, boss,” he</p><p>grinned as Jimmy passed him. </p><p> “You are a prince, Sam,” commended</p><p>Jimmy. “Gather up those other tools </p><p>back there. As for these chaps kick them </p><p>off the lot. We don’t want any prisoners.” </p><p>To Billy he said simply—“I owe you one, </p><p>old man.” </p><p> “Not till you have frisked this skunk of</p><p>his gun,” the boy replied. “For two cents </p><p>I’d save you the trouble,” he growled at </p><p>Hecht. “Keep those hands up!” </p><p> Thirty seconds would have covered the</p><p>drama’s action from the time of Billy’s </p><p>warning shout. But there was an epilogue </p><p>to come. Jimmy devised it, and in the </p><p>heat of his desire all else was forgotten— </p><p>the men lying dead by the door of the hut— </p><p>Kaufman—Winifred—Brewer—all things in </p><p>heaven and earth but this man Hecht. </p><p> “I wouldn’t have you harm him, Billy,</p><p>for all the money in the mint,” he said in a </p><p>silky voice. “I promised him something </p><p>in there, and I’m going to give it to him </p><p>right now. I can’t wait.” </p><p> He took Hecht’s pistol from him, and</p><p>For the Flag </p><p>139 </p><p>his own, the one he had been relieved of </p><p>at the riverside. He passed them over to </p><p>Billy together with the revolver Diego had </p><p>brought him. Hecht did not speak, but </p><p>his eyes, flashing from one to the other, were </p><p>hells of hate. Kaufman was bawling ob- </p><p>jurgations at him from his vent in the </p><p>shutters. He had seen everything, and </p><p>Hecht knew that his career was closed. </p><p> “Now, you baby-killer, put up your</p><p>hands,” Jimmy ordered. </p><p> He squared away for the German’s</p><p>attack. So intent was he on the business </p><p>before him that he did not notice that </p><p>Brewer and Winifred had come out of the </p><p>house, and were in the yard watching the </p><p>astounding affair. They had brought their </p><p>rifles with them. Old Tia Matilde cowered </p><p>behind on the steps. Nor did Billy remark </p><p>them. He stood by with shining eyes. </p><p>This was as it should be. Jimmy was going </p><p>to wipe out in the only way possible the </p><p>indignities to which he had been subjected. </p><p> But Hecht did not put up his fists. The</p><p>decent art of self-defense was not his. He </p><p>lowered his head, and rushed in with </p><p>taloned fingers clutching for his opponent’s </p><p>throat. It was child’s play for Jimmy, this. </p><p>He leaped aside and planted a blow behind </p><p>Hecht’s ear that sent him plowing into the </p><p>dirt. </p><p> “One!” cried Billy. “Oh, boy!”</p><p> “De Lawd bless me,” chuckled Sam.</p><p> He had obeyed Jimmy literally, and</p><p>kicked his two Germans into the coffee- </p><p>field; and he had turned in time to see </p><p>Hecht go down. </p><p> The man climbed heavily to his feet.</p><p>He dashed the sweat from his eyes and, </p><p>his lesson learned, he crouched and began </p><p>warily circling around his foe. If he could </p><p>close with him, get a wrestling hold! He </p><p>would know his way then. Jimmy saw </p><p>what Hecht was up to. He did not intend </p><p>to let the fellow come to a clinch with him; </p><p>he was not too sure of that freshly healed </p><p>lung of his, and, besides, the thought of a </p><p>straining embrace with the brute nauseated</p><p>him. </p><p> “Come on, you Boche,” he invited softly.</p><p>“I knew there was no such thing as a stand- </p><p>up fight in you. Come on and strike me </p><p>in the mouth. You did it once.” </p><p> Hecht believed he saw an opening, and</p><p>rushed in. His rage carried him smashing </p><p>through Jimmy’s guard. But before he </p><p>could make his grip fast Jimmy shot in a </p><p>short-arm jab to his jaw that staggered him. </p><p>It gave Jimmy the chance to throw him off, </p><p>and in the same motion he got in a vicious </p><p>uppercut to his chin. Hecht tottered back, </p><p>spun around dizzily and dropped. </p><p> “Two!” counted Billy rapturously.</p><p> A shrill, flesh-creeping cry pierced the air.</p><p>Jimmy swung around from the supine </p><p>Teuton. Tia Matilde was fleeing from </p><p>the porch to Winifred, her hands raised in </p><p>terror above her head. Behind her, in the </p><p>door, Kaufman’s bearded face showed for a </p><p>moment. A raucous laugh rolled from his </p><p>lips, and the door was banged to. </p><p> On his last visit to the man Brewer had</p><p>neglected to shoot the bolt that held him </p><p>prisoner, and he had found it out. And in </p><p>the living-room were loaded guns—two </p><p>Mausers, a Colt, and Kaufman’s own </p><p>hammerless S. &amp; W. </p><p>CHAPTER XXXI </p><p>BREWER </p><p>TT WAS a meteoric moment. Winifred </p><p>and Brewer stood looking uncertainly </p><p>at the closed door. The baleful occurrence </p><p>seemed to have dazed them. </p><p> “To the kitchen, Winifred! Quick!</p><p>Quick!” Jimmy shouted. </p><p> He grabbed a pistol from Billy and set</p><p>out full tilt for the girl. </p><p> Hecht had got to his feet, but he was</p><p>unarmed, and they paid him no attention. </p><p>Billy started to follow Jimmy. Sam, from </p><p>the background where he had been collect- </p><p>ing the weapons of the dead Germans, ran </p><p>forward. And then came what was near to </p><p>proving Billy’s end. With his second step</p><p>he tripped and fell. The pistols piled in </p><p>his hands scattered right and left. In a </p><p>twinkling Hecht had pounced on one, and </p><p>roaring his triumph, drew it down on the </p><p>prostrate boy. But the bullet plowed harm- </p><p>lessly into the ground. Hccht had been </p><p>a second too late. Sam fired first, not ten </p><p>feet from him, and the .45 bored his body </p><p>through from side to side. </p><p> “Good boy, Sam!” yapped Billy as he</p><p>scrambled up and retrieved the guns he </p><p>had spilled. </p><p> Sam scooped up the one Hecht had</p><p>dropped, and they raced on, leaving the </p><p>Hun gurgling out his life in the trodden </p><p>dirt. Both Jimmy and Brewer had stopped </p><p>at the man’s savage cry, but before either </p><p>140 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>could shoot, the negro had dispatched him. </p><p> They all crowded into the kitchen-house.</p><p>It was under twenty yards from the dining- </p><p>room, but the solid stone walls defied any- </p><p>thing short of a field-piece. They had but </p><p>to keep away from the window, and Kauf- </p><p>man would not have a chance at them. </p><p>From the southeast window of his prison </p><p>room he could have commanded the door </p><p>had not the shutters been nailed fast; but </p><p>the angle was too sharp for accurate aim </p><p>through the peepholes. The situation, </p><p>however, was not without its danger, and, </p><p>moreover, it was humiliating. The trap- </p><p>pers were trapped. </p><p> “It was my criminal carelessness,” Brewer</p><p>groaned. </p><p> Jimmy did not understand, but it was no</p><p>time for futile questions. Billy and Sam </p><p>were depositing their superfluous pistols on </p><p>a chair. Billy turned abruptly and ex- </p><p>claimed: </p><p> “I say! What’s to prevent Kaufman</p><p>from going quietly out at the front and </p><p>scooting off. He may have done it already.” </p><p> This was a new thought to them, for until</p><p>then it had been fixed in their minds that </p><p>the minister would hold the house till an- </p><p>other rescuing party should arrive. Nei- </p><p>derlein would certainly send more men, and </p><p>probably head them himself, to learn why </p><p>Hecht did not return to the legation. He </p><p>would not know of the cloudburst, and the </p><p>delay consequent upon it. Even now he </p><p>might be on his way to the farm. </p><p> “Kaufman was brought here in the night,”</p><p>said Winifred reflectively. “He doesn’t </p><p>know the country it is likely. I don’t think </p><p>he would venture out alone; and he doesn’t </p><p>know how many of us he has to deal with. </p><p>He may think we have some one stationed </p><p>in the trees at the front to watch the door.” </p><p> The answer to their problem was start-</p><p>lingly unexpected. Brewer had put his </p><p>rifle aside, and immersed in thought was </p><p>moving toward the back of the kitchen, </p><p>where was another door giving into a smaller </p><p>room, which, in turn, opened on a narrow</p><p>strip between the kitchen-house and the </p><p>precipitous hillside on the west. He passed </p><p>before the window. Instantly a gun spoke </p><p>and a bullet whistled through the window. </p><p>It missed Brewer only by an inch or so. </p><p> “Father!” gasped Winifred, white with</p><p>fear. </p><p> “He’s found the guns!” cried Billy. “He</p><p>is going to keep us here.” </p><p> “In two hours it will be dark. Then we</p><p>can do something,” said Jimmy. “He can’t </p><p>guard all the windows at one and the same </p><p>time.” </p><p> “But if he gets reinforcements! Those</p><p>chaps we let go will tear back to the city </p><p>in their car. Neiderlein will come out with </p><p>a bigger bunch.” Billy wrinkled his nose, </p><p>but not in comedy now. “Gee, Jimmy, it </p><p>doesn’t look any too good to me.” </p><p> Jimmy glanced over at Brewer. He did</p><p>not seem to be upset by his narrow call. </p><p>He wore, rather, an abstracted air that took </p><p>no account of his surroundings. He beck- </p><p>oned to Jimmy with a slight gesture, and </p><p>Jimmy, ducking below the window-sill, </p><p>went to him. Winifred, still in the clutch </p><p>of her fright, leaned limply against the wall </p><p>and watched them. But for a moment </p><p>only. Brewer led the way into the adjoin- </p><p>ing room and closed the intervening door. </p><p>He spoke rapidly and quietly. </p><p> “It is an enormity—Kaufman holding</p><p>the house with the flag flying over him. It </p><p>is my fault, and it is my business to find the </p><p>remedy. There is a way, and I will attempt </p><p>it.” </p><p> “What way?” broke in Jimmy, puzzled.</p><p>“The doors are fast, and the shutters are </p><p>bolted on the inside.” </p><p> “You have forgotten the skylight.”</p><p> “The skylight?”</p><p> It shot through Jimmy’s mind that all</p><p>these events had affected the man’s reason. </p><p>Brewer answered calmly. </p><p> “Exactly that. It is open and the lad-</p><p>der in the hall is up. It is not probable that </p><p>Kaufman has removed it.”</p><p> “Oh,” interrupted Jimmy again, “but the</p><p>thing is impossible, -sir. How-” </p><p> “Wait!” enjoined Brewer curtly. “There</p><p>is another ladder. It lies along the east </p><p>side of the house. It was used, I imagine, </p><p>for repairing the roof. At any rate it is </p><p>there. I shall raise it, and go up in my </p><p>stocking feet for a better foothold on the </p><p>tiles. I will go down through the skylight, </p><p>and surprise Kaufman in the dining-room. </p><p>Your part is to keep him busy until I can </p><p>get away.” </p><p> Jimmy gazed at him in silence.</p><p> “By Jove!” he breathed at last. And</p><p>then: “I believe it could be done, only how </p><p>will you get from here to the east side of </p><p>the house? Kaufman will shoot you </p><p>down.” </p><p> Brewer led him to the outer door.</p><p>For the Flag </p><p>141 </p><p>CTI “THERE!” he said. “If I can </p><p>reach the edge I can claw my way </p><p>along below eye-range and come up </p><p>at the farther end.” </p><p> “And a slip would send you to the bot-</p><p>tom. Mr. Brewer, this is work for a </p><p>younger man. I want you to let me-” </p><p> Brewer stopped him with a remonstrant</p><p>hand. A flickering, inscrutable smile played </p><p>about his mouth and vanished. </p><p> “I have, I think, a special strength for</p><p>this,” he said. “When you came to me </p><p>the other day and told what was required </p><p>of me it—well, it meant new life to me. It </p><p>meant what a shipwrecked man must feel </p><p>who sees a sail come up over the horizon </p><p>when he has lost all hope—a ship flying his </p><p>country’s flag. I can’t very well make you </p><p>understand, Mr. Perry, but this work is for </p><p>me alone. It is for no other.” </p><p> He hesitated, and brought out a key from</p><p>his pocket. </p><p> “If anything happens to me this will open</p><p>my box at the Credito Mercantil in Cortina. </p><p>There is money in it, a great deal of money. </p><p>And there are papers. You will understand </p><p>when you read them. Winifred will know </p><p>what to do; it is what I shall do if I live to </p><p>see this thing finished. She—Winifred— </p><p>faithful through all-” </p><p> His voice broke and he did not go on.</p><p>Jimmy reached out and took his hand. </p><p>He looked steadily into Brewer’s eyes. </p><p> “I do not have to read the papers to</p><p>understand,” he said with feeling. “Be- </p><p>tween you and me and Winifred all is well, </p><p>sir. You are going to succeed—Mr. Bow- </p><p>man—and you are going home with us, when </p><p>all this is over, in honor and high regard.” </p><p>Brewer shivered as with cold. His head </p><p>sank upon his breast. </p><p> “You know!” he choked.</p><p> “From the first I have known; but w’hat</p><p>I did not know was that I should come to</p><p>this downright liking for you. You have </p><p>won it, sir, and how, it shall be my privilege </p><p>to tell the world.” </p><p> Brewer’s head came up gradually. In</p><p>his look was indeed the hope of the rescued </p><p>castaway. He gripped Jimmy’s hand in </p><p>both his own, but he said only— </p><p> “I am going now.”</p><p> “Wait one minute, until you hear the</p><p>firing,” Jimmy cautioned him. “You can </p><p>make your break under cover of it. Good </p><p>luck, sir. And remember, we are all pulling </p><p>for you.” </p><p> He returned to the others. Winifred</p><p>mutely questioned him with her eyes. He </p><p>told her in a dozen words what her father </p><p>had undertaken to do. </p><p> “Now Billy—Sam—stand back from the</p><p>door, and start shooting out of it when I </p><p>call. Not too fast, and not together. Two </p><p>shots each.” </p><p> For himself, he caught up Brewer’s rifle</p><p>and warily poked the muzzle out of the </p><p>window corner so that it very nearly shel- </p><p>tered him from view. Only a minute por- </p><p>tion of his arm and shoulder showed. </p><p> “Now!” he called.</p><p> With each shot from the door Jimmy</p><p>pumped one at the dining-room, praying it </p><p>would find Kaufman at the port he selected </p><p>for his doubtful aim. The combined effect </p><p>was as if all six shots were delivered at the </p><p>house. Kaufman returned hesitantly what </p><p>he possibly took for a fusilade, and yet </p><p>could not see where it came from. He </p><p>fired once or twice at the kitchen window, </p><p>and then was silent. Jimmy ran into the </p><p>back room, and looked out. Brewer was </p><p>gone. The ruse had diverted attention </p><p>from his movements. </p><p> “If I could watch how he gets along!”</p><p>murmured Jimmy. </p><p> The dining-room commanded both the</p><p>front and rear doors of the kitchen, but </p><p>Jimmy calculated that with a cautious step </p><p>out of the rear door, and flattening himself </p><p>close to the wall, he could gain the shelter </p><p>of the south side, and from that point, mov-</p><p>ing back a little, he could see the roof of </p><p>the big house. Ten seconds would do </p><p>it. </p><p> He tried it, and succeeded without draw-</p><p>ing Kaufman’s fire. He was protected from </p><p>the dining-room, but he perceived that </p><p>should Kaufman take a notion to go to his </p><p>own room to reconnoiter the kitchen terri- </p><p>tory he could with a slant shot pot any one </p><p>who moved outside a limited area in the </p><p>flank of the building. But from within </p><p>this area Jimmy found that the skylight </p><p>was in plain sight. And it was a degree </p><p>cooler here than in the low-ceiled kitchen. </p><p> He returned in the same guarded man-</p><p>ner, and reported his discovery. Tia Ma- </p><p>tilde would not budge. She sat crouched </p><p>against the wall with the determination to </p><p>remain there until all danger had passed. </p><p>But the others ducked under the window </p><p>to Jimmy. He took charge of Winifred’s </p><p>rifle and instructed her how to proceed. </p><p>m </p><p>142 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Go first,” lie directed. “I will be in</p><p>close touch of you.” </p><p> His idea was to shield her should Kauf-</p><p>man glimpse them. </p><p> His purpose was clear to the girl. For</p><p>just a moment her eyes rested on him—on </p><p>his blood-stained cheek—with soft intensity; </p><p>then in quiet obedience she stepped out of </p><p>the door. He was instantly at her side. </p><p>Billy followed with Brewer’s rifle, and then </p><p>Sam. The great bulk of the negro was not </p><p>so easily flattened against the wall. The </p><p>crack of a Mauser came from the dining- </p><p>room, and Sam sputtered an exclamation. </p><p> “O-o-o! I cudn’t ’a’ slipped er sheet o’</p><p>writin’ paper ’tween dat an’ me.” </p><p> THEY reached the safety zone with-</p><p>out further incident, and they stood </p><p>"* with their eyes on the flag hanging </p><p>slack on its pole over the skylight. Billy </p><p>took advantage of the respite to reload the </p><p>magazine of Brewer’s gun. </p><p> “I hope Kaufman doesn’t start to ram-</p><p>bling about the house,” he said nervously. </p><p>“It would be easy to see Mr. Brewer, or hear </p><p>him at the living-room windows.” </p><p>“Or he might go up to the roof. And </p><p>then—if he should see father coming! Do </p><p>you think he might do that, Jimmy?” </p><p>Winifred laid a trembling hand on his </p><p>arm. He laid his own over it reassuringly. </p><p> “Don’t think he’d attempt it,” he an-</p><p>swered. “That ladder is mighty shaky, </p><p>and this move of ours will set him to guess- </p><p>ing. He will try to figure out what we are </p><p>up to, and he won’t venture away from this </p><p>side of the house. He will want to keep a </p><p>watch on us.” </p><p> “I’ll tell you something you don’t know,</p><p>Jimmy,” said Billy earnestly. “Mr. Brewer </p><p>wanted to make a deal with Hecht to ex- </p><p>change places with you—to be shot in your </p><p>place, if it came to that.” </p><p> “He did?” said Jimmy very quietly. “I</p><p>wish I had known it before, Billy.” </p><p> He met Winifred’s eyes. They were</p><p>humid. He pressed her hand, and it re- </p><p>sponded. They fell quiet after this, all of </p><p>them, waiting tensely for Brewer’s appear- </p><p>ance on the tiles. A tremendous stillness </p><p>wrapped the earth. So still was it that </p><p>they heard, or fancied they did, the scrap- </p><p>ing of the ladder Brewer was erecting against </p><p>the roof. </p><p> “My Lawd, w’at’s dat!” ejaculated Sam</p><p>in a scared voice. </p><p> They looked in the direction in which he</p><p>was pointing. Bounding out from the woods </p><p>near the hut was a great, tan-colored beast, </p><p>spotted black with a white breast and belly. </p><p>It stopped in the open. Its long, sinewy </p><p>tail switched from side to side, and its furry </p><p>ears were flattened to its head. </p><p> “A jaguar!” whispered Billy. “Some-</p><p>thing is wrong or it would never come this </p><p>near a house.” </p><p> They gazed fascinated at the giant cat.</p><p>It saw them, but it took no note of them. </p><p>It held a curious listening poise. And now </p><p>its head went up, and a deep, hoarse cry— </p><p>pu, pu—issued from its throat. It bounded </p><p>off into the coffee-field. </p><p> Suddenly Billy swore under his breath,</p><p>and then lifted his voice in a warning </p><p>shout— </p><p> “Regrese, Diego, regresel”</p><p> From around the back of the stables to</p><p>the right, trotting toward them, came the </p><p>old peasant from his skulking-place in the </p><p>woods. He had seen them gathered out </p><p>there by the kitchen wall and imagined, </p><p>probably, that no danger threatened; for he </p><p>did not know the true state of affairs. </p><p> He paused at Billy’s call, a fatal moment.</p><p>A spurt of flame burst from the southeast </p><p>window of the house. Diego turned to run. </p><p>Another shot, and Diego rolled over and </p><p>over and lay in a huddled heap. And still </p><p>another shot followed. A scream echoed </p><p>with it. Old Tia Matilde staggered into </p><p>view. She whirled about, rocked to and </p><p>fro—and there was a second motionless </p><p>huddle on the ground. Matilde had come </p><p>forth at the sound of her husband’s name, </p><p>forgetful of the hazard, and Kaufman had</p><p>shot her down. </p><p> “My God, the butchering brute!” thun-</p><p>dered Jimmy. He sprang out from the </p><p>sheltering wall, and poured the five shots </p><p>in his Mauser into one vent and then the </p><p>other of Kaufman’s windows. Billy was </p><p>with him, firing in the same furious rage. </p><p>There was no reply. Kaufman had emp- </p><p>tied the magazines of his guns, or a bullet </p><p>had found him. </p><p> But another sight claimed them. Brewer</p><p>was on the roof. He was at the skylight. </p><p>And, what they had not noticed in these </p><p>last fierce minutes, a torrid air had sprung up. </p><p>It rippled out the folds of the flag above </p><p>Brewer. He looked down at\them, and then </p><p>up at the flag. For a moment they saw </p><p>him thus—and were hurled flat on their </p><p>For the Flag </p><p>143 </p><p>faces in the roar and crash of a world-shak- </p><p>ing convulsion. </p><p> It came again and again. They lay where</p><p>they had been dashed down, bruised and </p><p>stunned. They had no voice with which </p><p>to shriek their fears. Each recurrent shock </p><p>seemed to lift and crush them down. </p><p> Horrible beast-cries came from the for-</p><p>est. All about were sounds of grinding, </p><p>slipping earth, of great boulders hurtling </p><p>down the hill. And now descended on them </p><p>a rain that held no moisture—a soft, </p><p>stealthy rain of ashes borne on the increas- </p><p>ing breeze from old Borazo, awakened fully </p><p>after these many years to a devouring activ- </p><p>ity. It was an hour from sunset, but the </p><p>gloom of a dying twilight was on the land. </p><p> A pause came in the shocks. It grew</p><p>longer, lengthened into minutes. But the </p><p>filthy rain still fell, and over in the south </p><p>was a pale, ghastly glow reflected from the </p><p>molten lava the volcano was spewing up </p><p>from its bowels. </p><p> Jimmy put out a groping hand.</p><p> “Winifred!” he called in a labored whis-</p><p>per. “Winifred—Winifred!” </p><p> Her hand touched his. She had fallen</p><p>close to him. </p><p> “Jimmy!” she whispered back.</p><p> “Billy—Sam!” he called.</p><p> They answered, and presently one by</p><p>one they ventured to their knees, and, </p><p>finally, with a painful effort, to their feet. </p><p>They stared about them in the gloom, hot- </p><p>eyed and horror-bound. Only a mound </p><p>of stone where the kitchen had been lay </p><p>between them and the house. And the </p><p>house—it was but a greater mound! Part </p><p>of it had tumbled down the cliff, which had </p><p>been shorn away to the very foundation of </p><p>the building. </p><p> The stables were gone. Brewer’s car lay</p><p>buried deep under the wreckage. There </p><p>was not an upstanding stick or stone within </p><p>their view. They were alone, these four,</p><p>on a broken, barren hill-crest, the only </p><p>breathing human creatures of all those that </p><p>had peopled it an hour before. </p><p> “Father! Father!” It scarcely stirred</p><p>the awful stillness, so low and tremulous a </p><p>note it was. </p><p> Jimmy’s arm went around the desolate</p><p>girl’s bowed form. He drew her gently to </p><p>him, and her head rested on his breast. </p><p>And they stood thus for many minutes in </p><p>the soft, smothering, abhorrent rain from </p><p>Mount Borazo. </p><p>CHAPTER XXXII </p><p>HOMEWARD BOUND </p><p>IT WAS Saturday noon. Jimmy sat with </p><p>the Hon. John Henry Lane in the im- </p><p>provised quarters of the American legation </p><p>over a tobacco shop on the Plaza Central. </p><p>Jimmy had just come in. Before them lay </p><p>the ruins of the three-story Hotel Europa. </p><p>Up on the Calle Commercio the legation </p><p>building was a heap of rubbish. But the </p><p>German legation stood intact, though its </p><p>doors were closed. </p><p> The death of the imperial envoy was</p><p>recorded with Spartan brevity in La Cro- </p><p>nica. He had been visiting in the country, </p><p>and with his host was buried in the ruins </p><p>of the house. This, so it was stated, was </p><p>the only fact known at present. In short, </p><p>the Government had seen to it that the </p><p>burden of explanatory details should rest </p><p>with the legation, if it cared to shoulder it. </p><p>Lane was speaking. </p><p> “It is pretty bad, James. Some forty</p><p>buildings are wrecked, and two hundred </p><p>lives lost by present reports. The list may </p><p>grow. Now tell me just what happened </p><p>out there. From the beginning, please. </p><p>I’ve worried myself sick about you. And </p><p>I see you have had a hurt.” </p><p> “That?” Jimmy touched his temple con-</p><p>temptuously. “A miss is as good as a mile. </p><p>It is nothing.” </p><p> As briefly as he could he narrated what</p><p>had occurred up to the moment of the </p><p>’quake. His face was very grave. </p><p> “When we were able to get our wits to-</p><p>gether,” he went on, “we groped our way </p><p>down through the coffee-field to the Santa </p><p>Marta Road, and from there to the river </p><p>and always in that hideous velvet rain of </p><p>stinking ashes.” </p><p> He shuddered as he recalled it.</p><p> “We waited there for ages. Black night</p><p>came on. And there was another shock, </p><p>but only a tremor this time. It scared us, </p><p>though, I can promise you. The river had </p><p>fallen so that if it had been day we could </p><p>have crossed, but we were afraid to try it </p><p>in the dark. And then came the lights of </p><p>a car on the other side. We shouted and— </p><p>oh. I’ll cut it short; I can’t think of it </p><p>quietly. It was Enrique—good old En- </p><p>rique! He hadn’t forgotten us in all the </p><p>tragedies of the day. On the way in we </p><p>passed an overturned car. It had been </p><p>144 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>caught in the ’quake. Those two Germans </p><p>were under it, and dead. The road was </p><p>pretty bad in spots, but Enrique made it, </p><p>and took us to his home, Don Luis’ house.” </p><p>He drew a long breath and continued. </p><p>“Enrique told us about Mary Taylor— </p><p>her death — and I knew what the telling </p><p>cost him. We did not press him for par- </p><p>ticulars. By Heaven, Mr. Lane, I’ve been </p><p>living with men since I struck in here— </p><p>men! Enrique, Billy Smith, Black Sam— </p><p>God bless him—and Brewer. You didn’t </p><p>know Brewer, I believe you told me?” </p><p> He scanned Lane closely.</p><p> “No. He never called at the legation.</p><p>I did not know him.” </p><p> There was a short pause. Then Jimmy</p><p>said slowly: </p><p> “No matter how this Kaufman business</p><p>resolves itself in retrospect, no matter </p><p>whether it helped or did not help, Brewer’s </p><p>soul was in it. He died for it—the death </p><p>of a man—under his own flag.” </p><p> There was another pause. Lane broke it.</p><p>“And Mr. Brewer’s daughter? You have </p><p>scarcely mentioned her, James.” </p><p> Jimmy gave him a straight look.</p><p> “She is very lonely, and she is very deso-</p><p>late, Mr. Lane. And I love her. Is it </p><p>enough for me to say? Or—” his expression </p><p>lightened—“shall I tell you that &amp; I can </p><p>prevail on her she will be my wife before </p><p>the boat sails for home tomorrow. To- </p><p>night, if she will consent.” </p><p> Lane started in his chair.</p><p> “Why—God bless me—my dear boy!</p><p>Ah—er—humph, you have a sudden way </p><p>with you. But a thousand good wishes, </p><p>James—ten thousand.” </p><p> He grasped Jimmy’s hand and wrung</p><p>it fervently. The ghost of a grin flitted </p><p>across Jimmy’s face. </p><p> “I will collect afterward,” he said. “And</p><p>meanwhile if you can send around to me</p><p>presently four hundred dollars of the nine </p><p>hundred I left with you I’ll be obliged. It </p><p>will be enough to buy us some presentable </p><p>clothes, and get us home. There will be </p><p>three of us in the party, for of course Sam </p><p>will go along.” </p><p>“But why not all the money, James.” </p><p>“The rest is for a small remembrance to </p><p>Billy Smith—after I am gone. I will ask </p><p>you to attend to that for me, sir. Billy, </p><p>you know, is out of a job-” </p><p> “The devil he is!” roared the Hon. John</p><p>Henry. “With all the work before me </p><p>now? As soon as we see you out of town, </p><p>he will have to buckle to and help Whitta- </p><p>ker. And by the way, you are lucky about </p><p>the railroad. The quake did not damage </p><p>it seriously. The trains can run. Mrs. </p><p>Isaacs got in last night with only a minor </p><p>delay.” </p><p> “Mrs. Isaacs!” Jimmy stared his aston-</p><p>ishment. “Is she back again looking for </p><p>her uncle?” </p><p> Lane guffawed.</p><p> “Oh, so Enrique has not told^ou?” The</p><p>Hon. John Henry enjoyed his surprise. </p><p>“Even Ortega did not suspect her at first. </p><p>I will tell you about her.” </p><p> And he did, chuckling greatly. He</p><p>added: </p><p> “They have had news from Terrozas</p><p>today. He wired the full story. He inter- </p><p>cepted the Peralta expedition, bagged the </p><p>whole outfit, and brought them into Puerto </p><p>Mono. Our gunboat settled the Arraca </p><p>business; blocked the river mouth so they </p><p>couldn’t send their launches out. It seems </p><p>also that there was a German U about, and </p><p>Terrozas settled that account. He has </p><p>developed into a great figure in the State. </p><p>I will have particulars about the U today. </p><p>Lieutenant Norris is coming up to see me.” </p><p>He talked these matters over at greater </p><p>length for Jimmy’s enlightenment. When </p><p>he concluded Jimmy rose to go. </p><p> “Well,” he remarked with deep satisfac-</p><p>tion, “I’ve had a small hand in one little </p><p>shindy; now I’m going home home to take</p><p>a hand in the big one. I’ve filed a cable </p><p>to father saying that I’m safe and sailing </p><p>tomorrow.” </p><p> “Did you mention the surprise you have</p><p>in store for him?” hinted the minister slyly. </p><p> Jimmy answered with a return of his</p><p>former seriousness. </p><p> “No, sir. That is something I can’t</p><p>reduce to a telegraphic announcement. And </p><p>I want to say, Mr. Lane, that when I am </p><p>home again, and have seen father and Uncle </p><p>Allan, you will get from them a personal </p><p>appreciation of your kindness to me. As </p><p>for my own thanks, I won’t try to put them </p><p>in words.” </p><p> Lane followed him to the door, radiating</p><p>pleasure. </p><p> “If it is to be tonight, James,” he de-</p><p>claimed unctuously, “I must be informed </p><p>at an early hour. I wish to communicate </p><p>with Senor Ortega, and his Excellency the </p><p>President. I don’t know, but it may be </p><p>For the Flag </p><p>145 </p><p>that the President will attend. I can swear </p><p>he’ll want to. For myself-” </p><p> “I say,"sir!” cried Jimmy; but Lane rolled</p><p>on in full swing, unheeding of him: </p><p> “Of course it is my privilege as the repre-</p><p>sentative of our sovereign country to give </p><p>away this fair—er—a-humph—daughter of </p><p>the flag. Don Enrique will stand up with </p><p>you, I presume, and if perchance an attend- </p><p>ant on the bride is desired, there is Mrs. </p><p>Isaacs, a less alluring ‘daughter,’ I will </p><p>grant, but American to the core, and-” </p><p> “My dear sir!” shouted Jimmy, strug-</p><p>gling to keep his countenance. “I haven’t </p><p>asked Miss Brewer to marry me yet. I </p><p>have only hopes.” </p><p> “W-what!” exclaimed the astounded man.</p><p>“But I am going to ask her, inside of </p><p>half an hour,” Jimmy finished, “and I will </p><p>let you know the result.” </p><p> He left the Hon. John Henry with his</p><p>mouth open in a vain attempt at speech, </p><p>and went down the stairs to the street. </p><p>THEY were in the library of Senor </p><p>Valera’s house, and alone. The </p><p>secretary was at his office whelmed in </p><p>the inordinate duties the great disaster had </p><p>heaped on him. Enrique was in charge </p><p>of a provost-marshal’s detail policing the </p><p>stricken city. And Billy Smith, with a </p><p>wisdom beyond his years, had removed </p><p>himself to other scenes. </p><p> “Is it because it is so soon after, Wini-</p><p>fred?” Jimmy questioned. </p><p> Her head moved in dreary negation. She</p><p>was white and worn from the terrors she </p><p>had passed through; and yet these were as </p><p>nothing now to the sweeping sense of deso- </p><p>lation that beset her. </p><p> “It is not that, Jimmy—what difference</p><p>could it make? He is dead, and his tomb </p><p>is reared above him; it is there I would have </p><p>him lie. And for me, there are no barren </p><p>conventions to be observed. And yet,</p><p>Jimmy, it is because he is dead that I must </p><p>go my way apart from you. It is because </p><p>a secret is buried with him that I, his daugh- </p><p>ter, should be the last to tell. I can not </p><p>share it with you, Jimmy.” </p><p> “But you love me. You have said it,</p><p>Winifred.” </p><p> “Ah! If love were only all of life!” She</p><p>clasped her hands with a passionate gesture, </p><p>in which also was the eloquence of a su- </p><p>preme despair. “But it is not all. Honor </p><p>and dishonor are in it, and pride and shame. </p><p>We are prisoners to them for good or bad.” </p><p>She moved away a few aimless steps, car- </p><p>ing only that she should not see his sup- </p><p>pliant eyes. He did not follow. He stood </p><p>very quietly where he was, and he said: </p><p>“Your father, when I parted with him, </p><p>gave into my keeping a key. I was to use </p><p>it in case anything happened to him. The </p><p>key was to his strong-box at the Credito </p><p>Mercantil. He said there were money and </p><p>papers there, and I was to read the papers. </p><p>I have read them, Winifred.” </p><p> She had turned, and was gazing at him</p><p>in incredulous surprise. It was several </p><p>seconds before she spoke. </p><p> “You know!” They were her father’s</p><p>words—the same choked cry. </p><p> He answered her, as he had her father,</p><p>and his smile was infinitely tender and com- </p><p>passionate. </p><p> “From the first I knew it, Winifred. I</p><p>told your father that I knew, and his hand </p><p>was in mine at that last moment before he </p><p>went on a brave man’s mission, and met a </p><p>brave man’s death.” </p><p> “You knew—all the time—and it made</p><p>no difference?” A wonderful light was in </p><p>her eyes. </p><p> “Did I act as if it did, Winifred?” he</p><p>asked. </p><p> He held out his arms. A long moment</p><p>intervened. She took a trembling step </p><p>toward him, and stopped. </p><p> “Your—your father?” she whispered.</p><p> His head lifted pridefully.</p><p> “My father will rejoice with me, for he,</p><p>too, is a man.” </p><p> An instant longer she hesitated, and then</p><p>came all the way. </p><p>THE END </p><p>■to </p><p>10 </p><p>The Greai Foolishness </p><p>hij EuqeneBLyl&amp;iJjr </p><p>OME to think of it, John, Johann </p><p>and Jonathan Sam were cousins </p><p>—three great big fellows—and </p><p>they might have gotten along </p><p>very well together except for the woman. </p><p>But there was the woman—this woman </p><p>like a flame in the raw gold camp of Placer </p><p>Sands, where men didn’t go to law for what </p><p>they wanted but to the sagging bulge on </p><p>their hips. The gaudy jade had virtue, </p><p>which, strangely enough, was the trouble. </p><p>She wouldn’t let herself go easy. She let </p><p>it be understood around camp that only the </p><p>best man could get her, so there was that </p><p>question to be decided. </p><p> The woman was that kind. She wanted</p><p>trouble. Tribute of trouble was wine to </p><p>her red lips. She was the kind to stand </p><p>by while men fought for her. Men did it, </p><p>too; made ribbons of one another. Now </p><p>perhaps you begin to see her, rich in sex, in </p><p>animal magnificence, in sheer splendor of </p><p>the flesh — a strapping, stunning crea- </p><p>ture, slender and lithe and lazy. Her </p><p>mouth was a painted Cupid’s bow; a ver- </p><p>satile Cupid’s bow whipped by whim, petu- </p><p>lant, haughty, cruel or melting; and the </p><p>dark, smoky eyes were heavy with chal- </p><p>lenge and slumberous mystery. </p><p> Her name was Suprema, and she fitted</p><p>the name for all its crude genesis. In gilt- </p><p>shaded lettering on a patent-medicine label </p><p>the word had appealed to her mother’s </p><p>naive soul. The word was part of the </p><p>Spanish translation descriptive of the bot- </p><p>tled remedy. “Suprema!” It had a gor- </p><p>geous sound, irresistible as carmen and gold. </p><p>Enough—the babe was christened Suprema; </p><p>and Suprema the woman was of a glamor </p><p>to match. </p><p> Suprema couldn’t bother Jonathan Sam,</p><p>though—not yet, not very much. Jona- </p><p>than Sam liked to be care-free and wear a </p><p>cheerful grin under his tousled mop. Sam </p><p>wasn’t denying that the woman went to his </p><p>head when she came around and her per- </p><p>fumery was in the air. Just the same, she </p><p>was thirty-seven shades too resplendent in </p><p>the way of Egyptian bliss for Jonathan </p><p>Sam. He’d have something more home- </p><p>folksy for his, thank you. And besides,</p><p>what was the use? “Old Jock”—that was </p><p>John, though John wasn’t old, only big and </p><p>slow and florid, with a bald spot—old Jock </p><p>would get her anyway. </p><p> Old Jock more than shared his cousin</p><p>Sam’s prophetic feeling that he, Jock, would </p><p>be the one to get Suprema. Old Jock had </p><p>gotten much already because he knew, or </p><p>had known, how to use his fists. Thus it </p><p>was Jock, and not Sam nor yet Johann, </p><p>who had staked off the likeliest claims in </p><p>the first rush to Placer Sands. It was Jock </p><p>who had jumped other claims; who had </p><p>grabbed creek frontage right and left—and </p><p>God help the hindmost, including Johann! </p><p> Naturally, therefore, concerning the</p><p>camp’s ravishing trouble-maker, old Jock </p><p>took it for granted that when he beckoned </p><p>she’d come. It never penetrated his re- </p><p>doubtable skull that she had begun to look </p><p>at Johann; that her looks were mighty </p><p>provocative, too. And Jock neither saw </p><p>nor heard if she sighed forlorn and artful, </p><p>The Great Foolishness </p><p>147 </p><p> iust for Jonathan Sam to hear. But then</p><p>Jock couldn’t have felt any real hostility </p><p>toward Sam, anyway. </p><p> Toward Sam, Jock was more like an</p><p>older brother; an overbearing bull-headed </p><p>brother, and Jonathan Sam had riled and </p><p>swatted him for it once or twice, though </p><p>without any permanent hard feelings either </p><p>way. Those two never really took advan- </p><p>tage of one another, but without being </p><p>extra friendly, either, when it comes to that. </p><p> But about Johann, now—about the other</p><p>cousin—well, old Jock ought to have both- </p><p>ered, that’s all. He certainly ought. He </p><p>oughtn’t to have been bull-headed and </p><p>cocksure and blind as the under edge of a </p><p>stone wall where Johann figured into the </p><p>game. For while Jock was burly and soft, </p><p>Johann was burly and hard and getting </p><p>harder. Johann panned his own gravel in </p><p>the rapids all day, even though he liked </p><p>to smoke and be sociable of an evening, </p><p>and maybe get poetic about the volcano </p><p>dust in the sunset sky. </p><p> Johann might have seemed warmer-</p><p>hearted and more subject to honest grief or </p><p>mirth than stiff old Jock; but that was only </p><p>a part of the man that Johann was, and </p><p>perhaps a craftily calculated part. Sam </p><p>guessed it—there were woman notions back </p><p>in Cousin Johann’s blond, brooding head. </p><p> The three men would scarcely have</p><p>picked the same time for one of their </p><p>periodical hikes back to cities and civiliza- </p><p>tion. They certainly would have picked </p><p>one another for companions on the peril- </p><p>ous trek across desert and sierra. But </p><p>the woman was going too. Her swarthy </p><p>wanderer father, who dealt faro smiling a </p><p>fixed gleam of white teeth, had himself </p><p>cashed in, and the desolated daughter of </p><p>chance had smoothed smoother the tight </p><p>sash over her hips and expressed little won- </p><p>der but what she’d be moving on. </p><p> Lone temptresses, of course, did not move</p><p>on over a bone-dry wilderness so casual as </p><p>all that, but it appeared directly that John </p><p>was going back to bank his gold-dust and </p><p>Sam largely to blow his, and she mentioned </p><p>to Johann, laughing low, that she was going</p><p>with them. So Johann went also. Su- </p><p>prema knew then that the journey would </p><p>not be monotonous; she had so provided. </p><p> There were the four of them who went</p><p>and also a boy, besides pack-animals and </p><p>mounts. The boy was a sturdy, sober- </p><p>minded, industrious waif belonging to no- </p><p>body. He had a portable forge and he used </p><p>to sharpen the miner’s tools. But the forge </p><p>was packed on his little gray burro now. </p><p> At the end of their first day of tortuous</p><p>plodding, they were down among the foot- </p><p>hills, and the first night they camped beside </p><p>a mountain stream. The woman had a dog- </p><p>tent and quilted pads and Angora rugs, but </p><p>the three men and the boy bedded them- </p><p>selves under the stkrs. Johann, sullen </p><p>and suspicious, unrolled his blankets near </p><p>John’s. </p><p> Where they lay, and before sleep might</p><p>transport them safely hence, they could </p><p>hear the woman humming to herself in her 1 </p><p>tent. It was singularly disturbing. Her </p><p>nearness was a palpable tiling, and she was </p><p>not letting them forget it. The low notes </p><p>cuddled deeper in the pillow of silence, </p><p>sleep-laden, dreamy, dying. At last one </p><p>of the men threw off his blankets and stood </p><p>up. It was Johann. His blocked-out </p><p>figure strained toward the tent. The sil- </p><p>very blur of canvas was filmy, like a veil in </p><p>the soft haze. </p><p> “Man, lie down! What the -”</p><p>growled Old Jock. </p><p> Gruff Old Jock wanted to sleep. But</p><p>something peremptory was in his growl. </p><p>Johann jerked back his head and his hands </p><p>hardened into great sledge-like fists at his </p><p>side. But Johann did not know what </p><p>weapon John might have trained on him, </p><p>and he muttered a bit but subsided back </p><p>into his blankets just the same. </p><p> The next morning while John was trying</p><p>to stake his mule where it had other views </p><p>in the matter, he got a kick that put his </p><p>left arm in a sling. John swore it was </p><p>nothing, and sympathy only made him </p><p>madder, but Johann’s gaze lingered on the </p><p>bandaged arm with brooding earnestness. </p><p> Afterward, at breakfast, which was spread</p><p>on a fiat rock near the creek, Johann kept </p><p>near the woman. He was so persistent in </p><p>this that he might have been goading him- </p><p>self by each rustling movement of her body, </p><p>by the fragrance of her in each breath he </p><p>drew—goading himself on to some wild and </p><p>secret project. She was between him and </p><p>John, indolently snipping off bits of pone </p><p>crust with her even white teeth. </p><p> After a while, when it suited her mood,</p><p>she let Johann have the thrall of her big, </p><p>round, smoldering black eyes, and at the </p><p>same time she let her hand that was nearest </p><p>John come to rest over John’s hand. Then, </p><p>148 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>at the quick thickening of storm between </p><p>Johann’s brows, she lazily arched her own, </p><p>as if asking him in so many words what he </p><p>was going to do about it. </p><p>JOHANN’S cumbrous wits floun- </p><p>dered. He was maddened past en- </p><p>durance, and, yet he lacked provo- </p><p>cation. He had no call to attack John, </p><p>who hadn’t so much as noticed the woman’s </p><p>caress. But Johann tortured provocation </p><p>out of nothing. He slapped at a gnat, miss- </p><p>ing it, and his hand was cupped to slap </p><p>again when his frown focused on stolid, im- </p><p>pervious John. </p><p> “You object, eh?” Johann roared, thump-</p><p>ing his chest and jumping to his feet. </p><p> Johann could not pass behind the woman</p><p>to get at John because of the creek and its </p><p>treacherous sands at her back. So he had </p><p>to go around the camp-fire. But the boy </p><p>was in his way, squatted tailor-fashion by </p><p>the fire mending a broken cinch-buckle and </p><p>Johann lurched over the boy and then </p><p>kicked him in the side. The thud of it </p><p>turned Sam sick. </p><p> The boy staggered to his feet.</p><p> “You b-big bruiser!” the boy sobbed,</p><p>swaying where he stood; but with the long </p><p>rasp he had been using he belted Johann </p><p>across the knuckles and hurled it at him. </p><p> Even when Johann swept him under foot,</p><p>the boy wrapped his arms about the ankle </p><p>of Johann’s boot and held on. </p><p> But John—old Jock himself—was there</p><p>now. John had slipped his bandage and </p><p>had rushed to save the boy. John’s arm </p><p>was not broken, as Johann had hoped; but </p><p>big as John was—inches bigger every way </p><p>than thick-set Johann—he was soft and </p><p>clumsy and unbelievably dense. John just </p><p>shut his eyes and slugged. Jonathan Sam </p><p>could have wept for the old blunderhead. </p><p>The most tremendous body wallops rained </p><p>on old Jock only beat a grunt out of him. </p><p> At first Johann seemed surprised and dis-</p><p>concerted because John could not realize </p><p>that he was licked. Then it infuriated Johann</p><p>because John kept on. The boy was still </p><p>clinging to Johann’s boot, too; but Johann </p><p>savagely kicked himself loose, ran to the </p><p>fire, scooped up live coals in the frying-pan, </p><p>and dashed them in John’s face. John </p><p>fended with one arm across his eyes, blindly </p><p>groping with the other hand, whereupon </p><p>Johann leaped and bore him to the ground. </p><p>They rolled, snarling like jaguar cats. </p><p> Jonathan Sam gaped. What had started</p><p>this, anyway? Oh, yes, a gnat bite. Then </p><p>he saw the woman. </p><p> She was perched on a rock like some</p><p>beautiful valkyr above the obscene clamor, </p><p>waiting, waiting; and in that she was a </p><p>harpy, too, though damnably beautiful. </p><p>But this valkyr was not interested in the </p><p>souls of heroes, nor this harpy in any man’s </p><p>dead flesh. Rather was she the lioness </p><p>feigning unconcern. </p><p> As Jonathan Sam looked at her, and</p><p>thence to the two giants heaving and goug- </p><p>ing, he had a glimmer of horrified compre- </p><p>hension. Here was why Johann had toiled </p><p>at the sluices. Johann had been laying on </p><p>muscle, content to let John put on layers </p><p>of paunch. Sam marveled at the terrific </p><p>singleness of purpose behind Johann’s pa- </p><p>tient cunning. He stood aghast at dull, </p><p>unwieldly Johann obsessed by a dream of </p><p>winning Suprema and become this maniac </p><p>of swift destruction. </p><p> But Sam recalled times when Johann</p><p>had scowled at him, too, so that now Sam </p><p>distrusted Johann’s past friendliness. Ev- </p><p>erything once seeming decent and loyal </p><p>about Johann began to look like treacherous </p><p>calculation, and only Johann’s scowl was </p><p>honest stufi. Sam saw his own turn com- </p><p>ing next. Sam was lean and rangy, but </p><p>without training; Sam’s fists packed no </p><p>more punch than a sofa-pillow. Yet he </p><p>knew that he ought to pitch in, or Johann </p><p>would finish them off singly. Sam knew he </p><p>ought, yet it didn’t seem fair—two to one— </p><p>and he chose to stand by and let them fight </p><p>it out, which was a difficult business when </p><p>they jostled and sideswiped him, and mut- </p><p>tered abuse, if he yelled at them to be </p><p>careful. </p><p> The boy made it hardest. When Sam</p><p>thought of the look on that boy’s face, the </p><p>manhood in him cringed for shame. Why—</p><p>why—had he not rushed in when Johann </p><p>first drew back his boot? Well, Sam had </p><p>not believed that Johann could do it. </p><p>The thing itself had left him dazed. But if </p><p>it were to do over again ... If ... . </p><p> A hand was laid on his shoulder, and</p><p>Sam found the woman beside him. With a </p><p>little nestling movement she dovetailed her </p><p>fingers of both hands over his forearm. </p><p>Her gaze drifted to the two men beating </p><p>each other to pulp for her; then back again </p><p>up at Sam, and her brows arched in that </p><p>slow, questioning way of hers. </p><p>The Great Foolishness </p><p>149 </p><p> Sam twisted his arm free.</p><p> “I know that stuff! You handed it to</p><p>Johann,” he cried roughly. </p><p> She laughed. His anger was “score one”</p><p>for her. </p><p> ■'‘Your chance, boy—baby!” she mocked.</p><p>“And,” she whispered, “there won’t maybe </p><p>never come another.” </p><p> Sam frowned the blacker because his pulse</p><p>leaped. He understood her all right. Let </p><p>him now clean up Johann, and with John a </p><p>wreck, who was there left to interest the </p><p>lady? Who but Jonathan Sam? </p><p> But he was brought out of that by a</p><p>groan that could not be quite smothered. </p><p>He caught the woman by the arm. </p><p> “That boy lying there, go to him! What’s</p><p>the matter with you anyway—you, a </p><p>woman? Don’t you see he’s hurt?” </p><p> Her smoky eyes rounded wonderingly,</p><p>and Sam pushed her aside and ran to the </p><p>boy. With water from the creek in his </p><p>hat he bathed the boy’s white, twitching </p><p>face and tried to wash out the jagged </p><p>gashes. From the bottom of a constricted </p><p>heart Jonathan Sam cursed Johann. The </p><p>woman came and stood over him and </p><p>watched him curiously at his ministrations </p><p>as one watches the devotee of a strange cult. </p><p>Tenderness toward the weak was a strange </p><p>cult for Suprema. </p><p> Sam looked up; not at her, but at the</p><p>two men. There had been a pause in the </p><p>struggle while John and Johann lay wheez- </p><p>ing for breath, each with fingers grappled </p><p>in the other’s shirt. Now they had started </p><p>again. With each buckling up of the two </p><p>bodies Johann always strained to throw </p><p>his weight in the direction of the creek. </p><p>His purpose was clear. Once at the brink, </p><p>he would suddenly break all holds and </p><p>thrust John over. The quicksands would </p><p>finish John. On they went, John cran- </p><p>ing his neck to snatch a glimpse of where </p><p>they were bound. Once, for a second, </p><p>Sam caught John’s eye, bloodshot and </p><p>desperate.</p><p> “Aye, Jock,” Sam shouted, “these are</p><p>stirrous times, old dear!” </p><p> Over they thumped again, Johann be-</p><p>neath ; but in the instant of going over him- </p><p>self, John flung out a leg, dug his heel into </p><p>the ground and dropped athwart Johann’s </p><p>chest. With his hands and his weight on </p><p>top, he clamped Johann’s shoulders down </p><p>upon the camp-fire’s patch of live coals just </p><p>beneath. Johann ripped forth a howl, and </p><p>became a frenzy of flopping and agony and </p><p>astonishment. He had overlooked the </p><p>patch of live coals in his path. But old </p><p>Jock had not. </p><p> During an anxious moment Sam hoped</p><p>that Johann might now be scorched back </p><p>into decent citizenship. But not for long </p><p>could John smother down the whale-like </p><p>heaving under him. John was bucked off </p><p>at last, and only by a split second got to </p><p>his feet first. Johann made for the creek, </p><p>and frantically doused water over his burns. </p><p>But John was coming, and Johann did not </p><p>wait. Snatching up a canteen, passing the </p><p>woman on the way, who met his insane </p><p>glare with a Mona Lisa smile, Johann </p><p>scrambled up the steep face of the nearest </p><p>cliff, showering his pursuer under a land- </p><p>slide of rock and gravel. He dropped be- </p><p>hind a ledge, and gave himself over to nurs- </p><p>ing his wounds. </p><p>JOHN came back, battered and </p><p>weary, but with a stubborn light in </p><p>his eye. Among their dunnage he </p><p>found first Johann’s cartridge belt and pis- </p><p>tol and then his own. Johann’s pistol he </p><p>tossed into the creek. His own he aimed </p><p>and fired twice. At each shot one of </p><p>Johann’s two pack-mules dropped as if all </p><p>four legs were cut away by a scythe. </p><p> Johann came pounding down from his</p><p>refuge. </p><p> “What do you mean by that?” he roared.</p><p>“What do you mean by that?” </p><p> “I’m meaning a fight,” said John grimly,</p><p>“a fair fight.” </p><p> “Fair?” screeched Johann. “You call it</p><p>fair, killing my mules? How’ll I tote grub </p><p>enough? You want to starve me—that’s</p><p>it—starve me!” </p><p> John nodded his hard head.</p><p> “Yes,” said John, “that’s it. And while</p><p>you are starving some, I’ll be hardening up, </p><p>and that way we’ll both work around to an </p><p>even-Steven condition for the finish. I sup- </p><p>pose you understand, Johann, that it’s got </p><p>to go to a finish now.” </p><p> But Johann screeched some more about</p><p>starving, and shrugged his shoulders. Jo- </p><p>hann needn’t starve, John reminded him. </p><p>It was only a day back to Placer Sands; </p><p>Johann could go on back there. </p><p> At that the woman laughed, and Johann</p><p>looked and saw that she was looking at him. </p><p>The slow smile was creeping about her lips. </p><p>Johann could go back and not starve; but </p><p>150 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>she would not go back with him. To go </p><p>back was to give her up. Johann turned </p><p>again on him. </p><p> “I’ll whip you now!” he yelled, coming</p><p>at John. “I’U whip you on a full stomach!” </p><p> John’s overstrained tendons jerked his</p><p>knees as he tried to get set. </p><p> “All right—waiting for you,” he said.</p><p> “Game old rooster!” Sam murmured af-</p><p>fectionately. </p><p> That he was not soon a gone one was due</p><p>to no lack of deadly purpose in Johann’s </p><p>seething ferocity. But Johann’s knuckles </p><p>were raw from the boy’s rasp, and the great </p><p>driving muscles down his back were drawn </p><p>and stiffening from his bums. Each smash- </p><p>ing blow he dealt cost him a fiercer wrench </p><p>of pain. Only his maniacal fury kept him </p><p>at it, and at that he twisted his slobbered </p><p>mouth into frightful grimaces with some </p><p>desperate fee-faw-fum notion of scaring </p><p>John into a blue funk. But John went right </p><p>on wildly pummeling and talcing what </p><p>came. </p><p> In the end—for there’s no need to cata-</p><p>log the buffets of the exhausted giants— </p><p>they were half-kneeling, half-crouching on </p><p>the ground, each holding the other off. </p><p>Thus they glared eye to eye out of puffed </p><p>lids, their huge arched chests laboring, until </p><p>they fell apart. They lay as they fell, eyes </p><p>distended and wary. </p><p> The woman sighed and shrugged her</p><p>shoulders and went back to her tent. </p><p> The little caravan did not continue its</p><p>journey that day. Jonathan Sam did not </p><p>reflect that he might, perhaps, have gone on </p><p>alone with Suprema. Instead he would </p><p>wait for his cousins until they could travel. </p><p>And he would not leave the boy. Of the </p><p>woman Suprema he was not observably </p><p>thinking at all. She was both indignant </p><p>and puzzled. She couldn’t figure him out. </p><p>What was it they called it in the vegetable </p><p>world when some cabbage or other jumped </p><p>the reservation? Oh, yes—a sport. Well, </p><p>Jonathan Sam was a sport—that kind.</p><p>Yes, and he was a vegetable, too! </p><p> But Sam knew the perils to the lone</p><p>traveler in the arid waste they had yet to </p><p>cross. They would all need each other; </p><p>badly, too. Sam cursed Johann again when </p><p>he thought of the desert. He almost cursed </p><p>the woman. It was up to him to stay sane, </p><p>to get them all safely across. </p><p> They stayed where they were that day</p><p>and that night. John slept with his pistol </p><p>under his hand, his stuff about him, his </p><p>horse and mule staked near, and he tried to </p><p>sleep with one bad eye half-open. But </p><p>when he awoke at dawn he perceived Jo- </p><p>hann loading a gray burro. </p><p> “That’s my jack!” cried the boy. “And</p><p>he stole my grub-sack, too!” </p><p> “Look here, Jo,” said Sam, “the child’s</p><p>got to eat.” </p><p> “Is that so?” retorted Johann.</p><p> “He can’t walk, either,” said Sam, “the</p><p>way you beat him up.” </p><p> “Serves him right, the meddling brat!”</p><p>sneered Johann. </p><p> John aimed his pistol.</p><p> “Sorry, lad,” said John, but he fired</p><p>and dropped the gray burro dead. “Sorry,” </p><p>he repeated, but Johann had to be licked, </p><p>which was the sole issue and consideration </p><p>with John. </p><p> “Quit your worrying, kid,” said Sam,</p><p>“I’ve got plenty.” </p><p> Which was true. With his usual luck,</p><p>Sam had six burros besides his saddle-mule. </p><p>The burros had been left on his hands by </p><p>two prospectors whom he had grub- </p><p>staked. </p><p> “Let you ride the mule, too,” Sam added.</p><p>“Meant to hoof it anyway. It’s time—” he </p><p>glanced at Johann striding toward them— </p><p>“high time I was hardening up some, tam- </p><p>bien.” </p><p> Johann’s manner when he came was a sur-</p><p>prise, for there was an ingratiating smile </p><p>upon his discolored lips. </p><p> “Like to earn some dust, Sammy?” he</p><p>asked. </p><p> Sam nodded.</p><p> “Always,” he said.</p><p> “Then see here, suppose you distribute</p><p>my stuff around on these jacks of yours? </p><p>I’d—I’d pay you, pay you right now, </p><p>Sammy.” </p><p> Sam pondered.</p><p> “All right,” he said. “Four ounces per</p><p>day per hundred. But Jo—you’ll have </p><p>to deliver the freight.” </p><p> “That’s all right,” said Johann. “I’ll</p><p>go get it.” </p><p> Johann ran to the dead burro, and swung</p><p>its pack to his own shoulder. But he was </p><p>not half-way back when John put a bullet </p><p>between his feet. </p><p> “I’ll line out the next one higher,” said</p><p>John. </p><p> Johann dropped the pack and shook his</p><p>fist, yelling: </p><p>The Great Foolishness </p><p>151 </p><p> “Sam’s got something to say about that.</p><p>Sam knows he’s got a right to freight </p><p>goods-” </p><p> “Hold on,” Sam interrupted, “I don’t see</p><p>any to freight.” </p><p> “Isn’t this here any ? ” demanded</p><p>Johann. </p><p> “Not unless you deliver it.”</p><p> “And let that claim-jumper pot me?”</p><p>Johann raged. </p><p> “That’s not my affair,” said Sam. “If</p><p>it was you with the pistol, you could see </p><p>that for yourself.” </p><p> Johann’s ingratiating smile was entirely</p><p>gone now. </p><p> “Huh, I get you,” he sneered bitterly.</p><p>“I get you—you’re in with John! You’re </p><p>in with him, or scared of him!” </p><p> “Deliver the freight and I’ll pack it,”</p><p>repeated Sam. “But don’t expect me to </p><p>take John’s gun away from him.” </p><p> “All right,” said Johann, “all right. But</p><p>wait—that’s all—wait—and remember!” </p><p>He spat to underscore his threat, and </p><p>wiped his hand across his mouth. Then </p><p>he dragged back the pack and sorted out </p><p>what he would carry and burned what he </p><p>must leave behind. The latter included </p><p>much that he had stolen from the boy. </p><p> With the heat of the day they were out</p><p>of the foothills and halted beside the last </p><p>pool of the dwindling stream from which it </p><p>was possible to dip water. Beyond lay a </p><p>sage-pocked waste, rimmed by a copper </p><p>horizon. They rested here till night, filling </p><p>canteens, water-skins and Sam’s six empty </p><p>kegs; but an hour after sundown found </p><p>them moving through a luminous haze like </p><p>lavender and stardust in solution, threading </p><p>their course among endless purpled clumps </p><p>of brush and yucca. </p><p> The woman rode in the lead. She was</p><p>mounted palfrey-fashion on a tireless little</p><p>mustang. Behind her plodded her string </p><p>of pack-horses, burdened mostly with the </p><p>regalia accessory to her lure. She was </p><p>humming her song again, and especially </p><p>was it like a siren’s song as the men followed </p><p>her into the trackless wilderness. Often </p><p>she looked back, at first hopefully, then in </p><p>haughty petulance. The first of the men </p><p>was Jonathan Sam. Sam leaned against </p><p>his mule as he walked, so as to hold the </p><p>sick boy in the saddle. Sam might have </p><p>been walking beside Suprema, of course. </p><p>Undeniably she was at sea regarding </p><p>Sam. </p><p>BEHIND Sam’s outfit came John’s </p><p>saddle-horse and pack-mule, and </p><p>after them trudged big John him- </p><p>self. At times John rode, but according as </p><p>his big, soft, bruised body would let him, </p><p>resolutely he walked. Old Jock was in </p><p>training now. Using his pistol for menace, </p><p>he jealously guarded the distance between </p><p>his mule with its precious burden of food and </p><p>water and the bent, solitary figure of Johann. </p><p> All that Johann had of food, he carried on</p><p>his back, and a bulging water-skin atop of </p><p>that. Even so, Johann carried other weight, </p><p>which was neither food nor drink. Strung </p><p>to his belt hung small canvas sacks, round </p><p>and tight as cannon-balls and as heavy. </p><p>Nuggets and dust were in them, his clean-up </p><p>at Placer Sands. The sacks swayed gently, </p><p>touching; then one slipped its thong </p><p>and dropped. But Johann checked an </p><p>impulse to kneel and salvage the scattered </p><p>dust. Already he knew that in time he </p><p>must jettison all the gold. </p><p> He fingered the hasp of a hunting-knife</p><p>in its sheath. Imperceptibly he lengthened </p><p>his stride, bringing him slowly nearer to the </p><p>moving shadow there ahead, which was </p><p>John’s mule. </p><p> When the first rays streaked the east and</p><p>the mystery of stardust and lavender had </p><p>changed to a gray desolation, John stopped </p><p>to fill his canteen from the water-skin on </p><p>his mule. But the tumorous-like bag had </p><p>gone flat during the night. Through a slit </p><p>in the hide, the water had drained. A </p><p>hunting-knife—Johann’s—lay between two </p><p>grub-sacks beneath the collapsed water- </p><p>skin. Without a word John hurled himself </p><p>on Johann. </p><p> Johann went down, but parrying with</p><p>one arm, he slipped off his pack-straps and </p><p>labored to his feet. Although John’s ter- </p><p>rific punches lacked steam, it was apparent </p><p>that the first margin of difference between </p><p>the two adversaries had narrowed. </p><p> Sam, hurrying back to them, stopped short</p><p>to stare at something else—something half- </p><p>hidden behind a cactus—a dirty grayish </p><p>head with pointed ears and lolling red </p><p>tongue. The beast’s eyes, intent and </p><p>cunning, were on the weakening combat- </p><p>ants. Sam had a feeling that other gray </p><p>forms infested the sage, and at a sound </p><p>behind him he clapped his hand to his pis- </p><p>tol. But it was only the woman who had </p><p>ridden up behind him and was quietly </p><p>laughing at him. </p><p>152 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “I see,” said Sam, getting mad, “you</p><p>aren’t scared of wolves, then?” </p><p> “Dear me, no,” she laughed. “It’s up</p><p>to you—the three of you—to save me from </p><p>them, isn’t it?” </p><p> “And a job for the three of us at that,”</p><p>Sam retorted. “But look at ’em—the </p><p>comedians! They think they’re fighting </p><p>for you. They haven’t the sense to see </p><p>they’re fighting to give you to the wolves. </p><p>You certainly ought to feel right compli- </p><p>mented, ma’am.” </p><p> The warriors had milled the alkali sand</p><p>ankle-deep, and grappled weakly. It was </p><p>another deadlock. They stumbled apart. </p><p>“Water!” gasped John. “Water—Sam!” </p><p>Sam slung off his canteen. But instantly </p><p>Johann twisted a bleeding fist under his </p><p>nose. </p><p> “Don’t you, Sam!” Johann protested.</p><p>“Without water, this big bruiser is licked, </p><p>and you keep clear, Sam! You keep out!” </p><p>“But I’m selling it,” argued Sam. “How </p><p>about it, Jock? I’m here to sell water at </p><p>one ounce of dust per one pint of water!” </p><p> John nodded and took the canteen. -</p><p>the price! </p><p> “All right, then,” said Johann; “that’s</p><p>all right, but providing you sell me grub, </p><p>too, when I need it.” </p><p> “Sure,” said Sam; “come to me when you</p><p>need grub, and I’ll sell it.” </p><p> “Yes,” mumbled big John, “but he’ll not</p><p>come to you, Sam. When he tries it, I’ll </p><p>wing him.” </p><p> Johann scowled from one to another.</p><p>“Eh-heh!” he burst forth with vehement </p><p>blasphemy. “I knew it! More of your </p><p>rotten fairness! The dirty two of you are </p><p>in cahoots to murder me!” </p><p> But Sam protested.</p><p> “This here shop,” he said, “is open to</p><p>all comers. But you’ve got to be a comer.</p><p>If some hombre with a gun keeps another </p><p>hombre from coming, that’s not my fault.” </p><p>“Eh-heh! Eh-heh!” said Johann, mouth- </p><p>ing threats with his oaths as he got back </p><p>into the galling harness of his pack. </p><p> When again they stopped, Johann’s pack</p><p>looked somewhat smaller. Not to be left </p><p>behind, not to let the woman pass on for- </p><p>ever, and to hoard his present strength </p><p>against his rival, Johann had begun to </p><p>throw over his future sustenance. </p><p> But John, for his part, was likewise be-</p><p>ginning to pay. That same night John </p><p>could not drag his horse to its feet. At no </p><p>price would Sam risk depleting his own </p><p>store of water for John’s horse and mule. </p><p>The mule must soon be abandoned, too, </p><p>since the next water-hole was yet five </p><p>marches distant. They had not gone far </p><p>when behind them they heard the wolves </p><p>snapping and yelping about the horse that </p><p>could not rise. </p><p> Five nights later they still had not reached</p><p>the water-hole. Now, the morning after, </p><p>although the sun was high and the heat </p><p>waves like the breath of a furnace, they </p><p>were pushing on in stricken haste, all of </p><p>them except Johann. The gaunt figure of </p><p>emaciation that Johann had become was </p><p>no longer numbered among them. </p><p> “His tracks,” said John, pointing, “th—</p><p>they-” </p><p> Sam nodded. When he opened his</p><p>mouth, the air burned it dry. Already </p><p>John’s tongue was getting black. Except </p><p>the boy, they all labored on foot under a </p><p>pack now, even the luxurious Suprema. </p><p>The boy drooped over the saddle-horn of </p><p>Sam’s mule, and Sam’s mule was the only </p><p>animal left. </p><p> The tracks they followed were of one</p><p>who went heavily, whose feet dragged. </p><p>Yet the tracks ran mostly straight, or if </p><p>they weaved from the line, they quickly </p><p>straightened out again. The pursuers could </p><p>not cease to marvel at the indomitable will </p><p>of the man. </p><p> “He was the first to fall last night,” per-</p><p>sisted John. </p><p> Latterly they had been making camp</p><p>where the first among them fell. Last </p><p>night it had been Johann, but this morning </p><p>when they awoke they had found him gone. </p><p>Greater than fatigue, an insensate purpose </p><p>drove the man. </p><p>“I tell you,” cried Sam, “he wants to get </p><p>there first to fill his water-skin. You mightn’t </p><p>let him, you with your gun. What else?” </p><p>John touched his tongue to his fiery lips. </p><p>“Then what are we hiking after him like </p><p>- for?” </p><p>“God, Jock, he wouldn’t! He wouldn’t!” </p><p>“Wouldn’t? Sam, if you don’t know the </p><p>skut yet-” </p><p> “But he’d need dynamite—giant-powder.</p><p>He couldn’t wreck that water-hole unless he </p><p>had-” </p><p> “Yes, he could, if he’s got plenty of time.</p><p>Just with rocks he could-” </p><p> “Hurry, then! We haven’t a full canteen</p><p>left. Take the girl’s other arm. She-” </p><p>The Great Foolishness </p><p>153 </p><p> She was about all in, as to that. But</p><p>note that Jonathan Sam thought of her now </p><p>as the girl, not as the woman. The change </p><p>dated from about the time she began leav- </p><p>ing off her perfumery. Her regalia was </p><p>back there, too, strapped to the skeletons </p><p>of her pack-horses, long since picked clean </p><p>by the wolves. Suprema the opulent and </p><p>barbaric had come down in the world along </p><p>with those who would win her. And she </p><p>had left off the animal lure as well. It had </p><p>Sam backed to the guards. </p><p> “I declare, Sue,” he burst out, after deep</p><p>pondering, “I don’t get you at all, any </p><p>more!” </p><p> Surprise as much as a hummock of dust</p><p>made her stumble. Half-jeeringly he had </p><p>used to call her “Miss Supremacy.” Now it </p><p>was “Sue.” Moreover, she liked “Sue” </p><p>better, and she wouldn’t have before. </p><p> “How, Sam? In what way?” Her tone</p><p>was eager. </p><p> “How in thunder should I know? But</p><p>you seem—well, somehow—cleaner.” </p><p> AT THE word, the crimson swept</p><p>into her burned cheeks. But a </p><p>swift glanced showed her that he </p><p>was entirely serious. Cleaner? Well, it </p><p>did sound like a joke, when she looked down </p><p>at herself—a disheveled thing in grimy </p><p>khaki blouse and skirt who plowed along </p><p>somehow in a cloud of whitish-yellow dust. </p><p> She thought of scented baths, of the lost</p><p>softness of her skin, the one-time rounded </p><p>fulness of her slender body, the clinging </p><p>enticements of gossamer weave and but- </p><p>terfly tints, and the sensuous ease of her </p><p>blood lazily coursing. And now Jonathan </p><p>thought her . . . She laughed, and it was </p><p>a queer kind of laugh. But that was be- </p><p>cause she had his meaning, which was more </p><p>than Sam did himself. </p><p> “Sam,” she said, and hesitated. “Any-</p><p>way, Sam, I hope you are right. I—I hope </p><p>I am.” </p><p> He started at the yearning in her voice.</p><p> But his mule had stopped stiff-kneed in</p><p>its tracks, head down, body gently weaving. </p><p>As Sam reached for the boy in the saddle </p><p>the mule’s forelocks curled backward and </p><p>it was down—finished. </p><p> “More of the same,” sounded John’s</p><p>cavernous rumble. “Lump o’ Rock already </p><p>in sight, too!” </p><p> Sam grimly waved John on. His trained</p><p>eye had also marked where the slate-green </p><p>of the yucca trees was possibly a little higher </p><p>and a little thicker—meager promise of an </p><p>oasis and water. </p><p> John nodded and stalked on alone.</p><p>Johann would be at the water-hole already </p><p>—had been there, perhaps, with time enough </p><p>to do the thing they feared. </p><p> Sam ran, overtook John, and gave him</p><p>his canteen. </p><p> “All, Jock! Drink it all! Get there</p><p>quicker—go!” </p><p> John tilted the canteen to his lips, but</p><p>did not stop. Sam turned back to Suprema </p><p>and the boy. Behind them, in among the </p><p>sage, he saw ghostly gray scavengers sniff- </p><p>ing toward the fallen mule. But there </p><p>would be no more carcasses to stay them, </p><p>that is, unless .... </p><p> Sam’s lean face was hard and drawn as</p><p>he hastened back. He steadied the boy, </p><p>and would have helped Suprema as before, </p><p>but she shook her head impatiently and </p><p>put herself on the boy’s other side to help </p><p>with him. Her act in doing this brought </p><p>back Sam’s perplexity. </p><p> “What’s this new stuff of yours, anyway,</p><p>Sue?” he demanded. “Have you gotten </p><p>human, or what?” </p><p> “I don’t know, Sam, what it is,” she said.</p><p>She was as helpless in her own bewilder- </p><p>ment about it as a child. </p><p> There was a silence as they fared on in</p><p>the torrid glare. </p><p> “After all, Sam,” she began again with a</p><p>strange shyness upon her, “after all, it’s </p><p>only fifty-fifty. You had me bothered, too,</p><p>Sam. Oh, but not any more. No, because </p><p>I got it at last.” </p><p> “It—what?”</p><p> “Of course,” she said, “your being out</p><p>for yourself—that was perfectly intelligible </p><p>to me. It’s what makes all of you as legible </p><p>as—as the ‘one’ on a dollar bill.” </p><p> Out for himself? When Sam thought</p><p>what he had charged poor old Jock for </p><p>water, for freight, for riding a donkey, he </p><p>blushed to the back of his neck. He had </p><p>Jock’s dust to the last sack, now safely </p><p>cached with his own beside the trail. He </p><p>had back his treasury stock, which canny </p><p>old Jock had once bought of him. He held </p><p>as security a block of shares in Jock’s own </p><p>claims, for now it was Jock who owed him, </p><p>and not he Jock. These transactions had </p><p>been most gratifying. </p><p> “Yes,” Suprema went on, rather drearily,</p><p>“your selling water at ten times its weight </p><p>154 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>in gold was quite comprehensible, but your </p><p>giving it away, giving it to the boy—Jona- </p><p>than Sam, that had me stumped for fair!” </p><p>Sam’s grit-laden brows knitted. He re- </p><p>membered surprising her puzzled eyes on him </p><p>as if he were a bug or a celebrity. Usually </p><p>it had been when he was doing something </p><p>for the boy and not thinking of her at all. </p><p> “I don’t suppose,” she said in a faintly</p><p>rueful tone of reproach, “you ever did get </p><p>a girl so pestered, or ever will again. You </p><p>certainly were one continuing riddle, Sam.” </p><p>“Riddle, eh? Well, what’s the answer?” </p><p>“The answer? Why,” she cried, “it was </p><p>that simple I couldn’t see it. It was only </p><p>that maybe you weren’t out entirely for </p><p>yourself after all. Sam, it was something </p><p>so clean, stark, staggering new to me that— </p><p>that-” </p><p> “Wait!”</p><p> Under the merciless ball of fire hung in</p><p>the sky, the boy had gently sighed and gone </p><p>limp between them. With a swift back- </p><p>ward glance for wolves, Sam lifted the frail </p><p>bundle across his shoulder and kept on. </p><p>The woman’s eyes slowly filled, but they </p><p>were not puzzled, not any more. He looked </p><p>down at her. Yes, she was crying. </p><p> “Strength,” he heard her saying,</p><p>“strength,” like a bitter refrain. “How I </p><p>have worshipped it—just strength—always </p><p>—and I never knew what it really was! </p><p>And when I did understand—Sam, Sam, it </p><p>was too—too gorgeous for me all at once. </p><p>And then—God knows I’m not mushy, </p><p>Sam, and more’s the pity, but—well, it </p><p>choked me up, and—and you can call it </p><p>new stuff if—if you must, Jonathan Sam.” </p><p>He was filled with sheer wonderment. </p><p> “I reckon,” he said, “you’ll have to try</p><p>to forgive me, Sue. Lord help me, how </p><p>was I to know you’d change so?” </p><p> “Changed?” she cried. She brushed back</p><p>flying ends of hair to look at him. “You </p><p>think so, Sam? Oh, maybe it’s true, then! </p><p>Maybe—maybe I’ll make the shore yet!” </p><p>“If any of us do, Sue.” </p><p> “You mean the—wolves? If the wolves</p><p>don’t stop us, don’t 3'ou?” </p><p> The wolves, yes. But there was Johann</p><p>first. In his mind’s eye Sam saw again a </p><p>thin ribbon of water trickling down the face </p><p>of a rock, slowly filling a shallow basin of </p><p>stone. He imagined some haggard desert- </p><p>rat crawling to that thread of life, but to </p><p>find the basin shattered, the seam of the </p><p>rock a gaping fissure, and the flow rising </p><p>no higher than the sand. And now a maniac </p><p>in his despair and his hatred of his fellow- </p><p>beings was at that shrine of existence— </p><p>there alone, frenzied, resourceful. There </p><p>alone, unless old Jock reached him in </p><p>time! </p><p> “Make it or perish! Make it or perish!”</p><p>Sam’s heart beat the taps. </p><p> But just because of the lengthening odds</p><p>Sam’s zest for the dizzy gamble of life was </p><p>whetted to a keener edge. His crushing </p><p>burden, pain, and the torture of effort— </p><p>none of it could down the eternal buoyancy </p><p>of gay adventure in Jonathan Sam. </p><p> In the arid, endless grove of sage, Lump</p><p>o’ Rock grew well defined at last, a craggy </p><p>dorsal reef in a drab, dead, scum-strewn </p><p>Sargasso sea. A mountain had thrust its </p><p>peak through the sand to become one more </p><p>synonym in the vocabulary of hope. </p><p> They were close to it, so close that to</p><p>Sam’s vigilant ears came the crackle of </p><p>twigs tramped under foot. Of the cause, </p><p>however, he saw nothing. A chute ran up </p><p>into the rock; cactus and desert-grass were </p><p>thick on it, and behind the tangled fringe </p><p>some sort of struggle was going on. </p><p> Sam dropped off his pack, and carrying</p><p>the boy, labored on. The girl fell behind—■ </p><p>vaguely he knew that she stumbled. With </p><p>head down, he fought the undertow of sand </p><p>between him and the rock. He heard stac- </p><p>cato gasps and his thought was that even </p><p>yet he might be in time, when—not in front </p><p>but back of him—a shriek of terror jerked </p><p>taut every nerve in him. </p><p>HE WHIRLED, pistol drawn, una- </p><p>ware that he had let the boy slip to </p><p>the ground. He beheld Suprema </p><p>running toward him, her arms raised. Close</p><p>beside her a wolf ran leaping at her throat, </p><p>snapping its jaws. Farther back, sniffing </p><p>and cautious but huddling for the rush, </p><p>crouched the dirty-gray pack of wolves. </p><p>The hem of the girl’s dress caught on a </p><p>broken stalk of cactus. Dragging it, she </p><p>went down on one knee. Her arms as she </p><p>fell she hel d outstretched toward Sam. There </p><p>was an instant when the animal’s forepaws </p><p>were on her skirt; when, also, Sam fired in </p><p>air. The pack broke, scattering, vanish- </p><p>ing among the sage, their leader last. </p><p> The girl’s right sleeve hung in ribbons</p><p>from the shoulder, and her white arm </p><p>passed ’round the man’s neck as he stooped </p><p>and swept her to her feet and held her. </p><p>The Great Foolishness </p><p>155 </p><p> “You are my girl!” he said. “My girl—</p><p>do you hear?” </p><p> Her arm tightened about his neck.</p><p> “Sam, it was you from the first,” she in-</p><p>formed him; “but I could not make you </p><p>so much as try to get me—you—the strong- </p><p>est and dearest!” </p><p> “The strongest?” he echoed in scorn.</p><p>“H’m, just so.” </p><p> His scorn was for himself, because he</p><p>alone could not bring her safely through. </p><p>He needed big John. He might do without </p><p>Johann, but he did need big John, or Su- </p><p>prema and all of them would go down be- </p><p>fore the wolves. Which was reason enough </p><p>why John and Johann’s glorious orgy of </p><p>mayhem should come to an end. </p><p> But they were still at it, John and Jo-</p><p>hann. Sam had forgotten. The girl’s </p><p>peril had made him forget. But this was </p><p>her peril, too. He put an arm about her </p><p>and together they lurched and buffeted </p><p>through the sand toward the water-hole. </p><p> This time no sound rose from behind the</p><p>matted growth, no trampling of brush, nor </p><p>hard-drawn gasps. The stillness was omi- </p><p>nous and ghostly. They found the gap, </p><p>a threshold packed hard by the converging </p><p>tracks of desert prowlers. The half-shaded </p><p>place into which they stumbled was as still </p><p>as a church. But they did not think of that. </p><p>Water was all their thought. On the first </p><p>mouthful to burning membranes their souls </p><p>were centered. Their gaze sought the face </p><p>of the rock at the end of the chute. There </p><p>they should see a tiny pool in a basin of </p><p>stone. Then realization petrified them in </p><p>their tracks. They remembered. Johann! </p><p>Johann had been there! </p><p> Of him they saw nothing. Nor of John.</p><p>But of Johann’s handiwork there was that </p><p>which figured death—their own. The face </p><p>of the rock, for a height of two feet and as </p><p>wide, was broken down, the debris filling </p><p>the hollowed stone at the base. Johann </p><p>must have had dynamite! And yet the </p><p>hole in the rock did not look like a “shot.” </p><p>On his knees, groping for a trace of moist-</p><p>ure that might betray the rock’s severed </p><p>artery, Sam threw out first a cold chisel </p><p>and then a farrier’s hammer? Now where </p><p>on the desert had Johann picked up a cold </p><p>chisel and a farrier’s hammer? Sam recog- </p><p>nized them. They had belonged to the </p><p>boy. Johann had found them in the boy’s </p><p>kit; had foreseen his need of them here. </p><p>Food and gold Johann had cast away, but </p><p>tools for cutting the life-thread of his fel- </p><p>low creatures were more precious to him. </p><p>Sam brought his hand out dry, and looked </p><p>up at the girl. Now that they knew the </p><p>end, a warping grin twisted his mouth. </p><p> He wondered, though, at the way her</p><p>eyes widened. He wondered what she was </p><p>staring at. Suddenly he thought he under- </p><p>stood, for he thought she was going mad. </p><p>Well, maybe it was better. Better for her, </p><p>poor kid! One arm she held partly raised, </p><p>extended downward. The hand quivered </p><p>from the wrist like a leaf, yet he knew she </p><p>was pointing, pointing down at him. Her </p><p>lips, cracked and flecked with dried blood, </p><p>were parted, and her slack jaw trembled. </p><p>Suddenly— </p><p> “Water!” she screamed, and slued over</p><p>upon him in a heap. </p><p> He gathered her to him with a bitter and</p><p>defiant tenderness. But gradually he be- </p><p>came aware that her mouth was pressed </p><p>against his shoulder, that it was held there </p><p>and when he felt a fold of the cloth drawn </p><p>between her teeth, in a kind of pitying hor- </p><p>ror he forced back her head. Then, he </p><p>too, stared. Her lips were wet—freshly </p><p>wet! He frowned deeply, with angry </p><p>concentration. He must not hope—it was </p><p>too dangerous. But why were her lips wet </p><p>like that? He put his hand to his shoulder. </p><p>The cloth was wet, too; cool and wet, so it </p><p>was not perspiration. But what had made </p><p>it wet? What had he been doing to make </p><p>it wet? Well, he had been groping in the </p><p>rock. He did it again, and noted that the </p><p>point of his shoulder was jammed against </p><p>the upper edge of the little cave. </p><p> “God,” he murmured, “God grant--”</p><p> And, daring all, he laid the palm of his</p><p>hand on the rock where his shoulder had </p><p>pressed. At once moisture gathered be- </p><p>tween his fingers. He removed his hand.</p><p>A narrow ribbon of water, so thin that it </p><p>was scarcely a film, coursed down the face </p><p>of the rock. At the edge of the rock it </p><p>fell drop by drop. So, after all, the mur- </p><p>derous beast, Johann, had not tunneled in </p><p>deep enough to cut the fine ascending </p><p>thread! Johann had again clumsily mis- </p><p>calculated. </p><p> “Sue,” he whispered. “It’s all right!”</p><p> He plunged his hand into the debris.</p><p>The fragments of rock were flooded. The </p><p>stone basin was intact! They had only </p><p>to clean out the basin, and wait while the </p><p>drops fell one by one. </p><p>156 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> But why wait? Let them find Johann’s</p><p>water-skin and canteen, which naturally </p><p>Johann must have filled before beginning </p><p>his labor of destruction. </p><p> Canteen and water-skin, and both</p><p>filled, they did find after a little search </p><p>within the fringe of brush; but at that spot </p><p>they stood and gazed down on Johann and </p><p>John lying there—yes, and also the boy. </p><p> The three still forms lying there were un-</p><p>speakably horrid because they were human. </p><p>Had they been stuffed lay figures for the </p><p>setting of a desert picture, they would have </p><p>been only grotesque. As it was, they were </p><p>too grotesquely hideous for reality. They </p><p>were too wildly disordered, too shrunken of </p><p>flesh and protuberant of bone; the coating'of </p><p>alkali dust was too spectral; the caked, fes- </p><p>tered wounds were too natural—as a wax- </p><p>works horror they overreached. But they </p><p>were not wax. They were John and </p><p>Johann and the boy, and it was the finish of </p><p>the fight. </p><p> The finish—but to associate the idea of</p><p>victory and a victor with it was but a grisly </p><p>straining for humor. Johann was lying on </p><p>his back. His gaunt face was upturned, </p><p>his tongue was bloated between his parted </p><p>teeth; and half-across his chest lay John, </p><p>face downward, fingers of one hand curled </p><p>as they had slipped from Johann’s throat. </p><p>The boy had had Johann by an ankle at the </p><p>last. He lay so now. </p><p> Sam’s features hardened into a grimace.</p><p> “John’s fight!” he announced.</p><p> Two pointed ears vanished behind a rock</p><p>at his muttered words, and they heard </p><p>the startled wolf making off through the </p><p>brush. </p><p> “Wait, and you’ll get us all, you fellows,”</p><p>said Sam. </p><p> An exclamation from the girl brought</p><p>him ’round. She was kneeling beside the </p><p>boy. She motioned excitedly, pointing to </p><p>Johann’s canteen. Sam snatched it up and </p><p>ran to her.</p><p> “His heart—feel, maybe the others-”</p><p> It was true. The boy’s heart fluttered</p><p>under the pressure of finger-tips. And it </p><p>was true of the others. Sam and the girl </p><p>set about to revive them. They—all of </p><p>them—might now win through. They had </p><p>food enough, and water—and together </p><p>they’d match the desert and the wolves. </p><p> “But there’ll be no more fighting,” de-</p><p>clared Jonathan Sam. </p><p>JW </p><p>The Other Side </p><p>A Complete Novelette </p><p>£y WTowrtpnd </p><p>Author of “Mr. Harrington's Wife,” "A Leader of Men,” etc. </p><p>■K JHT WAS a dark February morning, </p><p>I rain fell steadily and without </p><p>(1^1 |sji pity; men with sheepskin coats </p><p>ME over their wet khaki waded </p><p>knee-deep through flooded trenches; on </p><p>every side there was misery, discomfort, and </p><p>the chance of death: and yet the boy grinned, </p><p>grinned boyishly and cheerfully as if at last </p><p>he had reached happiness. That in itself </p><p>was enough to make Flint curious. </p><p> He was tall and slight, built on the lines of</p><p>a young grayhound, straight-backed and as </p><p>tough as whipcord. He had fair hair, gray </p><p>eyes that met Flint’s gaze steadily with no </p><p>The Other Side </p><p>157 </p><p>sign of nervousness, a thin, freckled face </p><p>with a touch of color still showing in the </p><p>cheeks, a short straight nose, and a firm </p><p>mouth that was forever breaking into a </p><p>smile; and his smile seemed to be trying to </p><p>explain that though very young and insig- </p><p>nificant and unworthy, he wanted to make </p><p>friends and learn his job, whatever that job </p><p>might be, and please everybody. </p><p> He looked, in fact, exactly what he was, a</p><p>boy who in other times would have been </p><p>thinking of nothing more important than </p><p>football or next season’s cricket, or the </p><p>’varsity, in the Autumn, certainly not of war </p><p>or shell-fire or the necessity of leading into </p><p>action men older than himself. </p><p> But there was something about him,</p><p>something reliable and straightforward and </p><p>altogether efficient that made Flint glad </p><p>that he was to have the boy in D Company. </p><p> “Are you Captain Flint, sir?” he had</p><p>asked. “I was told at the Q. M. stores I </p><p>was posted to you. Is that all right, sir?” </p><p>Flint, who had been making his way slowly </p><p>and with difficulty along a wet and badly </p><p>battered communication trench leading </p><p>from the front line, halted and steadied him- </p><p>self on a half-fioating duck board. </p><p> “Let me see, you’re-”</p><p> “I’m Derrick,” said the boy, smiling.</p><p> “Oh I understand now.” Flint thrust</p><p>out his hand. '“I’m glad to see you. Rot- </p><p>ten weather, isn’t it?” </p><p> “Beastly.”</p><p> “Why didn’t you wait till tonight and</p><p>come up with the ration party?” </p><p> “I don’t know, sir. I thought—well, I</p><p>thought now I’d got here I’d better join the </p><p>battalion at once. There was nothing much </p><p>for me to do in Sailly, anyhow.” </p><p> “A miracle!” said Flint with a half-smile.</p><p>“A miracle! So he comes here—to this; </p><p>thinking he’ll find jobs and things and the </p><p>war waiting to begin. I am even more </p><p>glad to have you than I said I was.”</p><p> The boy reddened and then laughed.</p><p> “It wasn’t that, sir, really, but-”</p><p> But Flint stopped him.</p><p> “You come along with me and I’ll show</p><p>you the underground palace known as D </p><p>Company Headquarters. And don’t you </p><p>be ashamed because you’re keen, son. I </p><p>like ’em keen. We’re in the supports at </p><p>present, back a bit, but we go into the front </p><p>line tomorrow.” </p><p> “Have you had a bad time of it lately,</p><p>sir?” </p><p> “Fairly hellish,” said Flint quietly. “It’s</p><p>a rotten sector, of course.” </p><p> “What kind of a crowd have you got</p><p>opposite?” </p><p> “A particularly poisonous brand of Prus-</p><p>sian. -them!” </p><p> Flint spoke as one who had suffered yet</p><p>bears no bitterness. </p><p> “Hope they’ll not celebrate my arrival,</p><p>anyway,” said the boy. </p><p>FLINT, rendered critical by sixteen </p><p>months of actual fighting, was </p><p>pleased. To become possessed of a </p><p>subaltern of the new army who was not only </p><p>keen—that in itself was a common virtue— </p><p>but who knew his job savored of the mir- </p><p>aculous. Flint himself, a second-lieutenant </p><p>of three years’ service at the outbreak of war </p><p>and now a captain and in command of a </p><p>company, had all the regular officer’s in- </p><p>stinctive distrust of those who had obtained </p><p>commissions merely because their country </p><p>was at war and needed officers. </p><p> To his mind no one could hope to make</p><p>an officer, much less an efficient officer, un- </p><p>less he had had his eighteen months at </p><p>Sandhurst followed by the long and gradual </p><p>breaking in with a regular battalion. Nor </p><p>could he hope to learn the ways of the army, </p><p>its traditions and customs, the duties and </p><p>obligations of an officer after serving for a </p><p>matter of months only. It was impossible </p><p>on the face of it. More often than not, </p><p>Flint’s strictures were justified.</p><p> But Derrick was of a different type.</p><p>Here, as Flint soon discovered, was effi- </p><p>ciency in the highest degree; eagerness to do </p><p>not only his own work but the work of </p><p>others as well, an eagerness that Flint </p><p>curbed most promptly; enthusiasm and an </p><p>instinctive understanding of his men, com- </p><p>bined with sympathy and tact and a sense </p><p>of humor that was priceless at such a time </p><p>and in such a place. </p><p> Flint, while purposely sparing in his</p><p>praises, announced after two days’ observa- </p><p>tion that he had in Derrick the best sub- </p><p>altern in the battalion. </p><p> “Or, if he’s not the best at present,” he</p><p>said, “he will be soon. He can’t help it. </p><p>He’s got it in him, and that’s everything.” </p><p>“Another of Flint’s finds,” said some one. </p><p>“Wait till he realizes what the war’s like, </p><p>Flint! Wait till he’s lieen shelled to blazesl </p><p>Wait till he goes over the top! Why not </p><p>try him, Flint? Take him out on patrol.” </p><p>158 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “I will,” said Flint. “I’m going to take</p><p>him out tonight to have a look at the Huns’ </p><p>new wire.” </p><p> And as Flint had promised so it was.</p><p>That night he took the boy out between </p><p>the lines. </p><p> It was cold and very dark, the rain had</p><p>ceased, at intervals stars showed between </p><p>the gaps in the driven clouds, and the wind </p><p>moaned shrilly through the barbed wire </p><p>across No Man’s Land. </p><p> There was little shelling, but occasionally</p><p>bursts of machine-gun fire from the German </p><p>trenches swept the open ground between </p><p>the lines. </p><p> Flint and the boy crept slowly along the</p><p>outskirts of the maze of German wire, every </p><p>now and then lying motionless in the mud </p><p>as the star-shells hissed upward. </p><p> Once Flint heard a little choking noise</p><p>and glancing back had a momentary glimpse </p><p>as the light waned, of the boy’s face, white </p><p>and drawn, as he stared into the ghastly </p><p>wide opened eyes of a dead Highlander </p><p>hanging from the wire. But almost im- </p><p>mediately another star-shell showed him </p><p>to all appearance unmoved, gazing toward </p><p>the German trenches, and Flint knew that </p><p>he need have no fear. </p><p> A little later the boy gripped him by the</p><p>elbow and they crouched down and waited </p><p>while four big Germans passed them with </p><p>slow and stealthy tread. </p><p> When at last they reached the friendly</p><p>shelter of a small wet dug-out that smelt of </p><p>rats and stale food and damp trench-coats, </p><p>and a sleepy batman had set two mugs of </p><p>hot coco on the rough plank table Flint </p><p>turned to the boy- </p><p> “Well, kid, how d’vou like it?”</p><p> “Oh! all right, sir. I wondered whether</p><p>I ought to have put a bullet through the last </p><p>of those four Huns, though.” </p><p> “-good job for you—and me—that</p><p>you didn’t!” said Flint lightly.	f</p><p> “The clumsy blighter only just missed</p><p>treading on me. I suppose they’ve a gap </p><p>in their wire just about where we were lying. </p><p>I wonder if their trenches are anything like </p><p>as mucky as ours.” </p><p> Flint smiled.</p><p> “Maybe you’ll have a chance of com-</p><p>paring them, kid, before you’re very much </p><p>older.” </p><p> “Hope so, at any rate,” said the boy.</p><p>“If I don’t, I’ll—” He broke off with a </p><p>laugh. “It’s rather good sport, really, that </p><p>kind of exploring, isn’t it? You never </p><p>know what you’re going to run up against; </p><p>dead men, listening posts, patrols, any- </p><p>thing.” And the way in which he spoke </p><p>showed that he was in earnest. </p><p> “Good Lord!” said Flint helplessly.</p><p>“What a God-forsaken idea of sport! </p><p>Weren’t you scared at all?” Flint, a be- </p><p>liever in straightforward questions, watched </p><p>him curiously. </p><p> “Scared!” said the boy. “No.”</p><p> “Not even when you saw that poor devil</p><p>on their wire?” </p><p> “No, sir. I don’t think I was.” He</p><p>hesitated as if trying to remember his own </p><p>feelings. “I didn’t like it, of course.” </p><p> “I’m glad you’re with us,” said Flint.</p><p>“You’ve brought us luck.” </p><p> “Me, sir! How?”</p><p> The surprise in the boy’s face was very</p><p>real. </p><p>“We’ve scarcely had a shell over since </p><p>you arrived. And that’s something to be </p><p>thankful for these days, I can tell you.” </p><p>“Did they strafe much before, then?” </p><p>Flint stood up and began to button up his </p><p>coat. </p><p> “StrafeI Rather! From mornin’ to night.</p><p>And they’ll do it again, too! You wait and</p><p>see. But they don’t get much change </p><p>out of our fellows. I tell you, kid, they’re </p><p>great—absolutely. And the sooner you </p><p>learn it the more use you’ll be to the </p><p>battalion. Well, I must be off now. I’m </p><p>going to have a look at that new sap they’re </p><p>digging. You’d better turn in while you’ve </p><p>the chance.” </p><p>Some hours later, in the middle of the </p><p>forenoon, Flint engaged in earnest conver- </p><p>tion with an artillery officer came upon </p><p>errick seated on the firestep poring over a </p><p>trench map. </p><p> “Ah, there he is. Look, Garnett; mild-</p><p>looking youth, ain’t he? You wouldn’t </p><p>think to see him now what a fire-eater he </p><p>was. He’s only got one ambition, and </p><p>that’s killing Huns. That’s why they let </p><p>him come out. Don’t be afraid of him, </p><p>Garnett. Shake hands and be friendly.” </p><p>“Pleased to meet you,” said the gunner. </p><p>“Is Flint working you to death? He al- </p><p>ways does, you know. No subaltern can </p><p>stand him for very long.” </p><p> Flint chuckled.</p><p> “Lord, work him to death. He’s our</p><p>miracle. Works for the fun of the thing. </p><p>The kid knows about as much as all the rest' </p><p>The Other Side </p><p>159 </p><p>of us put together already. You ought to </p><p>hear him talk about the use and misuse of </p><p>artillery in trench warfare. He’d make </p><p>even you sit up, Garnett. Tell him all </p><p>about those guns of yours, and you’ll both </p><p>be happy.” </p><p> “Are you interested in artillery work?”</p><p>said the gunner. </p><p> “Yes, sir—I am.”</p><p> “Like to come and have a look ’round the</p><p>battery some day?” </p><p> “I would—very much.”</p><p> “Well, you trot along next week when</p><p>you’re out of the trenches, and I’ll show </p><p>you a thing or two that’ll surprise you. </p><p>We’ve got some new gun positions that </p><p>poor old Fritz is breaking his heart over. </p><p>He’s been trying for two weeks to find ’em </p><p>and he hasn’t spotted us yet.” </p><p> The boy’s face lit up.</p><p> “I’ll come just as soon as I get a chance.</p><p>I’ve never seen a battery in action; except </p><p>in the distance, of course. It’s awfully </p><p>good of you to ask me, sir; it is, really.” </p><p>Flint watched him solemnly. Then he </p><p>laughed. An enthusiast himself, neverthe- </p><p>less he found enthusiasm in others a trifle </p><p>bewildering. </p><p> “Derrick,” he said. “I often wonder</p><p>what on earth you'd have done if there </p><p>hadn’t been a war on. Don’t you ever </p><p>think of anything besides soldiering?” </p><p>IN THE front room of the small </p><p> headquarters and officers’ mess Flint</p><p>was writing letters home and listening </p><p>rather against his wish to the snatches of </p><p>talk from three of his subalterns. </p><p> The room itself, long and narrow and lit</p><p>by candles, was furnished with a big table </p><p>from which the remains of dinner, coffee </p><p>cups and glasses, a plate of apples and a tin </p><p>box of plain chocolate had not yet been re- </p><p>moved, a tall and hideous dresser covered </p><p>with crockery and burnished pots and pans</p><p>of copper, and a mahogany chest of drawers </p><p>on the top of which were books, a stuffed </p><p>partridge in a glass case and a couple of .75 </p><p>shell cases. The walls, from which the </p><p>paper was peeling in large damp patches, </p><p>were adorned with vividly colored battle </p><p>pictures from the illustrated papers, a mul- </p><p>titude of photographs; some, single por- </p><p>traits, and others, wedding groups; framed </p><p>certificates relating to the army and di- </p><p>plomas from school granted to one Elise. </p><p> Seated around the little coffin-and-urn-</p><p>shaped stove were the three subalterns, </p><p>smoking and talking and laughing. </p><p> Nine struck from the clock over the</p><p>mantel-piece. </p><p> “Where on earth’s the kid got to?”</p><p> Flint looked up from the far end of the</p><p>big table at which he sat. </p><p> “Chuck me a cigaret, some one, please.</p><p>Who, Derrick? He ought to be back by </p><p>now. He’s had time enough to inspect </p><p>twenty batteries.” </p><p> “The kid’s a good chap, of course, but he’s</p><p>crazy, all the same.” </p><p> Flint lit his cigaret.</p><p> “I tell you what it is, young Stratton, if</p><p>you knew one-half what the kid does you’d </p><p>be just about ten times as much use as </p><p>you are at present.” </p><p> Stratton laughed easily.</p><p> “Can’t help it, I’m afraid. And we</p><p>aren’t all built the same way, anyhow.” </p><p> “I don’t know why,” said Flint, “but</p><p>there’s something about the kid that you </p><p>can’t help liking. He’s so everlastingly </p><p>keen, for one thing. Ever heard him ask </p><p>questions? He wants to know everything, </p><p>how and why and when? You daren’t </p><p>laugh at him, either.” </p><p> From the eastward there came the dull</p><p>throb and rumble of heavy guns. </p><p> “Listen to that!” said Flint. “There’s</p><p>the devil of a strafen going on, eh! They’ve </p><p>been giving our trenches hell ever since</p><p>we came out to rest.” </p><p> There was the sound of footsteps outside</p><p>and the murmur of voices. Then the door </p><p>opened and Derrick entered the room, wet </p><p>and smiling. </p><p> “Hullo!” said Flint. “Where the blazes</p><p>have you been? What kept you? They’ve </p><p>got some dinner hot for you in the kitchen. </p><p>Does Smith know that you’re back?” </p><p> “I’ve had a top-hole time of it,” said the</p><p>boy. “Seen everything.” His white teeth </p><p>showed in a sudden triumphant grin. </p><p>“Everything. And I don’t want anything </p><p>to eat, thanks. I’m not hungry.” </p><p>“Maniac!” said Stratton. “And he’s </p><p>walked about twenty miles.” </p><p> “I haven’t, either. Came back most of</p><p>the way on a limber wagon, too. They </p><p>were shelling the cross-roads like one o’clock </p><p>and the driver had the wind up.” </p><p> He tossed his soft cap on to a chair,</p><p>smoothed back his fair hair and wriggled </p><p>out of his wet trench coat. </p><p>i6o </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “By Jove, it’s been great. Simply great.</p><p>Those gunners of ours are wonderful. </p><p>Hullo, Smith! I’m not hungry, but you </p><p>may leave it if you like.” Smith, Flint’s </p><p>batman, a stolid, square-jawed private, had </p><p>entered with a plate of roast beef and vege- </p><p>tables. “Talk about being efficient,” the </p><p>boy went on quickly as though unwilling to </p><p>let the attention of his audience wander, </p><p>“I tell you we aren’t in it. The infantry’s </p><p>all right, of course, but-” </p><p> Flint stabbed viciously at the blotting</p><p>paper with his pen. </p><p> “Shut up!” he growled. “Look here,</p><p>kid, if you go on to say you’d rather have </p><p>been in the artillery I’ll choke you. Under- </p><p>stand! You’re in the infantry and don’t </p><p>you forget it.” </p><p> And although he smiled, Flint of a sudden</p><p>felt a curious irritation come over him, the </p><p>reason for which he could not have ex- </p><p>plained. That any one, above all any one </p><p>in his battalion, should compare the artillery </p><p>with the infantry with all their hardships </p><p>and sufferings seemed almost sacrilege. </p><p>For to Flint, who had seen his own battalion </p><p>wiped out three times over since that Sun- </p><p>day when they had gone into action at </p><p>Mons, the infantry represented the finest </p><p>branch of the service, the backbone of the </p><p>British army which had been sacrificed to </p><p>save Europe from destruction. </p><p> He watched the four subalterns curiously</p><p>as they chatted and laughed around the </p><p>fire; Stratton small and light-hearted and </p><p>restless, a student of La Vie Parisienne, a </p><p>creature of impulse, never serious even </p><p>when most in earnest; Mason, a West- </p><p>countryman, slow-moving, ponderous of </p><p>thought, and sound as the granite of Ex- </p><p>moor; MacDermott, a big, raw-boned </p><p>Irishman, much older than any of the others, </p><p>a silent man who spoke seldom and then </p><p>never about himself or his past; and Derrick, </p><p>tall and slight and wholesome-looking, </p><p>thoroughbred to the tips of his fingers, </p><p>the youngest and the most reliable of </p><p>the four. </p><p>AND as Flint sat at the table staring</p><p>idly across at the stove he wondered </p><p>rather sadly what the future might </p><p>hold in store for each of them. Flint’s </p><p>creed was simple, unorthodox perhaps, but </p><p>of a high standard. That it was out-of- </p><p>date according to modern ideas he himself </p><p>acknowledged rather proudly than other- </p><p>wise. Briefly, to his mind it were better by </p><p>far to be killed or to suffer untold torments </p><p>in battle, to be maimed or disfigured, to lose </p><p>sight or limbs, fighting for one’s country </p><p>than to live out one’s life in selfish peace and </p><p>luxury and safety without having risked </p><p>anything. </p><p> Few of those who had landed with him</p><p>in the Summer of 1914 were still alive. </p><p>They had died at Mons, at Ypres, at Given- </p><p>chy, at Festubert, at Loos. It was the best </p><p>who were taken—always. Would any of </p><p>those in the small farmhouse last the war </p><p>through? Would they see the Summer </p><p>green of the poplars along the roadside? </p><p>Or the poppies and cornflowers at the back </p><p>of the trenches? Or hear the lark’s song </p><p>in a lull of the guns? Or watch the brown- </p><p>and-gold leaves falling in the Autumn? </p><p> And, though of a practftal nature and by</p><p>no means given to sentiment, Flint shivered. </p><p>The best were always taken, of course. It </p><p>was hard, but it was war. </p><p> “B’rVh'I I’m cold. Some one tramp-</p><p>ing in the mud over my grave, I suppose. </p><p>- him! Thank the Lord there’s no </p><p>working party and we can spend our last </p><p>evening under cover. Eat something, kid; </p><p>you won’t get another decent meal for more </p><p>than two weeks so you’d better make the </p><p>most of your opportunity now.” </p><p> There was a light knock at the door and</p><p>a plump thick-set Frenchwoman with dark </p><p>hair and a worn, weather-beaten face came </p><p>in. </p><p> Stratton waved a friendly hand.</p><p> “Hullo, madame! How goes it? Com-</p><p>ment allez vous qe soir? ■ Bon, eh?” </p><p> The French of the British subaltern is,</p><p>though limited, expressive. </p><p> But there was no response, no voluble out-</p><p>burst of mixed patois and soldiers’ English </p><p>as was customary with madame, and a </p><p>strange and uncomfortable silence settled </p><p>on the little room. The five officers stared </p><p>at the Frenchwoman without speaking, </p><p>only the clock on the mantel-piece ticked </p><p>on hurriedly, as though bent on catching up </p><p>what was gone forever, and the roll of guns </p><p>sounded angrily through the storm. </p><p> For madame was crying. She was no</p><p>beauty at any time was madame: hard work </p><p>and worry and the raising of many children </p><p>had robbed her of what looks and figure she </p><p>might have had in the far-off days of her </p><p>girlhood when monsieur had led her to the </p><p>altar. Her eyes were red and the lids </p><p>The Other Side </p><p>161 </p><p>swollen, great tears trickled down her </p><p>mottled cheeks, her lips quivered and her </p><p>bosom heaved with sobs. </p><p> “Good God!” said Flint jumping to his</p><p>feet. “Madame, qu’est-qe que votis,-it, </p><p>you fellows, what’s the word—can’t some </p><p>one stop her?” </p><p> MacDermott gave a shrug of his big</p><p>shoulders. </p><p> “Poor creature, leave her alone, Flint.</p><p>If you let a woman have her cry out—so </p><p>I’ve heard—she’ll be the better for it.” </p><p> “I knew a girl once,” said Stratton, and</p><p>broke off abruptly, very red in the face. </p><p> “Madame,” said Flint desperately. “Dis-</p><p>toi, done—tell us what’s wrong. Pour quo i </p><p>Sles-vous si triste?” </p><p> And then between great bursts of sobbing,</p><p>madame told her story. </p><p>“For the country—he is dead in bataille— </p><p>monfilsl Keel, you say it: my son Pierre.” </p><p>“Lord!” said Mason. “What rotten luck! </p><p>-this war anyhow! -it!” </p><p> The Frenchwoman continued in a low</p><p>broken voice, weeping quietly, standing </p><p>quite still in the center of the room, her </p><p>fingers twisting in and out of her apron. </p><p>Her son Pierre was dead at Verdun. One </p><p>had brought her the news that evening from </p><p>Pierre’s wife at Bethune. They had been </p><p>married a year, and Pierre was dead. And </p><p>the baby not a month old. Whom Pierre </p><p>would never see. And now—with Pierre— </p><p>all were dead. </p><p> Her husband had died first, at the Marne.</p><p>And then three sons. Such good boys. </p><p>And now Pierre at Verdun, the best. Also </p><p>her daughter’s husband. All dead—each </p><p>one of them. What was left for her? </p><p>Nothing, only death. The good God might </p><p>take her whenever it pleased Him. She </p><p>would pray that her time might not be long. </p><p>She was alone now, all alone in the world</p><p>and once she had been happy. It was the </p><p>war—the war that was wrong and cruel and </p><p>wicked—that had robbed her. </p><p>THEY did their best to comfort her </p><p>but what comfort was there in </p><p>words when she had lost all that </p><p>made life possible. </p><p> A lump came to Flint’s throat.</p><p> “But what would you, madame? C’est la</p><p>guerre. Your son died for his country. </p><p>He gave his life for France.” </p><p> And, strange though it seemed, Flint’s</p><p>few, halting sentences brought comfort. </p><p>Of a sudden, madame drew herself up </p><p>proudly to her full height, her sobs ceased, </p><p>her hands dropped once more to her sides, </p><p>and she gazed about her nervously, as </p><p>though afraid lest she had offended. </p><p>“Pardon, messieurs,” she said. </p><p> Her dark eyes rested with a tender, wist-</p><p>ful expression, on Derrick. </p><p> “Pauvre petitl” she said softly and from</p><p>the way she spoke she might have been </p><p>talking to one of her own boys—perhaps in </p><p>her own mind she was. “So young—and </p><p>your mother. The poor mothers!” </p><p> As though it were the most natural thing</p><p>to do, without showing any trace of em- </p><p>barrassment, she put her hands on the boy’s </p><p>shoulders and kissed him tenderly on either </p><p>cheek. Then she went out, crying softly </p><p>into her apron, feeling her way with her out- </p><p>stretched hand. Flint closed the door. </p><p> The boy’s face was very red and he turned</p><p>and walked over to the stove. </p><p> “Well!” said Flint grimly</p><p> “Well,” said MacDermott, “what of it?</p><p>That’s your-war for you! Four sons— </p><p>dead! Four sons and her husband!” </p><p> “Yes,” said Flint in a low voice, “that’s</p><p>war. And what do we British know about </p><p>it? What have we suffered? It makes me </p><p>sick. Downright sick. That poor old </p><p>thing has given everything she has for</p><p>France. And, by God, she’s proud of it. </p><p>We ought to be thankful that we’ve even </p><p>had the privilege of helping France. I tell </p><p>you, you fellows— and I don’t often feel </p><p>about anything like I feel about this—if </p><p>we’d left France to fight this thing out alone, </p><p>by God, we wouldn’t have been fit to exist </p><p>as a nation. We’d have deserved to have </p><p>Germany stamp us out, once and for all. </p><p> “The French are the finest people on</p><p>earthy bar none. Could any man hold back </p><p>after seeing what we’ve seen? Look what </p><p>they’ve suffered! Look at this village— </p><p>think of the women of France, giving all to </p><p>their country; carrying on in spite of every- </p><p>thing, living under shell-fire, doing their </p><p>work. And why? Because it’s for France. </p><p>They don’t need any persuading, that’s </p><p>sufficient in itself. Could any one men- </p><p>tion Germany in the same breath as France? </p><p>And think what France means to each one </p><p>of us—now! And once—my God—once we </p><p>thought of France as—as what? </p><p> “Something like what La Vie Parisienne</p><p>expresses. Chorus girls, the caffes, Maxime’s. </p><p>Do you think of England as Picadilly and </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Leicester Square or the night clubs, or that </p><p>mob of shysters in the House of Commons, </p><p>or those-swine who want us to make </p><p>peace with Germany and stop the war— </p><p>now, when Germany’s still unpunished? </p><p>We’ve done some pretty average rotten </p><p>things in the past, but by God, I’m proud </p><p>to think the British are fighting side by </p><p>side with the French. And there isn’t a </p><p>sacrifice that we might be asked to make </p><p>that wouldn’t be worth while if it were </p><p>going to help France.” </p><p> Flint stopped, out of breath and rather</p><p>startled by the depth, of his own feelings, </p><p>and found Derrick staring at him intently. </p><p> Long after, looking back on that night</p><p>and all it stood for, Flint remembered the </p><p>boy standing by the dresser with the light </p><p>of the candles shining on his face and a </p><p>strange expression in his eyes, fear or horror </p><p>or something akin to both. </p><p> “Then you think,” he began huskily:</p><p>“you think—” He hesitated and cleared </p><p>his throat. “I suppose, Flint, a man— </p><p>every man—ought to be willing to give all </p><p>for his country—to do anything he’s asked </p><p>to do.” </p><p> “Yes,” said Flint and he wondered what</p><p>was coming and why the boy seemed all at </p><p>once troubled and worried. “Yes, of </p><p>course. It’s the least he can do. What’s </p><p>being killed, after all? Nothing—if you’re </p><p>killed for the sake of your country. What’s </p><p>taking a risk, if it’s your duty?” </p><p> “Nothing,” said the boy slowly. “Noth-</p><p>ing at all. That’s why we’re here. A </p><p>man is justified in doing anything he can to </p><p>help his own people. Anything. It’s his </p><p>duty, eh? It must be, of course.” </p><p> He snuffed a guttering candle with a</p><p>finger and thumb, frowning as though think- </p><p>ing of other things. Then he yawned wearily. </p><p> “My hat, but I’m tired tonight. I’m not</p><p>hungry so I don’t think I’ll bother about </p><p>any dinner. I’m going to turn in. Good </p><p>night, all.” </p><p>“DO YOU mind if I go out tonight,</p><p>sir, to have a look at that old crater </p><p>where they told us they thought the </p><p>Boches were running out a sap?” </p><p> It was the morning after the battalion had</p><p>reached the trenches once more. The sun </p><p>was shining in a cold, pale sky, a fresh wind </p><p>was blowing, and the mud was drying </p><p>underfoot. Flint, strolling along the fire- </p><p>trench, piled up high on both sides with </p><p>sand-bags full of chalk from the mines, had </p><p>stopped to speak to Derrick in one of the </p><p>fire-bays. </p><p> “What’s that?” he said. “So you want</p><p>to go out on patrol, eh?” </p><p> He smiled rather as an elder humoring</p><p>the request of a small and precocious child. </p><p>The boy flushed. </p><p> “Why not, sir? I know I can find out</p><p>what’s going on, and it’s better for one to go </p><p>than half a dozen, isn’t it?” </p><p> “You mustn’t go by yourself,” said Flint</p><p>suddenly. “That’s settled. I don’t want </p><p>to lose you, kid, and—” he paused for a </p><p>moment and thought—“I tell you what, </p><p>you’d better take Corporal Dyer with you.” </p><p>“I suppose you think I can’t look after </p><p>myself,” grumbled the boy. </p><p> His face was very red still and offended</p><p>dignity showed in his expression. </p><p> “Not at all,” said Flint untruthfuUy.</p><p>“Only supposing you get into a scrap or are </p><p>wounded! You understand!” </p><p> “Oh! I understand,” said Derrick. “All</p><p>right, then. I’ll take Dyer and find out </p><p>what’s happening.” </p><p> Flint looked at him curiously. His</p><p>pleasure was obvious; from his manner one </p><p>might have judged that he was going home </p><p>to England rather than that he had been </p><p>told he might crawl across No Man’s Land </p><p>to the German trenches. </p><p> The moon had set and the night was dark</p><p>and cloudy. The boy went out at midnight. </p><p>Flint saw him before he left, chuckled at his </p><p>eagerness, and then, when he had gone, fell </p><p>to worrying. An unaccountable feeling </p><p>of anxiety, of fear as to what might per-</p><p>chance happen, weighed him down. </p><p> Calling himself names, he tried to shake</p><p>off his depression, and failed signally. </p><p> As the hours went by and Derrick did not</p><p>return Flint’s anxiety grew. Supposing the </p><p>boy were wounded and had to lie out be- </p><p>tween the lines for days; supposing he were </p><p>killed—whenever rifle-shots broke the still- </p><p>ness Flint would find fresh grounds for fear; </p><p>supposing that they took him prisoner. To </p><p>Flint this was the worst prospect of all. To </p><p>be a prisoner in German hands was the most </p><p>awful fate a man could suffer; hell, unadul- </p><p>terated. Better that a British officer should </p><p>die before that. </p><p> At about three in the morning Derrick</p><p>returned. Flint, in the company head- </p><p>quarters dug-out, heard footsteps descend- </p><p>ing the stairs. </p><p>The Other Side </p><p> “Is that you, kid?” he called.</p><p> “Yes, sir,” and the boy, his face and</p><p>hands and clothes plastered with mud, </p><p>entered. </p><p> “Been out the devil of a time, haven’t</p><p>you?” said Flint curtly. </p><p> Now that the boy was safe he could af-</p><p>ford to show a certain amount of an- </p><p>noyance. </p><p> “Yes, I’m afraid so, sir, I’ve had rather a</p><p>job.” </p><p> Flint saw that the boy was troubled.</p><p> “What do you mean by ‘rather a job’?</p><p>Not hurt, are you? Where’s Dyer?” </p><p> “Dyer! I’m afraid he’s a prisoner. I’ve</p><p>made enquiries and he’s not back, so-” </p><p> “What!” Flint whistled. “So that’s it!</p><p>What the devil happened?” </p><p> “First of all, we crawled through a gap in</p><p>their wire, sir, and worked our way in the </p><p>direction of the crater. It took us some </p><p>time, of course, as the going was bad. </p><p>Then we found the sap. As a matter of </p><p>fact we heard them digging, and that guided </p><p>us. We couldn’t make out very much, </p><p>I’m afraid, it was too dark; but I can show </p><p>you on a map whereabouts the sap lies. By </p><p>the way, sir, I think they’ve got a machine- </p><p>gun emplacement on the northeast side of </p><p>the crater. </p><p> “They opened fire from there when we</p><p>began to move back. Their patrols must </p><p>have spotted us. Some one shouted at us, </p><p>anyhow, and began shooting from near the </p><p>sap. </p><p> “Things were getting a bit hot so I</p><p>crept into a shell-hole, thinking that Dyer </p><p>was with me. But he wasn’t. And I’ve </p><p>been looking for him ever since. I’m </p><p>very sorry about it, sir, but I did my best to </p><p>find him and—I thought I’d better be </p><p>coming in.” </p><p> “Good God!” said Flint. “There’s noth-</p><p>ing to worry about. You couldn’t help it! </p><p>By Jove, though, you must have had a</p><p>pretty ghastly time of it, Derrick!” </p><p> “It’s Dyer I’m worrying about. I didn’t</p><p>go off without him—I hope you don’t think </p><p>that, sir.” </p><p> His eagerness to make it clear that he had</p><p>tried his utmost to find the corporal struck </p><p>Flint as something almost pathetic. </p><p> “Don’t get that into your head!” he said.</p><p>“-few of us would have risked going </p><p>back to look for him as you did. You did </p><p>your best, what more could you do?” </p><p> The boy dropped wearily down on a plank</p><p>bench and sat with his shoulders bent and </p><p>his head drooping, the picture of dejection </p><p>and misery. </p><p> “I’m sorry I made such a mess of things,”</p><p>he said. “I was responsible for Dyer—and </p><p>maybe he’s killed or a prisoner and-” </p><p> “Listen here, kid,” said Flint. “At the</p><p>end of the second day we were in action at </p><p>Ypres—October, 19x4—I’d seven of my </p><p>platoon alive. The others had gone west, </p><p>or were wounded. And I kept thinking if </p><p>I’d only made them dig in quicker in one </p><p>place, or withdrawn a little in another, or </p><p>gone ahead at the double somewhere else, </p><p>or hadn’t let ’em stop just where a Jack </p><p>Johnson was going to burst—well, they’d </p><p>still have been with me. You understand! </p><p>The finest men God ever made: old army, of </p><p>course. And fight! They were gluttons. </p><p>They could stand more punishment than </p><p>any men I’ve ever met. It was my fault, </p><p>of course, that they were dead. </p><p> “That’s what I thought. And I very</p><p>nearly worried myself sick. And then— </p><p>well, then, kid, I began to see what war </p><p>really meant and that to win battles you’ve </p><p>got to risk other lives besides your own. </p><p>You understand. Whatever you tell ’em </p><p>to do, they’ll do it, and they’ll get killed— </p><p>by your orders. It makes war more hellish </p><p>than ever, eh? And now have a drink, kid, </p><p>yow’re shivering. And as for being respon- </p><p>sible for Dyer, that’s ridiculous. Dyer was </p><p>responsible for you; that’s why I sent him.” </p><p>IT WAS just after sunrise when the </p><p>German heavy guns opened fire. </p><p>Flint listened to the screech of </p><p>the shells overhead. </p><p> “What are they crumping now?” said</p><p>MacDermott. </p><p>From where they stood they could see the </p><p>smoke of bursting shells rising from the </p><p>ruined village behind the trenches. </p><p>“Giving the village a dose of it, eh!” </p><p>“Well I’m glad it’s not us, anyway,” said </p><p>Flint. </p><p> “The luck can’t last, though: we’re bound</p><p>to get it again before long,” said MacDer- </p><p>mott. “It’s too good.” </p><p> “It does happen like this occasionally,”</p><p>said Flint. “By Jove! They’re chucking </p><p>them in, aren’t they?” </p><p> That afternoon Flint ‘met an artillery</p><p>officer at the blanket-covered entrance to an </p><p>O. P. dug-out. </p><p> “Hullo!” said Flint. “How goes it?”</p><p>Adventure </p><p> But the gunner who looked tired and worn</p><p>gave him no answering smile. </p><p> “You heard what happened to us, didn’t</p><p>you?” he said. </p><p> “No,” said Flint. “What?”</p><p> “This morning soon after it was light the</p><p>Huns opened on us. By God, Flint, I </p><p>don’t want to see anything like it again.” </p><p>“Did they do much damage?” </p><p> The artilleryman laughed.</p><p>“Put us clean out of action. Three </p><p>direct hits, right in the gun-pits: three guns </p><p>smashed to blazes. We’ve lost three- </p><p>quarters of the battery, killed and wounded. </p><p>The dug-outs got hell. The other batteries </p><p>in the brigade caught it pretty badly, but not </p><p>like we did. I’m feeling fairly shaky, still.” </p><p>“Rough luck!” said Flint. “I’m awfully </p><p>sorry, old chap. I am really.” He hesi- </p><p>tated. “Old Garnett’s all right, of course?” </p><p>“I’m afraid not,” said the artilleryman. </p><p>“What’s that?” said Flint quickly. “Not </p><p>—not killed? Don’t say they’ve killed </p><p>Garnett!” </p><p> “Yes,” said the other in a dull whisper.</p><p>“Blown in half. God Almighty! It was </p><p>awful.” </p><p> “What’s that?” said a strangled voice.</p><p>“Garnett killed!” </p><p> Flint saw Derrick by his side.</p><p> “Garnett killed!” continued the boy.</p><p>“Why—why I was only with him two days </p><p>ago. He showed me the battery, every- </p><p>thing-” </p><p> “The whole battery’s gone,” said the</p><p>gunner. “Bridger and Davidson are killed, </p><p>too; Mulcahy is not expected to live. </p><p>Hesketh and Grant are wounded. Pretty </p><p>bad, isn’t it?” </p><p> “Bad!” said the boy. “Bad! Why,</p><p>it’s-” </p><p> He broke off and stared at the artillery-</p><p>man with an expression of frozen horror, as </p><p>though the significance of what he had </p><p>heard was just coming home to him.</p><p> “My God! It’s awful. Poor old Garnett!”</p><p>“It was just a matter of luck, really,” </p><p>said the artilleryman. “They happened to </p><p>spot us, that’s all. So they let us have it!” </p><p>“There were few men I liked so well as </p><p>Garnett,” said Flint soberly. “And now </p><p>he’s gone. That’s what happens out here </p><p>—always. Every pal I ever had in the </p><p>army has been killed. Garnett was going </p><p>home on leave next week, too. He was </p><p>telling me how much he wanted to see his </p><p>wife and kiddies.” </p><p> As Flint turned away he noticed the lines</p><p>in the boy’s face and he knew that the war </p><p>with all its cruelty and terror had begun </p><p>already to leave its mark. </p><p> A COMPANY commander who is</p><p>worth his salt must take notice of </p><p>ILSSsai all that concerns his company. So </p><p>Flint made it his business quietly and </p><p>methodically to study his officers no less </p><p>than his men, lest in the hour of trial when </p><p>the machine must do the work of one double </p><p>or treble, nay ten times, its strength, some </p><p>small cog wheel should be unequal to its </p><p>allotted task and the whole mechanism </p><p>break to pieces under the strain. </p><p> And if there were rare and depressing</p><p>moments, born of the never-ending hard- </p><p>ships of a cold and bitter Spring and the </p><p>uncertainty of the future, when he had wild </p><p>and foolish doubts concerning Stratton or </p><p>Mason or even MacDermott, never even </p><p>when things were at their worst could he </p><p>have any fears for Derrick. </p><p> Derrick, young as he was, was splendid.</p><p>In everything he undertook he proved his </p><p>value; his judgment and initiative were far </p><p>beyond the average subaltern’s. Also his </p><p>spirit was too high to admit the possibility </p><p>of failure. And Flint knew inwardly that </p><p>however great the task that might be given </p><p>him the boy would carry on, undismayed, </p><p>and in spite of all would be successful. </p><p> Yet as the weeks went by, Flint noticed</p><p>a gradual change creep over him. He was </p><p>quieter than he had been at first; he had </p><p>less to say and was more serious. When </p><p>the others were talking he would sit by </p><p>himself, listening, taking no part in the </p><p>conversation but watching each speaker </p><p>intently as though perplexed or puzzled by</p><p>what they said. </p><p> On rare occasions he would talk wistfully</p><p>of home and what home meant; Sussex, with </p><p>the little white villages nestling at the foot </p><p>of the downs, narrow lanes winding be- </p><p>tween hedgerows sweet with honeysuckle </p><p>and wild roses, green meadows and little </p><p>streams and copses, and an old red-brick </p><p>house covered with wistaria and set among </p><p>oaks and copper beeches and elm trees with </p><p>a big lawn and garden gay with flowers and </p><p>the blue of the Channel in the distance. </p><p> Sometimes Flint would come on him sud-</p><p>denly, seated on the firestep, alone, staring </p><p>at nothing, lost in thought. When the </p><p>brigade was out at rest he showed an almost </p><p>The Other Side </p><p>165 </p><p>pathetic anxiety not to be forgotten; he </p><p>must pay his fair share and take his part in </p><p>everything. And always, in the trenches </p><p>or out, Flint had the idea that he was worry- </p><p>ing; worrying over some deep problem that </p><p>was past all understanding. </p><p> To find an officer’s true worth one must</p><p>go to the men. This was to Flint a self- </p><p>evident truth. </p><p> For who can judge an officer more ac-</p><p>curately than the man he commands? He </p><p>alone can tell whether his officer be just or </p><p>otherwise; whether he consider his own </p><p>comfort as of more importance than his </p><p>men’s. An officer may be everything that </p><p>an officer should be in the mess, yet a dis- </p><p>mal failure in the eyes of those under him. </p><p>And if an officer can not win the confidence </p><p>and esteem of the soldiers whom he must </p><p>lead in battle, then he is no real officer and </p><p>it were better that he had never been born. </p><p> Derrick’s men, keen judges each one of</p><p>them, adored him. </p><p> This Flint learned for certain one night</p><p>in March. </p><p> He stood in a traverse morosely watching</p><p>the Verrey lights soar upward and listening </p><p>to the thunder of the guns in the North. </p><p> “So I ses to ’im, I ses, ‘I wouldn’t do it,</p><p>sir, if I was you; it ain’t your duty, sir, an’ </p><p>it ain’t safe!’ ” </p><p> The words came to Flint clearly and he</p><p>recognized the voice of one of his sergeants. </p><p> “An’ he laughs. ‘Sergeant,’ he ses, ‘if we</p><p>was all to think wot was safe an’ wot wasn’t </p><p>we wouldn’t be here; we’d be at home </p><p>making munitions an’ strikin’ for another </p><p>’arf-crown a day, instead of sitting about </p><p>in the wet and gettin’ killed.’ An’ after </p><p>that I didn’t say nothin’. An’ off he goes </p><p>all by himself an’ later on I hears ’is rifle </p><p>barkin’ an’ back he comes with an old ’el- </p><p>met as pleased as a puppy wot ’ad just </p><p>pinched an old shoe from ’is master.” </p><p>“Did he get any one?” asked another </p><p>voice. </p><p> “Dunno! He’s a - good shot, any-</p><p>way. I’ve seen him in daylight in a sniper’s </p><p>post knockin’ chips of chalk off their para- </p><p>pet. Anyway he couldn’t ’ave got the </p><p>’elmet off a live German, could he?” </p><p> “He’s a decent sort wot I’ve seen of ’im.</p><p>Does ’e do that kind o’ thing often? Goin’ </p><p>out like that by himself!” </p><p> “Often! Every bally night if he can. I</p><p>tell you, Sam, that kid—he’s only eighteen </p><p>an’ he looks sixteen—that kid don’t know </p><p>wot fear is. He’s a blasted miracle, more </p><p>like a ruddy Ghurka than an Englishman. </p><p>The platoon ’ud go through ’ell for him, if </p><p>he asked ’em to. He’s the best an’ most </p><p>considerate orf’cer I ever come across, not </p><p>exceptin’ young Flint. But Flint’s a reg’lar: </p><p>soldierin’s ’is job.” </p><p> Flint chuckled in the darkness and went on</p><p>his way. What he had heard satisfied him. </p><p>If any doubts as to his junior subaltern’s </p><p>abilities as an officer had remained the men’s </p><p>praises would have removed them. What </p><p>they had said concerning the boy, merely </p><p>proved that his own vi€ws had been </p><p>correct. </p><p> But though Flint might assure himself</p><p>that no power on earth, neither hardship </p><p>nor toil, neither danger nor the imminence </p><p>of death, could ever daunt or diminish </p><p>Derrick’s courage or nerve, yet he had not </p><p>made due allowance for the effect of inces- </p><p>sant rain and snow and fatigue on a body </p><p>not yet keyed up to the hardships of cam- </p><p>paigning. </p><p> It was in the last week of May when</p><p>MacDermott first noticed what was </p><p>happening. </p><p> “Flint,” he said, “if you’re not very care-</p><p>ful you’ll find yourself short of a sub- </p><p>altern.” </p><p> “Good biz!” said Flint. Then he saw by</p><p>MacDermott’s saturnine face that he was </p><p>serious. “What are you talking about, </p><p>Mac? You’re not getting a transfer, are </p><p>you?” </p><p> “Me? No. But the kid is.”</p><p> “What the blazes are you driving at</p><p>now?” said Flint. “The kid’s going to do </p><p>nothing of the kind. To what?” </p><p> “Kingdom Come, most probably.”</p><p> Flint was startled.</p><p> “I’ve not noticed anything wrong,” he</p><p>said. “You mean he’s not well, eh?” </p><p> “You come and have a good look at him,</p><p>now,” said MacDermott. </p><p> SO FLINT slipped on his belt and</p><p>followed by MacDermott set off in </p><p>search of Derrick. He found him, </p><p>as he had half-expected, seated on the fire- </p><p>step in the front line, gazing moodily up at </p><p>an aeroplane in the blue sky against which </p><p>the white puffs of shrapnel showed up like </p><p>cotton wool. </p><p> He lowered his eyes, shivered as though</p><p>cold, and saw Flint. </p><p> “Hullo!” he said. “Want me?”</p><p>i66 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “No,” said Flint, “not exactly, kid.</p><p>You were right, Mac.” </p><p> He continued to stare until the color</p><p>flooded the boy’s thin cheeks and he laughed </p><p>nervously. </p><p> “What’s up, Flint? Why are you look-</p><p>ing at me like that? Anything wrong?” </p><p>“No. How are you feeling? Fit?” </p><p>“Yes, of course.” </p><p> “You don’t look it, then; does he, Mac?”</p><p>“Why didn’t you have any breakfast, </p><p>such as it was? Why don’t you sleep when </p><p>you have the chance?” </p><p> Cl J_»&gt;</p><p> The boy seemed puzzled.</p><p> “What makes you say I don’t sleep?”</p><p>“Not feverish or anything, are you?” </p><p>asked Flint, certain that his guess had been </p><p>right. </p><p> “No, Why?”</p><p> “You come along with me, kid. I’ve got</p><p>something to show you. Mac, you hang </p><p>on here till I come back.” </p><p> And he took the boy off, protesting feebly,</p><p>to the little rabbit-hutch of a shelter which </p><p>was known officially as the regimental aid </p><p>post. Here they found the medical officer, </p><p>short and stout and free of speech, and </p><p>sundry helpers, inspecting the sick of the </p><p>battalion. </p><p> “Doc,” said Flint; for this was a medical</p><p>officer who, being loved by all, was known </p><p>simply and vulgarly as “Doc.” “Doc, will </p><p>you have a dekko at the kid and tell me ex- </p><p>actly what’s ailing him?” </p><p> “Oh, - it! I’m all right, honestly I</p><p>am,” said the boy. </p><p> “Look at him, Doc. He doesn’t eat; he</p><p>doesn’t sleep; he sits on the firestep and </p><p>shivers; he goes hunting Huns at night, in </p><p>the wet; he’s thinner than he was a month </p><p> “Right!” said the little doctor, and he</p><p>produced a thermometer and a stethescope. </p><p> “Feel all right, kid?” he asked after a</p><p>while. </p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “H’ml doubt it. Any pain over the</p><p>heart?” </p><p> The boy shook his head miserably.</p><p> “I don’t understand it,” said Flint.</p><p>“He’s quite different from what he used to </p><p>be.” </p><p> “Well,” said the little doctor, scratching</p><p>his nose with his stethescope. “Well, </p><p>there’s nothing exactly wrong—organically. </p><p>His lungs are all right; so’s his heart, but </p><p>he’s run down. You’re run down, Der- </p><p>rick—understand? If I didn’t know you, </p><p>if I were back in South Kensington trottin’ </p><p>around visitin’ patients at half-a-guinea </p><p>a time I’d say you were—well, worryin’ </p><p>about something. Not in love, are you?” </p><p>The boy laughed. </p><p> “Lord, no!”</p><p> “Good for you. Keep away from ’em,</p><p>kid. Now look here, you’ve let yourself go </p><p>all to pieces. I don’t know how. Do you </p><p>sleep well?” </p><p> The doctor was filling in a sick report.</p><p>“Usually, I do, but—lately—” the boy </p><p>shrugged his shoulders as though to show </p><p>the futility of hiding the truth—“lately, </p><p>I’ve not been sleeping at all.” </p><p> The doctor signed his name, with a</p><p>flourish. </p><p> “Right! Now listen to me, Derrick.</p><p>I’m serious now. Understand? You’ll be </p><p>having a breakdown if you’re not careful. </p><p>You’re on the verge now. The battalion </p><p>goes out of the line in four days’ time. But </p><p>you must go today. Get right out of this </p><p>as soon as you can and wait for us.” </p><p> A look of distress came into the boy’s face.</p><p> “I can’t—I just can’t.”</p><p> “You can and will, my child. I say it,</p><p>and that’s enough.” </p><p> “But, Doc, you don’t expect me to leave</p><p>my platoon now. It wouldn’t be fair. </p><p>Would it? I can’t go out, and leave them </p><p>here. It’s impossible. And what about </p><p>that raid of ours? I can’t be out of that. </p><p>I’ve not been over the top with the men </p><p>yet. And, Doc, I’m all right really, I </p><p>swear I am.” </p><p> Even Flint, accustomed as he was to the</p><p>boy’s moods, was perplexed. The little </p><p>doctor frowned. </p><p> “No. You’ll do as I tell you. You’re</p><p>needin’ a rest, so off you go at once. And </p><p>do you mean to tell me that your platoon </p><p>can’t manage for four days without you, </p><p>raid or no raid? Of course they can. </p><p>They’d far better do without you for a short </p><p>time than have you taken away for good. </p><p>Now, that’s final. You clear off from the </p><p>trenches as soon as you can.” </p><p> Arid when the little doctor spoke like that</p><p>argument was futile. The boy drifted off, </p><p>looking miserably unhappy. </p><p> Flint stopped behind.</p><p> “What’s wrong, Doc?”</p><p> “Nerves simply, he’s all to pieces. As</p><p>brave as they make ’em, of course, but he’s </p><p>The Other Side </p><p>167 </p><p>not strong and if he carries on the way he’s </p><p>doing, all work and no rest, well—we’ll be </p><p>shippin’ him home to England. Get him </p><p>to take things a bit quietly.” </p><p> “That’s easily said, Doc, but you don’t</p><p>know the kid as well as I do. He’s break- </p><p>ing his heart now because you’ve sent him </p><p>away from the battalion—even if it’s only </p><p>for four days. He was dead keen on going </p><p>over with us when we raid the Bodies.” </p><p>“H’m! Seems to like his work, eh?’ </p><p>“Crazy about it. And don’t talk about </p><p>nerves! He’s the coolest hand I’ve ever </p><p>seen in action. I tell you, Doc, that boy </p><p>ought to have been killed weeks ago. He’ll </p><p>take the most impossible risks just—well, </p><p>just for the sport of the thing!” </p><p>THAT night the German guns </p><p>opened a heavy bombardment. </p><p>Flint, in the company head- </p><p>quarters dug-out, heard the screech and </p><p>rush of heavy shells. </p><p> “Hullo! Hullo! What’s that? Bit of a</p><p>hate on eh!” </p><p> He stood up and reached for his steel</p><p>helmet. </p><p> A tremendous crash shook the dug-out;</p><p>the timbers rocked, as though in an earth- </p><p>quake, earth fell through the narrow spaces </p><p>between the planks supporting the roof. </p><p> Stratton came tumbling down the steep</p><p>steps of the dug-out. </p><p> “My God! That was near, it was, Flint.</p><p>Did—did you hear it? I thought it was all </p><p>up with me.” </p><p> Flint gripped him by the shoulders.</p><p>“Steady, old chap! Pretty near, eh?” </p><p>“N-near—I dud-dunno, Flint, I thought </p><p>—thought I was done for. It knocked me </p><p>down-” </p><p> “You stay here, Stratton, in the dug-</p><p>out.” And the noise of the bursting shells </p><p>was so great he had to shout. “I’m going </p><p>up to see what’s happening.” </p><p> “Good God! Flint—Flint, you’re never</p><p>going out in this! They’re dropping heavy </p><p>stuff all over the place.” </p><p> “All the more reason for my going. I’ve</p><p>got to see after those poor devils of mine.” </p><p>Slowly he climbed out into the trench, </p><p>trying to shut out of his consciousness all </p><p>thought of peril and succeeding only passing </p><p>well. Most men would have called him </p><p>brave, even in an army where cold-blooded </p><p>bravery was the rule—Flint realized that </p><p>with no false modesty—but never yet had </p><p>he overcome his hatred of shell-fire with all </p><p>its infinite possibilities. Before each at- </p><p>tack or each spell of duty in the line, he felt a </p><p>greater and ever growing need of forcing </p><p>himself to show his unconcern. For, ac- </p><p>cording to Flint’s code, an officer must </p><p>never show that he either feared or even </p><p>respected shell-fire; outwardly at least he </p><p>must appear oblivious of danger and devoid </p><p>of fear. </p><p> So now, when his whole being craved for</p><p>safety, for the shelter of a deep dug-out, he </p><p>deliberately climbed out into the open, </p><p>cursing himself for so doing. For why </p><p>should he, merely because he wore three </p><p>stars on his cuff, lurk in safety while others, </p><p>common soldiers in rank but better men </p><p>than himself, suffered the agonies of hell? </p><p>If they could die, so too could he: if death </p><p>in action were to be his fate no power on </p><p>earth could save him from his doom. </p><p> A slight rain was falling; the night was</p><p>acrid with the fumes of high explosives; the </p><p>glare of bursting shells lit up the blackness, </p><p>their crashing and screeching stunned the </p><p>senses to a numbed and helpless terror. </p><p> Flint, staggering drunkenly, ran up a</p><p>short stretch of communication trench to </p><p>the chaos and horror of the front fine. </p><p> The screech of an approaching shell</p><p>made him throw himself headlong at the </p><p>bottom of the trench, his hands clasped </p><p>around his head. There was a deafening </p><p>roar as of the heavens splitting, a blinding </p><p>flash of light, the very ground heaved </p><p>upward with the explosion, and Flint lay </p><p>on his face, half-buried by a fall of sandbags </p><p>and stunned by the concussion. For a </p><p>moment he could not move, then slowly, </p><p>making an effort he forced himself to rise.</p><p> Near at hand a ghastly voice was shriek-</p><p>ing piteously. </p><p> “Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, kill me, for</p><p>God’s sake!” </p><p> Flint shuddered and reeled on.</p><p> “Where are you?”</p><p> But the voice was lost amid the incessant</p><p>roar of shells rushing down the steep arc </p><p>on to the tortured soil. </p><p> Flint stumbled on from one broken bay</p><p>to another, ducking his head as though to </p><p>shield himself from the storm of steel, and </p><p>seeing in the sudden geysers of flame flung </p><p>upward dark figures of men cowering in </p><p>the muddy trench or clambering into shell </p><p>holes. Some were silent, some swore foully, </p><p>incessantly, terribly, cursing the God that </p><p>168 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>had brought them to this hell, one was </p><p>sobbing bitterly, another standing among </p><p>the dead in a part of the trench where a </p><p>shell had landed uttered wild and devilish </p><p>laughs as though fear had robbed him of </p><p>his soul, and he, as Flint passed, clutched </p><p>him by the apn. </p><p> “Ho! You bloody orf’cer—why ain’t you</p><p>in yer dug-out? All dead, every one of ’em </p><p>—all dead, an’ you an’ me alive.” </p><p> And to each man he saw Flint, stumbling</p><p>along through great gusts of flame, shouted </p><p>words of encouragement, seeking forget- </p><p>fulness of self and what might come at any </p><p>instant in the presence of those less able to </p><p>bear the strain. </p><p> “Get back into the supports, d’you hear</p><p>me? You—there!” </p><p> “Me legs are broken—leave me be.”</p><p> “Are you wounded or not? You!”</p><p>This to a man face downward in a shell-hole, </p><p>moaning. “You’re not wounded? Then, </p><p>- and blast it, get up! Come on, get </p><p>up! Go back into the support line at once! </p><p>It’s your only hope. And you—get on </p><p>back, as I tell you. You can’t stop here, </p><p>and maybe they’re coming over. Oh, for </p><p>-’s sake, get a move on!” </p><p> Rounding what remained of a traverse,</p><p>Flint saw by the light of a star-shell Mason </p><p>crouching motionless in the midst of what </p><p>had once been men lying as the shell had </p><p>scattered them. </p><p> “Mason, old chap, get back into the</p><p>supports. There’s no chance of holding </p><p>the front line.” </p><p> Mason did not speak. He grasped his</p><p>shoulder but Mason toppled over back- </p><p>ward and, Flint stooping down, found that </p><p>he too was dead. </p><p> In the blackness following on the glare</p><p>Flint, alone with the slain, groped his way </p><p>through the drifting smoke of the bombard-</p><p>ment to where a sergeant buried to the neck </p><p>in debris was crying feebly for help. </p><p> “Take me out of this, some one, for</p><p>the love of God! Oh, God! Don’t leave </p><p>me-” </p><p> “All right, Sergeant.” Flint reached his</p><p>side and digging with bare hands began to </p><p>loosen the chalk piled up around him. </p><p>“I’ll get you out. Hang on!” </p><p> He worked with frantic haste, paying no</p><p>heed to the shells, intent only on the rescue </p><p>of one of his men, dragging at the lumps of </p><p>chalk and clay until his nails were torn and </p><p>bleeding. </p><p> “I must get something to dig with,” he</p><p>said hoarsely. “I won’t be long, Ser- </p><p>geant.” </p><p> “Don’t leave me, sir. I can’t stand it</p><p>much longer.” </p><p> Aching in each limb, dizzy with fatigue,</p><p>Flint turned and searched the shell-holes </p><p>until he found a dead man with an en- </p><p>trenching tool blade and handle in his </p><p>equipment. The crash of heavy shrapnel </p><p>bursting overhead threw him to his knees. </p><p>When he staggered back to where he had </p><p>been working, the sergeant was dead, his </p><p>face streaming with blood from a huge </p><p>scalp wound. </p><p> Flint threw the entrenching tool aside</p><p>and laughed bitterly. </p><p> “Oh, what’s the good!”</p><p> The shelling ceased as suddenly as it had</p><p>begun, and the pale pink sky of dawn found </p><p>tired, sleepy, broken men building anew the </p><p>battered fire-trench. </p><p> Flint saw MacDermott, red-eyed and pale</p><p>and covered from head to foot with mud, </p><p>coming toward him. </p><p> “Hullo, Mac,” he said wearily. “It’s</p><p>been the-of a night, eh? I’m about </p><p>done in.” </p><p> “Flint,” said MacDermott, “have you</p><p>seen little Stratton anywhere?”</p><p> “Me! No. I left him in the dug-out soon</p><p>after they started strafing us. He’s there, </p><p>isn’t he? He’d had a bit of a shock or </p><p>something—a shell burst near him and </p><p>knocked him a bit silly. Why, what’s up?” </p><p>MacDermott’s face was very grave. </p><p>“Flint, old man, the whole dug-out’s </p><p>blown to blazes. A shell must have landed </p><p>right on top of it.” </p><p> “Oh, my God! And poor little Stratton.</p><p>-"it!” said Flint fiercely. “I wish to </p><p>God that we’d never—” He broke off </p><p>with a grim laugh. “Oh! Well, what’s the </p><p>use of it? The poor little man’s dead, and </p><p>Mason’s dead—I wonder if they’ve taken </p><p>him away yet. I’m glad the kid wasn’t </p><p>in it. It’s been a bad night, Mac: as bad </p><p>as any we’ve had. By God! We’ll take it </p><p>out of the Huns for this, though; they’ll </p><p>pay for what they’ve done, Mac, or I’m a </p><p>Dutchman.” </p><p>EARLY in the afternoon Derrick </p><p>rejoined the battalion. </p><p> Flint met him plodding up a com-</p><p>munication trench, now no more than a </p><p>wide ditch with crumbling sides. </p><p>The Other Side </p><p> “Why the - are you here?” he de-</p><p>manded. “Where do you think you’re </p><p>going, Derrick?” </p><p> “Front line,” said the boy.</p><p> He spoke gruffly, without raising his eyes.</p><p>And, although in the past twelve hours he </p><p>had seen fear and horror and suffering in </p><p>every degree marked in the faces of his men, </p><p>Flint was shocked by the boy’s looks. His </p><p>color had left him, his eyes were sunken, </p><p>there were hollows in his cheeks, he looked </p><p>worn-out and ill. </p><p> “Front line?” said Flint. “You’ll do</p><p>nothing of the kind. We’ve no front line— </p><p>only shell-holes now—and we won’t have </p><p>till we’ve had a chance to build it up prop- </p><p>erly. I’m not going to have you risking </p><p>your life when there’s no need for it. ’Bout </p><p>turn, kid, and we’ll get along to head- </p><p>quarters; it’s just ’round the corner. </p><p>We’re using another dug-out now, the old </p><p>one’s crumped pretty badly. What made </p><p>you come back?” </p><p> The boy who had turned glanced over</p><p>his shoulder. </p><p> “I heard—they told me you’d had—had</p><p>rather a rotten time last night.” </p><p> “Rather a rotten time! My giddy aunt!</p><p>Lord, kid, we got it in the neck, proper! </p><p>We had thirty-five killed and sixty wounded </p><p>out of the company alone.” </p><p> “My God!” said the boy in a broken</p><p>voice, “and I was out of it, after all.” </p><p> “Out of it! Yes: and I’m-glad you</p><p>were.” They were descending the steps into </p><p>the dug-out. “I couldn’t afford to lose any </p><p>more of my subalterns, kid.” </p><p> “What’s that, Flint? Flint, none of the</p><p>others were knocked out, were they? Don’t </p><p>tell me that, for God’s sake!” </p><p> “Mason and Stratton.”</p><p> “Killed,” said the boy hoarsely.</p><p> “ ’Fraid so!”</p><p> Derrick swayed and Flint caught him.</p><p> “Steady now, old chap, hold up!”</p><p> The boy dropped on to a wooden box and</p><p>sat for a while with his head buried in his </p><p>hands. </p><p>“I shouldn’t have gone. I shouldn’t have </p><p>gone. Oh, my God, why didn’t I stay?” </p><p>“Don’t be a silly idiot, kid! You couldn’t </p><p>have done any good if you’d been here.” </p><p>“Flint,” said the boy, “if I’d known— </p><p>if I’d known-” </p><p> “It wouldn’t have made any difference,</p><p>son, if you had.” </p><p> “And the men?”</p><p> “You’ve never seen a heavy bombard-</p><p>ment, have you, kid? We’ve been lucky </p><p>lately. But last night made up for it. </p><p>From what you read in the papers, you’d </p><p>think our fellows didn’t mind shell-fire.” </p><p>He laughed. “They were broken helplessly, </p><p>and what else could you expect? But God </p><p>help ’em when our chaps get in among ’em </p><p>with the bayonets next time, that’s all.” </p><p>“They’re wonderful, of course,” said the </p><p>boy. “Wonderful.” He sighed. “My </p><p>God! This war is awful. Once—before </p><p>I came out I thought the army was—I hope </p><p>you don’t think me a-fool, Flint—the </p><p>one career a man could have. But it’s </p><p>hellish—simply hellish—and I wish to God </p><p>I’d never-” </p><p> He broke off suddenly and sat staring</p><p>across at Flint with vacant, unseeing eyes. </p><p>Flint frowned. </p><p> “You’re not fit, kid, that’s what’s the</p><p>matter. Why the devil did you come back </p><p>so soon?” </p><p> “I can’t keep away, Flint. I simply</p><p>can’t. You don’t know how I felt when I </p><p>heard what you chaps had to go through </p><p>last night. There was I skulking behind </p><p>the line while the men I was supposed to </p><p>be commanding were being butchered. </p><p>I just couldn’t bear to think of the battalion </p><p>being in action without me, that’s why.”</p><p>“That’s all very well, but—you’re not </p><p>fit, old son, and you’ve got to go back till </p><p>the brigade comes out of the line.” </p><p> “But, Flint,” the boy looked frightened,</p><p>“Flint, you forget—tonight we’re going over </p><p>the top—why, I simply must be here. </p><p>You’ve not altered the arrangements, have </p><p>you, after last night?” </p><p> Flint shook his head.</p><p> “N-no; we’ve not. We’re raiding ’em</p><p>tonight just to prove that their old bom- </p><p>bardments don’t worry us.” </p><p> Derrick was smiling in a puzzled fashion.</p><p>“But, Flint, if we’re going to raid ’em, </p><p>don’t you see that I’ve simply got to go. </p><p>I can’t leave the trenches now—how can I?” </p><p>“I’m afraid you must, kid,” said Flint </p><p>kindly. “You’re not fit and that’s all </p><p>about it. You must have a rest. I’m </p><p>sorry, but we can’t afford to take you. It’s </p><p>not fair on yourself.” </p><p> He stopped, startled by the look of hope-</p><p>less despair that had settled on the boy’s </p><p>face. </p><p> “What’s up, kid? You’re a bundle of</p><p>nerves these days. That night work has </p><p>170 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>been too much of a strain on you—I thought </p><p>it would be. You’ve got to get out of the </p><p>trenches before you’re carried out on a </p><p>stretcher.” </p><p> “My God, Flint! You don’t under-</p><p>stand.” </p><p> “I understand this, kid, that you’re not</p><p>fit: you’re not strong enough for the work </p><p>we’ve got to do tonight. Also I’m not going </p><p>to lose another subaltern for nothing.” </p><p>There were tears in the boy’s eyes. Flint </p><p>stared at him pityingly. He was ill, of </p><p>course, and not himself, otherwise he would </p><p>have long since given in to what was in- </p><p>evitable. By this time he must know all </p><p>arguments were futile. </p><p> “You don’t know what it means to me,</p><p>Flint. You’ve stopped me, just when I </p><p>wanted to do some good. I was hoping—” </p><p>He made a funny almost foreign-looking </p><p>little gesture with his hands. “I’m making </p><p>a fool of myself, aren’t I? And I’m half </p><p>blubbing, too. Sorry I’m such a fool! </p><p>But I’d set my heart on being with the </p><p>crowd tonight when they went into the </p><p>German trenches. And after last night </p><p>it doesn’t seem fair, somehow, to be out of </p><p>it. I wanted to feel I was really part of </p><p>the battalion for once and—and that I was </p><p>sharing the same risks as the others.” </p><p> Flint felt as though he were out of his</p><p>depth. The kid was crazy: he must be; </p><p>no man in the battalion had run more risks </p><p>than he had. What was worrying him? </p><p> “You’ve done more all along than any</p><p>one else, Derrick.” </p><p> The boy shook his head and looked at</p><p>Flint with a curious weariness in his eyes. </p><p> “No, Flint, I’ve not. I’ve done nothing.</p><p>You don’t understand—how could you? </p><p>If you’d let me go over with the company </p><p>tonight I’d prove everything I say now. </p><p>I’m not like you, Flint, I can’t hide my </p><p>feelings. I thought I could, but I can’t. </p><p>I feel as if this war was driving me mad— </p><p>mad with—with anger—or hate. I can’t </p><p>explain, but I hate the people we’re fighting </p><p>like I hate vermin—the rats or lice that we</p><p>get in the trenches.” He shuddered. </p><p> “I hate their methods, their deceit, their</p><p>cruelty, their army, their Kaiser, their </p><p>own particular brand of God—they’re un- </p><p>clean, Flint, like animals—they’re not </p><p>human. I know—how can any one help </p><p>knowing. They want to make the whole </p><p>world like themselves. I hate them more </p><p>than I ever thought I could hate. I want </p><p> to kill some of them, Flint, or—or be</p><p> killed myself. Let me go, for Heaven’s</p><p> sake!”</p><p> Flint listened to the boy’s outburst in</p><p> silence.</p><p> At nineteen one can not have what is</p><p> called a past, of that he was certain; but</p><p> none the less the boy’s manner, his agita-</p><p> tion, his sudden loss of control puzzled him.</p><p> He was nervous and even frightened—</p><p> desperately frightened: yet of what? Not</p><p> of the Germans, certainly. There was</p><p> something wrong somewhere; but the case</p><p> was one that no doctor, however learned in</p><p> the ills of the flesh, could diagnose or pre-</p><p> • scribe for.</p><p> “Well,” said the boy after a while;</p><p> “what are you going to do?”</p><p> “You’ll have other opportunities of</p><p> killing Huns, Derrick. There’s no need</p><p> to worry about that. Y’ou’re not yourself</p><p> and you’ve got to rest. That’s final.</p><p> Stay in the dug-out and go out of the</p><p> trenches tomorrow morning. Only—no</p><p> playing the fool! Understand! You’ll give</p><p> me your word of honor not to disobey</p><p> orders and follow us over, won’t you?</p><p> You must stay at the ’phone and don’t</p><p> leave it.”</p><p> “All right,” said the boy slowly. “I’ll</p><p> do what you say. It’s hard, of course,</p><p> but everything out here is hard, isn’t it?</p><p> Damnably hard.”</p><p>THE raid was a success: even </p><p>Flint had no criticism to offer. </p><p>As it had been planned, days be- </p><p>fore the bombardment, so it was carried </p><p>through, without a hitch. </p><p> The men of Flint’s company had their</p><p> allotted part, on the right flank, and Flint</p><p> knew by the grim look on their faces, the</p><p> stern and sullen manner in which they</p><p> spoke, that they would exact a dreadful</p><p> payment for their sufferings of the night</p><p> before. Bitter as he was, he could find it</p><p> in his heart to pity those Germans who</p><p> were doomed to meet them in battle that</p><p> night. It was a quarter to two when the</p><p> artillery and trench-mortar barrage lifted</p><p> and' Flint and his men went forward into</p><p> No Man’s Land. They advanced slowly</p><p> held back by shell-craters and broken wire;</p><p> above their heads screamed the shells, in</p><p> front of them crept the line of blinding</p><p> flashes which marked the barrage.</p><p>The Other Side </p><p>171 </p><p> The rat-tat-tat-tat-lat of an enemy’s ma-</p><p>chine gun came from the right but with </p><p>few casualties the raiders crossed the open </p><p>and burst into the German front-line trench. </p><p> By the light of the star-shells that shot</p><p>up into the darkness Flint saw the fire-bay </p><p>into which he had jumped crowded with </p><p>men, British and German, jammed together </p><p>and fighting with rifle and bayonet and fist </p><p>and bomb. </p><p> “Clear ’em out, boys!” he shouted.</p><p>“Into ’em.” </p><p> A big German struck at him savagely</p><p>with his butt over the back of a man who </p><p>was striving to hold another down at the </p><p>bottom of the trench. Flint dodged but </p><p>the rifle grazed his left shoulder and he was </p><p>hurled backward. The German threw him- </p><p>self forward and pinned him against the </p><p>counterscarp of the trench, snarling angrily </p><p>the while and shouting in German. Only </p><p>half-realizing what he did, sick with the </p><p>pain in his shoulder, Flint wrenched his </p><p>right hand free and pulled the trigger of his </p><p>revolver. The German with a grunt col- </p><p>lapsed 011 top of the two men who had been </p><p>struggling in the mud. </p><p> “Take ’em off, quick,” shouted a gruff</p><p>voice. “’Urry! I’ve croaked this - </p><p>blighter but I’m ’arf dead meself.” </p><p> After it was all over certain pictures were</p><p>stamped vividly in Flint’s mind, seen in the </p><p>flashes of light in the midst of the blackness: </p><p>a sergeant in his company, a pale, thin-faced </p><p>Nortli-countryman, with blazing eyes, a </p><p>street preacher from Rochdale, wild with </p><p>berserk rage, bareheaded, fighting his way </p><p>through the press, armed like some Cru- </p><p>sader with a butcher’s cleaver: a big, fine- </p><p>looking German, a man of substance per- </p><p>haps in his own village, blood pouring down </p><p>his chin, a horrible fear written on his </p><p>countenance, screaming out guttural prayers </p><p>—prayers they must have been—as with all </p><p>hope of escape gone he awaited the bayonet: </p><p>another—a man with the fierce eyes of a </p><p>ferret—Flint remembered the eyes—fight- </p><p>ing viciously in a narrow part of the trench</p><p>until there came to him, also, the knowledge </p><p>of death: a dug-out entrance, black as the </p><p>pit, and crazy men in khaki, jostling each </p><p>other and shouting out demands that the </p><p>occupants should surrender, then the sud- </p><p>den change of tone: “Give it ’em, boys— </p><p>the beggars won’t come up—we can’t wait </p><p>’ere all night—come on, now—where’s </p><p>them Stokes bombs?” followed by the </p><p>terrific explosions and the shrieks of agony, </p><p>and the dense clouds of smoke: and lastly, </p><p>and this happened as the rocket to recall </p><p>the raiders soared upward and Flint blew </p><p>his whistle, the German officer, scornful and </p><p>haughty and very angry, who was the pris- </p><p>oner of a small, blaspheming private. </p><p> “Look wot I’ve got,” shouted the private,</p><p>“a blurry orficer. Get on, you—or I’ll run </p><p>yer through. I ain’t afraid of the likes o’ </p><p>you. ’Op it!” </p><p> And he drove him before him with wild</p><p>oaths. </p><p> It was the prisoner who became Flint’s</p><p>chief concern once he had got his men, full </p><p>of excitement and the triumph of success, </p><p>back across No Man’s Land now under the </p><p>enemy’s shell-fire, into the shelter of their </p><p>own lines. </p><p> “Sergeant-Major,” he said, “call the roll</p><p>of the company, find out the casualties </p><p>and send any men of A and C back to their </p><p>own companies. And tell Mr. MacDermott </p><p>to take charge for a few minutes. I’ve got </p><p>to ’phone battalion headquarters at once.” </p><p>He turned to the small private who with </p><p>another was guarding the prisoner— </p><p>‘ “Bring that officer along now!” </p><p> Then he made his way down the trench</p><p>to the dug-out. </p><p> Derrick was waiting for him.</p><p> “Hullo, Flint! I heard you were back.</p><p>Everything all right?” </p><p> “Rather! I’m in the devil of a hurry,</p><p>though, and I’ve brought a prisoner.” </p><p> The boy stood in the middle of the floor</p><p>of the small dug-out, lit by candles and full </p><p>of dark shadows. He was smiling a little</p><p>as though with Flint’s return all anxiety </p><p>had gone. An orderly sat on a box in the </p><p>corner. Flint walked over to the telephone </p><p>and the two privates, their khaki and </p><p>equipment covered with mud, brought in </p><p>their prisoner. </p><p> Flint, lifting the receiver from off the</p><p>stand, saw that the boy’s face showed </p><p>strangely gray and worn against the black- </p><p>ness, and the thought came to him that he </p><p>had done wrong in not sending him off to </p><p>hospital. He wasn’t fit, of course. He </p><p>needed a thorough rest before he would be </p><p>any good for the trenches again. </p><p> “Give the prisoner a seat, kid, will you,</p><p>and a smoke?” </p><p> “I don’t think you’ll get through, sii*”</p><p>said the orderly. “We’ve been trying for </p><p>ten minutes. The wires are cut.” </p><p>172 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Curse!” said Flint. “That’s a -</p><p>nuisance.” He hung up the receiver. </p><p>“Well, I’ve got to let headquarters know </p><p>what’s happened so far as D Company is </p><p>concerned.” He nodded to the two pri- </p><p>vates. “All right, you two, you’d better </p><p>cut along now. Wait in the trench till </p><p>you’re wanted. Tell Smith, my batman, </p><p>to give you a drink. Say I sent you.” </p><p> The two privates, grinning their thanks,</p><p> went out.</p><p> Flint turned to the prisoner.</p><p> “Do you speak English?” he asked.</p><p>THE German, cold scorn in his eyes, </p><p> Ig shrugged his shoulders and said</p><p> nothing.</p><p> Flint grunted.</p><p> “H’ml That’s rather awkward. I’d made</p><p>sure every German spoke English.” He </p><p>looked at Derrick. “You don’t speak Ger- </p><p>man, do you, kid?” </p><p> The boy moistened his lips.</p><p> “You know I don’t. I wish I did.”</p><p> And though he spoke to Flint he kept his</p><p> eyes fixed on the tall prisoner with a kind of</p><p> sick horror in his eyes.</p><p> “MacDermott does, anyhow,” said Flint.</p><p> “But he’s the only officer in the battalion</p><p> who can. He’ll have to go down to head-</p><p> quarters with the prisoner.”</p><p> He scribbled a few lines in his note-book</p><p> and glanced at his watch.</p><p> “A quarter past two exactly.” He</p><p>turned to the orderly. “Marshall,” he </p><p>said, “take this back to battalion head- </p><p>quarters as quick as you can. It’s im- </p><p>portant, of course.” </p><p> The orderly picked up his shrapnel</p><p>helmet and respirator, saluted, and dis- </p><p>appeared up the stairs.</p><p> “Well,” said Flint, “that’s done. By</p><p>Jove, I’m tired. It’s been a great night, </p><p>kid. The men were splendid: simply </p><p>glorious.” </p><p> “I wish I’d been with you,” said the boy</p><p> wistfully.</p><p> “I think I’ll go back and see the sergeant-</p><p> major. I’m not quite sure yet what losses</p><p> the company had. And I’ll fetch Mac back</p><p> with me. You’ll stay here, Derrick, and</p><p> keep an eye on our friend. I won’t be</p><p> long.”</p><p> Flint went up into the open air. The</p><p>two privates were waiting. </p><p> “Did you get your drink?” he asked.</p><p> “Yes, sir,” said the men, “thank you, sir.”</p><p> The Germans had begun to shell heavily</p><p>but without accuracy, scattering high ex- </p><p>plosive and shrapnel haphazard over the </p><p>trenches, as though bent on exacting </p><p>punishment somehow but without knowing </p><p>exactly from whom. </p><p> Flint walked on until he came upon</p><p>MacDermott talking to the sergeant-major </p><p>near a machine gun emplacement. </p><p> “Well,” he said, “what’s the result?”</p><p>“I’ve got the names down on the list, </p><p>sir,” said the sergeant-major. “There’s </p><p>only five not accounted for. Three men </p><p>killed and seven wounded. Prisoners taken </p><p>by D Company eleven: that includes the </p><p>officer, sir.” </p><p> “Good business!” said Flint. “That’s</p><p>great. Mac, I want you to go down to </p><p>battalion headquarters with the prisoner. </p><p>You’re the only officer in the battalion that </p><p>speaks German and I think we must find </p><p>out one or two things before we hand him </p><p>over to the tender mercies of the intelligence </p><p>people.” </p><p> “Who’s with him?” said MacDermott.</p><p>“No one, except the kid. When I left </p><p>they were glaring at each other from oppo- </p><p>site sides of the dug-out like a couple of wild- </p><p>cats. As neither of them can understand </p><p>a word the other says I suppose they’ll keep </p><p>on doing it. Hallo!”</p><p> A shell burst with a roar at the back of</p><p>the trench down which they were walking. </p><p>“By Jove! That’s nearer, Mac.” </p><p> “H'm. The Huns are angry.”</p><p> “Don’t wonder,” said Flint. “We gave</p><p>’em something to be angry for.” </p><p> The noise of the guns made talking</p><p>difficult, and they hurried on in silence </p><p>down the muddy trench until they reached </p><p>the entrance to the dug-out where the two </p><p>privates still waited crouching against the </p><p>sand-bags. </p><p> “Everything all right?” said Flint.</p><p> “Yes, sir.”</p><p> “Any one else in the dug-out beside Mr.</p><p>Derrick and the prisoner. No other </p><p>officer?” </p><p> “No, sir.”</p><p> “Right! Well, you’d better wait where</p><p>you are. We won’t be a minute. Go on, </p><p>Mac. You first.” </p><p> MacDermott stepped through the door-</p><p>way and on to the stairs that led down to the </p><p>dug-out. Flint followed, looking back over </p><p>his shoulder and listening to the fierce </p><p>cracking of shrapnel bursting near at hand. </p><p>The Other Side </p><p>173 </p><p> And then MacDermott’s fingers gripped</p><p> his wrist with a warning pressure.</p><p> From the dug-out there came the sound</p><p> of a low, guttural voice talking angrily.</p><p> For a moment, Flint, his thoughts back</p><p> in the trench where the shells were dropping,</p><p> could attach neither importance nor sig-</p><p> nificance to what was happening.</p><p> Some one—the prisoner—was speaking.</p><p> Why not? Why shouldn’t he speak?</p><p> Why shouldn’t he even speak in German?</p><p> He wondered impatiently why MacDermott</p><p> had stopped: what he was listening for?</p><p> And then it flashed into his mind that</p><p> there were two people only in the dug-out—</p><p> Derrick and the German officer—and that</p><p> ' neither could speak the other’s language.</p><p> The German officer must be speaking to</p><p> himself, then.</p><p> All at once a strange premonition of dis-</p><p> aster stole over him.</p><p> “What is it?” he said. “Why are you</p><p> stopping, Mac?”</p><p> MacDermott relaxed his grip on his wrist</p><p> and moved on, quickly and softly, down the</p><p> steps into the lighted dug-out.</p><p> The boy, white to the lips, faced the tall</p><p> German, who glared at him scornfully.</p><p> “What’s the matter?” said Flint. “Any-</p><p> thing wrong?”</p><p> “I don’t know.” The boy hesitated.</p><p> “He began to talk to himself in German—</p><p> I didn’t understand, him.”</p><p> At that the German threw back his head</p><p> and gave a short laugh. Then he spoke a</p><p> few, sharp words in German.</p><p> “God Almighty!” said MacDermott</p><p>harshly. </p><p> “What is it?” said Flint. “What the</p><p> devil’s happening?”</p><p> He glanced from one to the other:</p><p> MacDermott, his face like stone, grim and</p><p> hard; the German, smiling contemptuously,</p><p> his eyes half-closed, his teeth showing in a</p><p> sneer under his fair upturned mustache;</p><p> and Derrick, looking like death itself, so</p><p> strange and ghastly was his expression.</p><p> For a brief space, while one might have</p><p> counted ten, no one spoke.</p><p> The German laughed once more and</p><p> bowed in an ironic manner, first to Flint,</p><p> then to MacDermott, and lastly to Derrick.</p><p> Then he spoke in English.</p><p> “I am afraidt, chentlemen, dot I have</p><p> been deceiving you. I can speak English</p><p> well, but not so well as our young friendt</p><p> here can speak Gherman, of course.”</p><p> “What do you mean?” said Flint. “You</p><p>can’t speak German, Derrick, can you?” </p><p>“You do not believe me, hey?” said the </p><p>German. “All right! Den why does he </p><p>not say somesing—dot traitor to Cher- </p><p>many? He can not. He knows dot der </p><p>game is finished.” </p><p> “What the blazes are you driving at?”</p><p>said Flint roughly. “A traitor to Ger- </p><p>many! Are you crazy?” </p><p> “Crazy!” said the German bitterly.</p><p>“Mein Gott! No. I say it again. A </p><p>traitor to Chermany! He knows. See him </p><p>now!” </p><p> The thing was monstrous. So mon-</p><p>strous, indeed, so outrageous and absurd, </p><p>that it meant nothing. </p><p> Flint felt that he was growing angry.</p><p>Also he was frightened. Something was </p><p>happening which he could not understand: </p><p>something that was perfectly clear to the </p><p>other three. </p><p> He turned swiftly to the boy.</p><p> “Derrick, what is it? Why don’t you</p><p>speak? Why don’t you put an end to </p><p>this - foolishness? This swine here is </p><p>calling you a traitor! And a traitor to </p><p>Germany, too! Why? Because you’re </p><p>fighting for your own country against his?” </p><p>There was no reply. The boy merely</p><p>stared in the same dazed way at the big </p><p>German. So, thought Flint, might a </p><p>cornered hare have watched the huntsman. </p><p> “His country,” said the prisoner in a</p><p>quiet voice. “Vot is dot? Dot officer of </p><p>yours is a Cherman; I am ashamed to say </p><p>it. I am in your hands, chentlemen; if </p><p>you kill me, it is der fortune of war... But </p><p>it is my duty, der duty of a Cherman officer </p><p>to make sure dot der traitor is punished.” </p><p>“Stop that!” said Flint angrily. The </p><p>threat in the German’s tone warned him </p><p>of danger. “Put your hands up this </p><p>instant, you fool, or I’ll shoot!” </p><p>BUT before Flint could move, even </p><p>while he was still speaking, the </p><p>German sprang, tigerlike, so swift </p><p>and terrible was his onslaught, and gripping </p><p>the boy’s throat in his two hands sent him </p><p>headlong against the boarded wall of the </p><p>dug-out. </p><p> P’lint jerked his revolver from its holster</p><p>and, with a feeling of savage satisfaction, </p><p>fired. The German relaxed his grip and </p><p>fell with a clatter to the floor. Derrick </p><p>shoved him away and staggered to his feet, </p><p>174 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>choking. MacDermott dropped to his </p><p>knees and turning the wounded man over </p><p>raised his head. A dark red patch stained </p><p>the front of his field-gray tunic. His florid </p><p>face had lost its color, and his eyes were </p><p>closed. Flint waited in silence without the </p><p>slightest feeling of compassion. </p><p> The German had deserved to die. He</p><p>had told black lies about a British officer, </p><p>about an officer in the best battalion in </p><p>the British army. Death was almost too </p><p>good a punishment for such carrion. Der- </p><p>rick, a German—the very idea was pre- </p><p>posterous. A lie? Of course it was a lie. </p><p>Reason fought and triumphed over sus- </p><p>picion in Flint’s consciousness. </p><p> “He’s gone,” said MacDermott.</p><p> “Not yet,” said the German; “not yet,”</p><p>and he made an effort to raise himself. </p><p> MacDermott slipped his arm under his</p><p>shoulders and eased him up. </p><p> “He may escape me, but—dere are dose</p><p>he will not escape. Chermany will neffer </p><p>forgive! He has told you lies—and—” the </p><p>prisoner’s eyes were glazed and dull, his </p><p>breath came in deep sobs— “and he has told </p><p>lies to us. He will die—a traitor—but I— </p><p>die—for Chermany.” </p><p> His head sank forward on to his chest.</p><p> “He’s dead, I think,” said MacDermott,</p><p>and he lowered him gently to the ground. </p><p> For a time no one spoke. The gun-</p><p>fire sounded like distant surf beating on </p><p>the shore. MacDermott frowning a little </p><p>was rubbing the blood from off his hands. </p><p>Flint watched him curiously. </p><p> “Well?” said the boy in a husky tone.</p><p>“Well?” </p><p> “Did he hurt you?” asked Flint.</p><p> “No,” said the boy. “Oh, no!”</p><p> “I wonder if they heard the revolver?”</p><p>said Flint. “I don’t think so. There’s </p><p>such a dickens of a row going on, they’d</p><p>hardly notice it.” He stopped short, afraid </p><p>of what he must say next: then with an </p><p>effort he went on quickly. “A - He, </p><p>kid, eh? What he said about you!” </p><p> The boy raised his hands and let them</p><p>fall helplessly to his sides. </p><p> “No,” he said hoarsely. “No, it’s true,</p><p>I’m not English, Flint. He was right. </p><p>I’m a traitor to Germany—because I’m a </p><p>German.” </p><p> An icy coldness gripped Flint’s heart.</p><p>As at a distance far away, he heard a stern </p><p>voice his own voice, speaking. </p><p> “You’re what?”</p><p> “I’m German.”</p><p> “You’re German!” He spoke slowly as</p><p>though to let the significance of what the </p><p>boy had said sink into his mind. “You’re </p><p>German? Oh!” He paused, pondering. </p><p>“But—you’re fighting for us, Derrick. </p><p>That’s why you’re a traitor to Germany. </p><p>I see now. That’s what he meant, isn’t it?” </p><p>And at that the boy gave a low, mirthless </p><p>laugh. </p><p>“Flint, don’t you understand even now? </p><p>MacDermott does: he heard. Don’t you </p><p>understand that I was—was helping them?” </p><p>“Helping them!” said Flint dully. “Help- </p><p>ing the Germans!” </p><p> And then all at once Flint understood.</p><p>He felt that he was being stifled, that he </p><p>must get out into the fresh air or he would </p><p>choke. His throat seemed to have con- </p><p>tracted so that it was difficult to swallow, </p><p>his heart hammered against his ribs, there </p><p>was a black mist before his eyes so that he </p><p>could scarcely see and a singing in his </p><p>ears. </p><p> “Oh, my God!” he whispered. “Oh, my</p><p>God! So it’s true, after all!” </p><p> “Yes,” said the boy, “it’s true.”</p><p> “And I believed in you—I trusted you—</p><p>I’d rather have had you with me in a tight </p><p>place than almost any other man I’ve ever </p><p>met—and you’re a German!”</p><p> The very thought hurt him. It seemed,</p><p>even now, impossible. The kid, a German! </p><p>An enemy! </p><p> “My God! it’s a-L he. It must be!”</p><p> Again and again he came back to that:</p><p>the impossibility of an officer in his battalion </p><p>being an enemy. </p><p> “It’s the truth, Flint,” said the boy</p><p>wearily. “I’m a German—a German spy. </p><p>I was, at least: I’m not now. Ask Mac- </p><p>Dermott; he heard him talking to me. But </p><p>I’ll tell you everything from the beginning. </p><p>I must: I’m not quite such a cur as you </p><p>think me, Flint. Maybe, when I’ve ex- </p><p>plained, you’ll understand. When I re- </p><p>member what you’ve done for me, and </p><p>how-” </p><p> Flint stopped him.</p><p> “All right, Derrick. Never mind that</p><p>now. How did it happen?” </p><p> “It began years ago before the war was</p><p>thought of—thought of, by you, at least. </p><p>They knew, of course, and they had me </p><p>trained for this—just for this end. I came </p><p>over to England when I was quite small </p><p>and lived with my uncle in London. He </p><p>The Other Side </p><p>175 </p><p>wasn’t an uncle, really, but he passed as </p><p>one, and to all intents and purposes I was </p><p>the same as any other boy at school.” </p><p> He stopped suddenly.</p><p> “What’s the good?” he asked. “It hurts</p><p>—like—like hell.” </p><p> “Go on,” said Flint. “Finish it now</p><p>you’ve started.” </p><p> And all the while there raced through his</p><p>mind again and again, keeping time to the </p><p>pounding of his heart, the awful truth: </p><p>Derrick, a spy! Derrick, a spy! Derrick, </p><p>a spy! </p><p> “Flint, you remember what you told us</p><p>that night—the night the old French- </p><p>woman heard her last son was killed at </p><p>Verdun—that a man must be ready to give </p><p>all to his country—to do what he’s told to </p><p>do without questioning: that was what I </p><p>was doing. It was for Germany. And, </p><p>Flint, it wasn’t easy. Sometimes even </p><p>when I was at school I funked it—it seemed </p><p>so hopeless—and then I’d remember it was </p><p>for Germany, the—the Fatherland, and </p><p>that seemed to smooth over all difficulties. </p><p> “I wasn’t quite old enough for Woolwich</p><p>or Sandhurst before war broke out but I </p><p>went to Sandhurst afterward. There was </p><p>no difficulty about that. They were clever, </p><p>Flint—you don’t realize how clever! No- </p><p>body had any suspicions about me. Why </p><p>should they? You didn’t, did you? They </p><p>had money, influence, friends, everything </p><p>to help them succeed. And then I came </p><p>out here. T don’t think they could have </p><p>known which battalion and brigade I was </p><p>coming to—I didn’t know myself till I left </p><p>the base—but they knew as soon as I got </p><p>here. Why? I left a message at the gap in </p><p>their wire the first night I went out with you! </p><p> “My work was easy. All I had to do was</p><p>to let them know what was going to happen. </p><p>I might have been killed by German shells </p><p>or bullets, of course, but what of that? I </p><p>was a soldier, and it was my duty to risk my </p><p>life for my country. They’d taught me that </p><p>early. Flint, don’t you see that I was doing </p><p>as much for Germany as you—as you were</p><p>for England? Don’t you see that it was my </p><p>duty to help Germany in every way I could? </p><p>“I USED to go out on patrol when- </p><p>ever I had the chance. I went over </p><p>to their lines, of course. They’d </p><p>give me helmets, rifles, anything I wanted, </p><p>for souvenirs so that you might think I’d </p><p>taken them myself from men I’d killed. </p><p> “And you remember the night I went out</p><p>with Dyer, Flint, don’t you? I had to get </p><p>rid of him. He was in my way. He’s </p><p>not dead. You might let his wife know. </p><p>I had him taken prisoner and he’s safe </p><p>in Germany. They won’t let him write </p><p>though—not yet. </p><p> “You remember, too, after I came that</p><p>the battalion had a quiet time in the line. </p><p>You said I’d brought luck. God forgive </p><p>me! It was quiet because they knew I was </p><p>here. They kept their guns off our sector </p><p>because of me. And then-” </p><p> His face was very pale, but his eyes, full</p><p>of trouble and pain as they were, met </p><p>Flint’s steadily, his voice, though so low </p><p>that at times it sank almost to a whisper, </p><p>was firm. </p><p> “There was Garnett’s battery, too,</p><p>Flint, I’ll have the deaths of those men on </p><p>my conscience till my dying day—” He </p><p>stopped short with a hard laugh. “My </p><p>dying day—my God—that doesn’t say </p><p>much—does it?” </p><p> Flint shivered. Horror was piling upon</p><p>horror. </p><p> “I gave away the battery positions—</p><p>showed ’em on the map where each gun- </p><p>pit was—and they knocked out the whole </p><p>battery the next day. That was hell. </p><p>Garnett was killed. And I’d done it. </p><p>I’d killed him as surely as though I’d put </p><p>a bullet through him. I was doing what </p><p>I’d been trained to do, what I knew was </p><p>my duty, yet I felt sick. 1 went through </p><p>hell in those days, Flint. This—” again </p><p>he gave a hard little laugh—“this is noth- </p><p>ing—it’s come as—as a relief almost after </p><p>what’s happened.” </p><p> “Oh, my God!” The cry came from</p><p>Flint’s heart. “Derrick, man, think what</p><p>you’re saying! Do you know what you’ve </p><p>just told me? Do you understand that </p><p>you’ve said that Garnett and Ills men </p><p>were killed through you?” </p><p> “Yes,” said the boy. “Through me</p><p>Garnett was killed. You remember, Flint, </p><p>saying I looked ill? I was. I’ve never </p><p>felt—I didn’t believe any one could feel— </p><p>like I felt. There have been nights, Flint, </p><p>when I lay awake till dawn—just wondering </p><p>what would happen to me and praying to </p><p>God that I’d be killed before you found out. </p><p>I was always frightened of that: always. </p><p>Well, it doesn’t matter now. You know, </p><p>and it’s finished. </p><p> “But what I’m getting at is this, Flint.</p><p>176 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>V </p><p>I learned after I’d been out here a few </p><p>weeks that I was no longer a German. I </p><p>looked an Englishman, I spoke like one— </p><p>that’s why I’m here, of course—and I felt </p><p>like one. I wasn’t German any more. It’s </p><p>true, Flint, as true as Gospel. I’d lived in </p><p>England too long. England was home, the </p><p>only home I knew: English people and the </p><p>English country; Sussex and Surrey and </p><p>Devon and Somerset: English fields and </p><p>woods and streams and orchards. They </p><p>were home to me. And when I came out </p><p>here I had to do my best to go back on </p><p>everything that meant anything at all. </p><p> “All my sympathies were with the</p><p>British, and I hated Germany and what </p><p>Germany stood for. They’d sent me to </p><p>England to become as English as I could. </p><p>I’d done so; but I’d gone further than </p><p>they meant me to. What else could I do </p><p>but hate myself? I’d seen the battalion </p><p>in the trenches, I’d got to know the men, </p><p>to like them, to know what they were, </p><p>how splendid and fine and gentle, I knew </p><p>what they suffered, what they’d done out </p><p>here, and I knew—and this was as bad </p><p>as anything, Flint—I knew that some of </p><p>those men under my command, in my </p><p>platoon, would be killed because of what </p><p>I was doing. Do you wonder that I was </p><p>nearly mad at the thought? Are you sur- </p><p>prised now that I looked sick? </p><p> “Flint, I knew that bombardment last</p><p>night was coming. They told me and </p><p>I’d been ordered to get away from the </p><p>trenches. I told them once I could work </p><p>it, whenever I wished—I could too—and </p><p>then I determined I wouldn’t. If the men, </p><p>my men, were to go through hell, I’d stay </p><p>with them. I’d stick it the same as they </p><p>did. But you wouldn’t let me: you sent </p><p>me away. I couldn’t tell you, could I? </p><p>You mayn’t believe all this, Flint, but it’s </p><p>the truth, every word of it. I’d rather </p><p>have been with the company in the bom- </p><p>bardment than where I was. </p><p> “And, Flint, I knew that this raid was</p><p>coming off: I had known it, as soon as </p><p>you did. But I never told them. They </p><p>had asked me if we were going to come</p><p>over in this sector: I said that we weren’t. </p><p>That was a lie, of course. I wouldn’t tell </p><p>them. I kept putting it off. It didn’t seem </p><p>fair, somehow: and when I heard the guns </p><p>last night and knew that my men were </p><p>being killed, I swore that I’d be in the raid </p><p>myself. </p><p> “I wanted to kill, to show I was English,</p><p>body and soul, before being killed. I </p><p>wanted to show I could fight as well as the </p><p>rest of you, and you stopped me again. </p><p>Flint, that broke my heart. If I’d died </p><p>out there fighting the Germans, as I hoped </p><p>to die, you’d never have known—and now, </p><p>.what am I? A German, a German spy, </p><p>a traitor to Britain, a traitor to Germany, </p><p>and I’ve no country.” </p><p> He stopped talking and Flint, rousing</p><p>himself from the stupor into which he had </p><p>fallen, looked at him and saw in his face </p><p>the hopelessness of despair and the knowl- </p><p>edge of what he really was, an outcast, an </p><p>object of scorn in the eyes of all right- </p><p>thinking men. </p><p> And all at once Flint realized as never</p><p>before, how young the boy really was, how </p><p>forlorn and lonesome and yet how brave: </p><p>a feeling of horror surged over him as he </p><p>thought of what must have been the ordeal </p><p>through which he had passed: and he knew </p><p>also that there was no hope. Through </p><p>Derrick Garnett had been killed. Never </p><p>since the far-off days of Marlborough when </p><p>the regiment first carried its colors into </p><p>battle, nor through the years of fighting </p><p>that followed, in Germany, in North </p><p>America, in the West Indies, in Egypt, in </p><p>Spain and Portugal, in France and Bel- </p><p>gium, in India and in Russia, not even in </p><p>time of disaster or defeat, had the loyalty </p><p>and honor of one of its officers been ques- </p><p>tioned. </p><p> A spy! A German spy! Flint whispered</p><p>it to himself and shivered. One of their </p><p>officers was a spy! And Garnett was dead! </p><p>MacDERMOTT was the first to </p><p>break the silence. “He’s right, </p><p>Flint. I heard that—” he nodded </p><p>toward the dead German lying on his back </p><p>on the floor—“call him a traitor. He said </p><p>that he’d broken his word, gone back on </p><p>the fatherland—I dunno—he said a lot of </p><p>things.” He turned to the boy. “You</p><p>told him that you wouldn’t go on with what </p><p>you were doing, wasn’t that it?” </p><p> “Yes,” said the boy wearily. “He asked</p><p>me if I’d known of the raid. I told the </p><p>truth for once. I said I had, and that </p><p>I hadn’t given them any warning because </p><p>I’d never warn them again—of anything. </p><p>I was not fighting for them any more.” </p><p>Flint uttered a groan of agony. </p><p> “My God! Mac! It seems impossible—</p><p>The Other Side </p><p>177 </p><p>impossible. One of our officers! And all </p><p>the time I thought he was fighting for us, </p><p>he was fighting for Germany, doing his best </p><p>to get us beaten.” </p><p> “Well,” said the boy roughly, “what</p><p> are you going to do with me?” He waited</p><p> a moment for a reply, and then continued.</p><p> “What is it to be? Will you shoot me?</p><p> Make me a prisoner? Tell the colonel?</p><p> Have me tried by court-martial?”</p><p> The boy was standing with his back</p><p> to the table: he held himself upright, his</p><p> head tilted slightly back, his shoulders</p><p> squared; his hair had been rumpled in</p><p> the scuffle with the German, he had a bruise</p><p> on his cheek bone, his collar was torn open,</p><p> showing his throat. MacDermott leaned</p><p> against the wall on the opposite side of the</p><p> dug-out, his hands in his pockets, his face</p><p> half-hidden by the shadow cast by the steel</p><p> helmet he still wore, only his mouth showed</p><p> grim and stern.</p><p> Between them on the rough chalk floor</p><p> lay the German officer, his wide-open eyes</p><p> staring up at the ceiling, his arms bent and</p><p> his fists clenched, his gray uniform stained</p><p> with mud and blood. From a dark corner</p><p> of the dug-out a huge gray rat, encouraged</p><p> by the deep silence, came out, but as Flint</p><p> spoke, turned and scampered back to its</p><p> lair.</p><p> “Tell the colonel!” said Flint slowly.</p><p> “Have you tried by court-martial! And</p><p> have every one in the division know that</p><p> you—in our battalion—that you-”</p><p> He could not force himself to finish.</p><p> The boy smiled.</p><p> “That I was a German spy, sent here by</p><p> Germany, paid by Germany. Why not?”</p><p> “I hate saying it,” said Flint grimly,</p><p> “but I wish to God, kid, you’d been killed</p><p> before you told us! You were right in want-</p><p> ing that, it would have been better that</p><p> way. We’d never have known—never.</p><p> As it is, they’ll all know: every one. It’s</p><p> bound to come out now: everything.”</p><p> “Why is it?” said the boy.</p><p> . “How can we stop it?” said Flint sternly.</p><p> “Derrick, there’s one thing I can not do.</p><p> It’s out of the question. I know what</p><p> war is. Who better? Each one of us must</p><p> do as he’s told. I don’t blame you. How</p><p> can I? You did what they ordered you</p><p> to do—for your country. You knew the</p><p> consequences of failure. Can I let any-</p><p> thing stand in the way of doing what I know</p><p>is my duty? Can I-” </p><p> 12</p><p> Derrick interrupted him.</p><p> “I’m not asking for mercy, Flint. That</p><p>would be no use to me, now. I’ve gone </p><p>too far. No one wants me, I’m finished, </p><p>but, Flint, I’d like as few people as possible </p><p>to know what I really was. You don’t want </p><p>others to find out, either, do you?” </p><p> “I don’t,’’.said Flint, “but know they</p><p>must sooner or later.” &gt; </p><p> “Mayn’t there be—an—an accident,</p><p>Flint? Let me go out my own way. No </p><p>one will know, then, and—if I thought that </p><p>the men had no suspicion of what I’d </p><p>been-” </p><p> Flint looked up to find Derrick’s eyes</p><p>fixed on him, and in them he read an appeal </p><p>for pity that his lips could never have put </p><p>into words. </p><p> “That’s the only possible way out, Flint,”</p><p>said MacDermott suddenly. “No one save </p><p>us three—” he looked at the dead man once </p><p>more—“need ever know.” </p><p> “Are you strong enough, Derrick?” said</p><p>Flint. </p><p> The boy’s lips quivered, then he drew</p><p>himself up proudly. </p><p> “Yes. I am. It’s the one chance I’ve</p><p>got. It’s that or—or every one knowing.” </p><p>“Derrick,” said Flint, “I’ll do as you say. </p><p>But I want you to answer me one question </p><p>before—before you go. Was there any </p><p>one else on this side helping you?” </p><p> The boy shook his head.</p><p> “No one. I’ve been working on my lone</p><p>ever since I left England. I’m speaking </p><p>the truth, Flint, honestly.” </p><p> “Good Lord, I know that! Of course</p><p>you are.” </p><p> He hesitated.</p><p> “Have you any—any one, you’d like to</p><p>write to, Derrick? Any of your people?” </p><p>And as he spoke there came to Flint’s </p><p>mind the memory of the night in the farm- </p><p>house when the old Frenchwoman had </p><p>heard of her son’s death and Derrick had </p><p>asked if in tune of war a man were justified </p><p>in doing anything he could to help his own </p><p>people. </p><p> The boy shook his head, and Flint watch-</p><p>ing him wondered if after all he were </p><p>breaking under the strain. His eyes were </p><p>clouded with suffering, a tear trickled </p><p>slowly down his cheek, his teeth were </p><p>pressed deep into his lower lip, and yet, as </p><p>though to prove his unconcern, he tried to </p><p>smile. </p><p> “No,” he said finally, “there’s no one.</p><p>i78 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>No one in the world. The only people I </p><p>care for are here—in the battalion. So </p><p>there’s nothing to worry about. I’ve no </p><p>papers of any kind. But if—if there’s any- </p><p>thing, Flint, and you, Mac, that you’d like </p><p>to keep out of my things—I wish you would. </p><p>I won’t ask you to—perhaps you’d rather </p><p>forget me.” </p><p> “Thank you,” said Flint. “I’ll take</p><p>something, if I may. And, Derrick, have </p><p>you anything planned?” </p><p> “Yes,” said the boy. “I’ll manage. I’d</p><p>rather it were in the open, though, and not </p><p>down here. Do you mind?” </p><p> “There’s not much time,” said Flint</p><p>wearily. “It must be getting near dawn </p><p>now.” </p><p> He found it difficult to speak. Hardened</p><p>as he was to war’s horrors this going out </p><p>to die was far more terrible than anything </p><p>he had thought possible. His duty as a </p><p>soldier was clear, yet he had need of all his </p><p>resolution and control to hide the pity and </p><p>tenderness he felt toward the boy whose </p><p>story he had heard. </p><p> Death on the battlefield was nothing.</p><p>Had Derrick died at the head of his men </p><p>fighting the Germans, he would have had </p><p>no pity, only sorrow that the boy was no </p><p>longer with him, and pride that he had </p><p>met a soldier’s end. But to die as Derrick </p><p>would die, alone and friendless, knowing </p><p>that by his very obedience to orders he </p><p>had forfeited all right to live, seemed to </p><p>Flint a grim and tragic mockery of all they </p><p>fought for. Yet Derrick must die, as the </p><p>men of Garnett’s battery had died, because </p><p>the world was at war. </p><p> He led the way up to the trench.</p><p> “You’ll stay here and let me go on by</p><p>myself, Flint, won’t you? I’d rather,” said </p><p>the boy. </p><p> The shelling had ceased. In the east the</p><p>sky was a pale saffron. A solitary star shone </p><p>in the dusky blue. A faint breeze blew from </p><p>the north bearing with it the scent of Summer. </p><p> Flint drew in a deep breath.</p><p> “It’s going to be a fine day,” he said</p><p>slowly. </p><p> The boy, his face clear-cut and very pale</p><p>in the half-light, stood by his side. </p><p> “Yes, it will be a fine day.”</p><p> The two small privates were fast asleep,</p><p>huddled up in a corner of the trench, still </p><p>gripping their rifles. </p><p> “Poor little devils,” said Flint. “I</p><p>forgot all about ’em.” </p><p> “They’ve had a hard time of it,” said the</p><p>boy. “You wouldn’t think to look at </p><p>them that they were the men who’ve beaten </p><p>the greatest fighting nation in the world. </p><p>Look at them!” </p><p> Flint touched the boy’s arm. The</p><p>thought of Garnett killed by the side of his </p><p>guns hardened his heart. </p><p> “Come on, Derrick,” he said. “We can’t</p><p>waste any more time; I’ve not been to </p><p>headquarters yet. They’ll be worrying. </p><p>Have you planned what you’re going to do£ </p><p>There mustn’t be any mistake about it, </p><p>whatever it is.” </p><p> The boy nodded.</p><p> “It will be all right, Flint, I’ll take care.”</p><p>He hesitated. “I don’t like to ask it, but </p><p>I’d feel better if you and Mac would shake </p><p>hands with me before I go. Will you?” </p><p>“Of course,” said Flint, thrusting out his </p><p>hand. “Why not? Good-by, kid. You’re </p><p>-brave over it all. It’s too late, now, </p><p>but—I wish to God I’d shot that German </p><p>in his own trenches.” </p><p> The boy drew himself up and saluted.</p><p>Then he turned and made off toward the </p><p>front line. Flint watched him disappear </p><p>around a bend in the trench. </p><p>F "’**5 “THERE goes one of the best sol- </p><p>f 7:' *diers I’ve ever seen. That’s the </p><p>finish, Mac. Poor, poor kid!” </p><p> A lump came to Flint’s throat and he</p><p>could not speak. </p><p>“Supposing he doesn’t do it?” said </p><p>MacDermott in a husky whisper. “Sup- </p><p>posing he goes across to the Germans!” </p><p>Flint, conscious all at once of the pain in </p><p>his bruised shoulder, answered him fiercely. </p><p> “I hope to God he does. But he won’t,</p><p>Mac. He’ll never go back on his word. </p><p>That’s why I let him go.” </p><p>As he spoke the stillness of the dawn was </p><p>shattered by the crash of an exploding bomb. </p><p> “He’s done it,” said Flint. “Poor, poor</p><p>kid! I was right, Mac. That’s the end.” </p><p>They waited on in the narrow trench </p><p>until at last a man came running toward </p><p>them, his face pale, his voice hoarse with </p><p>the horror of the news he brought. </p><p> “Sir, Captain Flint, an awful thing’s</p><p>happened.” </p><p> “Well,” said Flint sharply, “what is it?</p><p>Speak up, man!” </p><p> “There’s been an accident, sir. Mr.</p><p>Derrick’s been killed by a bomb he was </p><p>looking at.” </p><p>the: overland freighters </p><p>By E. A. BRIN INSTOOL </p><p>MO COMPILE even approximate </p><p>statistics of the overland travel </p><p>and freighting across the plains </p><p>before the advent of the rail- </p><p>road, would be an impossible task. It is </p><p>estimated however that forty-two thousand </p><p>persons made the overland trip by wagon </p><p>in 1849 alone. On the heels of this vast </p><p>migration immense freighting facilities </p><p>sprang up. By the ’6o’s it is stated that </p><p>sometimes as many as five hundred heavily- </p><p>laden wagons passed old Fort Kearney in a </p><p>single day. In 1865, six thousand wagons, </p><p>each carrying from one to four tons of </p><p>freight, passed this same post. </p><p> One firm alone,, and that one the great-</p><p>est—Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell—at the </p><p>height of their freighting operations em- </p><p>ployed six thousand two hundred and fifty </p><p>wagons and seventy-five thousand oxen. </p><p>These immense freighting wagons were </p><p>seventeen feet long and six feet deep, with a </p><p>capacity of from five thousand to sixteen </p><p>thousand pounds each, and cost from eight </p><p>hundred to fifteen hundred dollars each. </p><p>First-class mules, five hundred to one </p><p>thousand dollars a pair; harness, three </p><p>hundred to six hundred dollars to the ten- </p><p>mule team, besides salaries, provisions and </p><p>incidentals. In brief, a first-class freight- </p><p>ing outfit in the days of the plains travel </p><p>cost as much as an up-to-date vestibuled </p><p>passenger train of today. </p><p> The height of this freighting was the</p><p>period from 1850 to 1869. The floating </p><p>population then on the plains was about </p><p>two hundred and fifty thousand. In 1865 </p><p>over twenty-one million pounds of freight </p><p>was shipped from Atchison, Kansas, alone, </p><p>requiring 4,917 wagons, 8,164 mules, 27,685 </p><p>oxen and 1,256 men. </p><p> The tariff of the overland freighters be-</p><p>tween Atchison and Denver—six hundred </p><p>and twenty miles—averaged as follows: </p><p>flour, nine cents per pound; sugar, thirteen </p><p>and one-half cents; bacon and dry-goods, </p><p>fifteen cents; whisky, eighteen cents; glasS, </p><p>nineteen and one-half cents; trunks, twenty- </p><p>five cents; furniture, thirty-one cents. </p><p> The above is the tariff on a very small por-</p><p>tion of what constituted a freighter’s load.</p><p>Everything went by pounds. The trip from </p><p>Atchison, Kansas, to Denver, Col.—620 </p><p>miles—took twenty-one days for wagons </p><p>drawn by horses or mules; five weeks for ox- </p><p>trains. </p><p> Another of the greatest of these freighters</p><p>and stage-line kings was Ben Holliday. At </p><p>the height of the overland business he </p><p>operated nearly five thousand miles of </p><p>daily mail stages, with about five hundred </p><p>coaches and express wagons, five hundred </p><p>freight wagons, five thousand horses and </p><p>mules, besides a host of oxen. </p><p> On the main line he used two thousand</p><p>seven hundred and fifty horses and mules </p><p>and one hundred Concord coaches. It cost </p><p>fifty-five thousand dollars for the harness </p><p>alone, and his feed bill was one million </p><p>dollars a year. To equip and run this line </p><p>for the first twelve months cost two million </p><p>four hundred and twenty-five thousand </p><p>dollars. The Government paid Holliday a </p><p>million dollars a year in mail contracts. In </p><p>1864 grain was twenty-five cents a pound </p><p>along the line, and hay as high as one hun- </p><p>dred and twenty-five dollars a ton. In a </p><p>single day, one of Holliday’s grain buyers </p><p>contracted for seven Missouri River steam- </p><p>ers to load with corn for Holliday’s army of </p><p>horses and mules! </p><p> On top of all this was the tremendous</p><p>losses occasioned by the Indian depreda- </p><p>tions. Between i8'64-i866 the savages so </p><p>crippled his stage line—nearly all the stage </p><p>stations for a hundred miles being burned, </p><p>the stock stolen and the men killed—that </p><p>the loss was close to half a million. </p><p> But Alexander Majors was probably the</p><p>best-known and best-loved of all the over- </p><p>land freighters. He died about 1900. He </p><p>was a Kentuckian, a Christian gentleman, </p><p>who never drank, nevec-swore and who made </p><p>every one of his employees sign a contract </p><p>not to drink, swear or gamble, under </p><p>penalty of dismissal from his service. </p><p> Majors’ stage line from Denver to Salt</p><p>Lake had a run of over six hundred miles </p><p>without a single town, hamlet or house on </p><p>the entire route. Between Leavenworth </p><p>and Denver he had one thousand mules and </p><p>fifty coaches. The first of these “hoss- </p><p>power Pullmans” reached Denver May 17, </p><p>1859, occupying six days for the six hund-</p><p>red and sixty-five-mile journey. Horace </p><p>Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune, </p><p>was one of the passengers. </p><p> But the coming of the railroad across the</p><p>plains in 1869 drove romance forever from </p><p>the great silent stretches, just as the advent </p><p>of the telegraph made the Pony Express </p><p>but a memory. </p><p>179 </p><p>THE American Legion, suggested and </p><p>originally organized by us of the Camp- </p><p>Fire, was turned over to the Government in </p><p>December, 1916, and thereby went out of </p><p>existence as a private organization. Only </p><p>partial use was made of it, but that was not </p><p>the Legion’s fault and the work it was doing </p><p>beforehand is the same work the Govern- </p><p>ment has had to do since we went into the </p><p>war. Military authorities considered it the </p><p>most practical step taken for defense before </p><p>the war, and it had high value as propa- </p><p>ganda in a country that at the time cer- </p><p>tainly needed to be waked up to the peril </p><p>that has since materialized. We need feel </p><p>only proud of the organization we started. </p><p> Even after a year and a half men try to</p><p>join it. Its mail still comes in and is for- </p><p>warded from its old address to me. From </p><p>its former secretary, Dr. John E. Hausmann, </p><p>I hear frequently. He is a captain in the </p><p>Quartermaster’s Department, though he </p><p>preferred the Medical Corps and is trying to </p><p>get to France. From what I can hear the </p><p>reason he doesn’t get to France is that he </p><p>has made himself too valuable where he is </p><p>and they won’t let go of him. Here’s luck </p><p>to him and may he see France. In several </p><p>letters he has sent his regards to the Camp- </p><p>Fire and I transmit them herewith. </p><p>brute physical creature to something more spiritual, </p><p>endangered by the wolves of anarchy as Civilization </p><p>begins to break down. But anyhow, if you don’t </p><p>enjoy the allegory, don’t let it spoil the story for </p><p>you, please.—Eugene P. Lyle, Jr. </p><p>I ADMIT I didn’t even suspect the </p><p>allegory in his story in this issue until </p><p>Mr. Lyle told me about it. It might be </p><p>well if those of you who are as dull as I </p><p>would not read what follows until you’ve </p><p>read the story. We took it because we </p><p>liked it as a straight story. The allegory </p><p>part, therefore, is velvet so far as we are </p><p>concerned, but knowing about it before- </p><p>hand might check the swing of the story </p><p>itself. </p><p> I suppose you have noticed that this story has a</p><p>stolen plot—that I stole it from the Great War, </p><p>with Germany and the Entente fighting for Su- </p><p>Eremacy and Jonathan Sam standing by (at least </p><p>e was then), and Supremacy changing from a </p><p>HERE’S part of a letter from Frank II. </p><p>Huston which I pass on to you.</p><p>“Uncle Frank” knew the Indians inti- </p><p>mately in the old days: </p><p> Some tribes scalped differently, as did individuals;</p><p>occasionally (the latter) skinning whole head, again, </p><p>with ears attached, or pieces from the side of the </p><p>head, but tha “lock” differed. Some Atlantic </p><p>coast tribes shaved and left a piece extending to fore- </p><p>head like the dewdad on a Roman helmet or shaved </p><p>all but the actual lock, the “whorl” at back of </p><p>head. </p><p> Plains tribes did not shave head, being neither</p><p>Mussulmans or Mongols. </p><p>T3EFORE scalp dried it was stretched on a little </p><p>hoop and cured, then trimmed and pared, and </p><p>when attached to articles of dress the skin part was </p><p>rolled into size and shape of pencil or little finger </p><p>and attached. How do I know? Well, after hav- </p><p>ing been called a “damned gowl” by an army officer </p><p>I surely ought to know. Had not all my effects </p><p>been destroyed some years ago by a fire would send </p><p>you some samples, bona fide ones at that, but not as </p><p>well fixed up as Injun cured. But greater honor </p><p>than taking a scalp was batting a strike or “coup” </p><p>with the hockey or shinny-shaped coup stick. Re- </p><p>member Many or Plenty Coups, Ty Cobb, as it </p><p>were, of his day, or is it Honus? Any squaw could </p><p>kill or scalp, but to hit a corpse or “blesse” with the </p><p>coup-stick in the heat of action was a greater achieve- </p><p>ment and so honored. </p><p>QURE I got a medicine-bag, and have opened </p><p>many a one, same as we used to open the skin- </p><p>wrapped dead uns stuck up on pole platforms when </p><p>lucky enough to find them. When the upright </p><p>skin i&gt;oles rotted and fell, or were blown down, the </p><p>varmint cleaned up the rubbish, but sometimes a </p><p>comparatively fresh one was found and even to </p><p>windward was far from fresh. Those book or closet </p><p>ethnologists, and some of the field variety, suffer </p><p>from a species of strabismus, even can’t see what is </p><p>before their nose or distort it from their civilized </p><p>view-point, sort of like English and French view of </p><p>our customs, etc.—“them us an’ us them.” </p><p> Look into the political economy of Dakota Con-</p><p>federacy, its pure democracy, and find that “men of </p><p>wealth” did not exist, or they gathered wealth only </p><p>to turn over to the clan or tribe and so “acquire </p><p>180 </p><p>The Camp-Fire	181</p><p>merit.” Red Cloud, three separate times was worth </p><p>or gathered Injun wealth to the value of an Ameri- </p><p>can equivalent of $20,000 and other “big chiefs’' </p><p>nearly as much, all of which was gathered, not for </p><p>personal use, but for the tribe. </p><p>'T'HE word Dakotah, meaning men, typifies </p><p>“them people.” They were men, except in the </p><p>eating line. There was nothing an old-time plains </p><p>Injun would not eat, except apples and fish. After </p><p>one had seen a buck with a yard or two of milk guts </p><p>hanging out of his jaw, a hunk of raw, hot liver in </p><p>one hand, and a gob of the undigested contents of the </p><p>critter’s paunch in the other for a vegetable relish, </p><p>one could understand why you could smell ’em a mile </p><p>to windward. Summer camps were not bad, but </p><p>Winter camps, Wooh! The trenches in Yoorup </p><p>aren’t in it. Every one stripped at night even at </p><p>forty degrees below. Just naturally had to or be </p><p>eaten alive. My skin crawls yet and it’s fifty years </p><p>or more. (A strange fact is that the Yankee troops </p><p>had. more lice than ours. Why? Never could rea- </p><p>son it out.) A Texas law used (if not now), to pro- </p><p>hibit Injuns entering or living within the borders of </p><p>the State. Too much Comanche, and by-the-by, </p><p>the Comanches used to have a queer scalp-lock, ap- </p><p>proximating the Pawnees’ and Kioways’, who were </p><p>undoubtedly of the same original stock. </p><p> And the plains Indians or mcat-eaters used to</p><p>have a profound disgust for the N. W. tribes whom </p><p>they termed “fisheaters,” as an Englishman uses the </p><p>term Hun, or an American, wop, dago, mick or hunk. </p><p>pLEASE don’t say skunk-skin but “taft-skin.” </p><p>And “pipe” ceremonies varied, in some, pre- </p><p>sented with both hands, bowl to right or left. Pipe </p><p>in council passed, if I remember, to left-hand party. </p><p>Hard to remember after so many years. Any old </p><p>pipe would not do, certain pipes for certain occa- </p><p>sions, and “pipe-keepers” who guarded the same. </p><p>Smoking was religious or ceremonial, as on occasion </p><p>of receiving visitors, councils, powwows, and was </p><p>sucked like a Chink sucks a dope-pipe. Everything </p><p>per ritual; in fact, their whole lives were per ritual. </p><p>Do you know the reason of the waddling shuffle of </p><p>the squaws? Roping. And the law of the roping </p><p>of the legs, and the many ways it was done and pen- </p><p>alties for violation? Do you know the working of </p><p>what whites would call divorce? That women were </p><p>not bought as wives, except occasionally a captive? </p><p>That the home pertained to the squaw; she could fire </p><p>the buck out if she felt like it? Oh, heaps of things </p><p>that nine-tenths of the book-writers never fathomed. </p><p>AND do you remember how the army and plains- </p><p>men roared in mirth when the Meeker outfit</p><p>women protested that the Injuns had been Galahads </p><p>with them? First thing done was to violate the </p><p>person of a woman captive, sometimes even in a </p><p>fight. </p><p> And do you know of the milliards of secret so-</p><p>cieties and how some went broke buying captives </p><p>from neighbors and giving ’em their liberty? A </p><p>bunch of Yanktonais adolescents did that right after </p><p>New Ulm and Col. Chivington and his 1st Col. Cav. </p><p>at Sand Creek started the war that ended in ’91 at </p><p>Wounded Knee by massacring the So. Cheyennes </p><p>who came in for a council? That “dog soldiers” </p><p>were the police and were the only ones who could </p><p>strike or man-handle or legally “bump” a tribes- </p><p>man? The voyagers mixed up dog soldiers with </p><p>Cheyennes, who were not Dakotahs but conquered </p><p>and incorporated with the latter. </p><p>AND do you know what caused the big cicatrices </p><p>on breasts and shoulder-blades of the bucks? </p><p>The ordeal of the Sun Dance and Rain in the Face, </p><p>through enmity to the medicine-man who “slit” him, </p><p>endured longer and busted more muscle and flesh </p><p>than any other ever known. That marriage went </p><p>by clans, the laws being frequently unobserved, but </p><p>the violation frowned upon, as when an Eagle took </p><p>a Turtle to wife? That a band was not always all </p><p>one clan, but various weaker bunches who joined </p><p>some well-known astute chief, or followed a famous </p><p>war chief? That government was by the “elders” </p><p>and not by individual chiefs, and that obedience to </p><p>any order of a chief was voluntary and optional? </p><p>LJI HO, I wish I was young again and those days </p><p>were back!

Did you ever “tootle tootle” with the flute </p><p>and then the “Twa” wrap up and sit under a </p><p>blanket?

And </p><p>did you ever hear of “The Young Man whose </p><p>horse would not go,” otherwise “Standing Horse”? </p><p>(He was not an Injun by birth.) And did you ever </p><p>trade booze for “cattriges” and sell ’em to the In- </p><p>juns? If not, make the sign rapidly by moving </p><p>the open hands, palms facing, an inch or two apart, </p><p>up and down in a chopping motion (meaning “stop” </p><p>or, done quickly, “shut up,”) or wave your hand, </p><p>palm outward, right and left in front of you (mean- </p><p>ing "no”; also, “enough,” “no more”). </p><p>WITH their new serial beginning in this</p><p>issue the following from Kathrene </p><p>and Robert Pinkerton will be of interest. </p><p> Father Jacques Marquette is generally con-</p><p>sidered the discoverer of the Mississippi River. </p><p>By most historians the credit is given to Louis </p><p>Joliet, who was trained for exploration work through </p><p>many years and finally sent out to find the “great </p><p>water” by the Governor of New France. Mar- </p><p>quette, who had spent several years on the southern </p><p>shore of Lake Superior and at the north end of </p><p>Lake Michigan, had the Jesuit desire to find new </p><p>lands and new peoples to bring into the church. </p><p>He planned the trip for several years and it is </p><p>possible that it was arranged that he and Joliet </p><p>make the journey together. </p><p>A FTER their return from the voyage of dis- </p><p>covery, which look them far down the river </p><p>and back to Lake Michigan by way of the Illinois </p><p>River, Marquette remained on Lake Michigan </p><p>that he might return to establish a mission among </p><p>the Illinois the next Summer. He wrote of his </p><p>voyage and drew a map of the northern Mississippi </p><p>valley, which he sent to Montreal, but he died </p><p>about two years later after a visit to the Illinois. </p><p> Joliet, with complete accounts of his discoveries</p><p>and a good map of the great valley and its water- </p><p>ways, hastened to Montreal. When only a few </p><p>182 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>miles from the city his canoe was overturned in </p><p>some rapids in the St. Lawrence and he barely </p><p>escaped with his life. His map and account had </p><p>only his memory as a basis, but these were sent to </p><p>Paris at once. </p><p> Because of this accident, Marquette’s journal</p><p>and maps were the ones to receive publication a </p><p>few years later, and early historians in this century </p><p>credited him with the discovery. Researchers now </p><p>generally give Joliet the credit, at least equal credit. </p><p>TJ OWEVER, though there are no records of </p><p>actual discovery, any historian who has dug </p><p>into original sources of information, grants readily </p><p>that there is no doubt that some of the coureurs </p><p>de bois reached the Mississippi and even went </p><p>beyond it before Marquette and Joliet reached it </p><p>June 17, 1673. These Frenchmen, trading without </p><p>royal license as many of them did, were forced to </p><p>keep their journeys secret. Many of them were </p><p>forced to trade with the Dutch and English at </p><p>Albany, N. Y., where they obtained goods and </p><p>sold their furs. They were a wild, daring, irre- </p><p>sponsible class of men, and there were several </p><p>hundred of them in the region about the western- </p><p>most of the Great Lakes. Nothing daunted them, </p><p>neither Indians nor the immensity of the wilderness, </p><p>and there is no reason to doubt that more than </p><p>one of them crossed the “great water,” but never </p><p>mentioned that fact when he returned to the St. </p><p>Lawrence. Nicolet was within three days’ paddle </p><p>of the Mississippi River when he was on the Wis- </p><p>consin forty years before Marquette arrived, and </p><p>any coureur de bois had the information necessary </p><p>to reach the Mississippi. </p><p>TJEUBEN GOLD TH WAITS, who knew more of </p><p>the history of the first days on the upper </p><p>Mississippi than any other man, said there was no </p><p>doubt that several coureurs de bois were ahead of </p><p>Marquette and that it was even possible that an </p><p>Englishman from the Colony of Virginia had pene- </p><p>trated to the great river prior to 1673. It was this </p><p>statement that suggested the story, “Before Mar- </p><p>quette.” </p><p> We had been impressed for several years by the</p><p>romantic story of the first French in Wisconsin, </p><p>Minnesota, Illinois and Michigan. It is a hazy </p><p>story, the more alluring and romantic because so </p><p>much is only suggested, because there are so few </p><p>facts, and yet room, for reasonable but marvelous </p><p>deductions. </p><p>TTIE life of the coureurs dc bois is largely the </p><p>basis for this. Few men have been given the </p><p>opportunity for more wonderful adventures. Yet </p><p>the very nature of their operations made publicity </p><p>undesirable and historical allusions little more than </p><p>imagination - arousing conjectures. There were, </p><p>however, some able, upright men among them, as </p><p>Nicholas Perrot, and in “Before Marquette” we </p><p>have tried to show the worst and the best of the </p><p>coureurs de bois. </p><p> Our information was obtained entirely from</p><p>original sources, some works, as Perrot’s, having </p><p>just been published in English. The Jesuit Rela- </p><p>tions have long been known, but Perot, in what </p><p>was intended as a confidential report to the In- </p><p>tendent of New France, told of his life of thirty </p><p>years on the Great Lakes and Upper Mississippi </p><p>River and gave minute descriptions of the Indians, </p><p>their many inter-tribal wars, their migrations, and </p><p>also their customs, habits, etc. </p><p>'T'HE American public has never understood the </p><p>Indian and has never known what he is really </p><p>like. Fiction, massacres and the results of in- </p><p>justice had induced queer conceptions, and yet the </p><p>Indian of the upper Mississippi valley before the </p><p>coming of white men was far different than he is </p><p>today. One reason for drawing a more intimate </p><p>sketch of the Sioux was to show how vastly dif- </p><p>erent he was from the man Custer met in Wy- </p><p>oming. </p><p> Another thing that has never been recognized</p><p>in fiction, and by only one historian, and that is the </p><p>effect of the fur trade on the spread of civilization. </p><p>It was for fur and fur alone that all the first trails </p><p>were blazed, and the story of the upper Mississippi, </p><p>down to the fall of the fur trade less than a hundred </p><p>years ago, has been duplicated in Canada and the </p><p>history of discovery there. </p><p>■\A/E WERE both born and have lived much </p><p>of our lives in the region described in “Before </p><p>Marquette.” Many of the scenes are familiar to </p><p>us, though it is hard to imagine Marquette Win- </p><p>tering at the forks of the Chicago River after seeing </p><p>the man-made river of today. We have paddled </p><p>many of the streams Dick Jeffreys traversed, have </p><p>camped where he camped, and in writing the story </p><p>have lived over again many of our experiences. We </p><p>have sat for hours on the great bluff from which </p><p>Dick first saw the “great water,” and now we are </p><p>confronted with the necessity of forgetting Dick and </p><p>his journeys. If we don’t, we’ll really believe he did </p><p>discover the “father of waters.”—Kathrene and </p><p>Robert Pinkerton.</p><p>'T'HE suggestion, by C. R. Rollings at a re- </p><p>cent Camp-Fire, that we should pay our </p><p>tribute to the late Jack London has met </p><p>with such response that there is not room </p><p>for all the tributes that have come in. Nor </p><p>is there need of all of them in print; the fact </p><p>that they came is the important one, and </p><p>one or two can typify our Camp-Fire feeling </p><p>for the great and loved adventurer who has </p><p>left us. </p><p> Personally I never met him and our slight</p><p>acquaintance is limited to a letter or two </p><p>and to the fact that he was an interested </p><p>member of our Camp-Fire. And yet even </p><p>the few written words from him are suffi- </p><p>cient to establish him as what he was—not </p><p>just a famous writer and adventurer, but a </p><p>real man. It is only this simple tribute that </p><p>I can pay him from my own acquaintance </p><p>with him, yet if you understand that simple </p><p>tribute as it is given you will know it is high </p><p>praise. </p><p> Let us listen to the words of our com-</p><p>rade of the writers’ brigade, J. Allan </p><p>Dunn, and to the poem he has written to </p><p>his friend: </p><p>The Camp-Fire	183</p><p>T-JEARTILY in accord with the suggestion of Mr. </p><p> Rollings at a recent Camp-Fire, I feel that the</p><p>memoriam of Jack London is, in a measure, up to </p><p>me. In all probability he and I were more intimate </p><p>than was the case with other members of the Camp- </p><p>Fire who personally knew him but this privilege </p><p>but makes me feel the more inadequate to fulfil the </p><p>task. » </p><p> I think one of the greatest attributes of Jack Lon-</p><p>don was the brave gentility of his spirit. In the </p><p>beginning all things were against him, he trailed </p><p>in the mire by force of circumstance, he saw the </p><p>seamy side of the world, and, while his spirit re- </p><p>volted against the injustice, the inhumanity that he </p><p>encountered, so that in youthful bitterness he ac- </p><p>counted himself an outlaw, yet his inherent sweet- </p><p>ness was unspoiled and when his full manhood was </p><p>achieved, his soul used his harsh experiences only </p><p>as a means to belter sympathize and understand </p><p>and to treat them as a flux by which his genius </p><p>crucibled the real impulses of humanity. </p><p>\/f ANY there are who have sel Jack London down </p><p>as a roughneck and a Socialist, little knowing </p><p>the man. There have been attempts to show him </p><p>as lacking in American patriotism, as a pacifist. A </p><p>pacifist! Jack London was ever a fighting man. A </p><p>biography of him might aptly be styled A Fight </p><p>with Fortune. He was always fighting, against </p><p>poverty, against lack of education; he fought for </p><p>opportunity, he wrote for years before he achieved </p><p>either recognition or a bare livelihood; he fought for </p><p>years against sickness, with a body weakened in the </p><p>very beginning by the lack of fair food and lodging, </p><p>weakened yet more by stomach troubles, aggravated </p><p>by the hardships of his travel in strange seas and </p><p>lands under unfavorable conditions, his nervous sys- </p><p>tem largely smashed by tropical sun-rays in the </p><p>Snark voyage. His spirit maintained a false but </p><p>vibrant virility. It was ever buoyant, ever gener- </p><p>ous. I have known many days when Jack London </p><p>fought off sickness to accomplish his allotted task, </p><p>and at the very end, he wrote until the final uncon- </p><p>sciousness overcame him. And he always fought </p><p>smiling. Obstacles to him were only tilings to be </p><p>surmounted. He bucked his way to the mastery </p><p>of words, he never ceased to study. When naviga- </p><p>tion was wanted he went at it while handling his </p><p>own roving vessel and mastered it..-Smiling. He was </p><p>a magnificent fighter. He loved life and loved to </p><p>live, and the pity of it was that one so truly vital, so </p><p>eminently understanding of the prime motives of us </p><p>all, should have gone in his prime. </p><p>'T'O ME he is not dead. He was on his way to</p><p>visit me when stricken down and now the mem- </p><p>ory of him, the inspiration of him is so vivid, so </p><p>enlivening that I know his spirit moves and has its </p><p>being in some strong measure here. If I meet him </p><p>on some stretch of Elysian sand he will be no </p><p>stranger and the place will be no longer strange. If, </p><p>according to certain creeds, he and I should meet in </p><p>Hades, that spot will have lost much of its allotted </p><p>terrors—and Jack London will still be smiling. </p><p> He was nearly read out of the Socialist party for</p><p>his “Iron Heel” in which he conservatively—accord- </p><p>ing to his own conviction—set the Socialistic mil- </p><p>lennium hundreds of years ahead and hinted that it </p><p>must come from within, bom of a universal desire. </p><p>He separated himself entirely from the party when </p><p>he found its trend was against the Democracy of </p><p>America and the participation of that democracy in </p><p>behalf of the rights and freedom of its citizens and </p><p>their allies. </p><p>gOCIALISM to him was an ideal and, with ma- </p><p>turer years and judgment, he did not always </p><p>find himself in harmony with the actions of its more </p><p>ardent propagandists. Yet always he welcomed </p><p>those he had styled “comrades’' in the days of his </p><p>trampdom and social outlawry. Seldom was the </p><p>little cabin on the ranch at Glen Ellen without some </p><p>vagrom occupants, exploiting Jack London.' It </p><p>got to be so bad that, in sheer defense, Mrs. London </p><p>and Nakata, most lovable and faithful of Japanese </p><p>majordomos, conspired to stop the lavish food sup- </p><p>plies and Jack was himself brought to see that his </p><p>generosity was being abused. Yet Jack, in the dead </p><p>of night, would steal down silently and rob his own </p><p>cellar, burglarizing the lock and packing a sack of </p><p>flour and a ham across the ranch to set it down out- </p><p>side the door where those ever-sleepy “brethren” </p><p>of his drowsed content in their belief in Jack’s easy </p><p>hospitality. Besides this, he held out a sure hand of </p><p>encouragement and employment for certain men who </p><p>had served their time in San Quentin or Folsom. </p><p> Nor, with a hundred calls on him, with his words</p><p>worth each one what would have bought him a meal </p><p>in earlier days, did Jack ever hesitate to set aside </p><p>his own affairs and help some struggling author or to </p><p>welcome a boys’ school or some such caravan that </p><p>came to see Jack London. He was pre-eminently </p><p>human. Adversity sweetened his spirit rather </p><p>than soured it, and prosperity—self won—still fur- </p><p>ther ripened it. </p><p>JACK rode fearlessly, he could sail his ship and </p><p>guide it, he could swing a coaching-team skil- </p><p>fully across skiddy pitches and tool them with the </p><p>utmost chivalry and appreciation of their efforts.</p><p>He swam like a Kanaka and dived like Neptune. </p><p>Apparently he never tired. He was a he-man who </p><p>stood up and grinned at trouble, was absolutely </p><p>frank in self-analysis and confession and held a </p><p>charity toward the weaknesses and backslidings of </p><p>others, coupled with the will and action to help, that </p><p>made him a potent example of real Christianity. </p><p> A strong spirit and a sweet one. Unaffected, des-</p><p>pite all rumors. Jack abominated a stiff collar </p><p>because he felt better without one. Never was a </p><p>man who posed less. </p><p>'T'HE story-teller absolute, his tales echo with </p><p>reality because he wrote only of what he knew, </p><p>what he had seen, enlivened with his genius, his </p><p>intuition for what a man must feel. And always he </p><p>sought and traveled so that his store of knowledge, </p><p>so largely unused, might increase. Absolutely lack- </p><p>ing in conceit, he called his wonderful technique </p><p>“tricks.” He was the first to acclaim merit in </p><p>others and the first to abominate charlatanry of all </p><p>kinds, save as he might forgive it in his friends for </p><p>the better sides of them he knew. “Brass tacks,” </p><p>he would cry, when guests spoke metaphysics. </p><p>“We are living now, we can not get away from the </p><p>‘now.’ Get down to brass tacks. Let us argue </p><p>along tangible lines.” </p><p> Jack London was a living answer to that vexed</p><p>question of whether an adventurer can ever forsake </p><p>the camp-fire for the home-side hearth and whether </p><p>the love of woman can ever take the place of the </p><p>wander-love. Of the wonderful intimacy between </p><p>184 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Jack London and Ckarmian London I shall say </p><p>little. Its tics were and are sacred as they were per- </p><p>fect. I do not cite them as an example. Their </p><p>unity was made up of an affinity welded and re- </p><p>fined by understanding, sacrifice, unselfishness that </p><p>is only too rare. But he showed that the true wan- </p><p>derer need not go mateless. </p><p>No one can analyze genius. London wrote of </p><p>what he had seen and heard and lived, his motif was </p><p>life and the red blood of him tinctures the ink in </p><p>which his words are printed. Jack London the </p><p>writer, lives in his books. Jack London the man, </p><p>was, despite his differences with the propaganda of </p><p>that party to which he felt himself intuitively </p><p>affiliated, a true Socialist. He was plucky, he was </p><p>generous to a fault, utterly unselfish, absolutely </p><p>frank. To all who came in contact with him he was </p><p>a true comrade. </p><p>AND man and writer are indissolubly linked. </p><p> He called up the nomad spirit of his own</p><p>Nordic race, the '‘vanishing blond,” as he was </p><p>wont to style it. He challenged, he challenges, in </p><p>all of us the viking mood, the desire to go beyond </p><p>the rim of things, to fight, to conquer if possible, or </p><p>to go down fighting—and smiling. He lifted us out </p><p>of the commonplace, he made the daily round less </p><p>sordid for a while, he revived romance is hearts </p><p>made dull by drudgery and this not less by the clear </p><p>fire of his own fighting manhood as by the flame of </p><p>his genius. By all the tokens he was a man. </p><p> A few of us who knew him very well, and know the</p><p>deeds he did in secret as well as in the open, called </p><p>him “Greatheart.”	„</p><p>J.

Where at one time lived 6,(XX) to 7,000 </p><p>people, with nicely built, painted houses, a 75-room </p><p>hotel, lots of stores, saloons, dance-halls, etc., etc., </p><p>nothing is left, not a board or brick, nothing except </p><p>the glamour of its remembrance. In fact in driving </p><p>along the road one would never know that a thriving </p><p>and prosperous community had ever existed there. </p><p>Originally the town was the headquarters of the </p><p>Eldorado Ditch Company, who constructed a ditch </p><p>ICO miles long to bring the water to these rich </p><p>places. Some idea of the magnitude of the enter- </p><p>prise may be gained from the fact that the rents </p><p>for the privilege of using this water ran as high as </p><p>§150,000 to §175,000 in the total, annually. </p><p>QEVERAL miles from the site of Eldorado is the </p><p>town of Malheur, known in the early days as </p><p>“Malheur City,” which was also one of the principal </p><p>headquarters of the early-day placer-miners. Here </p><p>still remain a few stores and houses, and an Odd </p><p>Fellows’ Hall, reminiscent of the “good old days,” </p><p>inhabited by possibly fifty or sixty people, but all </p><p>The Camp-Fire	185</p><p> the “glory” of former days has long since departed.</p><p> Several miles beyond Malheur, right by the road</p><p>and in the midst of the sage-brush-covered prairie, </p><p>is a small bright green spot, enclosed by a fence, </p><p>where the luxuriant grass still thrives from the </p><p>adjacent spring—as it were, an oasis in the desert. </p><p>Here, away off by itself, once flourished a prosper- </p><p>ous brewery, located there on account of the water </p><p>being particularly adapted to the manufacture of </p><p>beer—good beer and, believe me, lots of people </p><p>wish it were still there, but alas! nothing remains </p><p>but the grass and the spring. </p><p>OTILL farther on is the site of the old town of </p><p>Amelia, where naught but a battered old out- </p><p>house remains of a busy and populous community </p><p>of forty years ago. A few miles beyond lies Mormon </p><p>Basin, said to have been one of the richest placers </p><p>in the world and originally located by the Mormons </p><p>—tradition tells us they used to carry the gold away </p><p>by wagon-loads. I have never heard this verified </p><p>by any one who saw the “wagon-loads,” but the fact </p><p>remains that it was one of the richest districts ever </p><p>known. Placer-mining is still carried on in a small </p><p>way by one or two who employ the few old China- </p><p>men yet remaining of the many who were brought </p><p>there in the early days (Chinese were always used, </p><p>preferentially, in this work on account of their in- </p><p>herent honesty; at least, it is said, a greater percent- </p><p>age of them were honest than of other nationalities). </p><p>A4ILLIONS of dollars in gold was produced from </p><p>, these big rich placers and we are told that the </p><p>‘mother lode” which fecj them has never yet been </p><p>discovered by reworking the old ground with more </p><p>modem methods. We occasionally see one of the </p><p>old-time prospectors, still searching for his “ledge,” </p><p>always cheerful and optimistic and will be until </p><p>the end. </p><p> This whole section of country is replete with</p><p>legends and traditions, romantic and interesting, </p><p>dealing with the early life amongst the sturdy </p><p>pioneers, the miners and Indians—a good field for </p><p>the historian and story-writer, with ample room </p><p>for the exercise of his talents. </p><p> The writer first came West as a boy in 18S0,</p><p>living on the Idaho frontier, where many exciting </p><p>events happened, and is glad indeed to note the </p><p>Camp-Fire’s efforts to correct errors and preserve </p><p>authentic records of those events and happenings </p><p>incident to that stirring and strenuous period as </p><p>well as of the people who participated therein and </p><p>helped make history.—“Q.” </p><p>THROUGH the courtesy and </p><p>thoughtfulness of Mr. B. W. Denison, </p><p>Sunday editor of the Chicago Herald, </p><p>I received the following telegram: </p><p> April 17, 1018.</p><p> Arthur J. Hayes died Tuesday at Camp Grant of</p><p>pneumonia. </p><p> He is the second of our comrades of the</p><p>writers’ brigade to die within a short time, </p><p>and though he just as truly gave his life for </p><p>his country as if he had died in the trenches, </p><p>we know that he would rather have passed </p><p>out fighting. </p><p> We will remember him for his stories,</p><p>notably that fine dog story “The Epic of </p><p>Silver King,” but we remember him also as </p><p>our comrade. Let us turn back to what he </p><p>said to us something over a year ago when, </p><p>according to our custom, he stood up and </p><p>introduced himself to the Camp-Fire: </p><p> Chisholm, Minnesota.</p><p> Your forwarded le:ter was received in the Pelican</p><p>Lake country several days ago. The half-breed </p><p>trapper who obligingly brought it in from Orr was </p><p>not returning, so I was unable to get my reply out </p><p>more promptly. I have been on the trail of the </p><p>vanishing lumberjack for the past week, endeavor- </p><p>ing to tone up my local color for a series of stories. </p><p>The old two-fisted, red-sliirted calk-booted char- </p><p>acter of earlier eras has disappeared. The old </p><p>tote-trails are grown in with grass, and the tar- </p><p>paper flaps, a forlorn specter, on the ridge-pole of </p><p>the camps that were. To-day they build with </p><p>milled lumber, import “Jacks” who pack their be- </p><p>ongings in straw suit-cases, and who have attained </p><p>the effeteness of unions, labor agitation, and or- </p><p>ganized strikes, and drag the log-laden sleighs with </p><p>caterpillar tractors. But to gi t to the autobiography: </p><p>WAS born in Duluth, Minnesota, in the early </p><p>nineties. My earliest recollections arc of </p><p>that strip of strangely wild territory between the </p><p>Mesaba Range and the Rainey River. Knew it </p><p>when the Indians killed swimming moose with </p><p>axes from canoes and shot whitefish endeavoring to </p><p>leap Kettle Falls. Have vague recollections of the </p><p>high ebb tide of the Seine River gold-rush, an </p><p>aftermath of the Klondyke Frenzy, when thousands </p><p>of gold-seekers poured into Mine Center in quest of </p><p>an Ontario El Dorado. They poured out again, </p><p>disgusted and disillusioned. The stamp-mills and </p><p>shafts, long since abandoned, are among the show</p><p>places of the Rainey. </p><p> It has been my lot, hitherto, to live rather on the</p><p>fringe of things. Saw the only gold brick the Foley </p><p>Mine ever turned out, and the troops that poured </p><p>in after the Nett Lake fiasco in ’99. Have ridden </p><p>eight miles about one jump ahead of a forest fire, </p><p>and witnessed the burning of Chisholm, in 1908, </p><p>in the Slate’s greatest conflagration. Knew most </p><p>intimately, perhaps, all phases of the Minnesota </p><p>lumberjack existence. Have seen him in his hey- </p><p>day and decline. There -re some corking good tales </p><p>in the old mackinawtd Vikings of the pine country </p><p>J-J AVEN’T adventured myself, but have been </p><p>rarely fortunate in meeting in the out-of-the- </p><p>way places many a man who had. Have done cub- </p><p>re[&gt;orting, attended college, and instructed sundry </p><p>classes in rhetoric. I like the lonesome trails and </p><p>the men from the far horizon. Will annex an LL. B. </p><p>in June, but aspire rather to journalism and fiction. </p><p>The family have pioneered from my birth and have </p><p>seen the older, wilder days of the Iron Ranges. </p><p>Regret that I can not qualify with Camp-Fire's </p><p>first-hand performers.

I have studied the auto- </p><p>tire repair business from A to Z, with the Goodrich </p><p>Tire Works. Have just 3250 cash. Is there an </p><p>opening for me in South America—Brazil preferred? </p><p>Do you know of any one with whom I might com- </p><p>municate as to the chances of repair business in </p><p>Rio? I can’t speak the lingo but can stenograph </p><p>as a side line.”—John Phelan, Akron, Ohio. </p><p> Answer, by Captain Dingle:—If I am to advise</p><p>you on South America, I must begin by stating </p><p>frankly that I believe Argentina and Uruguay oSer </p><p>much the greater possibilities to settlers or im- </p><p>migrants. </p><p> Brazil is a great country; but the cultivated—</p><p>or cultivatable—portion is settled to a far greater </p><p>degree than other places; and business needs far </p><p>more drumming up there than in the two countries </p><p>I mention. One other thing is, that the language </p><p>must be learned if a man expects to ever amount to </p><p>much in business. You can easily realize that. If </p><p>a Frenchman or Chinaman or Greek comes here, </p><p>he can not carry on much business until he leams the </p><p>language of the country, can he? Well, then; </p><p>that’s your position in South America, without </p><p>the language. In Brazil you need Portuguese; in </p><p>most of the other places Spanish is used. </p><p> Your knowledge of stenography is under the</p><p>same handicap. Not many concerns can afford to </p><p>employ clerks with only one language, if that one is </p><p>a foreigner. There are, of course, a few openings; </p><p>such as Government offices having much direct </p><p>communication with America; but in general you’ll </p><p>find you need Spanish or Portuguese. </p><p> As for your capital, I’m afraid that won’t do much</p><p>more than carry you down there, buy a reasonable </p><p>outfit, and keep you safe for a week or two until </p><p>you strike something. My advice would be to try </p><p>for a good agency—such as the Goodrich—and </p><p>take it down with you; then you’d have a standby </p><p>until your repair business got started. </p><p> Monte Video, or Buenos Aires arc great cities, and</p><p>equal to Rio in every way; and the back countries </p><p>offer rather more openings than does Brazil. In </p><p>Argentina—Spanish spoken here, as in Uruguay— </p><p>there is a great and growing demand for cheap, </p><p>light cars; and tire repairs must be in demand. </p><p> I believe if you will write to Francisco J. Yanes,</p><p>Pan-American Union, Washington, D. C., stating </p><p>your resources, wishes, and ability, he can give you </p><p>some up-to-the-minute data on these places which </p><p>will be rather more valuable than my experience of </p><p>farther back, since the war has upset everything in </p><p>the way of trade centers, ocean travel, and expenses. </p><p>The same source will bring you data of Brazil, Argen- </p><p>tina, Uruguay, or any South American Republic. </p><p>If then you decide definitely where you will go, </p><p>and want to know anything of a more intimate </p><p>nature, such as outfit, customs, etc., I shall be happy </p><p>to reply to you further. </p><p>Ask Adventure </p><p> Queen Charlotte and Porcher Islands</p><p> Question:—“I am getting ready to start to British</p><p>Columbia and would like information on Queen </p><p>Charlotte and Porcher Islands. Are they very </p><p>heavily timbered or is there some open country on </p><p>them suitable for stock raising? Also about the </p><p>wild cattle on Qu&lt;en Charlotte. How many are </p><p>there? Who do they belong to and would any one </p><p>be privileged to get them?”—Pink Becker, West- </p><p>fall, Ore. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Carson:—There is very little</p><p>heavily timbered land on the Queen Charlottes, </p><p>most of it being very scanty with lightly timbered </p><p>muskeg and many open spaces. It has the reputa- </p><p>tion of being a stock country tor fair with a Winter </p><p>that only needs feed enough to be an insuiance </p><p>against an unusually heavy snowfall. Write </p><p>Deputy Minister ol Lands, Victoria, B. C. f&lt; r sur- </p><p>veyors’ reports. They have been surveying up there </p><p>for years. Porcher has been pretty well taken up so </p><p>far as good agricultural land is concerned but I </p><p>understand that several claims have been allowed </p><p>to lapse and that a man can find some pretty good </p><p>Stuff there yet. </p><p> As for the wild cattle, when the Grand Trunk</p><p>Pacific Railway was projected, an old greaser known </p><p>as “Mexican Tom” brought up a small herd and </p><p>turned them loose near Bearskin Bay or Masset as </p><p>it is now called intending to sell the increase to the </p><p>contractors who built the road. By some means the </p><p>big cattlemen ol Alberta who had also established </p><p>herds in advance of the railway, got the company so </p><p>tied up on a contract that it did not dare take Tom’s </p><p>cattle or even afford him transportation to the main- </p><p>land where he might have disposed ot them in inde- </p><p>pendent markets. </p><p> In disgust the old fellow turned the bunch loose to</p><p>shift for themselves and returned to the south, flat </p><p>broke, preferring to lose all rather than sell to the </p><p>men who had beaten him at their price. This was </p><p>the origination of the wild cattle on the islands and </p><p>there are several hundred of them still there accord- </p><p>ing to report. I know the Jap miners from Judway </p><p>used to come up every year and lay in their Winter’s </p><p>supply of beef at the cost of killing and transporta- </p><p>tion so it is a safe bet that any one else would have </p><p>the same privilege. </p><p> This in itself should answer the question of the</p><p>fitness of Graham Island as a stock proposition. </p><p>A Summer on the Great Lakes </p><p> Question:—“I am planning on spending the next</p><p>Summer on the Great Lakes. What sort of boat </p><p>will be the best adapted for going it single-handed? </p><p>What kind of equipment should I take for best re- </p><p>sults? Would it be better to depend on camping at </p><p>night or take a boat on which one could live per- </p><p>manently? I’ll want to fish, take some pictures </p><p>and just live. Would like to go among the islands </p><p>of the upper lakes, I think. Where can one get </p><p>charts of the Lakes and where may one purchase </p><p>real ‘has been’ books or articles on trips of this sort? </p><p>Where can I purchase a boat such as you advise and </p><p>about how much will it cost?”—Asa I. Belt, Rock- </p><p>ford, 111. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Spears:—I rowed 450 miles or</p><p>more on Lake Superior’s North Shore, Lake On- </p><p>tario, etc., in a 16-foot skiff. I carried water-proof </p><p>tarpaulins, woolen blanket, cooking outfit, duffle </p><p>189 </p><p>bag, a box of grub, etc. I was abroad in August </p><p>and September, and I think you are looking ahead to </p><p>the time of your life, basing my judgment on my own </p><p>experiences. </p><p> If you want to live right outdoors, go in a row-</p><p>boat. Carry with you ash, hickory, basswood or </p><p>other hoops, and canvas to spread over the top of </p><p>your boat. Carry light anchor, light line, and </p><p>anchor in little bays or river mouths, or drag your </p><p>boat up the beach out of the way of the waves. </p><p> Sleep on board, in a bunk made of heavy canvas,</p><p>swung along both sides and by the ends to sides </p><p>and stem of boat. Swing it low, but clear of the </p><p>bottom by three or four inches. Carry a little oil- </p><p>stove, to cook under the canvas cover in rains— </p><p>which are not frequent. </p><p> Write to Outing Magazine, New York City, Field</p><p>and Stream, New York City, Forest and Stream, </p><p>New York City, for book catalogs of skiff and boat </p><p>trips. I wrote my experiences for A. R. Harding, </p><p>Columbus, Ohio, who got them out in book form </p><p>“A Trip on the Great Lakes,” which will help you, </p><p>I think. I don’t know the price of the book, </p><p>seventy-five cents or a dollar, I think. It tells what </p><p>I saw, and what I did. </p><p> Get the charts of lakes you want from U. S. Lake</p><p>Survey Office, Detroit, Michigan. </p><p> If I were you, I should go to Chicago, and look</p><p>along the water-front and boat liveries and dubs, for </p><p>bargains in boats. You could find a very good boat </p><p>via Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., or Montgomery Ward &amp;</p><p>Co. (skiff), or small motor-boat, through Motor </p><p>Boating or Motorboat (get copies through news- </p><p>dealers). Good rowboat, first hand, $30 to $40. </p><p>If you got a $50 18-foot rowboat, and put in out- </p><p>board motor, you would have ideal outfit, but I’ve </p><p>rowed thousands of miles with oars. </p><p> Get a $2.00 or $5.00 fishing license for Ontario</p><p>waters, from game overseers—important towns— </p><p>and visit customs office and obtain pleasure cruising </p><p>permit. You would go up Michigan, across to </p><p>North Shore, along The Soo—through Canal—and </p><p>into North Shore of Superior. </p><p>The Red Lake Country </p><p> Question:—“I would like some information on</p><p>Beltrami County, Minnesota, the section around </p><p>Red Lake. Is this section thickly settled and how is </p><p>the hunting and fishing? Could I find a trapper’s </p><p>hut to stay at during the Winter? Are there good </p><p>waterways so I could do most of the traveling by </p><p>canoe? Could I rely upon a rifle for a grub stake? </p><p>Or would the hunting and fishing be better around </p><p>the Lake of the Woods? Is there any trapping in </p><p>this section or is the best of the land covered?”— </p><p>Chas. Haney, Olean, N. Y. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Pinkerton:—The country to the</p><p>south, east and west of Red Lake is pretty well </p><p>settled, while that to the north, mostly a great </p><p>spruce swamp, is being drained by the State and </p><p>Government and settlers are coming in. Where it is </p><p>not drained, there are stretches as big as a township </p><p>in which there is not a dry place big enough for a </p><p>tent. In some places the rivers run under- </p><p>ground. </p><p> Where settlers are not taking up the drained land,</p><p>homesteaders arc taking claims for the pulp spruce. </p><p>This is especially true around the Big and Little </p><p>Fork Rivers. Moreover, north of Red Lake there </p><p>are still a number of Indians, and there is an Indian </p><p>Adventure </p><p>190 </p><p>school on the lake. Between Red Lake and Rainy </p><p>River there are some good stretches unsettled, and </p><p>you can get into the country by canoe on the Rapid </p><p>River, though along the stream you will find </p><p>settlers. </p><p> There are deer, moose, bear and wolves in this</p><p>section, the fisher skins are very good because of the </p><p>thick spruce growth. You might be able to find a </p><p>deserted cabin in which to stay, and undoubtedly </p><p>there is land to be trapped. The old rules don’t </p><p>hold there, and it is the first man in. Near the </p><p>Lake of the Woods, on the Minnesota side, the </p><p>country is quite thickly settled. You most as- </p><p>suredly can not rely upon a rifle for a grub stake. </p><p>Birmingham, Alabama </p><p> Question:—“My husband has just signed a con-</p><p>tract as draftsman with a concern in Birmingham, </p><p>Ala. They tell him there’s no malaria there and </p><p>people do not mind the heat although it rises to 130 </p><p>at times. Now we have two babies the oldest two </p><p>and a half years of age; my health has not been the </p><p>best this Winter and I hesitate about going there </p><p>with the children this Spring. Please advSe me </p><p>about the climate. We are Northern people </p><p>having lived for the past ten years in New York </p><p>State so are used to a cool climate. </p><p> “Also how about domestic life? Are the colored</p><p>people accepted as help by the whites in preference </p><p>to white servants? My husband thinks I can get a </p><p>colored servant there cheaply, have an electric fan </p><p>or two and thereby stand the heat this Summer. </p><p>Is there electricity to be had there?”—Mrs. E. W. </p><p>Barnhart, Emsworth, Pa. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Liebe:—No two persons, of</p><p>course, will tell you the same things concerning the </p><p>healthfulness of any particular city. Here, frankly, </p><p>is what I think of Birmingham: </p><p> I regard it a pretty good Southern city, as to</p><p>climate and about everything else. Mosquitoes, </p><p>save in rare instances, are not what we down here </p><p>think of as bad. The draining of dead water </p><p>has worked wonders with the mosquito problem, </p><p>and consequently with malaria, in most such </p><p>Southern cities. The sanitation, I understand, is </p><p>good. </p><p> As to the thermometer rising to 130—that must</p><p>be a mistake. The highest ever reported by the </p><p>Weather Bureau was but 104. The mean July</p><p>temperature of Birmingham is but 5 degrees more </p><p>than that of Pittsburgh. People there, most of </p><p>them, do not think of it as an uncomfortably hot </p><p>place in Summer. However, they are mostly </p><p>Southern people, while you are a Northerner. It </p><p>would be better if you could go down there in the </p><p>Autumn. If you go in the Spring, I advise you to go </p><p>as early as is possible; you will consequently get </p><p>into the Summer gradually. </p><p> Yes, negroes are generally accepted as the best</p><p>help in Birmingham. But it will be much to your </p><p>advantage to investigate a little when you hire a </p><p>negro woman; demand references, I’d say, and then </p><p>do a little telephoning to make sure those refer- </p><p>ences are genuine. Handled just right, negroes </p><p>make the very best servants in the world. </p><p> As to electricity, yes, they have it. Birmingham</p><p>is quite a city. I fancy you will like the place a </p><p>good deal better than you now think. </p><p> I trust that you will not be disappointed in our</p><p>Southland. </p><p>Central American Opportunities </p><p> Question:—“Are there any openings in any Cen-</p><p>tral American country for young Americans with the </p><p>United Fruit Co.? Do they hire men in the U. S. as </p><p>checkers, foremen, etc., who have no experience in </p><p>this line? Can you give me names and addresses of </p><p>parties with whom to file applications? Will they </p><p>pay fair salaries?”—J. W. Robertson, Cedar Park, </p><p>Tex. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Young:—The United Fruit Co.</p><p>has pretty much of a monopoly of the fruit industry </p><p>in Central America and is by far the best company to </p><p>locate with. They hire a great many of their men </p><p>down there—fellows who drift in—but they also </p><p>send young men down from here once in a while and </p><p>teach them the business after they arrive. Some of </p><p>the men in charge down there are as follows: </p><p> G. M. Shaw, Manager Guatemala Division,</p><p>Puerto Barrios, Guatemala; V. M. Cutter, Mana- </p><p>ger Tela Divn., Tela, Honduras; R. H. Goodell, </p><p>Manager U. F. Co., Puerto Cortez, Honduras; W. E. </p><p>Mullins, Manager C. R. Divn., San Jos6, C. R.; J. M. </p><p>Kyes, Manager, Bocas Divn., U. F. Co., Bocas del </p><p>Toro, Panama. </p><p> You also might write: C. H. Ellis, Vice-Pres.</p><p>United Fruit Co., 321 St. Charles St., New Orleans, </p><p>La. </p><p> The salaries are good, ranging from S75 to $150</p><p>and promotion is rapid provided a man stays sober </p><p>and works hard. </p><p>Mining in Africa </p><p> Question:—“What chance lias a man to make a</p><p>stake in Africa as mining foreman or some such </p><p>position? I am familiar with all branches of mining. </p><p>Is there any placer-mining, or any established con- </p><p>cerns? Is there much danger from fever, etc.? I am </p><p>robust but have never been in the tropics. What </p><p>arms and ammunition would be best to take along </p><p>for hunting?”—Chas. Anderson, Houghton, Mich. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Miller:—The chief mining dis-</p><p>trict of Africa is the Rand, South Africa, a part of </p><p>the world I only know by reading and acquaintance </p><p>with men from there. It is not tropical, but a </p><p>temperate climate, not unlike Arizona. The rough </p><p>labor is done by natives and imported Indians and </p><p>Chinese, bossed by whites. Wages and living con- </p><p>ditions are good. </p><p> On the West Coast, with which I am more familiar</p><p>in a general way, there is considerable gold mining </p><p>on the Gold Coast, though someways inland, and in </p><p>northern Nigeria they are mining tin. But no </p><p>placer-mining, to my knowledge, is done in Africa. </p><p>The wages on the West Coast are good, but the </p><p>country is unhealthy, yet not so bad if one lives </p><p>temperately. Personally fever troubled me little, </p><p>but that depends largely on the district, it being </p><p>very unhealthy around the river deltas. </p><p> An experienced mining foreman would have no</p><p>trouble whatever in getting a good-paying job, if he </p><p>can handle natives, and they’re easy enough to </p><p>handle if one has handled men at all. The usual </p><p>contract calls for three years, with three months’ </p><p>notice either side to break it. The companies pay </p><p>out-going passage, and return passage if the three </p><p>years are carried out. </p><p> Take only a shotgun. There is a heavy license</p><p>on every gun a white takes through customs, as the </p><p>authorities are very careful not to let the natives </p><p>Lost Trails </p><p>191 </p><p>get hold of firearms. You can easily pick up a </p><p>rifle or sporting gun from some fellow coming home. </p><p> I will hold this letter over a few days, until I go up</p><p>to San Francisco, where I will get the names and </p><p>addresses of mining companies in Africa and enclose </p><p>them. You might write them, stating briefly age </p><p>and experience. Two of my correspondents landed </p><p>African positions last month that way. </p><p>Gold in the Southwest </p><p> Question:—“In what parts of Arizona and old and</p><p>New Mexico is gold to be found? I would like to </p><p>prospect in the Southern States. Is there any way </p><p>to get other work, in the mines or the woods, near </p><p>the gold area?”—Lois Pincher, Milwaukee, Wis. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Harriman:—All three of the</p><p>places mentioned by you are highly mineralized, but </p><p>you can not get across the border now, so old Mexico </p><p>may be left out of consideration. Copper is far </p><p>more generally found than gold in Arizona, but the </p><p>desert regions have many deposits of gold. Death </p><p>Valley, partly in this State, has much. It is a hor- </p><p>rible place to go. Oatman, Arizona, near Needles, </p><p>has the largest producing gold-mine in the State. </p><p>Northwestern Arizona is promising country for </p><p>prospectors, as is southwestern and northern New </p><p>but you should have some man with you </p><p>who knows the country, as it is arid and dangerous. </p><p> There is work among the mines in both States.</p><p>You mention work in the woods near mining area. </p><p>Most of the mining is done where mesquile trees are </p><p>the biggest they find, and they are scrubby little </p><p>things. Some few mines are found in forested sec- </p><p>tions, but not the bulk of them. You will find work </p><p>where they have ranches of various kinds. </p><p> There are known deposits of gold in large quan-</p><p>tities that are still unworked because of no water </p><p>within sixty miles. That is the kind of country </p><p>you will traverse in prospecting. Desert, hotter </p><p>than the old furnace into which the three Israelites </p><p>were thrown, drier than powder-mill or dry-kiln, full </p><p>of alkali dust and whirlwinds. Me, I’ll get my gold </p><p>in some other way, thank you. I am too amphibi- </p><p>ous to like desert for more than a week at a stretch. </p><p>The South Sea Islands </p><p> Question:—“What race of people in habit the South</p><p>Sea Islands? What are their customs, history and </p><p>religion? What opportunities do these islands offer</p><p>an adventurer? What is the best and easiest way </p><p>there? What money do you think necessary to </p><p>cover expenses? Is there any way to make money </p><p>while there? What sort of an outfit is needed? </p><p>Where can I get a book and map of these islands?”— </p><p>Raymond Mossburg, Baltimore, Md. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Mills:—There is much mystery</p><p>surrounding the whence of the South Sea Islanders, </p><p>and ethnologists still dispute about it. Why should </p><p>I theorize where men on the spot can’t agree? Some </p><p>say they are ancient Malayans, others that they </p><p>sprang from Egypt. I’m satisfied that they are a </p><p>fine race of South Sea Islanders for at least 500 </p><p>years. That’s far enough back, surely. </p><p> Their customs are various and pagan, like their</p><p>religion — sun-worshipers, cannibals, offerers of </p><p>living sacrifices, tremendously superstitious, be- </p><p>lievers in evil spirits, chaxms, incantations, and </p><p>strangely mixed in these later days with Chris- </p><p>tianity, for missionaries have done great work in the </p><p>islands during the past century, whole islands, such </p><p>as Rarotonga and Tonga, becoming professing </p><p>Christians. </p><p> Their history I can not give you. So far as the</p><p>islands are concerned, adventures are to the adven- </p><p>turous. Plenty of sea-loom, myriad islands, differ- </p><p>ing peoples—surely there is the setting for adven- </p><p>ture. The best way out to the islands for Americans </p><p>is either from Vancouver or San Francisco, whence </p><p>mail-boats and other craft go to Honolulu, which is </p><p>an ideal kicking-off place for the islands, of which </p><p>there are numerous groups to choose from. </p><p> Honolulu is a good place to get an outfit, which</p><p>only means, after all, a tropical equipment of clothes. </p><p>Money? Just what sort of spender are you? You </p><p>can get rid of as much cash in the islands as you can </p><p>in Baltimore—and you can live cheaper in the </p><p>islands than in your own city. It all depends on </p><p>whether you are a two-dollar-a-day man or upward. </p><p>You can “do” the islands on five dollars a day. </p><p>And, of course, money can make money as willingly </p><p>in the islands as in Baltinore—with a maker be- </p><p>hind it. </p><p> But there must be patience to make money as a</p><p>trader or as a planter. Unfortunately, the things </p><p>written about the islands arc not available in books </p><p>published in the U. S. A. so far as I am aware. As </p><p>soon as the war is over, any shipping company trad- </p><p>ing to the islands will send you copies of their </p><p>pamphlets, some of which arc instructive and in- </p><p>teresting. But the censor has forbidden the circu- </p><p>lation of such just now.</p><p> Kia Oral</p><p>LOST </p><p>TRAILS </p><p> Note—We offer this department of the "Camp-Fire" free of charge to those of our read-</p><p>ers who wish to get in touch again with old friends or acquaintances from whom the years </p><p>have separated them.

There is much agitation all over the United States over the law of</p><p> Eugenics, and some States have been wise enough to insist upon a medical examination of the two contracting</p><p> parties to a marriage before a license is issued, and although the propaganda of those at the head of this move-</p><p> ment is, perhaps, not fully understood or appreciated, there is no one who can conscientiously deny their</p><p> sincerity or the ultimate good that would result.</p><p> Through the adoption of a law whereby the physically unlit were barred from marriage in every State of the</p><p> Union, there would, indeed, be a relatively small percentage of the popu-</p><p> lation who would measure up to the standard.</p><p>WOULD YOU BE ONE OF THOSE </p><p> who were doomed to go through life alone, without the joys and happiness that</p><p> go hand in hand with a loving wife and strong, healthy children? Would the</p><p> fact that you have neglected your body, ignored the fundamental principles of</p><p> health and right living, and failed to make the most of Nature’s supreme gift,</p><p> doom you to a life of single wretchedness and unhappiness?</p><p> Our first duty is to posterity. We are not put here by an all-wise Providence</p><p> merely to live out our lives and then go out, like a snuffed candle. We are en-</p><p> trusted with the sacred duty of perpetuating the species, a duty which is as</p><p> sacred and immutable as anything might well be.</p><p> LIKE BEGETS LIKE is a saying handed down from time immemorial,</p><p> and no truer maxim has ever fallen from the lips of man.
