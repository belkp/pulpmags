"Over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board with them, boys o' mine!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a roar of exultation his crew rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men of the Groix, Codroy John and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Newfoundlanders flocking to their aid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamping up and down the Esperance's</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck, smiting and wrestling at her rail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irish Kerrigan, Boston Jim, Patterson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown, Hughie Hay, McCaig, Tom Halifax</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Bolero the cook, smothering Pellier's</seg><seg type="columnLine">force in the unexpectedness of their attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hurling them into the harbor water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taylor himself was locked with the admi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ral, old Peter and Jacques, fighting the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">as an ordinary person would fight a single foe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vainly they lunged and struck at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Viking that he was he laughed under their</seg><seg type="columnLine">blows, herding them to the Esperance's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail and knocking Beauport sheer over it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a lightning blow. Old Peter rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">but toppled back from Taylor's straight-arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">punch, caught his legs against the rail and</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed Beauport, while Pellier was plucked</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the deck in the Gloucester man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms and cast overside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My turn now, Pellier!"

My</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn, Peter, you foxy old devil!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE JUMPED for the Esperance's</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheel as he cried. His crew of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graywing and Codroy's of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esperance were at the main-sheet hoisting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big mainsail, and as he put over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spokes he felt the clean-lined schooner an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer like his own. Half a cable's length</seg><seg type="columnLine">away old Peter's long wooden jetty ran out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the water, Marie, old Anne and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">child on its edge. As the Esperance mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentarily luffed up Marie suddenly leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three-foot gap to the schooner's rail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Foaming Fore Shore</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">21</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Across the slant of the afterdeck she slid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">panting with excitement, and Taylor, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hand on the wheel, caught her to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his left, holding her thus for a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as he held the schooner to the jetty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Marie, Marie, my flower of the coast!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he breathed, his Viking blood pounding to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thrill, to the danger, to the touch of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging hands on his free arm and the whip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping of her hair against his cheek. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">your child--the little Madeline?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"My mother keeps her till things blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear and we are free, and then she will</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring her to me. She has turned to me at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last, my mother, just as Codroy turned."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Good!" exulted Taylor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the barrier," cried Marie, "the ice-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrier! I pray to God we may pass!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She trembled against him, her violet eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were ablaze with the fire of a woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakened to the crisis of her life. Out</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond yonder ring of icebergs lay the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open sea, a free path down to Gloucester, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">year of fretting under Pellier's enforced</seg><seg type="columnLine">marriage yoke, then release and happiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the law. It was all that stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">between her and another life and through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gap in the ice wall Pellier and his watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog cruisers could not go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dieu, it was a stake! Dieu, how she</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayed and clung as Taylor steered for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrier under full sail! Chateau Harbor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in a tumult, a thousand clamors rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the early dark that dropped suddenly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun failed. The beach was a-roar with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fishers' shoutings, a-rumble with the thud</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their feet as they ran to the stage heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep the Esperance in sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a witch the schooner sailed. Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creeping dark and the swirl of mist that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came with the dark, her sails gleamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">white, pointing for the ice-barrier. Dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, the Groix's boats were picking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pellier and his men and the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">French gunboat along with the two British</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruisers were moving from their moorings</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come to the Groix's assistance. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">many crafts were in their way, schooners</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brigantines at anchor, and before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">war-ships could close the cordon the Es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perance broke through in !zigzag tacking</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plunged for the gap amid the bergs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though the harbor surface was dark, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittering pinnacles of the bergs still caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rays of the sunken sun and glowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood-red like the spires of massed cathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drals in the dusk. On the ruby peaks</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">perched the resting sea-birds, puffins, guil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lemots, gulls, razor-billed auks, all black</seg><seg type="columnLine">as ebony against the crimson afterglow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their sleepy mutterings drowned by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of the waves and the rumble of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air in the ice caverns beneath them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like the crash of cannon rose the rumble</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the air as the Esperance approached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage. Like the roar of surf on a reef</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke the thunder of the swells across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerald ice ledges. But above these both,</seg><seg type="columnLine">another sound ripped through the air--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">belching guns of the cruisers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By heavens, is the madman firing at us?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped Taylor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, over us," cried Marie, watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red flares of the racing gunboats.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Over us--to close the passage.

Log huts, canvas-sided shacks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"shake" shanties were strewn haphazardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">along one side of the wide trail. Plumped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down here and there were larger structures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which came the blare of hurdy-gurdies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And among the men that thronged in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of these places there was the usual Sat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urday evening joviality and pioneer camara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derie, but there seemed something else, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Watchfulness, clannishness, suspicion, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have defined it; but he said nothing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and followed Sheehy to his shack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they came out an hour later it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite dark.

All the time, Haggerty</seg><seg type="columnLine">played his usual part of total abstainer. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied the crowd closely, pursuing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">search that had become a fixed mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">habit with him; and while he looked he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">newed his impression of the unusual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a while he was able to analyze it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was an unfamiliar element in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd. Mingling with the boisterous mi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ners, the pale-faced, passionless-eyed gam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blers, and the inevitable rag-tag collection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">loafers and hangers-on, were numerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">others that seemed to have no place in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mining-town. For one thing, their hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">were uncalloused and their heels spurred;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but more significant still was their peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">air of blended secrecy and challenge, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aloofness and even hostility with which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular miners treated them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Obviously unearned though it was, these</seg><seg type="columnLine">men seemed to have plenty of gold. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Golden Bear they were so numerous that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haggerty put his growing suspicion into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is this place," he asked Sheehy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"a mining-camp, or something else? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't think," he added significantly, "there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as much gold coin this side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">divide."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bar at which they stood was lined</seg><seg type="columnLine">with noisy men, and behind them well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">patronized gambling-tables, wheels and</seg><seg type="columnLine">layouts filled the place to the door. Sheehy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">looked swiftly over the crowded room, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then drew Haggerty to an unoccupied cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner near the end of the bar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I've been waitin' for ye to ask me that,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, in a cautious tone. "Ye heard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some outlawry on the way up, maybe?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "A lot of it," replied Haggerty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And, indeed, a flood of crime had recently</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread all over the up-country. Mysteri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous disappearances were common; the bod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ies of men were found floating in streams,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their gold removed; express riders were held</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and shot; and a general era of deviltry</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have set in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said Sheehy, "'tis the general</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion that most of the trouble's born</seg><seg type="columnLine">right here.

Ye can see the cut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat faces of 'em, and they've no visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of support save the revolvers in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">belts, and there ye are. But there's more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more of 'em all the time, and any night</seg><seg type="columnLine">ye can hear 'em boastin' in their cups of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they would do to Grizzly if we run 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. They wouldn't go far, they say, havin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hidin'-place near that no man could find</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor a regiment take."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This Black Doak, who's he?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haggerty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, if ye ask me, he's the leader of</seg><seg type="columnLine">'em," said Sheehy.

And if ye will</seg><seg type="columnLine">look cornin' through the door--that's him."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haggerty looked. What his eyes saw was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very large man with a dark, hard face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittering black eyes, and the general look of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the human wolf. What his mind regis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered was the end of a year-old chase, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the promise of a rehabilitated life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stepped sharply forward, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming. And then as suddenly he stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to Sheehy and asked in an anxious,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eager whisper-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's Doak, you say?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">24</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. What's up, lad?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haggerty's face expressed a torrent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift thoughts. Doak, the master of Griz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zly! His quarry, caught at last and still be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond reach! A desperate riddle flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through Haggerty's mind--a riddle that</seg><seg type="columnLine">must quickly be solved. He put part of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in words to the astonished Sheehy:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Don't look at him. Now if any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted--wanted anything out of him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there'd be no way to get it in Grizzly, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Short of killin' him," said Sheehy, "there</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me quick, is there anything that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would make it hard for him to leave this</seg><seg type="columnLine">place?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's gettin' rich here," said Sheehy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and then there's a girl.

I know you--Hag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's my name," said Haggerty, won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deringly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They usualLy change it," said Doak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nastily, "but, that bein' the case, maybe it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">smarter not to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a common name," replied Haggerty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rising anger. "I tell you again, you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a mistake."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, you can't put that over," rasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doak. "And I'll tell you what. I ain't no</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasted peacher, and it's too cursed much</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble to turn you up, but this camp ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">big enough for you and me. I won't ad-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mire seein' you around here after tonight."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I hope you go blind, then," said Hag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerty, evenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look out for yourself, then, you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the middle of his sentence, Doak's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand had flashed to his revolver butt. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weapon was never withdrawn. Sheehy</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't see whence he had snatched it, nor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is likely did Doak; but in Haggerty's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand had suddenly appeared a short, ugly</seg><seg type="columnLine">derringer. Its muzzle, filed smooth where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front sight had been, was shoved against</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doak's chest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That'll be all tonight," said Haggerty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crisply. "Now, about face!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doak hesitated an instant, glaring at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haggerty furiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm squeezing the trigger," warned Hag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerty tensely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Involuntarily, it seemed, Doak glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at the menacing hand and saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whitening knuckles. In a sort of hurry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wheeled toward the bar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So swiftly and quietly had the incident</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed that not more than three men ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served it, and they made no remark. Doak</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed behind the bar. Haggerty turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Sheehy and found the latter regarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in utter bewilderment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Saints in heaven," cried Sheehy, "where</seg><seg type="columnLine">did ye get that gun?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sleeve draw," explained Haggerty, pock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eting the weapon. "It's good for snakes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let's get out of this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside, they turned toward Sheehy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin. Sheehy, according to his non-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquisitive code, waited for Haggerty to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You saw what happened," began Hag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerty, after a moment. "I've got to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">that man. I've got to get him alive, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead. And from what you say, I'll have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">smash his gang to do it. So I'm going to be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a mighty unsafe friend-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another remark of that kind," inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted Sheehy, "and ye'll be no friend at all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What d'ye think I am?

He turned, and saw a girl helping a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeble old man down an ill-defined trail to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gold diggings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had evidently come from a teetery-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looklng tent pitched beside an ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">prairie schooner half-way up the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulch. They reached the claim adjoining</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sheehy's and immediately fell to work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl picked up a shovel, and swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly down into the miniature shaft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Intermittent showers of black earth began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come out of it. The old man loaded it</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a crudely constructed wheelbarrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the barrow was full the girl climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the hole and wheeled it down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumbling creek. The old man began plying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bucket while she alternately shoveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth into the cradle and rocked it;</seg><seg type="columnLine">always, Haggerty saw, she did the lion's</seg><seg type="columnLine">share of the work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's Rosa Brookes?" asked Haggerty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a queer voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," said Sheehy. "There's none</seg><seg type="columnLine">other like her in Grizzly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haggerty stared at her. Somehow he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fitted his imagination of the girl to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">surroundings. He had pictured an Amazon</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a woman, strong, rough, semi-masculine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This girl was strong, but there the parallel</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended. She was daintily feminine from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of her broad felt hat to the worn soles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her shoes. Her face was dark and irreg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ularly beautiful; she was like a flower,</seg><seg type="columnLine">transplanted from a hot-house somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shrinking a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It wasn't like Haggerty, that imagery, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was apt. For, though the girl worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">busily, smiled at her father, hummed little</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunes to herself, he could see that down deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was filled with uneasiness. An un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">easiness that Haggerty could well under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand, when he recalled what Sheehy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him. Quite apart from Doak's pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit of her, her late history had been enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to weaken the courage of the bravest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She and her father had been members of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the most ill-fated of the transconti-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nental parties. It had lost itself in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Humboldt Sink, it had taken a wrong cut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, it had finally been compelled to Winter</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the high Sierras. More than half its</seg><seg type="columnLine">number had died there, including Rosa's</seg><seg type="columnLine">two brothers. An honorable testimony it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">to those nineteenth-century Argonauts that</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the women, in all those famine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beleagured expeditions, survived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those who got through at last had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight for the lowlands as though driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">by an obsession. But Old Man Brookes</seg><seg type="columnLine">had broken down in Grizzly, and Rosa had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stayed with him perforce. Now they</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted only to get back to the East, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough money to buy back the home they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sold to make t he trip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd sure hate to see 'em start," Sheehy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had said, "as long as Doak holds the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haggerty studied the girl. Clear as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight was the impression he got of fine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and strength and unsullied honesty. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of a sudden he wanted very much to win</seg><seg type="columnLine">her friendship for reasons quite apart from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his desire to trouble Doak. He wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than the nodding acquaintance Sheehy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the other miners had, and all morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">he puzzled over the problem of attaining it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That afternoon, chance favored him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sheehy and he were deep-tunneling at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, up-stream in the direction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brookes claim. Haggerty uncovered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nugget, a pitted and scored chunk of almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">pure gold, dull-colored and heavy. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">exulted over their find, until Haggerty sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested they might have tunneled too far.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Exact measurements proved he was right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By his statement of where he had found it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nugget belonged to the Brookeses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he explained the matter and gave it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. It was a small thing in a way, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the beginning of trust, and that is never</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small thing. Haggerty felt somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheepish under the appreciative light of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rosa Brookes' eyes, and under the old man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanks, and even when he accepted what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had played for, an invitation to call some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time at their tent. But he wouldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">undone what he had done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night Haggerty turned over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sheehy a hundred dollars in dust. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">half the approximate value of the nugget.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid I lied a bit," said Haggerty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It really came out of our dirt. I tunneled</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little further after I found it, that's all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sheehy didn't look as astonished as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">26</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">might. He chuckled a little, and then fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a thoughtful silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder if you're playin' quite fair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lad," he hazarded at length.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haggerty stared at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said Sheehy slowly, "I'll tell ye.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doak knows the girl thinks nothin' of him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he's forced himself on her through fear;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but after the manner of his kind he's in love</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her. Ye've seen a flame lick up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of a house, devourin' while it caresses--</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, that's the way of his love. Also he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hates ye. Also the two of ye have an ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">count to be settled betwixt ye. Consider</seg><seg type="columnLine">them things, and the undisciplined bundle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of evil passions that ye know Doak to be,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then ask yourself if you're the safest</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend in the world for the girl to have."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Haggerty had already considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and to a different conclusion than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sheehy's. He was very young, and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the confidence of youth, and youth's ability</seg><seg type="columnLine">to believe what he wanted to. - If Rosa</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brookes were in danger, then so much more</seg><seg type="columnLine">did she need him as a friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also, as Sheehy may have suspected, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had another motive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He underestimated Doak, both his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength and his weakness, else he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have reasoned as he did: if Doak were</seg><seg type="columnLine">made jealous, well and good, the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly would he be held in Grizzly, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more time would Haggerty have to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the destruction of Doak's power in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grizzly, the seizure of Doak, and his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">vindication.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haggerty's mind went a long trail back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward that night, and at the end of that trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">there lay a dead man and a cell with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken lock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ill</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'VE DONE what you asked me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to," said Rosa Brookes. "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see him any more. But I'm--I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid. I try not to be, it seems silly. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's--drinking lately. And I'm afraid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You musn't be," worried Haggerty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It'll be all right. In a week more-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Sunday, and they were sitting on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little knoll covered with swaying wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">oats, quite out of sight or hearing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's so much I don't understand,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled the girl. "About you and--him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">They say the first night you came here you</seg><seg type="columnLine">had trouble with him. And you've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">working against him ever since, trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">organize the miners against him. Of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's good, if he's what you say. But--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she hesitated, "but he's been saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible things about you, too. To me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What did he say?" asked Haggerty, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice hardening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He said," replied Rosa in a low tone and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an effort, "that if I knew everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">about you, I'd never look at you again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That you are worse than even he is.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he said in a few days more he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to prove it, and he would."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a minute Haggerty stared out over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flower-strewn hills, an uneasy look on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face. Then he turned to Rosa and asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Supposing he did--supposing he seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to prove it, would you believe him?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I don't know," doubted Rosa.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She sat twisting her hands perplexedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Everything out here is so different. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">men are different. Even you. You did</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot a man. Yesterday. I heard about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thing had been torturing her all day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He tried to shoot me" said Haggerty</seg><seg type="columnLine">briefly. "I could have killed him. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I'm glad of that," said Rosa tensely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was the way I knew you'd feel about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it that saved him," said Haggerty. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was worse than a rattler."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Indeed, the man had drawn on him</seg><seg type="columnLine">without word or warning. Haggerty's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning quickness only had saved him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The would-be assassin, who was one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Golden Bear's most sinister habitues, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently relied on Doak's power to shield</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from the result of his crime. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second attempt on Haggerty's life in</seg><seg type="columnLine">two weeks. The other time he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot at from behind in the dark, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet had gone through his hat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haggerty turned the talk to other topics,</seg><seg type="columnLine">delighting to see Rosa's eyes and face light</seg><seg type="columnLine">up after a while, as she forgot herself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doak and Grizzly, and fell under the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluence of the perfect day and the windr</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept hills. They found much to talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">about, those two; but most of the way back</seg><seg type="columnLine">they walked in that close silence that some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times falls between those that draw nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">than friendship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forty-Nine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">27</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After they had parted, however, Hag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerty's mind reverted to Doak's threat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had thought that if Doak were to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounce him, he would have done it when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haggerty first appeared in Grizzly. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that he hadn't seemed to prove his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear, and the correctness of Haggerty's sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mise. His threat at this late day meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">something. Haggerty wondered what</seg><seg type="columnLine">whimsy of fate might have put in Doak's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands the seeming proof he had mentioned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he wondered whether Doak, in sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperation born of jealousy and hatred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear, would find the courage to use it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But in the morning Haggerty put aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">his doubts and got busy again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His work was double those days. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">both miner and missionary. In the eyes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of Grizzly's citizens who profited by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the presence of Doak's men, he was a des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picable malcontent. To most of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">miners he had been from the first a man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious motives, who was dooming</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to death in a worthy but hopeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause. The second man he preached his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gospel of law-and-order to warned him:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There was one man started to buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doak already. We buried him quiet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The verdict was extreme shortness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath, brought on by lead-poisonin'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Haggerty managed to live. He lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">and talked and made friends, and for a while</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was about all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard peculiar arguments. Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no law there could be no crime,</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway. Every man his own policeman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was good enough. Grizzly was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a temporary camping-place; why should</seg><seg type="columnLine">they trouble themselves? They hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to bother, their corns hadn't been</seg><seg type="columnLine">trampled on much, let the rest of the coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try take care of itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But gradually he began to get the decent</seg><seg type="columnLine">element of the camp together. He began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rouse in them resentment at the domi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nance of the outlaws. He urged that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner or later the clash would come, as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come in other camps and in the larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities. And backing him in all this was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinct for order and self-government that</seg><seg type="columnLine">shows itself wherever Anglo-Saxons gather.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Numerically the honest men in Grizzly</seg><seg type="columnLine">were greatly in the superiority. But they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were very busy, they were making money,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and before Haggerty's advent they had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong tendency toward letting well enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. Also they had a normal regard for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">their own lives, and they foresaw that an</seg><seg type="columnLine">open clash with Doak's men meant blood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shed. And nothing short of actual destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the gang would serve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If they but drove the desperadoes out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that secret rendezvous of which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">boasted so often, then life in Grizzly would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a desperate adventure indeed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as it was, there was ceaseless irrita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. The very presence of the undesir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ables was like a challenge. Their mysteri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous disappearances and returns, followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">always by the story of some back-country</seg><seg type="columnLine">outrage, kept the camp filled with a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of indignity. And they were bold blus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terers for the most part, with a touch of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bully about them, whose loud words goaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">to anger far more men than they cowed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this helped Haggerty. He was care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful in choosing his leaders. He got as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nucleus of his Vigilante organization the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soldier men in camp, the two storekeepers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a doctor, a square gambler, half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle-aged miners. They were already</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatient with conditions, and were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to enlist. The rest followed slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But as the days went by, cohesion set in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haggerty was confident that, given time, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have the respectable element of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp with him to a man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now he began to reveal the reward he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would ask for, Doak taken alive and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">livered into his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The trouble was, all this could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden from the crooks. Their surface re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">action to the threat was defiance and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">increasing arrogance. But underneath they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were growing uneasy. They knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength that could be massed against them</seg><seg type="columnLine">once it had coalesced. Haggerty heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the clearer-headed among them were</seg><seg type="columnLine">urging Doak to retire from the town. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">great fear was that they would have their</seg><seg type="columnLine">way before he got ready to strike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And what of Doak all this time?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS very beautiful that night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through trees motionless as senti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nels the starlight trickled, close and</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly. The giant ridges were things of</seg><seg type="columnLine">loveliness, so softly silhouetted were they</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the dusky sky. In the bottom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gulch the tumbling brook made music</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient as the world. And Rosa and Hag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerty, sitting alone by the dying embers of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">28</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">camp-fire, made believe to forget that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was anything else in the world than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible harmony that surrounded them, em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">braced them, and drew their souls together</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a spell as simple and clean and sweet as</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rosa's father had gone to bed, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two had been alone perhaps an hour, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">from somewhere above them, from beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall of rocks that half encircled the tent</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made Haggerty's position compara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively safe, came the sound of breaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrubbery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly Rosa was on her feet, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of Doak on her, and was urging Hag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerty out of the circle of light and behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haggerty obeyed, though the visitor</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be making too much noise to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous, and so they stood there until</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doak rounded the tent and came up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp-fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hell of evil passions in which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">presumably writhed the last few weeks had</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed him greatly. He was unshaven</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shaken and nervous, and he glared sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piciously around in the shadows. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haggerty, followed by Rosa, stepped for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, his body tensed galvanically, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">emitted an inarticulate growl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" from Haggerty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thought I'd find you here," with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt at a sneer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you want?" inquired Haggerty</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly.	t</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to talk with you.

I've got something here it'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">do you both good to hear about."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A note of malevolent triumph was in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice; but it was strange how the fear that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never been absent from him since Hag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerty's arrival in Grizzly broke through that</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumph even then, and tempered it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, come to the point," snapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haggerty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll come to it quick enough," declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His hand went inside his coat. It came</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with nothing more ominous than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspaper, crumpled, dog-eared, and brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">with age. But Haggerty drew a sharp breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I sent a man to San Francisco for this,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Doak. "What d'you suppose is in it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haggerty, before whom the past had risen</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a specter, gripped himself, collected his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wits, and replied coolly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, I suppose, judging from its ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent age and your manner, that it's an</seg><seg type="columnLine">account of the murder of my uncle. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably has my description in it, too, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed murderer, and mentions the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I broke jail, and that there's a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars reward for my arrest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rosa's cry at this abrupt confession was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the piteous one of a woman who feels her</seg><seg type="columnLine">world tottering to its foundation. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doak replied with a jeering chuckle:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wonder if you'll admit it all as easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the boys get hold of you? D'you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what I'm goin' to do with this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, you're going to tear it up," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haggerty easily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, am I?" grated Doak. "Just am I?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tell you what, I'm givin' you just one</seg><seg type="columnLine">more chance for life. If you're out of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp by sunrise, all right.

Then I'll get the boys together and</seg><seg type="columnLine">string you up for the cowardly murderer</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haggerty, his eyes never leaving Doak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped forward and kicked some dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">twigs into the middle of the fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A nice program," he said thoughtfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This world's a strange place. Seems like</seg><seg type="columnLine">we never can get away, doesn't it? Did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever'hear of the law of compensation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doak?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doak said something under his breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," went on Haggerty slowly, "it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a cowardly, cold-blooded crime. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">money; there couldn't have been any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">motive, and they found part of his money on</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. He and I had quarreled, too, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved that. I was a boy then--seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a year ago, doesn't it?--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty impulsive. But he'd taken care of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me all my life. Working late at night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoeing a neighbor's horse--a country</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross-roads blacksmith my uncle was, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">farmer, too--and you can see how the mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derer came up from behind and struck him</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. But there was a struggle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know, Doak, I've a curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory about crime. I believe the crimi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nal's always branded, some way. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't get away from it, it leaves its mark.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now this particular crime--but we won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk any more about it. Do as you like.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only it would be strange if I were hung in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grizzly. I was sure I'd found a sign of good</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck here."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forty-Nine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">29</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A peculiar effect these latter rambling</seg><seg type="columnLine">words had on Doak. His figure wavered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dancing firelight, and the paper in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand stirred and rustled as though it, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were possessed of quivering nerves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What d'you mean by that?" he snarled</seg><seg type="columnLine">viciously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, what do you think I mean?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Haggerty lightly. "We all have our</seg><seg type="columnLine">superstitions, haven't we? Now," in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice turned deadly, "you've told your</seg><seg type="columnLine">story. We want no more of you. Go and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell it to the camp, if you dare."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By-, I will," cried Doak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I were afraid of you," said Haggerty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">evenly, "wouldn't I shoot you where you</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand? Now go!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doak's shoulders came forward in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouch. But he turned away. The menac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing crouch and the cautious retreat were one</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the same movement. Haggerty drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rosa swiftly into the shadow of the tent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With his hand on his gun, he watched Doak</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he disappeared. Then he turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rosa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's all true," he said swiftly, "what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the paper. I'm wanted--hunted--now</seg><seg type="columnLine">--this minute. The other day, on the hill, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked you a question. I'm asking it</seg><seg type="columnLine">again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, what--what was it--Jack?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you believe-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no! You couldn't. I didn't think</seg><seg type="columnLine">--no!" She clung to his arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then God is good," cried Haggerty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with a double joy. "For Doak's the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. I was sure of it, and now-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was blinded by a crashing blow. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't hear the report of the gun. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself slipping down, felt Rosa's arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him. He struggled for sight, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength. He knew he called out Doak's</seg><seg type="columnLine">name. He did hear the clatter of a horse's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoofs and the second explosion of the revol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ver. He felt Rosa dragged away from him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then he fell into a great depth wherein</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing but shadows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He struggled up out of that depth. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a long time and a great effort, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of necessity that was more terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">than hell-fire urged him. He found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying unsteadily on his feet. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">men holding him. There were more</seg><seg type="columnLine">around, a great crowd of them. He heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">one say:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Skull's creased, that's all. Lucky</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rosa, Rosa!" cried Haggerty, in a ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A silence came over that crowd that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the silence of the utterly damned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then some one spoke from the open flap</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tent--"Old Man Brooke has cashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God!" groaned some one after an inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">val, "can't we do anything?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How can we," came the answer, "with</seg><seg type="columnLine">our horses druv away?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And with Doak and his whole devil's</seg><seg type="columnLine">brood gone.

The triple tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">||!iy| ment of bursting heart, of straining</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs, of flagging muscles. A brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">weary, too, from its constant insistence</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the single idea of just one effort more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and another, and another. The passage</seg><seg type="columnLine">from this into a state of sheer physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadness, in which the body becomes an</seg><seg type="columnLine">incumbrance, worse than useless flesh that</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be lifted and lifted and driven forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">by an overweening will. And then that</seg><seg type="columnLine">very will dies into a torturing sense of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">evitability, past and future are alike wiped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, and there is nothing else in the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a grim eternity of endless effort, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness absorbed in pain, a madness, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">obsession, an agony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such were the stages through which Hag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerty passed in his pursuit of Doak, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">when that last stage came it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">30</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">punishment, but a very great relief. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are mental agonies that pass the physi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal, and in the moment of his discovery of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rosa's abduction, Haggerty had thought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go mad. Black dogs of nameless horror</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatened the citadel of his mind, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morse flayed his soul like a scorpion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tipped whip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Remorse, for was he not himself to blame?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had he not, in sickening truth, played Rosa as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pawn, played her attractions to hold Doak</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Grizzly? Now nothing mattered but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rosa's safety, but like a whisper from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">barbed tongue was the thought, "Too late,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too late!" until that horrible numbness</seg><seg type="columnLine">came like a blessing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had started from the camp of catas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trophe shortly after midnight. At first his</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason held him down to the easy, falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">stride of the distance runner. Very shortly</seg><seg type="columnLine">this stride became a necessity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were three tilings that gave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope, the horse was double-loaded, for Doak</seg><seg type="columnLine">had evidently no desire to explain to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">followers his use for a second mount, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail was worn wide and plain by the immi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grant wagons, and he was trained down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the finest point. By lucky chance he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearing riding-breeches and light shoes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He threw off coat and upper shirt, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw away half of his cartridges. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have thrown away the gold dust in his hip</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket, but he forgot it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Very little light came through the trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">that overhung his path. Haggerty stum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled often and sometimes fell headlong.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he was always up again and going, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he never quite lost the sound of the hoof-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beats ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once Doak pulled his horse down to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk. Then Haggerty's dimming con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness was shot through with the deli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rium of hope. Surely he could overtake</seg><seg type="columnLine">him now. A Berserker rage came to Hag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerty, and he felt his hands on his enemy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat. Then Doak, his horse rested, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">off again on a gallop. This happened again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again, and each time was a torment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haggerty never halted, never consciously</seg><seg type="columnLine">slackened his pace. He knew if he did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never get started again. But deeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooted still was the knowledge that as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was running he would continue to run until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he caught Doak, or lost him hopelessly, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">died of a broken heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ran on for hours, for days, for endless</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, it seemed. After a while the only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sense impression he had was that of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound he followed. The stars began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale, the eastern sky grew purple. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">early Summer dawn came rushing over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills to meet him, and he did not know it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was broad daylight, and he had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized it. He wondered what made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize it now. Then he knew, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked trail had turned straight, and plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">in view perhaps half a mile ahead was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse with two riders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haggerty tried to run faster, but his</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs would not respond. A desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger came over him. It was an anger</seg><seg type="columnLine">directed against his body, a faulty mechan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ism that failed him in stress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he kept on in the same jogging trot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His breathing racked him from the dia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phragm upward; the sound of it was like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobbing. Blood had matted on his face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, where it was not, the skin showed pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ple with the unoxygenized life fluid. Above</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hips his muscles were loose, lax, so his</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunk was held insecurely to its pivot, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed as he ran.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little later, his quarry disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a declivity. When Haggerty got to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the canon into which the trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">descended, Doak was nowhere in sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And yet Haggerty could see a long way</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Puzzled, he descended to the canon's bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom, and then he understood. To the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right the canon was blocked with a land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">slide, but to the left it was open, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooring of broken rocks. And he stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">considering what to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His changed posture made Haggerty</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware of the bulge on his hip. He took out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sack of dust and dumped half its con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tents on a rock in the middle of the trail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then with his teeth he worried a hole in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sack so the rest would sift out slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Holding it in his hand, he turned into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canon. For quite a distance the way he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took was marked with yellow dust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His pace was a shamble. The way was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hazardous with holes and abrupt descents.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haggerty fell often. He did not always</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise again immediately. But when he fell it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was forward, and when he was down he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made way on hands and knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He followed no tracks, but on that hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom there could have been no tracks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a while, as through a thick, red</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist, he saw Doak again. Doak was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forty-Nine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">31</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">unthinkable distance ahead. He was pick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his way on foot, leading the horse, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle of which still sat the woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And again Doak disappeared. He disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared mysteriously. With a snarl at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">failing senses, Haggerty brushed the sweat</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his eyes and stared again. Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doak had been there was a patch of under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush. Haggerty reached that underbrush,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dropped flat to the ground, and wrig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled into the bushes. Looking all ways, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to where he thought the wall of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canon should have been, and there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was vacancy there. A hole, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed, opening straight into the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff. A tunnel higher than a man, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">broader, from which came a grumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What the devil's that? Good Lord, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lend a hand here. Take the nag,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied Doak surlily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There ain't no one watchin' here but</seg><seg type="columnLine">me," objected the voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind. I got away clean. There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">no danger."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hoof-beats and footsteps receded into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. Haggerty gathered his strength and</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed. His legs had become incum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brances. He dragged himself with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands and writhed along.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A square of light appeared ahead of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Outlined against it were four figures. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had hold of a woman's arm. The other</seg><seg type="columnLine">led the horse. Suddenly all four passed be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond that square of light and melted into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion of moving forms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haggerty struggled on to the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage. With his body twisted behind a</seg><seg type="columnLine">projecting rock, he stole a look into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock-bound chamber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just within the entrance stood Doak, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand on Rosa's arm. Fronting them at</seg><seg type="columnLine">various distances were perhaps twenty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, most of whom Haggerty had seen in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grizzly. Against the opposite wall of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rendezvous were tethered the horses. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were many cases of goods and ammunition</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxes there, too. The whole place was</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimly lighted with two oil-lamps, brack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eted near the entrance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lord, Doak, this ain't no place for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman," Haggerty heard one man say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's all right," replied Doak sharply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Simpson you go guard the tunnel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Doak began to lead Rosa across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the crowd, to the right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haggerty saw he was making for a narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening in the wall, beyond which looked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be another and smaller chamber. Rosa</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw it, too, for she cried out and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle. Protesting growls mingled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brutal laughs of the men, but none</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred to help her. And then Haggerty had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never felt stronger in his life, and he pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gun and fired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he fired, he leaped. He was on Doak</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Doak struck the floor. Blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">smeared Haggerty's hand as he gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doak by the right shoulder and dragged him</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the breach in the wall, leading into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inner chamber. Doak's revolver, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly drawn, clattered against the floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rosa snatched it up. Haggerty shoved her</seg><seg type="columnLine">violently ahead of him. A bullet whistled</seg><seg type="columnLine">past Haggerty's head as he followed Rosa</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the opening. The next instant he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had jerked Doak inside the second chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whirled around, his revolver swaying</seg><seg type="columnLine">level like a serpent's head, searching for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">target.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE HAD acted without plan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly on impulse, and it was with</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishment that he realized there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no target there, and that for the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment at least he held the outlaws at an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">passe. His range of vision commanded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer end and exit of the chamber; when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made his rush the outlaws had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of this space, and they stayed there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulminating threats and curses. The net</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation was that if they held him prisoner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners he also held them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Also he held another advantage. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">first words, cutting sharply into their</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumble of voices, reminded them of this:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Rosa, the first shot that's fired in here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">kill Doak. You out there, you know me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keep back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their talk died away at this, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">one voice replied bullyingly--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "-, young fellow, you can't bluff us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can kill half a dozen of you, though,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied Haggerty with apparent conviction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He thanked God they did not know how he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was trembling from head to foot with ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haustion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll get you in the end, though."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haggerty did not reply. The fact was</seg><seg type="columnLine">32</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">incontestable. One man could not stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever against twenty-five. Nor could the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlaws afford to let either him or Rosa</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape with the secret of their personnel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiding-place. The situation was as hope-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less as could be imagined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, young fellow, let's call it quits,y</seg><seg type="columnLine">came the offer. "You let Doak go, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll let you go. We'll let you leave here</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe. That's a promise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the girl?" asked Haggerty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," replied the man, readily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do we know you'll let us go?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ain't our word good?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haggerty laughed shortly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll have to do better than that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, then," replied the bargainer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">angrily. "We can do that, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What about Doak?" Haggerty replied to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the threat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," said the man deliberately, "Doak</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was-fool enough to get us into this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then Haggerty knew that his best</seg><seg type="columnLine">card had failed him. He could imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Doak's power over his men had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cently been slipping. Fear is Very ruinous</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leadership, and Doak of late had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much afraid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was afraid now. Amid a stream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">curses at his men, at Haggerty, at every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, he demanded if Haggerty meant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">let him bleed to death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haggerty passed back a knife and hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kerchief, and Rosa set to work to bandage</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wound as best she might.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haggerty never stirred from his post.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rest was doing him good; he was stead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ier now. He wondered how the outlaws</seg><seg type="columnLine">would go about it to accomplish their</seg><seg type="columnLine">threat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He wasn't left long in doubt. A brisk</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammering began without, the splintering</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wood, and the creaking of nails wrenched</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their sockets. Haggerty remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the packing-cases and ammunition boxes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he knew they were being shaped into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a movable barricade. He wondered whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the last moment he had not better turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rosa over to the desperadoes, trusting what</seg><seg type="columnLine">remnants of white manhood there might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in them. He decided not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was roused from a spell of black and</seg><seg type="columnLine">remorseful brooding by Rosa's excited voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why," she cried, "there's a scar here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On his shoulder!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is?" said Haggerty, almost indif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A scar, a burn, the shape of--of a horse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoe!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her voice was full of significance and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Haggerty, "you've guessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. The same mark was on my uncle's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body in half a dozen places. The bum of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">horseshoe white hot from the forge. It fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor, and they struggled over it, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">figured his murderer couldn't escape. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was sure it was Doak. Doak had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">working for him; he'd quit and gone two</seg><seg type="columnLine">days before, but that was a trick. I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wanted to get to the gold fields, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't the money."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, that explains-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Everything," said Haggerty, dully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My talk of brands, and why Doak was</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid to accuse me, and--why you're here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I drove him mad, Rosa, with fear and jeal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ousy and hate, and I never thought of you.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I deserve to die--but you-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hush!" said Rosa. "You saved me</seg><seg type="columnLine">from--you are dying for me. There's no</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance, is there, Jack?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was silent. He could not bring him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to tell her there was none, yet how</seg><seg type="columnLine">could he bid her hope?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "-you," said Doak weakly, "you'll</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">both die with me like rats!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, minute by minute, a long time</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragged away. It might have been an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour. The sound of the preparations for</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack went on unceasingly. To Haggerty</seg><seg type="columnLine">the suspense became almost unendurable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If he had been alone he would have leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and ended it all in one quick flurry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once from Rosa a curious question, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidering what was impending.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jack, why did you--run away?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was a young fool," said Haggerty. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was afraid. I thought they'd convict me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had part of his money, you know, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'd quarreled--that was the reason I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">his money, he'd given it to me, and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You wouldn't do it now," said Rosa.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No," said Haggerty, "I wouldn't do it</seg><seg type="columnLine">now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Man-like, he wondered at her woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sigh of relief. It was the one blot she knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">of on his shield.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Close upon that came their warning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">imminent doom, the scraping upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks of the wooden barricade. Its further</seg><seg type="columnLine">end came into view. How thick it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forty-Nine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">33</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Haggerty could not tell, nor how it was held</seg><seg type="columnLine">upright; but it was loop-holed at conveni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent intervals, and it was high enough so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haggerty could catch no glimpse of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouching bodies that pushed it forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haggerty felt a light touch on his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jack, you may--kiss me--now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later the muzzle of a gun ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared in one of the loop-holes. Haggerty</seg><seg type="columnLine">fired, and by luck and good marksmanship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to drive his bullet through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The curses of the wounded outlaw were</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked by the harsh voice of his leader.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Serves you right. Mind what I said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of you. Not a shot until we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">give him a volley."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thereafter the barricade came on stead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily, and with motive power as invisible as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the planks themselves had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">granted life. It swung out as a gate is</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned, the end nearer Haggerty's refuge al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most immovable, the further end sweeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear across the cave. It was a terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to see it coming and not to be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">check it, and to anticipate the storm of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullets that would burst from it the moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">it got into position. It was a more terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to imagine Rosa's body riddled hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribly and lying limp and bloody. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We don't want to kill the girl," came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer. "If she'll come out, we won't."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haggerty hesitated, but Rosa cried out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, no!" and there was an end of that. â– </seg><seg type="columnLine">Doak was alternately cursing and praying</seg><seg type="columnLine">in maudlin fashion; Haggerty was bathed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold sweat, and he found himself longing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of everything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inch by inch, foot by foot, the barricade</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced. Now it cut across Haggerty's</seg><seg type="columnLine">field of view, and crept past the mouth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel. And now in the dark mouth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel Haggerty saw a shadowy moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He saw several, and one stepped tenta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively within the cave, back of the outlaws,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with a wave of the arm summoned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. And instantly Haggerty called out</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a careful simulation of broken nerve:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Say, there, you! There's no use of this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll come out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No use of that, now. We've got you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll get some of you, though. You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've figured it different. We're willin'</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take the chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">3</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the girl and Doak! You don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to kill them, too. I tell you, we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">all come out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, what d'ye say, boys? Saves am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munition. All right, they say, come out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rosa, are you ready?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just a minute," she took her cue from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thin line of hard-visaged men that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">filing with Indian stealth through the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance of the rendezvous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Make yourself beautiful, miss," jeered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outlaw. "But we ain't waiting no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer than that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," said Haggerty at the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the allotted time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Throw your guns out first," came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't see the necessity for that," ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected Haggerty. "One man won't start</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything with twenty-five."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The -you don't. It's me runnin'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">this game. Throw 'em out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Besides, I've only got two guns," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haggerty, evenly.

As a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of fact he had awakened with this</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose in mind, had gone his lazy way all</seg><seg type="columnLine">day fully purposing to give it his attention,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had at last arrived upon the scene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The front gate had finally broken, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper hinge worn out; Ignacio carefully set</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ramshackly wooden affair back against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fence thinking how one of these days he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would repair it. Then he went between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bigger pear-tree and the lluvia d'oro which</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own hands had planted here and stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">with legs well apart considering the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">bells upon the easterly arch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Que hay, amigos/" he greeted them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Do you know what I am going to do for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you some fine day?

Then he sighed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned toward the other arch across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden to see how it was with the Little</seg><seg type="columnLine">One, La Golondrina and Ignacio Chavez.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For it was only fair that at least one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">six should bear his name.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Changing his direction thus, moving di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectly toward the dropping sun, he shifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hat well over his eyes and so was con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">strained to note how the weeds were assert-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing themselves with renewed insolence. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered a soft "malditol" at them winch</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been mistaken for a caress and</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined upon a merciless campaign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">extermination just as soon as he could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitted a new handle to his hoe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he paused in front of the mission</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps and lifted his hat, made an elegant</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow and smiled in his own inimitable re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markably fascinating way. For, under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ragged brim, his eyes had caught a glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a pretty pair of patent-leather slippers, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prettier pair of black stockinged ankles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hem of a white starched skirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nowhere are there eyes like the eyes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Mexico.

Ignacio</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chavez lifted such eyes to the eyes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl who had been watching him and spon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneously gave her the last iota of his ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">admiration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a fine day, senorita," he told her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">displaying two glistening rows of superb</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth friendliwise.

You</seg><seg type="columnLine">like it, no?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was slow music when Ignacio Chavez</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke, all liquid sounds and tender cadences.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he had cursed the weeds it was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">love-making. A "d" in his mouth became</seg><seg type="columnLine">a softened "th;" from the lips of such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bell-ringer of San Juan the snapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">gringo oath comes metamorphosed into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentle "Gah-tham!" The girl, to whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speech of Chavez was something as</seg><seg type="columnLine">new and strange as the face of the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her, regarded him with grave curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE was seated upon the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">bench against the mission wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">which no one but Ignacio guessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be painted green one of these fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, a bronze-haired, gray-eyed girl in</seg><seg type="columnLine">white skirt and waist and with a wide pana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ma hat caught between her clasped hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her knee. For a moment she was per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps wondering how to take him; then with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a suddenness that had been all unheralded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her former gravity, she smiled. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Bells of San Juan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">4i</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lips and eyes together as though she ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cepted his friendship.

"I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been sitting here an hour or two. You are</seg><seg type="columnLine">not going to send me away, are you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ignacio looked properly horrified.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I saw an angel here in the garden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">senorita," he exclaimed, "would I say sape</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it? No, no, senorita; here you shall stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand years if you wish.

But as to staying here</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand years--she glanced through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangle of the garden to the tiny grave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard and shook her head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have just come to San Juan?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked. "Today?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," she told him.

"All</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mother of God!" he said within himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And presently to her, "I did not see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage come today; in San Juan one takes</seg><seg type="columnLine">his siesta at that hour.

While his slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown fingers rolled a cigaret he stared away</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the garden and across the desert</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an expression half-melancholy, half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely meditative which made the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder what his thoughts were. When she</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to know him better she would know,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">too, that at times like this he was not think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think that this is the most profoundly</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaceful place in the world," said the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly, half-listlesslv setting into words the</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression which had clung about her</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout the long, still day. "It is like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strange dream town; one sees no one mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about, hears nothing.

Oh, he was smart and did much good</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sick; but the poor Mexican who</seg><seg type="columnLine">called him for a bed-ridden wife must first</seg><seg type="columnLine">sell something and show the money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond these it appeared that the envi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able class of San Juan consisted of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Padre Jose, who was at present and much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the time away visiting the poor and sick</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout the countryside; Julius Struve</seg><seg type="columnLine">who owned and operated the local hotel, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lesser luminaries though a portly</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleman with an amiable wife; the Por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters who had a farm off to the northwest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose connection to San Juan lay in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that an old maid daughter taught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">school here; various other individuals and</seg><seg type="columnLine">family groups to be disposed of with a word</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a careless wave of a cigaret. Already</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the fair stranger Ignacio had skimmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cream of the cream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl sighed as though her question</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been no idle one and his reply had disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed her. For a moment her brows</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered slightly into a frown that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a faint shadow; then she smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">again brightly, a quick smile which seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">more at home in her eyes than the frown had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ignacio glanced from her to the weeds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, squinting his eyes, at the sun. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ample time, it would be cooler pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently. So, describing a respectful arc about</seg><seg type="columnLine">her he approached the mission wall, slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the shade and eased himself in charac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teristic indolence against the white-washed</seg><seg type="columnLine">adobe. She appeared willing to talk with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; well, then, what pleasanter way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spend an afternoon? She sought to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">this and that of a land new to her; who to</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain more knowingly than Ignacio</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chavez?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a little, when she rose to go, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would pluck some of the newly opened yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low rosebuds for her, making her a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech about herself and budding flowers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He would even, perhaps, show her his bells,</seg><seg type="columnLine">let her hear just the suspicion of a note from</seg><seg type="columnLine">each.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sharp sound which came to her ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruptly out of the utter stillness meant noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to her. She saw a flock of pigeons rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the roofs of the more distant of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses, circle, swerve and disappear beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cottonwoods. She noted that Ignacio</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no longer leaning lazily against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall; that he had stiffened, that his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a little open, breathless, his attitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of one listening expectantly, his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">squinting as they had been just now when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fronted the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came the second sound, a repetition</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the first, sharp, in some way sinister.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then another and another and another un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">til she lost count; a man's voice crying out</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely, muffled, indistinct, seeming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come from afar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was an incongruous, almost a humorous</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to see the sun-warmed passivity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ignacio Chavez metamorphosed in a flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">into activity. He had muttered something,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had leaped away from the mission wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashed through the tangle of the garden and</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced like a madman to the eastern arch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With both hands he grasped the dangling</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell ropes, with all of his might he had set</seg><seg type="columnLine">them clanging and shouting and clamoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the reverberation smote her ears and</seg><seg type="columnLine">set the blood strangely tingling through her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had seen the look upon his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly she knew that those little sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds had been the rattle of pistol shots.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She sprang to her feet, her eyes widening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her cheeks growing pale. Now all was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet save for the boom and roar of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bells. The pigeons were circling high in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear sky, were coming back. She went</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly the way Ignacio had gonj, calling</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to him-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He seemed all unmoved now as he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bells cry out for him; it was for him to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm while they trembled with the event</seg><seg type="columnLine">which surely they must understand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a man dead," he told her, as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hand called upon the Captain for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">volume of sound from his bronze throat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You will see. And there will be more</seg><seg type="columnLine">work for RodericoNortone!" He sighed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head and for a moment spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly with his jangling bells. "And some</seg><seg type="columnLine">day," he continued quietly, "it will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roderico's time, no? And I will ring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Bells of San Juan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bells for him and the Captain and the Dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cer and Lolita, they will all put tears into</seg><seg type="columnLine">men's eyes. But first, Santa Maria, let it</seg><seg type="columnLine">be that I ring the others for him when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">marries himself with the banker's daugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A man dead?" the girl repeated, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to grasp fully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "You will see," returned Ignacio.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GIRL in the old mission gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den stood staring at Ignacio Chavez</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long time, seeming compelled by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">force greater than her own to watch him</seg><seg type="columnLine">tugging and jerking at his bells. Plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough she understood that this, was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm being sounded; a man dead through</seg><seg type="columnLine">violence and the bell-ringer stirring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">town with it. But when presently he let</seg><seg type="columnLine">two of the ropes slip out of his hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began a slow, mournful tolling of the Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain alone, she shuddered a little and with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That it might be merely a case of a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded, even badly wounded, did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">once suggest itself to her. Ignacio had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken as one who knew, in full confidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with finality. She should see! She</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back to the little bench which one day</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be a bright green and sat down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She could see that again the pigeons were</seg><seg type="columnLine">circling excitedly; that from the baking</seg><seg type="columnLine">street little puffs of dust arose to hang idly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the still air as though they were painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the clear canvas of the sky. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard the voices of men, faint quick sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the tolling of the bell. Then sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly all was very still once more; Ignacio</seg><seg type="columnLine">had allowed the Captain to resume his silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">brooding, and came to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I must go to see who it is," he apologized.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then I will know better how to ring for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. The sheepman from Las Palmas, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">bet you. For did I not see when just now I</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed the Casa Blanca that he was a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk with Senor Galloway's whisky?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And does not every one know he sold many</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheep and that means much money these</seg><seg type="columnLine">days? Si, senorita; it will be the sheepman</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Las Palmas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He was gone, slouching along again and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">no haste now that he had fulfilled his first</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty. What haste could there possibly be</seg><seg type="columnLine">since, sheepman from Las Palmas or an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, he was dead and therefore must wait</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Ignacio Chavez's pleasure? Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how she gleaned this thought from his man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner and therefore did not speak as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched him depart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That portion of the street which she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see from where she sat was empty, the dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">settling, thinning, disappearing. Further</seg><seg type="columnLine">down toward the Casa Blanca she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine the little knots of men asking one</seg><seg type="columnLine">another what had happened and how; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief actor in this fragment of human drama</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could picture lying inert, uncaring that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was for him that a bell had tolled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would toll again, that men congregated</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a little while Ignacio would return,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuffling, smoking a dangling cigaret, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat cocked against the sun; he would give</seg><seg type="columnLine">her full particulars and then return to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had come to San Juan to make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">home here, to become a part of it, to make it</seg><seg type="columnLine">a portion of her. To arrive upon a day like</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was no pleasant omen; it was too dread-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully like taking a room in a house only to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear the life rattling out of a man beyond a</seg><seg type="columnLine">partition. She was suddenly averse to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing Ignacio's details; there came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick desire to set her back to the town</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose silence on the heels of uproar</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rising hastily she went with quick steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the weed-bordered walk, out at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken gate and turned toward the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains. One glance down the street as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed it showed her what she had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected; a knot of men at the door of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Casa Blanca, another small group at a win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow, evidently taking stock of a broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">window-pane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun, angry and red, was hanging low</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a distant line of hills, the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiat lands were already drawing about them</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thin faintly colorful haze. She had put</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her hat and, like Ignacio, had set it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little to the side of her head, feeling her</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks burning when the direct rays found</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. The fine, loose soil was sifting into</seg><seg type="columnLine">her low slippers before she had gone a score</seg><seg type="columnLine">of paces. When she came back she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpack her trunk and get out a sensible pair</seg><seg type="columnLine">of boots. No doubt she was dressed ridic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ulously, but then the heat had tempted</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A curious matter presented itself to her:</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the little groups upon the street she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not seen a single woman. Were there none</seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in San Juan? Was this some strange, alto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether masculine community which she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumbled into? Then she remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">how the bell-ringer had mentioned Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Engle, the banker's wife, and his daughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mrs. Struve and others. Besides all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this she had a letter to Mrs. Engle which she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going to present this evening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was thinking of anything in the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">but of a tragedy not yet grown cold, so near</seg><seg type="columnLine">her that for a little it had seemed to em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brace her. Now it was almost as though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not occurred. The world was all un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed about her, the town somnolent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had shuddered as Ignacio played upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bell; but the shudder was rather from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bell's resonant eloquence than from any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more vital cause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A man she had never seen, whose name</seg><seg type="columnLine">even she did not know, had been shot by</seg><seg type="columnLine">another man unknown to her; she had heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the shots; she had seen nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">True, she had heard also a voice crying out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but she sensed that it had been the voice of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an onlooker. She felt ashamed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">episode did not move her more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As, earlier in the afternoon, she had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn from the heat of her room at Struve's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel by the shade to be found in the mission</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden, so now did a long, wavering line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cottonwoods beckon to her. In files which</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned eastward or westward here and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to come back to the general northerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">trend, they indicated where an arroyo</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhed down, tortured-serpent-wise, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountains. Through their foliage she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had glimpsed the Engle home. She ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected to find running water under their</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade, that and an attendant coolness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the arroyo proved to be dry and hot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gap in the dry bosom of the earth, its bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom strewn with smooth pebbles and sand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a very sparse, unattractive vegetation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunted and harsh. And it was almost as</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot here as on San Juan's street; into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade crept the heat waves of the dry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scorched air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Led by the line of cottonwoods, seeking</seg><seg type="columnLine">action rather than coolness yet craving</seg><seg type="columnLine">both, she found a little path and followed it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiencing a vague relief to have the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">town at her back. She knew that distances</seg><seg type="columnLine">deceived the eye in this bleak land, and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">she thought that before dark she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the hills, idle there where perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were a few languid flowers and pools,</seg><seg type="columnLine">returning just tired enough to eat and go</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to sleep. She rather thought that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">woukl postpone her call on the Engles until</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's manana-land, after all," she told</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself, with a quick smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half an hour later she found a spot 'where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trees stood in a denser growth, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">greener, more vigorous--less thirsty. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">could fancy the great roots, questing far</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward through the layers of dry soil,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrusting themselves almost with a human,</seg><seg type="columnLine">passionate eagerness into the water they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had found. Here she threw herself down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying upon her back, gazing up through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches and leaves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never until now had she known the mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of utter stillness. She saw a bird, a poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown unkempt little being; it had no song</seg><seg type="columnLine">to offer the silence and in a little while flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">away listlessly. She had seen a rabbit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big gaunt uncomely wretch of a thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappearing silently among the clumps of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her spirit, essentially bright and happy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had striven hard with a new form of weari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness all day. Not only was she coming into</seg><seg type="columnLine">another land than that which she knew and</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood; she was entering another phase</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her life. She had chosen voluntarily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without device or suggestion; she had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">her reasons and they had seemed sufficient,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were still sufficient. She had chosen</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisely; she held to that, her judgment un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But that stubbornly recurrent sense that</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the old landmarks she had abandoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old life; that both in physical fact and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiritual and mental actuality she was at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">threshold of an unguessed, essentially differ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent life, was disquieting. There is no get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting away from an old.basic truth that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's life is so strongly influenced as almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be molded by his environment; there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was uneasiness in the thought that here</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's existence might grow to resemble his</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitat, taking on the gray tone and mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">notony and bleak barrenness of this sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">smitten land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yielding a little already to the command</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid upon breathing nature hereabouts she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lying still, her hands lax, her thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking unto themselves something of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">character of the listless, songless brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird's flight. She had come here today</seg><seg type="columnLine">following in the footsteps of other men and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few women. Her own selection of San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Juan was explicable; the thing to wonder at</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Bells of San Juan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">45</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was what had given the hardihood to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first men to stop here and make houses and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then homes?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later she would know; the one magic</seg><seg type="columnLine">word of the desert lands: water. For San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Juan, standing midway between the rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road and the more tempting lands beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountains, had found birth here because</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a mudhole for cradle; down under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sand were fortuitous layers of impervi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous clay cupping to hold much sweet water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HTHE SLOW tolling of a bell came</seg><seg type="columnLine">billowing out through the silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl sat up. It was the Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain. Never, it seemed to her, had she</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard anything so mournful. Ignacio had</seg><seg type="columnLine">informed himself concerning all details and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had returned to the garden at the mission.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man was dead, then. There could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt as one listened to the measured</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorrowing of the big bell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She got to her feet and walking swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved on, still further away from San Juan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The act was without premeditation; her</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole being was insistent upon it. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered if it was the sheepman from Las</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palmas; if he had, perhaps, a wife and</seg><seg type="columnLine">children. Then she stopped suddenly; a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new thought had come to her. Strange,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inexplicable even, it had not suggested it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She wondered who the other man was, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who had done the killing. And what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had happened to him? Had he fled? Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">other men grappled with him, disarmed him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made of him a prisoner to answer for what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had done? What had been his motive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what passion had actuated him? Surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">not just the greed for gold which the bell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringer had suggested! What sort of a crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture was he who, in cold, calculating blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">could murder a man for a handful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">money?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was nothing to answer unless she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could catch the thought of Ignacio Chavez</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ringing of his bell. She moved on</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, hurrying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following the arroyo she had come to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first of the little, smooth hills, the lomas as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men on the stage had named them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through them the dry watercourse wrig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gled, carrying its green pennons along its</seg><seg type="columnLine">marge. She went up gentle slopes mantled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with bleached grass which under her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">was white in the glare of the sun. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun was very low now, very fierce and red,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an angry god going down in temporary de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feat but defiant to the last, filled with threat</seg><seg type="columnLine">for tomorrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The far western uplands cut the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">disc squarely in two; down slipped the half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wafer until it seemed that just a bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal-fire was kindled upon the ridge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as that faded from her eyes the slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobbing of the swinging bell was like a wail</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the death of the day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had removed her hat, fancying that</seg><seg type="columnLine">already the earth was throwing off its heat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a little coolness and freshness was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down to meet her from the mountains.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She turned her eyes toward them and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just after the sunset, it was that she saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man riding toward her. He was still far off</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she first glimpsed him, half or</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-quarters of a mile, just cresting one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the higher hills so that for him the sun had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet set. For she caught the glint of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light flaming back from the silver chasings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his bridle and from the barrel of the gun</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the hollow of his left arm. She did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not believe that he had seen her in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow of the cottonwoods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If she went on sh6 must meet him pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently. She glanced back over her shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">noting how far she had come from the town.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was very still again; the bell had ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">its complaint; the hoofs of the approaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse seemed shod with felt, falling upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt. She swung about and walked back</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward San Juan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little later she heard the man's voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">calling. Clearly to her since there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one else. Why should he call to her? She</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave no sign of having heard but walked on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trifle faster. She sensed that he was gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loping down upon her; sensed merely for</seg><seg type="columnLine">still in the loose sand the hoofbeats were</seg><seg type="columnLine">muffled. Then he called again and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped and turned and waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A splendid big fellow he was, she noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he came on, riding a splendid big horse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man and beast seemed to belong to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert; had it not been for the glint of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun she realized now she would probably not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have distinguished their distant forms from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the land across which they had moved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The horse was a darkish, dull gray; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, boots, corduroy breeches, soft shirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hat, was garbed in gray or so covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the dust of travel as to seem so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What in the world are you doing way out</seg><seg type="columnLine">here?" he called to her. And then having</seg><seg type="columnLine">come closer he reined in his horse, stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">46</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her a moment in surprised wonderment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept off his hat and said, a shade awk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wardly: "I beg pardon. I thought you</seg><seg type="columnLine">were some one else."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For her wide hat was again drooping</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her face and he had had just the form</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hor and the white skirt and waist to</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is all right," she said lightly. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagined that you had made a mistake."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was something of a victory over herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have succeeded in speaking thus care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly. For there had been the impulse, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">temptation almost, just to stare back at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man as he had stared at her and in silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not only was the type physically magnifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent; to her it was, like everything about</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, new. And that which had held her at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first was his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For it is not the part of youth to be stern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyed; and while this man could not be more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than midway between twenty and thirty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes had already acquired the trick of</seg><seg type="columnLine">being hard, steely, suggesting relentlessness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern and quick. Tall, lean-bodied, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">big calloused hands, as brown as an Indian,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair and eyes were uncompromisingly black.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He belonged to the Southwestern wastes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These things she noted, and that his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked drawn and weary, that about his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand was tied a handkerchief, hinting at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minor cut, that his horse looked as travel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn as himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One doesn't see strangers often around</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Juan," he explained.

I'll have to look out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The muscles of the tired face softened a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little, into his eyes came a quick light that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was good to see, for an instant masking their</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitual sternness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you'll excuse me again, and if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know a whole lot about this country</seg><seg type="columnLine">--" he paused to measure her sweepingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed satisfied and concluded--"I wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">go out all alone like this; especially after</seg><seg type="columnLine">sundown. We're a rather tough lot, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. Good-by."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had lifted his hat again, loosened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse's reins and passed by her. Just as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had expected, just as she had desired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And yet, with his dusty back turned upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">her she experienced a sudden return of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">loneliness. Would she ever look into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of a friend again? Could she ever ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tually accomplish what she had set out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplish; make San Juan a home?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her eyes followed him, frankly admiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">now; so she might have looked at any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nature's triumphant creations. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he had gone a score of yards, she saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">how a little tightening of his horse's reins</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought the big brute down from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging gallop to a dead standstill. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell was tolling again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again he was calling to her, again, swing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing about, he had ridden to her side. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice now, like his eyes, was ominously</seg><seg type="columnLine">stem.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who is it?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know," she told him, marvelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the look on his face. His emotion was</seg><seg type="columnLine">purely one of anger, mounting anger that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was dead! "The man who rings the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bells told me that he thought it must be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheepman from Las Palmas. He went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see--I didn't wait."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor did this man wait now. Again he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had wheeled; now he was racing along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arroyo, urging a tired horse that he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose no unnecessary handful of moments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as he went she heard him curse savagely</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his breath and knew that he had for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotten her in the thoughts which had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">released by the dull booming of a bell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN THE bar at the Casa Blanca,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long wide room, low-ceilinged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with cool, sprinkled floor a score or</seg><seg type="columnLine">more men had congregated.

Rod Nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton, again glancing sharply across the faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">confronting him, went to the closed door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">set his hand to the knob. But Jim Gallo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way having desired privacy just now had</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked the door.

Norton's eyes, probing into</seg><seg type="columnLine">every square foot of the chamber, took stock</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Jim Galloway and beyond him of Kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rickard, slouching forward in a chair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling a cigaret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Norton," said Galloway, tone-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly.

Chin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw and mouth, the latter full-lipped, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of strength, smashing power and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural cruelty.

A thin wisp of straw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored hair across a low, atavistic forehead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unhealthy, yellowish skin, with pale, lack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luster, faded blue eyes, he looked evil and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicious and cruel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One looking from him to Jim Galloway</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have suspected that one could be as</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhuman as the other but with the difference</seg><seg type="columnLine">that that which was but means to an end</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Galloway would be end in itself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kid Rickard.

Going to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">far end of the room where the chair leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the table, he found that a pane of</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass in the window opening upon the street</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been broken.

Nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's eyes rested on the man's boots longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">than upon the cold face. Then, stepping</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the door so that all in the barroom</seg><seg type="columnLine">might catch the significance of his words he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said sharply:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How many men of you know where Bis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bee always carried his money when he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his way to bank?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In his boots!" answered two voices to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come this way, boys.

It was at the front of -the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building, upon the ground floor, and opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost immediately when he rapped. Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fronting him, her own hands just being</seg><seg type="columnLine">dried upon a small linen towel, was the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had encountered at the arroyo.

For the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">part the miscellany consisted of big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fat books, bundles of towels and fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">white napkins, stoppered bottles of vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored contents and black leather cases, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt containing a surgeon's instruments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through an open door giving entrance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the adjoining room he noted further signs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">unpacking with a marked difference in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">character of the litter; the girl stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly to this door, shutting out the vision</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a helter-skelter of feminine apparel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is your hand?" she asked, as in most</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly matter-of-fact fashion she put</seg><seg type="columnLine">out her own for it.

Over an alcohol lamp she heated</seg><seg type="columnLine">some water; in a bowl, brought from the ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joining room, she cleansed the hand thor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oughly. Then the application of the final</seg><seg type="columnLine">antiseptic, a bit of absorbent cotton, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">winding of surgeon's tape about a bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gauze, and the thing was done. Only at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">end did she say--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's a peculiar cut--not a knife-cut, is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"No," he answered humorously. "Did it</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a piece of lead. 1 How much is it, Doctor?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Two dollars," she told him, again busied</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the drying of her own hands. "Better</seg><seg type="columnLine">let me look at it again in the morning if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">pains you any."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He laid two silver dollars in her palm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated a moment and then went out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She's got the nerve," was his thoughtful</seg><seg type="columnLine">estimate as he went to his corner table in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dining-room, "ftut I don't believe she</seg><seg type="columnLine">is going to last long in San Juan. Funny</seg><seg type="columnLine">she should come to a place like this, anyhow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wonder what the V stands for?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At any rate the hand had been skilfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated and bandaged; he nodded at it</seg><seg type="columnLine">approvingly. Then, with his meal set be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore him, he divided his thoughts pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">evenly between it and the recent shooting at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Casa Blanca. The sense was strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him as it had been many a time before</seg><seg type="columnLine">that before very long either Rod Norton or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Galloway would lie as the sheepman</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Las Palmas was lying, while the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">might watch his sunrises and sunsets with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strange, new emotion of security.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sheriff, manifesting an appetite</seg><seg type="columnLine">which gave color to the suspicion that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not eaten for a matter of twelve hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beginning his meal when the newest</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger in San Juan came into the dining-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. She had had time to finish bathing</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hands and face, had arranged her lus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trous copper-brown hair becomingly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked fresh and cool and pretty. Norton</seg><seg type="columnLine">approved of her with his keen eyes while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched her go to her place at a table</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the room. As she sat down, giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sign of having noted him, her back to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward him, he continued to observe and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">admire her lithe, perfect figure and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong, sensitive hands busied with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">napkin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A slovenly, half-grown Indian girl, Anita,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cook's daughter, came in from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen, directed the slumbrous eyes of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">race upon the sheriff who fitted well in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman's eye, and went to serve the single</seg><seg type="columnLine">other late diner. Now Norton caught a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleeting view of V. D. Page's throat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheek as she turned slightly in speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Anita. The serving-maid withdrew</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as she went out Norton rose to his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crossed the room to the far table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">52</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "May I bring my things over and eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you?" he asked when he stood looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on her and she had lifted her eyes curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously to his. "If you've come to stay you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't go on forever not knowing anybody</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, you know. Since you've got to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">us sooner or later why not begin to get ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quainted? Here and now and with me?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm Roderick Norton."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One must have had far less discernment</seg><seg type="columnLine">than she not to have felt instinctively that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great bulk of human conventions would</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrivel and vanish before they could cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">this far across the desert lands. Besides</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man standing over her looked straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and honestly into her eyes and for a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">she glimpsed again the youth of him veiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the sternness his life had set into his soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">and upon his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is kind of you to have pity upon me in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my isolation," she answered lightly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">without hesitation. "And, to tell the truth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I never was so terribly lonesome in all my</seg><seg type="columnLine">life."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made two trips back and forth to bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">his plate and coffee cup and auxiliary sauce</seg><seg type="columnLine">dishes and plated silver while she wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly that he did not instruct the Indian girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">to perform the service for him. Even then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she half-formulated the thought that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a much more natural thing for this man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do for himself what he wanted done than</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him to sit down to be waited upon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A small matter, no doubt; but then moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains are made up of small particles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">character of just such small characteristics</seg><seg type="columnLine">as this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING the half-hour which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they spent together over their meal</seg><seg type="columnLine">they got to know each other rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than chance acquaintances are likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do in so brief a time. For from the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of Norton's coming over to her table</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bars were fortuitously down between</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. She was plainly eager to supplement</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ignacio Chavez's information of la genie of</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Juan and its surrounding country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">evincing a curiosity which he readily under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood to be based upon the necessities of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">profession.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In return for all that he told her she</seg><seg type="columnLine">sketchily spoke of her own plans, very</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague plans, to be sure, she admitted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of her quick, gay smiles. She had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared to accept what she found; she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing no game of hide and seek with her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">destiny, but had come out thus far from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">former limits of her existence to meet life</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-way, hoping to do good for others, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little imperiously determined to achieve</seg><seg type="columnLine">her own measure of success and happiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the beginning each was ready, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps more than ready, to like the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her eyes, whether they smiled or grew sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly grave, pleased him; always were they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearless. He sensed that beneath the exter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nal soft beauty of a very lovely young</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman there was a spirit of hardihood in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every sense worthy of the success which she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come out bare-handed to make for</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself, and in the estimation of Rod</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norton no quality stood higher than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">superb independence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On her part, there was first a definite</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise, then a glow of satisfaction that in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this virile arm of the law there was nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the blusterer. She set him down as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet gentleman first, as a sheriff next.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She enjoyed his low, good-humored laugh</seg><seg type="columnLine">and laughed back with him, even while she</seg><seg type="columnLine">experienced again the unaccustomed thrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the sheer physical bigness of him, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">essentially masculine strength of a hardy</seg><seg type="columnLine">son of the Southwestern outdoors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Not once had he referred to the affair at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Casa Blanca or to his part in it; not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">question did she ask him concerning it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He told himself that so utterly human, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly feminine a being as she must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning with curiosity; she marvelled that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could think, speak of anything else.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When they rose together from the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were alike prepared, should circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance so direct, to be friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was going now to call upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Engles.

They're</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends of mine, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed and, as they left the hotel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">propounded a riddle for him to answer:</seg><seg type="columnLine">should Mr. Norton introduce her to Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Engle so that she might present her letter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or, after the letter was presented, should</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Engle introduce her to Mr. Norton?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It did not suggest itself to her until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed from the street, through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cottonwoods and into the splendid living-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room of the Engle home, that her escort was</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Bells of San Juan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">53</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not dressed as she had imagined all civilized</seg><seg type="columnLine">mankind dressed for a call. Walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the primitive town his boots and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft shirt and travel-soiled hat had been in</seg><seg type="columnLine">too perfect keeping with the environment</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her to be more than pleasurably con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious of them. At the Engle's, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his garb struck her for a moment of the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock of contrast, as almost grotesquely out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the broad front door Norton had</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapped. The desultory striking of a piano's</seg><seg type="columnLine">keys ceased abruptly, a girl's voice crying</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly, "It's Roddy!" hinted at the iden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tity of the listless player; a door within</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung open flooded the broad entrance hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">with light. And then the outer door</seg><seg type="columnLine">framed banker Engle's daughter, fair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired, fair-skinned, fluffy-skirted, her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright with unhidden expectation, her two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands held out offering themselves in dou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled greetings. But, having seen the unex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected guest at the sheriff's side, the bright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired girl paused for a brief moment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncertainty upon the threshold, her hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">falling to her sides.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Florrie," Norton was saying,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly. "I have brought a caller for your</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother. Miss Engle, Miss Page."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you do, Miss Page?" Florrie'</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied, regaining her poise and giving one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hands to each of the callers, the abandon</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her first appearance gone in a flash to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced by a vague hint of stiffness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mama will be so glad to see you. Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">come in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned and led the way down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide, deep hall and into the living-room, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber which boldly defied one to remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber that he was still upon the rim of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert. In one swift glance the newcomer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to San Juan was offered a picture in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tall, carelessly-clad form of the sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">became incongruous; she wondered that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained at his ease as he so obviously</seg><seg type="columnLine">did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yonder was a grand piano, a silver-chased</seg><seg type="columnLine">vase upon a wall bracket over it holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">three long-stemmed, red roses; a heavy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">massive-topped table strewn comfortably</seg><seg type="columnLine">and invitingly with books and magazines;</seg><seg type="columnLine">an exquisite rug and one painting upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">far wall, an original seascape suggestive of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Waugh at his best; excellent, leather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">upholstered chairs luxuriously inviting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once homelike and rich. Just rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one of these chairs drawn up to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">table reading-lamp, a book still in his hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Mr. Engle, while Mrs. Engle, in lavender,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as fair as her daughter, just beginning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grow stout, came forward smilingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Back again, Roddy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She gave him a plump hand, patted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lean brown fingers after her motherly fash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion, and came to where the girl had stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">just within the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Virginia Page, aren't you?

Oh, kiss me, kiss</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, my dear, for your mother's sake, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">save your handshakes for strangers."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Virginia, taken utterly by surprise as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Engle's arms closed warmly about her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew rosy with pleasure; the dreary loneli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of a long day was wiped out with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">kiss and a hug.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I didn't know--" she began haltingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to be cut short by Mrs. Engle crying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her husband:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's Virginia Page, John.

Not that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it mattered or concerned her in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest particular. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In her hand was the note of introduction</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had brought from Mrs. Seth Morgan;</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently both its services and those of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roderick Norton might be dispensed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the matter of her being presented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," Mrs. Engle was saying.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An arm about the girl's slim waist, she drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to a big leather couch and, still holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hand, sat down beside her.

Now, tell us all about yourself."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Virginia, who had been a little stiff-</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscled until now, leaned back among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cushions unconscious of a half-sigh of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent and of her relaxation. During the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">day San Juan had sought to frighten, to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pel her. Now it was making ample</seg><seg type="columnLine">amends. First the companionable society</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Rod Norton, then the simple, hearty</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcome here. She returned the pressure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Engle's soft, warm hands in sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER THAT they chatted</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly, Engle gradually withdraw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from the conversation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretly watching the girl keenly, studying</seg><seg type="columnLine">her play of expression, seeking according</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his habit to make his guarded estimate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new factor in his household. From Vir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginia's face his eyes went swiftly now and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">then to his daughter's, animated in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">tete-a-t&amp;te with the sheriff. Once, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Virginia turned unexpectedly, she caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hint of a troubled frown in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Broad double doors in the west wall of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">living-room gave entrance to the patio.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The doors were open now to the slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">freshening night air and from where she sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">Virginia Page had a glimpse of a charming</seg><seg type="columnLine">court, an orange-tree heavy with fruit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blossom, red and yellow roses, a sleeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">fountain whose still water reflected star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shine and the lamp in its niche under a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grape-vine arbor. When Norton and Flor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence Engle strolled out into the inviting</seg><seg type="columnLine">patio Engle, breaking his silence, leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward and dominated the conversation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Virginia had been doing the major part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the talking, answering questions about Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Engle's girlhood home, telling something of</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself. Now John Engle, reminding his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife that their guest must be consumed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity about her new environment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought to interest her in this and that in and</seg><seg type="columnLine">about San Juan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There was a killing this afternoon," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitted, quietly. "No doubt you know of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it and have been shocked by it, and perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">on account of it have a little misjudged San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Juan. We are not all cutthroats here, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">any manner of means; I think I might al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most say that the rough element is in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">minority. We are in a state of transition,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like all other frontier settlements. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad, though it doesn't come closer than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little tank station where you took thestage</seg><seg type="columnLine">this morning, has touched our lives out here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "A railroad brings civilizing influences;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the first thing it does is to bring in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">surging tide of forces contending against</seg><seg type="columnLine">law and order. Pioneers," and he smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his slow, grave, tolerant smile, "are as often</seg><seg type="columnLine">as not tumultuous-blooded and self-suffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient and prone to kick over the established</seg><seg type="columnLine">traces. We've got that class to deal with</seg><seg type="columnLine">now--and that boy, Rod Norton, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">job cut out for him, is getting results. He's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the biggest man, not only in the county, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this end of the State right now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Further to that he told her something of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sheriff. Young Norton, having re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned from college some three years before</seg><seg type="columnLine">to live the only life possible to one of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood, had become manager of his father's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranch in and beyond the San Juan Moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains. At the time Billy Norton was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">county sheriff and had his hands full. Ru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Bells of San Juan</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">55</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mor said that he had promised himself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">"get" a certain man; Engle admitted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">that man was Jim Galloway of the Casa</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blanca. But either Galloway or a tool of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galloway or some other man had "gotten"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy Norton, shooting him down in his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin and from the back, putting a shotgun</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge of buckshot into his brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had occurred shortly after Roderick</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norton's return, shortly before the expira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of Billy Norton's term of office. Rod</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norton, putting another man in his place on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ranch, had buried his father and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">had asked of the county his election to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place made empty by his father's death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though he was young, men believed in him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The election returns gave him his place by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushing majority.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And he has done good work," concluded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Engle thoughtfully. "Because of what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">has done, because he does not make an ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest until he has his evidence and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">drives hard to a certain conviction, he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to be called 'Dead-sure Norton' and has</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to be respected everywhere and feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a little. Until now it has become</seg><seg type="columnLine">virtually a two-man fight, Rod Norton</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Jim Galloway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "John," interposed Mrs. Engle, "aren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you giving Virginia rather a somber side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe I am," he agreed. "But this</seg><seg type="columnLine">killing of the Las Palmas man in broad day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light has become pretty close to filling my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. Who's going to be next?" His eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">went swiftly toward the patio, taking stock</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the two figures there. Then he shrugged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the table for a cigar and returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling to inform Virginia of life on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert and in the valleys beyond the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains, of scattering attempts at reclama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and irrigation, of how one made towns</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sun-dried mud, of where the adobe soil</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself was found, drifted over with sand in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shade of the cottonwoods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Mrs. Engle's sigh, while her husband</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke of black mud and straw, testified that</seg><seg type="columnLine">her thoughts had clung about those events</seg><seg type="columnLine">and possibilities which she herself had</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked him to avoid; her eyes wandered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tall, rudely-garbed figure dimly seen in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the patio. Virginia, recalling Jim Galloway</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she had seen him on the stage, heavy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodied, narrow-hipped, masterful alike in</seg><seg type="columnLine">carriage and the look of the prominent eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced with Mrs. Engle toward Rod</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was laughing at something passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">between him and Florence and for the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment appeared utterly boyish.

What has</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galloway got to do with it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ask him. He says Rickard killed Bis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bee in self-defense."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh," said Patten.

Even now she did not look toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">her kinswoman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JOHN ENGLE replied, speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">crisply. But just what he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Virginia did not know. For sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly her whole attention was withdrawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the conversation, fixed and held by</seg><seg type="columnLine">something moving in the patio. First</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had noted a slight change in Rod Nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's eyes, saw them grow keen and watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful, noted that they had turned toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door opening into the little court where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fountain was, where the wall lamp threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">its rays wanly among the shrubs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the grape arbor. He had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">something move out there; from where she</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat she could look the way he looked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark how a clump of rose bushes had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbed and now were growing motion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less again in the quiet night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wondering, she looked again to Norton.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes told nothing now save that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were keen and watchful. Whether or not</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew what it was so guardedly stirring in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the patio, whether he like herself had merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen the gently agitated leaves of the bushes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could not even guess. She started when</seg><seg type="columnLine">58</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Engle addressed some trifling remark to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her; while she evaded the direct answer she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was fully conscious of the sheriff's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady upon her. He, no doubt, was won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering what she had seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was only a moment later that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheriff rose and went to Mrs. Engle, telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">her briefly that he had had a day of it, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the saddle since dawn, wishing her good</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. He shook hands with Engle, nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Patten, and coming to Virginia said</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly but, she thought, with an almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">sternly serious look in his eyes:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're all hoping you like San Juan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Page.

Good night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She understood his meaning and though a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrill of excitement ran through her blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered laughingly:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Shall a woman learn from the desert?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Have I been such a chatter-box, Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Engle, that I am to be admonished at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to learn to hold my tongue?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Florence looked at her curiously, turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Norton and then went with him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. For a moment their voices came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an indistinguishable murmur down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hallway; then Norton was gone and Flor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence returned slowly to the living-room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again and again Virginia looked out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the patio. Never a twig stirred now; all</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as quiet as the sleeping fountains, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent and mystery-filled as the desert itself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had Roderick Norton seen more than she?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Did he know who had been out there?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was here the beginning of some further</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinister outgrowth of the lawlessness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kid Rickard? Of the animosity of Jim</seg><seg type="columnLine">Galloway? Was she presently to see Nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton himself slipping into the patio from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side, was she again to hear the rattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pistol shots?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had asked that she say nothing; she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had unhesitatingly given him her promise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had she so unquestioningly done as he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">requested because he was the sheriff who</seg><seg type="columnLine">represented the law, or because he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roderick Norton who stood for fine, up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing manhood? Again she felt Flor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence Engle'e eyes fixed upon her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Florence is prepared at the beginning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dislike me," she thought. "Why? Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">because I walked with him from the hotel?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the heat of an argument with Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Engle there came an interruption. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">banker's wife was insisting that Virginia</seg><seg type="columnLine">"do the only sensible thing in the world,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she accept a home under the Engle</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof, occupying the room already made</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for her. Virginia, warmed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cordial invitation, while deeply grateful</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that she had no right to accept. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to San Juan to make her own way;</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had no claim against the hospitality of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her kinswoman, certainly no such claim as</seg><seg type="columnLine">was implied now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Besides, there was Elmer Page.

At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment when it seemed that a deadlock had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come between Mrs. Engle's eagerness to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother her cousin's daughter and Vir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginia's inborn sense of independence, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interruption came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It arrived in the form of a boy of ten or</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve, a ragged, scantily-clothed, swarthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngster, rubbing a great toe against a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bare leg, while from the front door he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced that Ignacio Chavez was sick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had eaten something muy malo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had pains and that he prayed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor cure him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Patten grunted his disgust.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell him to wait," he said briefly.

Virginia</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose swiftly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see," she said to Mrs. Engle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"what a nuisance it would be if I lived with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?

Maybe he thinks</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'll get a free drink of whisky."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see again," laughed Virginia from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorway, "what it would be like, Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Engle; if every time I had to make a call</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mr. Engle deemed it necessary to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me--I'd have to split my fees with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him at the very least!

"I had to have a word</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her immediately. And I'm glad that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you came, Engle.

And say nothing about my hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sent the boy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Engle did not answer immediately. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Virginia stood trying to see the sheriff's</seg><seg type="columnLine">features through the darkness.

"I think you're mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken there, my boy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe," returned Norton. "But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't afford right now to make any mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes. Further," and in the gloom they</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw his shoulders lifted in a shrug, "I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">trusting Miss Page because I've got to!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Which may not sound pretty, but which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course I'll do what you ask," Engle</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "Is there anything else?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. Just to go on with Miss Page to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see Ignacio.

Then you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can see her to the hotel and go back home,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sending the horse over right away. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she will ride with me to see a man who is</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt--or she will not and I'll have to take a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">chance on Patten."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Who is it?" demanded Engle sharply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's 'Brocky' Lane," returned Norton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again his voice told of rigid muscles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and hard eyes.

"I'll be ready when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Page comes in. Good night, John."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And silently, without awaiting promise or</seg><seg type="columnLine">protest from the girl, he was gone into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper shadows of the cottonwoods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IGNACIO CHAVEZ, because thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could be of service to el sen or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roderico Nortone whom he ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mired vastly and loved like a brother, drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the dregs upon his fine Latin talent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubled up and otherwise contorted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted his lithe body until the sweat stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">out upon his forehead.

Going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the door she found that it was Julius</seg><seg type="columnLine">Struve instead of Norton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are to come with me," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel-keeper softly.

A moment Struve</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused, listening. Then, touching her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeve, he hurried away into the night, going</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the black line of cottonwoods, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl keeping close to his heels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the dry arroyo Norton was waiting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding two saddled horses.

Struve had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned back to the hotel. In another mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and still in silence, Virginia and Nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton were riding away from San Juan, keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the shadows of the trees, headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the mountains in the north.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now suddenly Virginia found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was giving herself over utterly, unex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pectedly to a keen, pulsing joy of life.

The soft thud</seg><seg type="columnLine">of shod hoofs in yielding soil was music to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, mingled as it was with the creak of</seg><seg type="columnLine">saddle leather, the jingle of bridle and spur</seg><seg type="columnLine">chains. She wondered if there had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">been so perfect a night, if she had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted so finely bred a saddle-animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far ahead the San Juan Mountains lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">their serrated ridge of ebony.

On all hands little</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind-shaped ridges were like crests of long</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves in an ocean which had just now been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stilled, brooded over by the desert- silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the desert stars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose," said Norton at last, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's up to me to explain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then begin," said Virginia, "by telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">me where we are going."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He swung up his arm, pointing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yonder.

"Unless you're made of</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron I'm almost inclined to believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">after your friend Brocky I'll have another</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient.

Before the night is out you'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">know rather a good deal about what is go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on, Miss Page," he added, thoughtfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "More than you'd have been willing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to know if circumstances hadn't forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">your hand?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he admitted coolly. "To get</seg><seg type="columnLine">anywhere we've had to sit tight on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">game we're playing. But, from the word</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cutter brings, poor old Brocky is pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard hit, and I couldn't take any chances</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his life even though it means taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances in another direction."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He might have been a shade less frank;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet she liked him none the less for giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">her the truth bluntly.

What sinister chain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances had impelled Moraga, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">Norton said was Galloway's man, to shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the cattle foreman? And Galloway</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, what type of man must he be if all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she had heard of him were true, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">were his ambitions, his plans, his power?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BEFORE long Norton pointed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her, looming ever vaster before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, the shadowy form of Mt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Temple, its mass of rock, of wind-blown,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind-carved peaks lifted in somber defiance</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the star-filled sky.

The man and girl riding swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">side by side felt in their different ways ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cording to their different characters and</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous experience the mute command laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them and for the most part their lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">were hushed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came the first slopes, the talus of</seg><seg type="columnLine">strewn, broken, disintegrating rock and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the first of the cliffs. Now the sheriff</seg><seg type="columnLine">rode in the fore and Virginia kept her frown-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing eyes always upon his form leading the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. They turned to the left, entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad mouth of a ravine, found an uneven</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail, and were swallowed up by its utter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">impenetrable blackness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Give Persis her head," Norton advised</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.

She sighed, sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in her saddle, relaxed, loosened her reins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an hour they climbed almost steadily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">winding in and out, frequently riding five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred or a thousand feet to accomplish a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred of the distance toward Brocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lane. Now, high above the bed of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorge, the darkness had thinned about them;</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than once the girl saw the clear-cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">silhouette of man and beast in front of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">or swerving off to right or left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When after a long time he spoke again he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was waiting for her to come up with him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had dismounted, loosened the cinch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his saddle and tied his horse to a stunted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted tree in a little flat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have to go ahead on foot now," he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">told her as he put out his hand to help her</seg><seg type="columnLine">down. And then as they stood side by side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tired much?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," she answered.

She kept her place</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost at his heels, now and again accepting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand he offered as their way grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">steeper underfoot. Half an hour ago she</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that they had swerved off to the left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the deep gorge into whose mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had ridden so far below; now she saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were once more drawing close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steep-walled canon. Its emptiness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">black and sinister, lay between them and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of bare peaks which were lifted like</seg><seg type="columnLine">cathedral spires against the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This would be simple enough in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">daytime," Norton told her during one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their brief pauses.

Oh,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he laughed carelessly, "you'd stop be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore you got to the bottom, but then a drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">of even half a dozen feet is no joke here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If you'll pardon me I'll make sure for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With no further apology or explanation</seg><seg type="columnLine">he slipped the end of a rope about her waist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tying it in a hard knot. Until now she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even known that he had brought a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope; now she wondered just how hazardous</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hidden trail was which they were trav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eling; if it were in truth but the matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a dozen feet which she would fall if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped? He made the other end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">short rope fast about his own body, said</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Ready?" and again she followed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There came little flat spaces, then broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulders to clamber through and over, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">steep, rugged climbs when they grasped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough rocks with both hands and moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">on with painful slowness. It seemed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl that they had been climbing for long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tedious hours since they had slipped out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their saddles; though to him she said noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, locking her lips stubbornly, she knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that at last she was tired, very tired, that an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abandoned in the Ice</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">63</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">end of this laborious ascent must come soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">or she would be forced to stop and he down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fifteen minutes," said the sheriff, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we're there.

Then he dropped down at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, looked at his watch in the light of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaring match carefully cupped in his hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lighted his pipe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nearly midnight," he told her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without replying she lay back against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slope of the mountain, closed her eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">relaxed, breathing deeply.

Her chest</seg><seg type="columnLine">expanded deeply to the long indrawn breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">which filled her lungs with the rare air.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She felt suddenly a little sleepy, dreaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">longingly of the unutterable content one</seg><seg type="columnLine">could find in just going to sleep with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff-scarred mountainside for couch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She stirred and opened her eyes.

Hurley watched her foresail mount</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she caught and heeled to the trade and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached for Oavalu and Levuka.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten minutes later Billi came aboard with</seg><seg type="columnLine">what news he could gather and Hurley took</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in the launch and started in a bee-^ie</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the Akua's destination, his engine giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the power of disregarding wind and</seg><seg type="columnLine">current. When he made fast at the boat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing the schooner was inhauling sheets</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her final inshore tack. The Lehua was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not in sight. Sunset was an hour away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Billi," said Hurley, "you go along</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of Levuka Louis' place. Kapitani</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wells he come along bimeby, talk along</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Louis on back lanai, I think. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he come ashore I make plenty talk with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, maybe till dark I keep him. You hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">along bush in garden, listen what Louis</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak along of him. Then you come back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Foo-Ching's place--tell me everything.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savvy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I savvy plenty that haole (white) dog</seg><seg type="columnLine">along Levuka Louis. Suppose he savvy</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in bush I think he make kai-kai (eat)."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You rub your self plenty frangipani</seg><seg type="columnLine">flower that dog no can tell. Now you walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">along."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billi went with the air of a martyr, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went. At sunset the Lehua crept out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the reef behind Kokua Head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneaked offshore in the dusk. Hurley,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">drinking gin rickies at Foo-Ching's, awaited</seg><seg type="columnLine">the result of Billi's mission, wishing that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself could have wormed into the garden</seg><seg type="columnLine">as quietly as the kanaka, and Billi, his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">smeared with the crushed petals of pungent</seg><seg type="columnLine">frangipani, crouched in the crotons under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the veranda where Louis talked with Wells.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fanchon was there too, drowsily uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious of any intruder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"SO," SAID Louis, "you wish to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enlist now that America is one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Allies. It is good. I under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand that well. But listen, mon ami. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be long before you can get back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the States, by that time the war may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. Suppose it is not, what then? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">enlist--in what? You--a first-class sailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">master, will you try to make of yourself a</seg><seg type="columnLine">private or become a Jackie aboard a cruiser?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I, too would serve France, old as I am.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But brain is better than muscle, mon brave,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it is in my mind that we can help the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause here in the Fijis. I have a plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">which should bring much money at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">expense of those pigs of Germans. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">money always wins. This money, mon</seg><seg type="columnLine">ami, we will send to aid our braves at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front.

It is in my mind that they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">need good master-mariners. Perhaps we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will build with this money a little, quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, with you in command, to go hunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">these sharks of U-boats, nom de guerre, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be better than drill for six months</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn in which end of the gun fits the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bayonet, non?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wells, curved of nose, lantern of jaw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded. Billi yawned in the crotons. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of talk was all words and idle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me about it," said Wells. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds good to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In Melanesia," said Louis, "Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Britain owns twenty-one thousand square</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles of islands, France seven and a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Germany seventy-eight thousand--</seg><seg type="columnLine">or she did.

The German plantations go back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the bush for lack of men and the pearl</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagoons lie untouched."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "All," said Wells softly. "Pearls."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pearls of Great Price</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">6 7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the crotons Billi's ears pricked up like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dog's--like Fanchon's who was beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to sniff uneasily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Northeast of New Mecklenburg in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">German Solomons, there is an atoll that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripe for gathering. It has not been touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">for six years and the shell is very rich. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will give you the position later, on paper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Figures talked to the air find wings, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fanchon is uneasy. What is it, Fanchon?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billi was no fool. In the few words last</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken he had gathered the reason of Wells'</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip, to get the pearls from the German</seg><seg type="columnLine">atoll. He sensed too that, in the hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening, his own personal odor was master-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that of the fragrant blossoms suffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciently for the dog to detect it. It was time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be moving.' He started to crawl away</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his belly, silently as a snake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, as he sinuously stretched, from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposed armpit glands the telltale kanaka</seg><seg type="columnLine">scent permeated the breeze, to the indig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nant offense of Fanchon's quivering nostrils.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without waste of growl the dog's lithe body</seg><seg type="columnLine">rippled over the railing of the lanai and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed into the crotons from which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of Billi shot, spurred by fear of fangs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wells arose, half drawing his automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its holster, but Louis laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let Fanchon obtain some exercise, mon</seg><seg type="columnLine">ami" he said. 11 Norn d'un nom, see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kanaka run."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Across the lawn, leaping the shrubbery</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread-eagled, Billi fled like a shadow in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dusk, the gray streak of Fanchon at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his heels. They vanished in the palms</seg><seg type="columnLine">that bordered the wild bush. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shriek, a yelp of triumph from Fanchon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and presently the bull terrier came trotting</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and laid a fragment of cloth at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">master's feet. Billi had hurled himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a mass of jungle too dense for Fanchon</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tackle. But she had drawn blood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtained a trophy and was content to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billi struggling in the tangle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Louis picked up the bit of cloth. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strip of yellow muslin, nearly new, bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow with purple and red circles inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">twined for pattern. He passed it to Wells.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That came out of Hurley's trade-room,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the latter. "He has passed out two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred fathoms of the stuff. No one else</seg><seg type="columnLine">has it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It does not surprise me," said Louis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"He came ashore in his launch half an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of the Akua."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And kept me chinning on the beach</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">about the war till it was nearly dark,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Wells. "I left him at Ching-Foo's on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One of his boys will steer standing for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while," said Louis. "Let us go inside. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is warmer but more private."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is the news I got from Suva," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louis presently. "The Solomons are in</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge of the dual Governments of France</seg><seg type="columnLine">and England. The British resident will</seg><seg type="columnLine">assume charge from Bougainville. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">French gunboat Leopard will proceed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">New Caledonia and inform the natives.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is doubtful if she will touch at our atoll.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She must not hear your little plan. Also</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hurley must not dip his fingers in this bowl</seg><seg type="columnLine">of poi. He will try--which makes the game</seg><seg type="columnLine">more interesting than solitaire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Louis chuckled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will provision tonight and go out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the ebb an hour before dawn. Do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait to rot the pearls. The smell might</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove traitor down the wind. Better to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose a few. You will find the best shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the north end of the lagoon. Come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see me as soon as the tide turns. I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">be awake. I fancy Hurley may pay me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little visit and perhaps he will show some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his cards. He is a little fond of telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he holds. Here is the position. Eh</seg><seg type="columnLine">bien, mon ami, au revoir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Wells left him, the dapper little</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchman, half pirate, half patriot, bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">to scratch Fanchon behind the ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So, you did not eat him, dog of my heart?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kanaka kai-kai is not to your liking. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">you nipped him, eh? Nipped him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breech. For that you get a better piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">meat, Fanchon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">r^l AT NINE o'clock a sulky and sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">I dued Billi arrived at Ching-Foo's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Â» ITwiI with a furrowed flank and received</seg><seg type="columnLine">first aid in the smart of carbolic acid, fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed by peroxide, with an emollient in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape of a bottle of square-face. Hurley</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more than complaccnt at the news of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pearl atoll and took to the beach with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shirt-pocket full of cigars to work out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem as he walked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He and Bodin reasoned much alike.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Both tried to look at situations first through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eyes of the other, then their own, playing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the game several moves ahead and figuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">all contingencies they could conceive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Louis' launch was in commission,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hurley was undone. His schooner could</seg><seg type="columnLine">68</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not follow. But he could trail the Akua.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The joker in the pack was the position of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island. He had a plan for getting that</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it meant taking Ching-Foo into part</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidence and partnership. At the worst</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could warn the French cruiser through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the British Government at Suva. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">would net him nothing save the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfiture of Louis and he was playing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">stakes--not just for the game. One thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, he resolved. If he could not get</seg><seg type="columnLine">in on the pearls, Louis should not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The news that Bodin had pirated from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aerograms had by this time reached Ching-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Foo. Hurley gave tribute to Louis for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspiration of the idea. He himself could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not especially share Louis' patriotic fervor</seg><seg type="columnLine">in spoiling the Egyptians by using German</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearls to fight them with the proceeds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sale. To Hurley, in South Sea ethics of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine and thine, the pearls were legitimate</seg><seg type="columnLine">trove for the first finder. His financial</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon was largely bounded by the rim of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dollar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the butt of his second cigar hissed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surf-line he resolved upon his first move.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would go and see Bodin. Louis had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been right when he told Wells that Hurley</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked to assist his bluffs by hinting at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards he held. Louis knew that Billi, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of Hurley's boys, had been listening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hurley valued rightly the episode of Fanchon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the missing square from Billi's loin-cloth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Louis would know that Hurley knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main factor of his scheme. Louis would</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that, in the Lehua, with the moon in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her third quarter and rising early, Hurley</seg><seg type="columnLine">could follow the Akua wherever she went,</seg><seg type="columnLine">night or day. With these aces already</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand he might persuade Louis to</seg><seg type="columnLine">split the pot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A random thought of trying to take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearls by force from Wells after the latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">had harvested them and was on the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, Hurley dismissed. He had run up</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Wells before and the New En-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glander was not to be bluffed. If it came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a fight for the possession of what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government would consider illegal treasure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wells would give as good as he received.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hurley lit a third cigar and wandered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Snuggery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Louis received him affably.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here's to better times," pledged Hurley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of a truth," replied Louis. "Present</seg><seg type="columnLine">times are dull, eh, mon brave?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wells spent no time shuffling the deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In his walk to the Snuggery he had learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Akua was provisioning. His own</seg><seg type="columnLine">schooner was fairly well stocked, lacking</seg><seg type="columnLine">only water, and that he had ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplied. If he had to chase Wells the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter would soon see the hopelessness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to get away and Louis might tire of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the delay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked into the Frenchman's smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and read that Louis had also gone over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation. Between men of their caliber</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparring was a waste of time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Few good things going now, Louis,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Hurley. "When one breaks we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">all be willing to share it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why, mon ami?" returned Louis evenly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Square thing to do. Besides, what is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the use of blocking one another? Partners</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't trump aces unless they are fools."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Of a truth. Even Fanchon knows that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eh, my cabbage? The dog sleeps. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been running and is tired. Have you a</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposition to make to me, mon ami?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Incidentally his hand strayed to where a</seg><seg type="columnLine">piece of cloth lay on the table beneath a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigar box. Hurley grinned at the gesture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure have I, Louis. You're on to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good thing right now. Let me in on it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Or you will block my hand?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd rather be partners, Louis."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But this enterprise is not my own.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The proceeds are not to go to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hurley laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I suppose not. Going to give them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">charity? The Widows and Orphans Fund?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bodin regarded him silently for a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two. His eyes brightened and dimmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The widows and orphans? Mon Dieu,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hurlee, that is not a bad idea. I thank</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. I had not thought of that. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">excellent idea, truly. But in any event</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can not share this with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hurley flicked the ash from his cigar</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his eyes got steely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will share it, Louis, or I'll copper</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. I'm on to the scheme. Piracy, that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it practically amounts to. Not that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I give a whoop about that-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Providing you share the loot, mon ami."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly.

The chances of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these men coming from the distant village</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which he and the three Frenchmen had</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped was slight.

If good white men come</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will welcome them, but we must make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white men understand now that we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to be plundered."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick saw many nods of approval as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, evidently a chief, finished speaking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he knew that quick action was neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary if he were to thwart a procedure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant certain death for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am pleased to hear so fair a speech</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the men of the Islinois," he said as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped closer. "I am glad, too, that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have spoken so plainly about the four white</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who plundered a village of your people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is only just that such men should pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">the penalty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "White men are not all such as those who</seg><seg type="columnLine">have visited you. There are people of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own race who do not always do right and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same is true of white men, for they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">all children of the one Father. White men</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a justice of their own that is bigger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the justice of your people. If a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">does wrong we do not wait for the people of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his victims to take revenge. He is punished</seg><seg type="columnLine">if his crime is known.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know the four white men who violated</seg><seg type="columnLine">your people last Summer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was an unconscious forward move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment on the part of the savages at this an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nouncement and their attention was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One of them himself drank of the strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">water enough to loosen his tongue," Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued, "and he told of what they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done. Did the white men who heard him</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell him he was brave? Did they give him</seg><seg type="columnLine">presents because of his deed? I will tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">how they answered him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick drew his hatchet from his belt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">held it aloft dramatically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That hand, that arm, that hatchet," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed, "broke the head of the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who plundered your people! He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leader. The others were only his tools,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as arrows in his hands. They ran into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">83</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">forest and escaped. But he who led them</seg><seg type="columnLine">against your people, who alone was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponsible for their crime, was dead within</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven days after he fled from your coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The savages, easily swayed by eloquence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lovers of the dramatic, were profoundly im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed. They began to talk excitedly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">several made friendly advances. Only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who had first spoken remained silent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stood in front of Dick looking steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">and searchingly into the white man's eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His arms were folded across his bare chest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as the chatter behind him increased his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brows contracted in a frown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I am glad to hear the words of the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man," he said as he waved his hand for</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence. "If they are true words none</seg><seg type="columnLine">could sound better. If they are not true</seg><seg type="columnLine">our people are unavenged. I feel that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are true but I can not go back to my people</seg><seg type="columnLine">and make them believe what I believe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They must hear the white man themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">or they will never know. If the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's words are true he will receive many</seg><seg type="columnLine">presents from my people. We will show</seg><seg type="columnLine">him how many and how great we are and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">will come to trade with us and get furs. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">will take him with us to our country and</seg><seg type="columnLine">give him presents and let him tell the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the plundered village how he has avenged</seg><seg type="columnLine">their wrongs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An exclamation of approval broke from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the savages and they began to press forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," protested Dick, "I must hurry</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to my own country if I am to return</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the snow comes with more goods. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a journey of many moons."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If the white man has spoken the truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">he will have no fear to come among us, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will pay him richly for his goods," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">' the chief with a gesture of finality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DICK argued, protested, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more he talked the deeper became</seg><seg type="columnLine">the frown on the chief's face, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more open his suspicion. The Virginian</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw his mistake. Then, too, he realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was a chance to escape before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the country of the Islinois, especial-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly if he agreed to go willingly. These sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages knew nothing of the use of canoes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his birchbark craft he could outwit or</seg><seg type="columnLine">outdistance them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I will go with the people of the Islinois,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he announced. "I have nothing to fear. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would prefer to go among you with goods.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it shall be as you wish."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The savages proved very friendly but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief never abandoned his suspicions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick was virtually a prisoner. After the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian custom, he pretended to ignore this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">acted as if he did not see the precautions</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken to prevent his escape, and talked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">joked with the various members of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">party.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The savages were not on the war-path, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had known when he first saw them, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reason for their presence so far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their home was a mystery until, nearly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">league farther up the river, the men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined by their families, the women bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy burdens, mostly of wild cattle skins</seg><seg type="columnLine">and robes, leggings and various articles</seg><seg type="columnLine">made from the hair of the animal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick was not permitted to go alone in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe. Three men were placed in it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, among them the chief, and when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached a point opposite the broad plain on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the east bank the craft was used to trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port the entire party across the stream.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This required two days, for the savages were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not accustomed to the use of the canoe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the current often carried them far down be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore they could make a landing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once the band was across cabines were</seg><seg type="columnLine">erected and then began for Dick the strang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est scene he had ever witnessed. From up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river came a large brigade of canoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with people of the Ayoe nation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had hardly made themselves at home</seg><seg type="columnLine">before a still larger number of Nadouais-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sioux paddled down from the north, whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">families crowded into smaller canoes than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick had ever seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mascoutens came down the Ouisconsin</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the country near Lac Mecheygan, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the weeks slipped by, Saulteurs from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lac Superior country. Kickapous jour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neyed up the Misisepe from the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaches of the Rocky River and strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribes of which Dick had never heard drifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in from the west. A month after the ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rival of the Islinois he estimated that nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">five thousand savages were encamped on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain between the river and the bluffs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the number grew Dick began to dread</seg><seg type="columnLine">each new arrival. Of all the people there he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was by far the most conspicuous, the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked of. Only a few of the savages had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever seen a white man and their interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unending. Whenever a shout went up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to signal the approach of a new band either</seg><seg type="columnLine">84</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">by land or water, the Virginian made him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Should Ouinibegous venture so far to</seg><seg type="columnLine">join the conglomerate gathering his situ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation would be serious. Should more</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islinois come from the village the French-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men had attempted to plunder his fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be sealed instantly. Should more</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mascoutens paddle from the upper reaches</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Rock River he might be recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Islinois' suspicions confirmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But by mid-May the last of the visitors</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to have arrived. For a week no</seg><seg type="columnLine">new bands came, and then Dick learned for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time the reason' for this strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering. The Nadouaissioux brought out</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild rice and fine, dark furs and traded</seg><seg type="columnLine">them for buffalo fat. The Ayoes depended</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely upon a large supply of soft, red</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone in their bartering, and so great was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the desire for this pipe material they reaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large reward in copper from the Saulteurs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and articles of European manufacture from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Mascoutens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each tribe came loaded with the products</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its own particular country. Copper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">paintstones, mica, soapstone, jade, flint,</seg><seg type="columnLine">obsidian and shells were bartered in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange mart. Clam shells from Dick's own</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantic Ocean, quaintly fringed in bead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, passed from hand to hand here on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the banks of the great Misisepe and rivaled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in popularity the obsidian which, the sa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vages told him, came from some great</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains as far to the westward as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">salt water lay to the east.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For each article in this strange collection</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a demand. Ayoes took salt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">water shells with which to make beads in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their homes far to the west. The Nadouais-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sioux were glad to get obsidian for the manu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">facture of spear and arrow heads and knives.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Islinois eagerly exchanged woven hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">goods for copper. There was not a nation</seg><seg type="columnLine">that did not have a want, nor a nation that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not fill it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ground upon which these distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">peoples gathered was sacred to commerce.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even though nations might be at war there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no hostilities so long as they remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the prairie between the hills and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great river at the mouth of the Ouisconsin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Distant tribes mingled freely, without fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">and without suspicion. Ayoes with the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipestone which could be obtained only in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their country strolled into the cabines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mascoutens and exchanged it for steel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">knives. Children of the Nadouaissioux</seg><seg type="columnLine">romped with those of the Islinois. Kicka-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pou boys shot blackbirds along the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks in company with Saulteur youngsters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mascoutens had several muskets and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Nadouaissioux boasted three or four</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons captured a year or two before</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Hurons, but they lacked powder</seg><seg type="columnLine">for them. The Ayoes had never seen fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms before, nor the Islinois, and Dick made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most of his musket. The Islinois, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw the respect of the other nations for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their guest, became very proud of him. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways he was asked to accompany them on</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hunts for deer or the wild cattle, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pride with which they afterward exhib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ited his game would have been laughable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Dick had it not been so valuable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Feasts were given continually and in this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of Dick's musket and his skill in</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunting, the Islinois easily outdid all other</seg><seg type="columnLine">nations. Their vanity, naturally great,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed about to burst and the members of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tribe secretly discussed the power their</seg><seg type="columnLine">great nation could wield were they only</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipped with firearms. They questioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick as to the possibility of getting them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and began to boast among themselves of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their future prowess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their attitude troubled the Virginian for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had found them a kindly, generous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">amiable people and he saw in this new arro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gance and vanity the beginning of one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible tribal wars. But he could not al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low any interest in them to affect his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances for freedom and he established him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self more firmly in their regard by readily</seg><seg type="columnLine">promising the white man's weapons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything that Dick did or said had be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind it the one idea of escape. Daily he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fruits of his efforts in the added confi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence with which the Islinois regarded him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only the chief never abated his watchful-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. It was almost as though he had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself responsible to the people of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plundered village for Dick's appearance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Always he saw to it that warriors were with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and at night a man sat at the door of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabine in which Dick slept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One thing, however, gave the Virginian</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope. The gathering of the strange tribes</seg><seg type="columnLine">would break up in a few days. Then, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the confusion of departure, he would grasp</seg><seg type="columnLine">any opportunity. The day the Ayoes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparing to leave he began to make de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">finite plans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">u But the Islinois, desirous of making one</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">85</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">last impression on the assembled nations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had arranged a mammoth feast. A band</seg><seg type="columnLine">of young men were sent to hunt deer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick could not afford to arouse their sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picions by refusing to accompany them. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual he remained beside a gully while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages drove the game toward him. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">this way he had killed four deer by noon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the party moved over to another ravine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beside the runway here they found six</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadouaissioux who were just about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive the place for themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Islinois young men, insolent with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride which had come to the whole band</seg><seg type="columnLine">and confident in Dick's musket and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own superior numbers, ordered the Na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">douaissioux out. The savages from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north refused and instantly the battle be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan. Dick attempted to prevent the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack, to make the Islinois see the unreason-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ableness of their demands. But his efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were unavailing and in less than three</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes the six Nadouaissioux lay dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the exaltation of this achievement the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islinois returned with their game and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">story of how they had punished the insolent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadouaissioux. They were reprimanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the chief and cautioned to keep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair secret. The feast was given that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night and plans for the entire party to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next day were hurriedly made. Several</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadouaissioux had been invited and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islinois watched them closely for signs that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loss of the hunters had become known.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the feast passed off without trouble and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Islinois, eager to be off, prepared to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">at dawn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rIN THE confusion resulting from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hurried flight Dick believed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last his chance had come. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief, however, detailed two men to guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">him constantly. No loophole was offered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the morning the entire band, heavily</seg><seg type="columnLine">loaded with the results of their bartering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to cross the river. Arrangements had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been made with the Mascoutens to aid</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their canoes and in a short time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire party was on the west bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Islinois had kept a close watch on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadouaissioux but no signs of hostility or</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicion were detected. The Northern</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages had even appeared to take little</seg><seg type="columnLine">heed of the departure of the small band</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once across the river the Islinois pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded down its western bank. The men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">aided with the burdens to make all possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">haste. At night a strong guard was thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">out around their camp and early the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning the march was resumed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After three days all fear of pursuit was</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned and they traveled more leisurely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In this reaction Dick hoped an opportunity</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his escape might come, but the chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed rather to redouble his vigilance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the manner of the savages he sought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give the impression that the Virginian was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an honored guest, one in their care, and to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded constantly. Politely but brazenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he even insisted upon Dick relinquishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his musket at night, saying that the weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too precious to become the loot of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thieving Western Indian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of the fourth day camp was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made in a ravine between two steep bluffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the western shore. No one feared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadouaissioux so far to the south and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards were thrown out. A couple of sentries</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the camp itself were deemed sufficient.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was then that the Nadouaissioux</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck. In the first light of dawn, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep was soundest, as early as it was pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible to distinguish friend from foe, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northern warriors, who all the time had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been ahead of the Islinois, passing them the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first night in their canoes, stole close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp and completely surrounded it, taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">every precaution to let no one escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So superior were they in numbers and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden and wholly unexpected was their</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack, the Islinois were powerless. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who did reach their feet and pick up their</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons were struck down at once. Fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the forty men were killed and the others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing themselves at the mercy of the foe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrendered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Nadouaissioux evidently had planned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to capture Dick alive. His first knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the raid was gained from a strong clasp on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ankles. He wakened to find a savage at</seg><seg type="columnLine">each wrist and he lay there without strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling, watching the Northern Indians</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread through the encampment, killing all</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who offered resistance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Five minutes after the attack began the</seg><seg type="columnLine">victors were in complete control and Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuddered at what was to follow. Twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five men were prisoners and all the women</seg><seg type="columnLine">and children of thg party. There could</seg><seg type="columnLine">only be torture for the first, slavery for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. Dick's knowledge of savage war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fare was extensive and he could conceive of</seg><seg type="columnLine">no alternative.</seg><seg type="columnLine">86</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leader of the Nadouaissioux ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Dick be brought to him. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the white man could speak both lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guages and he was asked to interpret. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick's complete amazement the chief began</seg><seg type="columnLine">as follows:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We learned before the feast given by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islinois what their young men had done.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When our hunters did not return we went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look for them and found their bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the footprints of the Islinois. And all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time we were eating of the meat of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islinois we were thinking of their treachery</seg><seg type="columnLine">and planning our revenge. For our duty</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clear and, though we did not wish it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and have had to travel far out of our way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have come to avenge our dead. We did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not intend even now to kill any of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islinois. We have done so only when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">took weapons against us. We want only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ten young men who murdered our</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunters."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick translated this speech to the pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oners. They, too, were mystified by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">leniency but instantly they grasped at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity to escape. The men began at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once to point out those who had taken part</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the attack on the Nadouaissioux and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they did so the Northern warriors took them</seg><seg type="columnLine">aside. Four were among the dead but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remaining six were closely guarded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," the Nadouaissioux chief said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick, "tell the people of the Islinois that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they may go back to their country but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are to tell their people that we are a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty nation, that we desire to live at</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace with our neighbors, but that treachery</seg><seg type="columnLine">is never permitted to go unavenged."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick translated the speech and the Islin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ois, as if in a trance, prepared for their de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parture. The Virginian was equally dazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by this unheard of toleration on the part of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">band of savages and as he began to see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was real, sincere, not intended as a cloak</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hide another attack, he imagined that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own opportunity had come. His canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at the river bank. The Islinois were</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to travel by land. By night he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be fifteen or twenty leagues in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead and speeding toward Virginia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In his eagerness to be off he turned to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">his musket. The chief of the Nadouais-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sioux stepped in front of him, his hand up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The white man will come with our</seg><seg type="columnLine">people," ne said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I had nothing to do with the killing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of your young men," protested the Virginian.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am not like the Islinois, who killed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the love of the killing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We know," answered the chief sternly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that you were present at the slaughter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our hunters."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you see the bodies?" asked Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">scornfully. "Did you find holes in them</seg><seg type="columnLine">made by the white man's arrows?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We saw the bodies," answered the chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemnly, "and we did not find holes made</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the arrows of the white man. But we</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not think the white man is a fool and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatchet hangs from his belt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dick drew the little ax from its loop and</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed it to the chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can you find blood upon it?" he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded. "Did you see a mark on your</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead that was not made by the war-clubs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Islinois?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We only know that the white man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">there," was the answer as the chief turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">away to order his warriors to prepare for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey to the prairie at the mouth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ouisconsin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick was frantic in his despair. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">once during his captivity among the Islinois</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he relinquished the thought of escape.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Always he had planned on the moment when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vigilance of the chief would be relaxed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when his attention would be taken by other</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters. Now when the moment had</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrived there had come this new blow to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans. It was unthinkable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As he stood there, dazed by this new turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">of affairs it was not fear that he felt but hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">resentment that the decision of one petty</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief of a band of savages should thus de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feat the success of his great mision, should</seg><seg type="columnLine">render impossible the gift that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">make to his own people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Nadouaissioux, he knew, lived far</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the north, west of Lac Superior, far be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the limits of the country known to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coureurs de bois. If he were to make his</seg><seg type="columnLine">long journey to Virginia before Winter he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must start at once. To go with this band</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their home in the north meant, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">should he escape later, that it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible to reach Virginia before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winter snows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The knowledge threw Dick into a fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage and he ran after the chief to protest</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. He argued, pleaded, threatened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrath of the king of France, an avenging</seg><seg type="columnLine">army of white men. But the Nadouais-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sioux only smiled. In the end Dick was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">87</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">forced into a canoe and the entire party</seg><seg type="columnLine">started up-stream. Again Virginia faded</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIII .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE EXECUTION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN the Nadouaissioux war-party</seg><seg type="columnLine">started northward on the Misisepe</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Islinois prisoners were forced to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">their share of the paddling. The Southern</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages were so unskilful their captors</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed and jeered at their clumsy efforts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick, adept as he was in a canoe, escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">this but he marveled at the ability of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Northerners in handling their little craft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only three or four men could find room in</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, but they fairly lifted them from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water as they shot up-stream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mouth of the Ouisconsin was reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the afternoon of the second day and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great prairie was found to be deserted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">all except the families of the Nadouaissioux.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thousands of savages who had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the annual bartering had dispersed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their homes and the Nadouaissioux them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves were ready for departure the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The desperate position in which Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself drove him to renew his</seg><seg type="columnLine">protests against being carried away with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, although before he began he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the futility of his words. This time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not plead or threaten. Rather he</seg><seg type="columnLine">argued with all the eloquence at his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pointed out that the French, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom they believed him one, would surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear of this action and that no traders</seg><seg type="columnLine">would dare to venture among them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry to them the white man's weapons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for which they were so desirous. He felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he scored here but, although he</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched their faces closely, he was unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn anything as to the weight of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">argument. They met this as they had all</seg><seg type="columnLine">else that he had said in silence, a silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was maddening because it told nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His failure even to elicit a reply convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Virginian that success must lie in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability to slip away, to steal a canoe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddle down the Misisepe. The attit-de</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Nadouaissioux encouraged him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, for while daylight lasted at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bartering-place there were no guards ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed. To all outward appearances the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners could go and come as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased, though none was unwise enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wander far from the center of the camp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every woman and child was in reality a</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchful sentry and a hundred warriors</seg><seg type="columnLine">would respond instantly to the first alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the coming of darkness all oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity of escape vanished, however. Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the six other prisoners were placed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabine and a dozen armed warriors took up</seg><seg type="columnLine">their station outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Islinois apparently went to sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly, but Dick lay awake for a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Now that he realized that escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hopeless for the present he reviewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation more carefully. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction in which the Misisepe flowed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the information he had received from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the savages and Antoine Goddin, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed that the Ohio of the Iroquois</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined the "great water" not far from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place where he had left it on his journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Virginia. This convinced him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best way back to the colony was to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the Misisepe until he came to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ohio, then eastward on the route by which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If his deductions were correct only three</seg><seg type="columnLine">or four months would be ample for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey, provided always that he met no</seg><seg type="columnLine">hostile nations and was not made prisoner</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. It was now the first of June. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would dare start as late as the first of</seg><seg type="columnLine">August. That would give him two months</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which to make good his escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The knowledge brought relief from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first incoherent feeling of the need of</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate haste. Now he could plan care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully, calmly, and, he told himself, success-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. When the two months were up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or before, he resolved that he would be on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way to Virginia to do the thing he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">promised himself that he would do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With these two months in view he laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">his plans. He would appear to submit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his captivity among the Nadouaissioux.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This alone would not deceive them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he must find some method of convincing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the savages that he had no desire to leave.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even if he journeyed far north with them</seg><seg type="columnLine">they undoubtedly would remain on or</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the Misisepe and, down-stream, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could quickly regain the lost ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick was not foolish enough to announce</seg><seg type="columnLine">his submission at once. Only by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner did he appear content to start</seg><seg type="columnLine">northward the next morning. He took his</seg><seg type="columnLine">88</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">place in his own canoe, paddled as hard as</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of the women, and even sang a song</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two as he toiled. The Nadouaissioux</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not ill-treat their prisoners but that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deaths of the young men were not being</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten was evident in the almost con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuous weeping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In fact, when camp was made, weeping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick believed, was the principal occupation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men, women and children. Culinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">duties were neglected the first night while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole band shed tears. Never before</seg><seg type="columnLine">had Dick seen more or greater expressions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sorrow, and his own heart was moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he heard one warrior, whose eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly raining tears, relate a humorous story</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the bartering-place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even the Islinois, who could speak only</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Dick because of the complete dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">similarity of the languages, were struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">by this ability to shed tears at will. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than anything else the Southern</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages spoke of the toleration of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">captors and, after the second day of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">northward journey they all began to share</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hope that they might be held as slaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">and adopted into the nation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The evening of the third day the canoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached a second prairie on the east bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the river, one fully as large as that just</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the mouth of the Ouisconsin. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">great bluffs continued on either side, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">here for the first time a valley stretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">away to the eastward between the hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a small river flowed in to join the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Misisepe. Here the party camped for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning Dick found that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadouaissioux were not preparing to depart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The weeping habit had been revived and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he left the cabine in which he had slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire band was shedding tears. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindly attitude of the savages had van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished, too, and as Dick started to walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">away one of the guards thrust him back</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the door. A few minutes later all</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven prisoners were marched forth and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded by the guards and followed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire band, led to a grove of trees near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river bank. There the chief made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech which he asked Dick to translate</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the Islinois.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Six of our hunters were slain by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people of the Islinois and the white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was with them," he began. "Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">young men were hunting the deer, with no</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of war or murder. Our people</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">went to the baxtering-place with no evil</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts for any other people. VVe kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truce which has existed on the prairie</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Rivers Ouisconsin and Misisepe ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">since our oldest men can remember. Never</seg><seg type="columnLine">have we mblested our deadliest foes while</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The young men of the Islinois forgot</seg><seg type="columnLine">their duty, their reverence for the spirits</seg><seg type="columnLine">that guard the place. Without cause they</seg><seg type="columnLine">slew our young men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There have come to us stories of how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people living far to the east near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinking water take prisoners and tie them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stakes, how they burn and slash them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut off their noses and ears, hold hot stones</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their breasts, gouge out their eyes, thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">splinters of pine into their flesh and set</seg><seg type="columnLine">them afire. We have heard that they tie</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to stakes in the ground and roast off</seg><seg type="columnLine">their feet and legs, that they tear out their</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger-nails, that they butcher them as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they never would butcher the wild cattle</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the deer or the moose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All these ways are strange to our people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We find no pleasure in them. We live</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaceably among ourselves and our neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bors. But we are not a timid race."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waited for Dick to tell the Islinois</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he had said and then continued:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In a war we are not afraid to fight, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">our enemies have learned, but once we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have won we are generous. We like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show that, though we are victors, we bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">no ill-will toward the vanquished. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the custom of our people when we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">at war with another nation and take pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oners to send them back to their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE PAUSED and nodded toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick, who repeated his words to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other prisoners. The Vir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginian spoke as fully as the chief, even added</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few words because of his own dawning</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope that after all they were to be released.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The temperate words and even tone of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief were inexplicable in the light of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick knew of savage revenge and savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">torture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Antoine Goddin had told him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sioux were unlike any other savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation. Their leniency toward the band</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Islinois, their treatment of prisoners</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now the magnanimous tone of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief, all confirmed this report, and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of it all Dick could only conclude that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">89</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they neither wished nor intended to detain</seg><seg type="columnLine">him longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he had translated, the chief con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are now three days' journey from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prairie where all the nations barter</seg><seg type="columnLine">each year. We are approaching our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">country, even now are on its borders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We have with us the six Islinois and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man who killed our young men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They killed them, not in war but with evil</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds and for an evil purpose. Under</seg><seg type="columnLine">such conditions it is our duty as well as our</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire that they die. We do not wish that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they die as do the prisoners of the nations</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the east. We are brave enough without â€¢</seg><seg type="columnLine">eating their hearts and drinking their blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">to add to our own courage. But they must</seg><seg type="columnLine">die as is the custom of our people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dick, his face pale, his eyes staring, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">too stunned by this announcement to turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the chief. The instant before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had seen liberty, a quick departure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now he stood face to face with death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is the white man afraid to die for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deaths he caused?" asked the chief scorn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully. "Is his heart as white as his skin?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick's fear was not so much for himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he was young and death could never</seg><seg type="columnLine">come easily. But his soul rebelled at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">blasting of his hopes, at a fate which hinged</seg><seg type="columnLine">so great an enterprise upon so inconse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quential a thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Partly in English, partly in Nadouais-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sioux, he protested his innocence, stormed</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the injustice of their action, threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened with the direst consequences his</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination could arouse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even as he raved and swore in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of the chief and the leading men of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">band who were gathered before him he read</seg><seg type="columnLine">the uselessness of his words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The white man talks in vain," inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted the chief sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Dick, inarticulate, with working lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dazed brain, stood staring at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages the death scene of Antoine Goddin</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to him as if it were a vision, as if a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit had suddenly appeared to rebuke him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He saw the bank of the Ouisconsin where</seg><seg type="columnLine">his friend had died, saw him lying there</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the foot of the great oak, his face calm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes brave to the end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Frenchman's words returned with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">their simple courage.

He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighed his chances, taken his risks, that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the great object might be obtained. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had died like a man dies when he knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the balance has swung the other way</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the lips that had finally closed were</seg><seg type="columnLine">curseless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick recoiled before a comparison of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frenchman's words and actions and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own. If he, too, must relinquish his work</seg><seg type="columnLine">to those who would follow, at least he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it with the same quiet courage. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned suddenly to the waiting Islinois.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Head up, eyes bright and steady, his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear and unfaltering, he repeated the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">words of the chief's message and then faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Nadouaissioux to await the end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately one of the Islinois was led</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from the others and tied to a tree.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before him all the boys of the village lined</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, their bows drawn, arrows in place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No sooner had the guards stepped back</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the flint-tipped shafts were drawn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a twanging of tjow strings. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">next moment a hail of arrows struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a human porcupine he stood there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows impaled in every part of his chest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">abdomen and arms. But he still lived, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boys' arms had not been strong enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Almost instantly, however, other arrows</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been fitted to the bows and a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight clattered among the shafts already</seg><seg type="columnLine">imbedded. The body of the prisoner sagged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its bonds and his head fell forward. Sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral warriors ran up and cut the dead man</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose. The body was thrown into the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A second Islinois was bound to the tree and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he, too, lived until the second flight of arrows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The third walked up proudly and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rewarded by a bit of flint entering his eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">and piercing his brain, bringing instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. The boy who had fired the arrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran forward and drew it out with a shrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">cry, and there were grunts of approval from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warriors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boys of the band were now hysterical</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their excitement and danced impatiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the fourth victim was led out. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">selected their arrows with care and crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other to get the most advantageous</seg><seg type="columnLine">positions. As a result of their excitement</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Islinois did not die until the fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">volley and more than a hundred and fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">shafts were imbedded in his flesh. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonds were cut and he fell forward, driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">a score of arrows entirely through his body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick, the spell of Goddin's death scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">still upon him, stood calmly in his place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">90</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He watched each successive victim as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was led forward, saw the swift flight of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows, heard the body splash into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters of the great river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The fifth Islinois died with the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight of arrows from the boys and only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained before Dick's turn would come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for they were evidently holding him for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last. The sixth was led forward and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngster, edging ahead of the others and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not waiting until the guards had retreated</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the tree, let fly an arrow which cleanly</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the victim's mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A roar of laughter swept over the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and women and the other boys, incensed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one of their number had taken an</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage, fell to arguing among them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves. Laughter convulsed the savages as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they stared at the victim, a shaft protruding</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his mouth, a thin line of blood running</seg><seg type="columnLine">down his chin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, one by one, then two and three</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a time, the boys began drawing their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bows again. There was a twang, a slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">hiss as the feathered shaft twisted in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight and, miraculously itseemed, another ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row suddenly appeared in the prisoner's flesh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quickly the number increased. Blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">drenched the savage's naked chest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran in streams down his legs. He stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, head erect, eyes unblinking, and still</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bows twanged until it seemed that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not room for another arrow above his</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist. Then simultaneously two shafts</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck his eyes and his head fell forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beginning with the laughter over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first arrow ' protruding from the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth and the excitement and quarrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the youthful executioners, the slow death</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the last of the Islinois had wrought up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire band. Men and women shrieked</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yelled and danced about, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant the prisoner was killed everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quiet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick, fascinated by the spectacle, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last to realize the sudden stillness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he looked around he found every person</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring at him. The boys, nervous, eager,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were fitting their best arrows to their bows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A NADOUAISSIOUX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a moment Dick had the impulse to</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn upon his captors, to attack his</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards barehanded, to run amuck among</seg><seg type="columnLine">them and compel a quick death. It was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not that he believed he might escape, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might compel acknowledgment of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage. It was simply the white man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to die. The savage is schooled through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the generations to die haughtily, even at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stake. The white man must go out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a blaze of fierce endeavor and action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as he turned and saw that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily grasp the war club of a man near him</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew that he would not try. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">chosen a life among the savages, had chosen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to play their game. He would follow it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the end and die according to their custom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though he were white, he could do no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">here than die as dies the savage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the silence that had descended upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd the young Virginian turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the guards and held out his hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They stepped toward him, grasped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrists and led him to the tree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The boys, their youthful minds inflamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the execution of the six Islinois,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hysterical even in the unusual excitement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were silent and nervous while the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man was bound. Here was unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">game. Here was flesh their flint and</seg><seg type="columnLine">obsidian had never penetrated. Here was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a representative of that unknown and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious race who drove their arrows</seg><seg type="columnLine">with thunder, who made keen tools of iron,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and who came from a marvelous land far</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the stinking water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The youngsters did not falter, did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrink from the task before them, but their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bows trembled and there was an unnatural</seg><seg type="columnLine">stiffness in their bearing as they stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In that nervous condition Dick saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he most dreaded would be inevitable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the boys were cool and unexcited death</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be quick. In their present state the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prolonged agony of the Islinois would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing with what he must suffer. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of numberless arrows sticking into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his flesh, none with force enough to bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end, was maddening, and impulsively</seg><seg type="columnLine">he began to speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen!" he called in a loud voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The half-drawn bows of the boys straight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened. There was a quick movement of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd toward him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Though I am a white man I can die as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as can your own people," the Vir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginian said. "But I have lived as a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I wish to die as a man. When I fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">I fought as a man, in the open, face to face</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my enemy. That is the way the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">91</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">white man wants to die, facing his enemy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a crowd of children with their child's</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are not my enemies. I have never</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmed you. But you think I have and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are going to kill me. You are a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">people and a just people, slow to anger, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know that you will grant the wish of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who is about to die."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is the white man's wish?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chief when Dick paused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Send those children to their mothers'</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirts!" he cried fiercely. "Put men in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">places. Let men's bows be drawn, not bows</seg><seg type="columnLine">that are used to kill blackbirds along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river. That is what I ask."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a demand rather than a request.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Its effect was apparent. The men began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak in whispers among themselves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The chief waved the boys back. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors seemed naturally to form a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle. Several began preparations to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeches, but an old man, stiff from years</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hunting and fighting and exposure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped forward and began to address</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You all know me," he said. "You all</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that my loss in the treachery of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islinois was double that of any one else.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You know that my two sons, the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">children I had, the only support of an old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and their mother, were killed. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that I face my old age without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfort and care of children, that I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">doomed to loneliness and sorrow until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end. I am like the broken reed in the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the moon of the rut of the moose. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">winds and the currents have their will with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I am too weak to hold against them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The white man we hold as prisoner was</seg><seg type="columnLine">present when my sons were killed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treacherous Islinois. He says he tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent the murder. From his actions</seg><seg type="columnLine">today I would believe him. But, whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is guilty or not, he was there. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Islinois, came to the bartering-</seg><seg type="columnLine">place with them, was with the hunting-</seg><seg type="columnLine">party that brought so much sorrow to us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The white man has shown himself to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">brave. He has looked upon death with</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady eyes and firm lips. He has shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he can die as we would all like to die.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He has the bow that kills with thunder</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows. He has a hatchet and knife of iron,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while we have only stone. He can paddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he can hunt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My people, I want this young man for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a son. I need him to provide-for me in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my old age, to kill moose and beaver that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I may not starve, to bring skins that I may</seg><seg type="columnLine">not freeze. I wish to take him into my</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, to call him son and have him call</seg><seg type="columnLine">me father. The white man and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islinois robbed me of all that I have. Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">them give back what they can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the old man took his seat in the circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the customary silence ensued, Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked eagerly at the faces of the warriors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew the savages often adopted pris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oners into their own families to take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">places of those slain in war. The Iroquois</seg><seg type="columnLine">had kept their ranks full by adopting entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what gave him the greatest hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the fact that a prisoner thus adopted</seg><seg type="columnLine">never endeavors to return to his own people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is the accepted belief that he has died,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his former existence has ended and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that into his body has come the spirit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slain warrior whose place he lakes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once adopted, Dick knew that the Na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">douaissioux would not question his accept-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of the savage theory but would treat</seg><seg type="columnLine">him immediately as one of the band, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">permit him to go and come as he pleased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And that would mean Virginia before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winter snows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Other warriors, leaders in the band, arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spoke briefly. Dick, straining against</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bonds, listened eagerly to every word.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not one showed a desire to thwart the</seg><seg type="columnLine">request of the old man. Only additional</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasons for the adoption of the captive</seg><seg type="columnLine">were proposed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end the chief nodded and several</seg><seg type="columnLine">young men ran to the tree to sever the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thongs that bound the Virginian to it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was escorted into the circle and formally</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented to the father whose sons had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">slain. And so, with a few simple cere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monies and much smoking of the calumet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick Jeffreys became a Nadouaissioux.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the three days that the band remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the prairie the Virginian devoted him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to establishing firmly the belief that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken the place of the sons who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">slain. The morning after the execution of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Islinois he went off early with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">musket, and alone. He crossed the prairie</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a great, rock-crowned bluff and followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">its base into the valley which opened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the east.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went on into this for more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">league and, by sheer luck, encountered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">92</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">small herd of wild cattle in a wooded valley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He crept close, killed a huge bull at the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot and loaded again in time to kill another</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the herd stampeded. Then, loading</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he ran, he climbed the side and met the</seg><seg type="columnLine">galloping animals face to face as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded the end of the ridge. A third</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down and, before the last were out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">range, a fourth was mortally wounded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The buffalo had turned toward the west</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as Dick made his way back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">encampment he encountered them again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting two more and finishing the one he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had wounded. He then hurried back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the savages and asked that the women</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sent out after the meat. At night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they returned, a hundred of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">each carrying all the meat her strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted, the camp was in an uproar.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the feast that followed Dick was ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">corded the place of honor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The band moved on up the river. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">they found a herd of buffalo swimming the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream and again Dick's musket won</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect. The grief-stricken father who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had adopted him strutted about the camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">and boasted of his son's prowess. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys who would have slain him a few days</seg><seg type="columnLine">before followed him in awe. The old men</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the band accorded his every word their</seg><seg type="columnLine">closest attention. His counsel was invited</seg><seg type="columnLine">and respected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DICK did not overlook any oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunities to cement his hold upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Nadouaissioux. He found them</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely different from any savages he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever encountered. They were mild, pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant, amiable people. The men were tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and well formed, though the women were</seg><seg type="columnLine">more ugly than is usually the case with</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages. Every member of the band, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the infants, began the day with a bath</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Virginian easily fell into their mode</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life, quickly adopted all their customs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">established the best of terms with the men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a week he was, to all outward</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearances, a savage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet not once in all that time did he forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one thing that prompted these actions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He studied the canoes, which were smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lighter than his own and better adapted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his long journey. He even chose the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one he would take when he made his dash</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the southward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He strolled about the camp after dark,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">learning the habits of the various individual</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of the band, noting the hour when</seg><seg type="columnLine">they retired, marking down those who were</seg><seg type="columnLine">prone to sit late about a fire and gossip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He made friends with the numberless</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogs of the encampment, surreptitiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed them pieces of meat and then tested</seg><seg type="columnLine">them by walking through the camp at</seg><seg type="columnLine">night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">He was up at dawn, watching to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">which members of the band were the earliest</seg><seg type="columnLine">risers. When he had learned who each</seg><seg type="columnLine">was he began to express a choice in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">location of his own cabine at night that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he had gone, his absence might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered as late as possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A week after he had been adopted Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided that the first cloudy night.would</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffice for his attempt. Every detail which</seg><seg type="columnLine">could insure success had been planned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had secreted a supply of dried meat</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wild oats on the bank to be picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his return, had chosen two good paddles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and selected a small, narrow canoe capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unusual speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The morning of the eighth day after his</seg><seg type="columnLine">adoption the band began its leisurely jour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ney northward in a fine drizzle. The low</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds drifted before a south wind. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was every indication that they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">hang low through the night at least. Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized his chance and resolved to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. In that swift current he could travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-four hours a day, sleeping in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of the canoe as he had done on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ouisconsin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He should gain at least twelve hours'</seg><seg type="columnLine">start, perhaps more, and in that twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours he could gain twenty-five leagues.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His pursuers, when they came, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel faster, but his experience with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ouinibegous had given him confidence and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew that the Nadouaissioux would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">dare venture too far south for fear of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Islinois.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Dick, paddling unconsciously, went</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and over his plans the leading canoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed out of sight around a bend. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he suddenly became aware of his surround-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings he found that, less than an hour after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the start, the fleet of birchbarks had strung</seg><seg type="columnLine">out along the shore of a large lake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">With the south wind helping, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadouaissioux made all possible speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lake was more than ten leagues long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick was told, and the high bluffs on either</seg><seg type="columnLine">side were the home of fierce winds that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">93</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">always lay in wait for the savages that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might devour the canoes. Men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">women and children showed their fear by</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddling swiftly. It seemed to be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire of every one to cross the lake as</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly as possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half a league out Dick found to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismay that the current had ceased.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lake was only an enlargement of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great stream, but it was a lake. Should</seg><seg type="columnLine">the south wind hold he could make no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a league an hour against it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The great lead he had counted upon would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be cut in half. He might not be able even</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get off the lake before he would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though he cursed himself for not having</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun his dash the night before, for not</seg><seg type="columnLine">having made inquiries as to the route</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, there was nothing to do except</seg><seg type="columnLine">go on. He was trapped and all he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope for was a fiercer wind that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive the savages to camp on the western</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore. Then, with only a small stretch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lake between him and the river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could get away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wind did increase, driving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoes before it, sending the water swishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and surging alongside in curling rollers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick's heart leaped at each successive</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast, but the savages kept on, paddling</seg><seg type="columnLine">harder, shouting hopefully to one another.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A race was on, a race between the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mounting seas and the canoes, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the finish line a point setting out from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">western shore, around which there would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be shelter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick kept on with the others, his foster-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parents paddling with amazing strength,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking anxiously over their shoulders at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the storm clouds behind them. Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayed that they would lose, begrudged</seg><seg type="columnLine">each league that slipped behind them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was incensed that the wind did not make</seg><seg type="columnLine">further progress too dangerous. He began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see that the entire success of his plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">depended upon being driven ashore before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shelter of the distant point was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the wind settled to a steady blow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little canoes rose and fell with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rollers in safety, and at noon the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet had rounded the point and stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rest in its shelter. From the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick could see the end of the lake about</seg><seg type="columnLine">three leagues to the northwest, across a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad expanse of water. The lake would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">require a whole night's strenuous paddling</seg><seg type="columnLine">under favorable conditions, he estimated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if the wind kept up he could not hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get out of sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The savages, after a rest, started on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They kept close to the west shore, out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind, but each member of the band</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a watchful eye on the clouds. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of the lake and the storms that swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">it kept them working steadily and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunset came they had reached the mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The land was low, swampy, the stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">divided into many channels, and as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great fleet left the lake it separated into</seg><seg type="columnLine">three divisions. Dick and his foster-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parents were with a score of canoes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered a swift, narrow place bordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by high rushes. Tired by their strenuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">exertions since morning, they made head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way with difficulty. The channel nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowed, the current became more swift,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dusk was settling over the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly out of the reeds on either</seg><seg type="columnLine">side darted a flotilla of small canoes, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">manned by four naked, painted, whooping</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arrows fairly rained upon the Nadouais-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sioux. Many were wounded. Paddles</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped from nerveless hands and floated</seg><seg type="columnLine">off down-stream. One canoe overturned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the heads of children bobbed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">current. Shrill yells came across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marshes, indicating that the attack was</seg><seg type="columnLine">simultaneous in all the channels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Dick saw the canoes dash out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">both sides his first thought was to flee.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whoever the attackers were, it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">his battle. But before he could turn his</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft the enemy were among the Nadouais-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sioux and war-clubs were swinging right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left. One canoe dashed straight toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick's and he laid aside his paddle for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">musket and fired into the face of the leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage just as he was about to brain his</seg><seg type="columnLine">foster-mother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two canoes swung together broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. A war-club crashed into the skull</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Dick's foster-father. The Virginian</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled his musket and knocked the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage into the water, but before he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">recover his balance the third brought down</seg><seg type="columnLine">his club.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick swerved, it caught him a glanc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing blow on the side of 'the head, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he fell unconscious upon the body of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Nadouaissioux.</seg><seg type="columnLine">94</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE PROMISE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE war-party of the Otjibwa, known</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the French as the Saulteurs because</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were first found at the Sault Ste.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marie, numbered less than half as many</seg><seg type="columnLine">men as the Nadouaissioux, but their attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so sudden and so wholly unexpected,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Nadouaissioux were at such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">disadvantage, the slaughter was terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a time. The savages from Lac Superior</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracked heads wherever they showed, male,</seg><seg type="columnLine">female or infant, and the early darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone saved their victims from complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">annihilation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That Dick Jeffreys lived was due to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick wit of his foster-mother. The canoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the attacking party had swept past when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she found herself alone in the bow of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft and she immediately turned, drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the current and hid in the reeds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sounds of the battle came from down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream and both sides but soon died away</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the current swept every one out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lake. The old woman judged that</seg><seg type="columnLine">none remained between her and the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">river and stealthily she shoved out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to paddle northward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The clouds were low, the darkness intense.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The river mouth was a vast marsh. High</seg><seg type="columnLine">reeds bordered the narrow channels and</seg><seg type="columnLine">islands were numerous. The old woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew every nook of the river and in two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours she had traveled so far from the lake</seg><seg type="columnLine">she dared go ashore and ascertain if her</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were, dead or only wounded. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned her canoe into a tree-roofed slough</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crept forward to feel of their bodies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick was breathing, but her husband's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands were cold and blood no longer flowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his crushed head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As she knelt over them she heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swish of water behind her and saw the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow of a canoe against the brighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">river. As she watched, another and another</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed, stealthily, like ghosts, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that her people wfere retreating in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness. She pushed out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream and all night toiled with the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the current.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dawn found their paddles still plying</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily and they did not stop until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a league beyond a river flowing into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Misisepe from the north, the route by</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the attackers had come. The entire</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">party, numbering only a pitiful dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoes hid in a slough while three un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wounded warriors in a single canoe went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">to warn the great body of their people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who, they knew, would be camped at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big falls of the great river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick's foster-mother, weary as she was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">did all she could do for the wounded man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She removed the body of her husband and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a soft bed for the Virginian in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of the canoe. She felt of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">welt on the side of his head, pressed against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skull and grunted with satisfaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">on finding that it had not been crushed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She washed the blood from his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck, bathed his face and crooned over him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an effort to bring him to consciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the hours went by and the Vir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginian lay in the bottom of the canoe, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face white, his eyes closed, his chest rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">and falling only slightly and with ominous</seg><seg type="columnLine">pauses between.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later in the afternoon a boy stationed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank of the main channel reported that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warriors were passing and the fugitives</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddled out of their hiding-place to see a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred canoes, each driven by four men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeding down with the current to cut off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Saulteurs and avenge the deaths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick's foe'.er-mother toiled the remainder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the day to traverse the six leagues re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">maining before the main encampment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her people was reached and then, exhausted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she turned her patient over to others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The morning of the second day Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened his eyes for the first time. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too weak to move and he believed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first that the thunder in his ears was due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his injury, for in all his travels on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Misisepe he had not found even a rapids.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was lying in a bark cabine, alone, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon his foster-mother entered, to retreat</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once with loud shouts of joy that brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crowd to the door. Broth was poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">between his Ups, his face and head bathed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he dropped off to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The recovery of the Virginian was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of weeks, not days. Willing hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore him each morning to the trees above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great falls, which Frenchmen were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see a few years later and name St. Anthony.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Women brought him food, the choicest</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts of the game. Old men came and sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside him, smoking for hours in absolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence if he showed no desire for con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">95</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The war-party returned with a score of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">prisoners and long tales of vengeance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Saulteurs had been dispersed, some</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fleeing into the forest, others down the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">river, all cut off for the time from their own</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">country to the northeast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again Dick was amazed at the tolerance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the Nadouaissioux. Ten prisoners were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">executed as had been the Islinois. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">others, after witnessing the execution, were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">set free and told to report to their people</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that the Nadouaissioux had not sought war,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that they desired peace with the Saulteurs,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but that their neighbors were guilty of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">foulest treachery and would be exterminated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">if ever again they committed such an act.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The methods of torture Dick had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the eastward, and which he believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">were practised by all savages, were un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known among the Nadouaissioux. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a custom to be adopted later, after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effects of the Iroquois raids had been felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the valley of the Misisepe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet the people with whdffi Dick found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself called themselves Poualaks, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">"warriors," the name Nadouaissioux, mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing "a snake," or "enemy," having been</seg><seg type="columnLine">given them by the Saulteurs. The French</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon reduced this to Sioux, and the amiable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brave, honest people who spread from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Misisepe to the great mountains to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">west, those who spared their prisoners and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wept copiously at will, were the ancestors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the followers of Sitting Bull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick believed his recovery would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">short. Virginia was ever in his mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">July had come but there was still time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to escape for his dash of several hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred leagues down the great river. But a</seg><seg type="columnLine">week after he arrived at the falls he dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered that his right side was partially</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralyzed. Sometimes he could move his</seg><seg type="columnLine">right arm or leg but he never could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain. A day might go by without his</seg><seg type="columnLine">being able to walk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first this brought a greater despond-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ency than at any time since the death of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Antoine Goddin. There was a chance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when he had been captured by the Islinois,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">still a chance when he was bound to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tree before the Nadouaissioux boys. Now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he saw none. A thousand leagues of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">unknown wilderness lay between him and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his destination, a thousand leagues of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">paddling, portaging, hunting his living,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dodging hostile savages, finding his way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Not only a stout heart but a whole body</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was necessary, and he could not even swing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a paddle, could not lift his musket to his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, could not be certain but that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">next step would topple him to the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was maddening, and for the first time</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick refused, even after days of contempla-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, to accept his fate without bitterness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Savages he could fight or outwit, strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters could be navigated, trackless forests</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be traversed, but this was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly beyond his power to combat. Idle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">chafing, cursing each day that found him</seg><seg type="columnLine">still at the falls, he saw July pass. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no improvement. The blow on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left side of his head had injured his brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">or certain nerve-centers, and he saw a life-</seg><seg type="columnLine">time of hobbling, crawling beggary among</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages who, as time passed, would lose their</seg><seg type="columnLine">awe for his color, would forget that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed two of the Saulteurs in their disastrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle down the Misisepe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The first of August nearly all the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered at the great falls began to depart</seg><seg type="columnLine">for their Winter home among the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerable lakes at the source of the Mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isepe. There, among the wild oats marshes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure from attack and provided with grain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beaver and moose for the Winter, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would remain until the following Spring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There was nothing for Dick but to accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany them. His foster-mother paddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he hobbled or crawled across portages.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warriors gave them of their game, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad of the honor of carrying his musket.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some insinuated that Dick should teach</seg><seg type="columnLine">them its use and give them powder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">balls, but he had only a small amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ammunition and even in the face of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">last disaster he could not give up all hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">that some day he might recover and start</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to Virginia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was on this journey to the Winter</seg><seg type="columnLine">home of the Nadouaissioux that peace was</seg><seg type="columnLine">arranged with the Saulteurs. Dick had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of the power of the calumet, had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reverence in which the Islinois held it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been told by Goddin of its might among</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the Western tribes. The Sioux espe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cially kept all sworn promises with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inviolable fidelity and the ceremony of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">calumet meant that absolute trust could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed upon them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The calumet itself, originally a stick of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood two or three feet long, a quarter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inch thick and two inches wide, pierced</seg><seg type="columnLine">from end to end so that the breath or spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">might pass through it, had, in Dick's time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">96</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a bowl at one end in which to smoke the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacred tobacco. The whole affair was</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually gorgeously decorated and many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tribes knew and practised a dance</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chant in honor of the calumet itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since Dick had become a Nadouaissioux</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had gained the confidence of the older</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of the tribe, they often talked to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the calumet and its power. It could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">used in all things, as a passport to distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">tribes, to ratify peace pacts or treaties,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to secure good weather, to bring rain, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attest contracts and to declare war.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT not until he witnessed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treaty with the Saulteurs had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized the really impressive cere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monies with which it could be smoked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For this was its most important use. Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">was accorded a seat in the front circle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors and as he watched the chiefs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two nations gravely blowing the smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the sky, the four world quarters</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the earth, earnestly invoking the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">and other spirits as witnesses to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">vows of "sacred kinship," he could not but</seg><seg type="columnLine">be impressed by the sincerity of the par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticipants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Through September the savages were</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy with the harvest of wild oats. Huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">quantities were gathered in the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">marshes and put away for Winter. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">women worked from morning to night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving their canoes through the tall stalks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beating the kernels into the bottom</seg><seg type="columnLine">with short sticks. The wild oats marshes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the property of the Sioux and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">then were becoming a bone of contention</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Salteurs and starting a warfare</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was to last through nearly two cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the first snows of Fall Dick dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered that his paralysis was leaving him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Daily he began to have more and more use</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his right arm and right leg. A fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">exaltation seized him. Each morning he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tested his limbs, tried to walk, to lift</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. If he were able to get away before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first ice in the lakes could reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swift current of the Misisepe, he could keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of Winter in its southward rush,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could at least reach the Ohio before frost</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the waterways. That would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">half his journey and he would risk the</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger and privation of the rest. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spring Virginia would have the news of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he was too eager, pressed his recov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery too hard. His nerves ceased entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to function and, shivering, despondent, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay beside the fire in the birchbark cabine</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Winter gripped the Northern land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was then that Dick Jeffreys for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time thought of other things in Vir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginia than his mission and Governor Berke-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley. With the savages there had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">constant human contact but never human</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellowship. The oil was stirred into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water but never merged with it, never could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be absorbed. Ever since the death of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Antoine Goddin Dick had felt a void which</seg><seg type="columnLine">even his breathless impatience to return</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Virginia could not entirely fill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, lying beside a small fire in a low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil-smelling cabine, shut in by the fierce</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winter of the North, despondent, comfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, his mind turned to the people of Vir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginia. There was his father, alone like</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, with even a deeper personal sorrow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps mortally wounded by what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would consider as the complete disgrace</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his son. There was Elizabeth Carver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Betsykins, the one person in the colony</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been a real companion, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">more nearly understood him, and she, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">his father, had been left with a great mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding, had in the end been de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prived even of that wonderful faith in</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick sometimes marveled at this trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the girl, whom he still considered, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had that last night under the sycamores</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a romping, boyish, carefree comrade.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even now he failed to understand how he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had hurt her in that last interview, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed it was his irreverence for kings</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had shocked her royalist ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In his foster-mother alone did Dick find</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfort. Like many Indian women who</seg><seg type="columnLine">have passed middle age, who have seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winters and famines and wars come and</seg><seg type="columnLine">go, leaving their trail of suffering and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorrow and death, she was a strong, noble,</seg><seg type="columnLine">virile character. Though the Nadouais-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sioux did not accord their women a high</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, she had won to a certain influence</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the sheer dominance of her will,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her keen intellect and her biting tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were, in fact, the only qualities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">leadership possessed even by the men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her sharp comments, her shrewd de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ductions, her knowledge of savage nature,</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressed openly or in long conversations</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the leading men, had resulted in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">97</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wielding a power in the band that was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">second even tp the chief's. The deaths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her two sons and husband had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain bitterness, a vindictiveness that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had won advantageous terms in the treaty</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the Saulteurs, but it had also, in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">loneliness, brought a great affection for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white man who had become her son.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On Dick she lavished her tenderness, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother love which is so often consuming</seg><seg type="columnLine">among savage people, and, in time, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick intuition and shrewd observation</seg><seg type="columnLine">led to a discovery of his ambitions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your body is here but your heart is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not," she said to him one night as they sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the fire. "Our people can become</seg><seg type="columnLine">the children of another nation when</seg><seg type="columnLine">adopted. But the white man can not</seg><seg type="columnLine">change his heart any more than he can</seg><seg type="columnLine">change his skin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick did not reply. He had a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">fondness for the old woman, a great respect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he did not know that he could confide</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can trust me," she uncannily</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered his thought. "I am your mother,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I know my son."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick looked at the wrinkled, dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skinned face with the straight black hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushed back from a low forehead. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hard-pressed mouth, the thick nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">the expression that always was stern and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forbidding, he found nothing assuring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But in the eyes, black, unwavering, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found truth, the mother love, a real tender-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness that belied the stern features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are right, mother," he answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulsively. "I am not happy here. I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be. You have been as kind to me as</seg><seg type="columnLine">your own flesh and blood. Your people</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been brothers. I should not ask more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," and his eyes glowed as he sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and faded her across the fire, "my</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart can never be here. It is in the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I was born, where I have always</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived, where my father, white-haired, sor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowing, waits for me. My land is far away</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I would have been there now had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the Islinois falsely accused me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken me prisoner. I must go back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my home, mother. I must go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old woman studied him shrewdly for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is a woman," she said at last.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You have not cared for the young women</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, there is none," answered Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnestly. "It is because I love my land</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my people and because I can not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy away from them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long time she sat looking into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire. The flickering blaze enhanced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savagery of her features. Her brown,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knotted, toil-cramped hands were clasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her knees. Her eyes stared, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavering, unblinking, complete masks for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My son," she said at last, "you have not</seg><seg type="columnLine">told me all. It is not a woman, for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman brings another light to a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. It is not the sickness of much</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking, for the longing for home dulls</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. You have not told me all, and I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not ask it. I am an old woman, one who</seg><seg type="columnLine">never before saw white men, and who am</seg><seg type="columnLine">I to understand them? White men harness</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thunder, cut and harden the iron, make</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs with black water that are the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">as words. Why, then, should they not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have thoughts that we can not know?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you are my son, even my flesh</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blood, and your happiness is my happi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.

When the Spring comes you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go!" cried Dick excitedly. "But I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">not lift a paddle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will be well and strong when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow has melted."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the chiefs!

Impatient, eager, he spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her one evening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Does my son doubt my word?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked sternly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he lay beside the fire, trying to deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine whether she had spoken boastfully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly, or whether she was really able to effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">his escape from the Nadouaissioux, he dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered that the first of her predictions</seg><seg type="columnLine">was coming true. Day by day he began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to regain the use of his arm and leg. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">Midwinter he could walk without assist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance and could carry his musket. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength returned and before Spring he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hunting moose and beaver with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of the band.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the Winter the Nadouaissioux scattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the Great Lake country. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">various places only a few leagues apart</seg><seg type="columnLine">small villages of a few families were estab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lished. This gave to each an undisturbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">game district and in Summer made it</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible for enemies to surprise the band.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before the foe had exterminated one</seg><seg type="columnLine">settlement the word would be carried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the many others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick and his foster-mother had Wintered</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a small lake twenty leagues from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">southernmost village. They were off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main stream of the Misisepe, separated</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it by many small lakes and portages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there were half a dozen villages on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">route.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the moon of the carp was in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last quarter and the snow had begun to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go the old Nadouaissioux woman suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced that she was about to make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey and that she wished Dick to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her. She had a small sledge upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">which she bound food, robes and a mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious bundle which she had been guarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully all through the Winter. Dick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he could get no hint as to the object</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her expedition, but hoping that it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean the fulfilment of her promise, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager to accompany her. Because she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">old he asked to be allowed to pull the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sledge, but she sternly informed him that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> his duty was to go ahead and hunt, leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman's work to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each night they stopped in one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, marsh-bound villages. Here for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time since Dick had known her</seg><seg type="columnLine">she showed an interest in petty village</seg><seg type="columnLine">gossip. Her stories of their own intentions</seg><seg type="columnLine">and experiences both amused and disturbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Virginian, but so great was his con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidence in her he did not ask questions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Back of it all he felt that there must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">some motive, some purpose. So he sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently beside the camp-fires while she</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked innumerable trivial questions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquired into every action through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Winter of every one she met.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of the week they passed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last village. Still the old woman kept on</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they camped that night in the open.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But her garrulity had ceased as suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it began. Now she sat for long hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the fire of dead pine, staring un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinkingly into the flames. She kept her</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts to herself, offered no explanation</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Dick of their mysterious journey. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">night he fell asleep while she sat thus, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">each morning he wakened to find her there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apparently she never slept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For another week she led him on into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the south, along the frozen bed of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Misisepe, which was now only a small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">winding stream. Neither as they trudged</seg><seg type="columnLine">on through the day nor as they sat beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire at night did she speak. As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time passed she seemed to grow more</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeble, to become more weary after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day's toil. But always her eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright and steady and each night she</seg><seg type="columnLine">refused to.stop until darkness made further</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress on the rotting ice impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The afternoon of the ninth day after</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the last village she turned toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shore and pushed the brush aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is here," she said simply. "We can</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest until the river breaks its bonds."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick, from his position behind her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught a glimpse of red birchbark behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bushes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A canoe!" he exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you think I wasted my breath in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that foolish chatter in the villages?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she asked sharply. "Did you think I aired</seg><seg type="columnLine">for gossip of all their silly doings?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you asked thousands of ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to -"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To learn one thing, that this canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">was here behind these bushes. Now, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">99</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">son, we have only to wait until the ice is</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. It will be soon, for the moon of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crane is new and I said that in the moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the crane you would start to find your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now that she had reached the canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the rotting ice drove her to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult, travel along the bank, the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman was more cheerful and communi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cative. The first night, after a supper of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild rice and moose meat, she brought out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mysterious bundle and untied it. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was long and thin and the outer wrapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tanned moosehide disclosed a hunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirt fringed and decorated with bands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">porcupine quills. Without a word she</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed it to Dick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His astonished thanks were sincere</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he knew that the quill work had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired every spare moment of the Winter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but his eyes were fixed in what still re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained in his foster-mother's hands. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the reason for the odd shape of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundle, a long, richly ornamented calumet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick recognized it at once as the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacred possession of the Nadouaissioux,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same pipe with which the treaty with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Saulteurs had been affirmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His foster-mother was busy, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with another and smaller bundle. As she</seg><seg type="columnLine">unwrapped the skin Dick exclaimed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement. She held half a dozen small</seg><seg type="columnLine">bells, the tongue of each bound with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thong so that it would be noiseless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where did you get them?" he demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he looked at these unaccountable evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dences of trade with Europeans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen, my son," she began. "This</seg><seg type="columnLine">calumet will bear you safely through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands of strange people. Only show it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave it toward the sun, smoke it with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people you meet, and you may pass un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmed. Never was there a calumet so</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful. The people of any nation who</seg><seg type="columnLine">see it will recognize it at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The shirt you must wear always. Upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">it I have sewed quills of colors and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms and figures which denote my prayers</seg><seg type="columnLine">for your safety.

They became lost and our war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riors surrounded them.

Her husband</seg><seg type="columnLine">and her sons dead, her adopted son on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to his own people, life held nothing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she declared, and she only feared that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not live long enough to reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave of her sons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick could not understand her assurance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she could time her death so accurately.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She had marched long hours each day,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dragging the sledge. She seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong and well. And yet when the ice</seg><seg type="columnLine">had rotted, the river had opened and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last they had embarked on the long journey,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw that her paddle was ineffectual,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she made only the motions. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they reached the great falls she was forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to admit that she could no longer gather</seg><seg type="columnLine">the firewood and cook the meals. Only in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes, black, blazing, unquenchable, did</seg><seg type="columnLine">life seem to remain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick, now that he had started at last</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Virginia, now that he was on his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the message he bore, paddled steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the long days. The river, swelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">hourly, bore him swiftly, but his paddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot the little canoe even faster. The great</seg><seg type="columnLine">falls were passed and the lake where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Saulteurs had ambushed the Nadouaissioux.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Landmarks slipped by one after the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he knew that two or three more days</seg><seg type="columnLine">would see him at the mouth of the Ouis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">consin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But as he watched the silent figure curled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bow he wondered if she would live</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see her desire fulfilled. For days she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had lain there in the bottom of the canoe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless, uncomplaining, her wasted body</seg><seg type="columnLine">consumed bit by bit by the fire of her un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conquerable will. As Dick's fear that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would die any hour became greater her</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire became his and he pressed on early</seg><seg type="columnLine">and late, driving his little craft with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one purpose of reaching the bartering-place</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was mid-afternoon of a bright April</seg><seg type="columnLine">day when at last he turned into a channel</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting in toward the eastern bank and shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to the prairie above the mouth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ouisconsin. It was deserted. The bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">poles of cabines scattered over the plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed like ghosts of the thousands who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had thronged the place when he had last</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he approached the bank he feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he might be too late. For hours he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not seen a movement of the silent figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the bow. He stepped ashore and leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">over her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are here, my son," she said as her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes opened. "You have your mother's</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanks. Carry me up so that I can see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prairie and I will die in sight of the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where my sons lie."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He lifted her from the canoe and carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to a knoll from which she could look</seg><seg type="columnLine">out over the plain to the bare bluffs beyond.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">101</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">For a few moments she sat there, only her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes moving. Then they closed and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second time, on the banks of the great,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown streams of the great, unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">wilderness, Dick felt that he was alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As carefully as with the body of Antoine</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goddin, he prepared a final resting-place</seg><seg type="columnLine">for her after the white man's fashion. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">dug deep in the soft earth and piled stones</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the grave. Then with his ramrod</seg><seg type="columnLine">he burned an inscription in English upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hewn board.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sorrowfully and slowly he paddled away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the current and was swept down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and across to the bluff at the base of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had buried Antoine just a year before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For an hour he sat beside the tomb he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">built, gazing out over the river, recalling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last moments with his friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good-by, Antoine," he said softly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he arose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN HIS abstraction Dick paddled</seg><seg type="columnLine">until dark before he went ashore</seg><seg type="columnLine">on an island to camp for the night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Day after day passed and he drifted down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mighty river, which constantly grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger as streams flowed in from either side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The towering bluffs at last gave way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeping prairies. Game was abundant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weather delightful. Peace and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentment seemed to hold the land, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">always Dick paddled, always he pressed on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spurred anew by the thought of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">graves he had left at the mouth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ouisconsin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Islands were numerous and afforded</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparatively safe camping-places. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, however, he tried the western shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the morning wakened to find a group</seg><seg type="columnLine">of strange savages about him. Soberly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled and lighted the calumet, waved it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun and the four quarters of the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then passed it to the strangers to smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The magic of the pipe was more potent</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he had dreamed, annoyingly so, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">they insisted upon taking him to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">village and feasting him for three days</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he was escorted back to the river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He found they were the Ottos, a branch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Ouinibegous, distant cousins of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadouaissioux. There was no difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">in understanding their dialect, and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">them Dick learned that the wilderness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now taking the form of great plains, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended for several leagues to the westward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ending at the great mountains without a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of salt water. On the plains were</seg><seg type="columnLine">many and strange nations, and beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains, it was reported, were still other</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands and other people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Ottos warned Dick that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">find savage people and still more savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">monsters if he continued on the "great</seg><seg type="columnLine">water," but he fired his musket to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he could do and departed with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">best wishes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A large stream flowed in from the east</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he took to be the Rocky River.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two noble streams joined the great water</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the west, and still the boundless</seg><seg type="columnLine">prairies continued. Sometimes the Mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">isepe swung to the southeast or southwest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but almost always he traveled south.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last he came to the mouth of a river</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the east which he believed to be that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Islinois. Twice he had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">villages of these people but had avoided</seg><seg type="columnLine">being seen except by a solitary hunter he</seg><seg type="columnLine">encountered on the shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately after passing the mouth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Islinois Dick came to the influx of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream on the western side. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbulent, muddy giant of a river, rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the beautiful, calm Misisepe, dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coloring its waters, causing great, swirling</seg><seg type="columnLine">eddies, taking possession of the valley and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashing on, carrying the canoe more swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">than it had ever traveled before. Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized it immediately as the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream of which Western savages had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken as the bartering-place the year</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, the Pekitanoui, or "muddy river,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward to be known, through another</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage language, as the Missouri.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the mammoth river in which he now</seg><seg type="columnLine">found himself Dick began to watch eagerly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last anxiously, for the Ohio. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vegetation and the climate he judged that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was as far south as Virginia, but still</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was traveling straight on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His belief that the Ohio joined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Misisepe was based on the rumor Basile</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pombert had heard from savages he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen and from his own knowledge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. He had traveled straight north</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Ohio nearly to Lac Mecheygan</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a large stream. The Islinois flowed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly the same place and toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">southwest. In the great triangle between</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would not be room for another river</seg><seg type="columnLine">so large as the Ohio, and he reasoned that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first big tributary on the east must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one he sought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">102</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he was about to despair, beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think of turning back, fearing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">geographical guesses had been far wrong,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reached it and turned joyfully toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the east.	&lt;â€¢</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Long days of toil followed. The river</seg><seg type="columnLine">was high, with a good current, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned and twisted in a manner that</seg><seg type="columnLine">became increasingly exasperating. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a few days remembered landmarks</seg><seg type="columnLine">were passed and he went on with new</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy, assured that his course was right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He spent almost every hour of the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the canoe, but as his supply of wild rice</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave out he was often forced ashore for</seg><seg type="columnLine">game. Once he pressed on regardless of</seg><seg type="columnLine">food but the consequent weakness con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced him of the folly of such a course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twice the calumet won passage past</seg><seg type="columnLine">large villages of strange savages. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he was cooking a meal on shore two</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indians crept close in a thicket and his life</seg><seg type="columnLine">was saved by the prayers embroidered on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hunting-shirt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he knew that, once he had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountains at the head of the Ohio,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his calumet and quill-worked applications</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the spirits would be unavailing. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the great valley of the Misisepe did the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe hold sway. Then his skill as a woods-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and blind chance alone could win</seg><seg type="columnLine">through to the settlements on the eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the Blue Mountains.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And they won through. Near the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Monongahela he abandoned the canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">and struck into the wilderness. He avoided</seg><seg type="columnLine">valleys in which he knew the savages would</seg><seg type="columnLine">gather, kept on the high levels and slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously wormed his way past.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In his concentration on the one purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach Virginia Dick never forgot that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only fighting his way to certain death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But not once since he had burned his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scription on the oak that towered above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"great water" had this consideration even</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him falter. Scarcely, in fact, did</seg><seg type="columnLine">he even think that his achievement might</seg><seg type="columnLine">allay the hatred of Berkeley. If he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of himself at all it was only that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fate was insignificant in the face of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This feeling increased with the strain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">constant watchfulness through the thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand leagues of travel since he had left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land of the Nadouaissioux and his greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear was not of Berkeley but of failure</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the goal was almost in sight. As</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the strain increased there resulted a nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition that made sleep at night only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitful jumble of dreams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twice he had cause to be thankful for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thoughtfulness of his foster-mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the bells, tied to strings in bushes</seg><seg type="columnLine">near his resting-place, warned him of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of prowling savages. Each time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he risked the noise of firing his musket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he knew that the entire tribe would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his heels if he permitted the prowler to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fifty leagues from Jamestown Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered the first evidence of an Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">uprising. An isolated clearing, far up</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the foothills, contained only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackened timbers of a cabin and the bones</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the settler's family. He had realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that in the colony of Virginia itself, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">long association with the whites had bred</seg><seg type="columnLine">an intense hatred, and where Governor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Berkeley's fear for his fur trade had induced</seg><seg type="columnLine">a policy of no defense, would come his</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With this evidence of the savages'</seg><seg type="columnLine">hostility he could not tell whether it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an isolated massacre or whether he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">find a string of ruined plantations across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the colony and the survivors besieged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jamestown itself. He kept to the thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamps, the most inaccessible places,</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled only at night, spent most of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">days in watching. Once he found the trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what he believed to be a small war-party,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again he saw a thick column of smoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">that undoubtedly rose from a burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">settler's home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dick was greatly weakened by the strain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeplessness and lack of food. Days and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nights spent in the dark, dismal swampland,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his body wet and shivering, finally had their</seg><seg type="columnLine">result. When only a few leagues from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">father's plantation the fever caught him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still he forced himself to go on, barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">a league a day. He was almost too weak</seg><seg type="columnLine">to walk. Often delirium brought visions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hatchet-swinging, yelling savages bend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over him. One evening, after dragging</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself forward all day he came out upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank of the James. Down the stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little way he saw the bow of a canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden in the grass. When darkness fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">he crawled into it, pushed out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">current and drifted down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every inch of the land and water was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now familiar, even at night. In another</seg><seg type="columnLine">league he would reach the cleared fields of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before Marquette</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">103</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his father's plantation. A league beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would see the manor house outlined</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the sky, if it were there, if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages had confined their operations to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outskirts of the settlement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A BEND in the river suddenly dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the lighted buildings. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were safe. Jamestown was safe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He worked the canoe painfully and slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the current to a point where, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, he would strike the wharf. In a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes he was walking up the broad path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great hall door was open, the win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows lighted, but no one was to be seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He crossed the broad veranda, entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall. The door of the dining-room opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and an old negro woman stepped out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Marse Dick!" she shrieked, and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to flee. He caught her by the shoulder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung her back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is father?" he demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is yo' daid?" she demanded in terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he answered sharply. "Where is</seg><seg type="columnLine">father?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's done gone over to Marse Carver's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fo' de big dinner to his lawdship an' de</seg><seg type="columnLine">gobernor, Marse Dick. Where yo' been?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The governor! Governor Berkeley?

He was deathly weak</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he had shaken the grip of the fever from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brain sufficiently to realize that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hang on only a little longer. Before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">veil again descended, before what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed would be the end, he must find</seg><seg type="columnLine">the governor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stumbled down the steps and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the old familiar path through the pines.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His feet seemed naturally to find their way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making each turn, lifting themselves over</seg><seg type="columnLine">each root and stone. A quarter of a league</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he stood before Carver Manor, bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liantly lighted in every window. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open door came a burst of laughter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Staggering, he crossed the lawn, mounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steps, entered the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A liveried servant barred his way. Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust him aside, muttering -- "The gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The servant ran for assistance and Dick</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked down the hall to the door which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew, opened into the dining-room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was closed. He lifted the latch, half-fell</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as it swung open. He caught himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood stiffly erect and his eyes swept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant scene before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great table was bright with dozens</seg><seg type="columnLine">of candles in their golden sticks, with plate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">china and glassware. Around it were more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a score of people, the cavalier aris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tocracy of the colony, the women with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorgeous gowns direct from Paris, the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally resplendent in silks and laces, vivid</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors and shining swords.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A woman glanced up at the door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">screamed. The chatter and the laughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceased. Men sprang to their feet, hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinctively falling to sword hilts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Colonel Carver, at the head of the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a step forward, only to stare in amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment at the figure in the doorway. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him stood a tall man, thin, shaking with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fever, his skin deathly white beneath a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scraggly beard, his buckskin garments caked</seg><seg type="columnLine">with mud, a rusty musket trailing at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, but with eyes that burned as bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liantly as a dozen candles and with a head</seg><seg type="columnLine">held high and proudly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dick!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly all eyes turned from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparition in the doorway to the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman who had cried the name. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">risen from the table and stood staring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her beautiful face had become as pale as his,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while in her eyes was both terror and disbelief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dick!" she repeated unconsciously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Dick Jeffreys!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly the brilliancy of the staring eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clouded. Dick's proudly held head</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lowered and a great, overpowering</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement impelled a step forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Betsykins!" he whispered. "It is really</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Betsykins?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As their eyes met Dick forgot the fever,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Misisepe, Berkeley, the noose, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant assemblage, everything except this</seg><seg type="columnLine">incomprehensible transformation from boy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish comrade to wondrous, alluring woman-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood. In the half-delirium of fever his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind instantly comprehended each act of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pas- and its consequences in the future.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heedlessly, prodigally, to satisfy vagrant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trifling whims, he had dissipated man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest fortune. With startling clearness</seg><seg type="columnLine">he recognized what that last interview be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath the sycamores had meant to her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how he had hurt her, what he had now</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought upon himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Betsykins," he repeated in a low voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand groping helplessly toward her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">m</seg><seg type="columnLine">104</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In that moment Dick Jeffreys knew what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he desired more than anything else in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, that for which no sacrifice was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">great. It was not Betsykins, his playmate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Elizabeth, his mate, who stood there</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him. But as he looked at her he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the gulf between them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thought maddened him. What were</seg><seg type="columnLine">kings and empires and governors' hatreds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what were purpose and high resolve and</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty, before the demands of this over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelming love that he had always felt but</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never recognized? And yet he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought his way back to stare through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">noose at this glory that might have been.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Forgetting everything else, completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed, the iron resistance that had kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dick on his feet for the last few days began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to desert him. His head fell forward. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes half-closed. One hand groped for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door-handle. The candles began to swing</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jeffreys, eh?" snarled a voice from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hatred expressed in each syllable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gloating inflection on the question at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end, stabbed through Dick's wavering</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness, brought his head up with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snap. An old man seated at the left of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Colonel Carver had risen to his feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as his eyes met Dick's the young Vir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginian's vision cleared instantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The same, your Excellency," he replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily and clearly.

I was the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man to see it, to traverse it, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed it in the name of the people of</seg><seg type="columnLine">England and their king, Charles the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Second."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DISCOVERY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">'G'OR a few moments after Dick had</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished speaking there was not a word,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a movement, about the big dining-table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since the founding of the colony seventy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">years before there had been continual</seg><seg type="columnLine">speculation as to what lay beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blue Mountains. From the Spaniards had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come amazing tales. They had traveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">far to the south and west, even to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eastern ocean. They had found gold and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearls, rich nations, strange lands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But of what lay to the north of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spanish country, of what lay west of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Virginia, behind the Blue Mountains, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now this fever-stricken, wasted figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">had suddenly appeared before them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had announced that not only had he been</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther than had any white man before him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but also that he had taken this land of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery in the name of the king of England.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Sir William Berkeley's eager voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">which first broke the silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You found gold, precious stones, pearls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the king?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I found something more valuable than</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold," answered Dick, "a land which holds</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater riches, and I found it for the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the king."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you expect," asked the governor</seg><seg type="columnLine">coldly, "that this will ransom your seditious</seg><seg type="columnLine">carcass, that this will save you from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">noose you slipped?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I expect nothing," and Dick's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">rang out proudly.

And I took</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in the name of the people and the king of</seg><seg type="columnLine">England. And because you are the king's</seg><seg type="columnLine">representative in Virginia, I have come to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to report."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And do you think the king will balance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that against your evil tongue?" demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">his excellency in a rage.

What is land worth when it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far away? Had you brought gold, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">news of gold, the king might have listened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you. There is gold there. The Span-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iards have found it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have not been beyond the Blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mountains, sirrah.

This man goes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Jamestown .gaol."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a gasp of amazement from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">diners.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a year last April since I first saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Misisepe. Since then I have tried un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceasingly to return.

Since she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">first seen Dick in the doorway, had called</seg><seg type="columnLine">his name, she had stood there looking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, hoping, praying that he had retrieved</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As she sat there sobbing, an old man</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther down the table, his hair white, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face deeply lined, staggered to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dick!

He swung about and jerked open</seg><seg type="columnLine">a drawer in the desk. Taking up an auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic, he dropped it into his pocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">squirmed into a heavy red mackinaw, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">took up his hat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That will be all for tonight, Miss Carle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton.

Closing the door behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, he made off in the direction of the mill</seg><seg type="columnLine">wharf. He passed the bunk-house without</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much as a glance, and continued toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river's edge. Miss Carleton sprang to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her feet. He was going without a posse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's going alone! No! No! They'll kill</seg><seg type="columnLine">him! It's--it's my fault! I taunted him!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I said he was-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She sprang toward the door; but half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, her knees ceased to support her body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a moment later the void unconscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness descended upon her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN darkness had settled over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface of the river, Potter spun</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fly-wheel of the launch motor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a moment later, at low speed, piloted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light craft from among the piling of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mill wharf, out upon the breast of the moon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A heavy tide was running, which,together</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the natural current of the river, forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to increase the speed of the motor in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to make way against it. For a time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he held steadily toward the open water;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, as the middle of the river was reached,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he threw over the tiller, and the launch's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose swung about and headed up-stream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was fully five minutes before the craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered full speed against the force of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing waters. The dim shore-line on</seg><seg type="columnLine">either side of him swept by like a moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture. Overhead, the stars twinkled</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintly, dimmed by the light haze which</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung over the river. A vague wraith of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moon stuck its thin, spindle points into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gray sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did not underestimate the difficulties</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the task before him. He was acquainted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Harrigan and with Harrigan's methods.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This river pirate was one of the most daring</seg><seg type="columnLine">characters in all the sawdust land. Ruth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, treacherous, resourceful, he was sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by a crew of his own choosing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Potter's eyes glittered with anticipation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">112</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and he advanced the throttle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motor.	^</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he rounded a big bend in the river, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brisk breeze drove down upon him from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep mouth of the river valley beyond.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Settling himself at the tiller, he rolled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighted a cigaret, and busied himself not-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the landmarks as they swept by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the launch breasted the mouth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">South Fork, Potter threw over the tiller</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and ran the craft into the narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">tributary. Here it was far darker than on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main arm of water, the trees on either</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank mingling their foliage to shut out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim moon and stars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a quarter of a mile from the mouth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fork, Potter reduced the launch's</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, and directed the craft in among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy undergrowth of the right bank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he sprang ashore, making fast to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy bough of a fallen forest giant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He scrambled quickly up the bank, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching the flat above, paused a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take his bearings. Then, without hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tation, he pushed ahead in the general di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection of Harrigan's camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The slight mist of the early evening was</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappearing, and the sky and stars seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have grown inestimably closer to earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was grateful for this meager light; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way underfoot was heavily overgrown and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluttered with dead brush and the limbs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunks of fallen trees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He halted suddenly, clutching the auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic in his pocket until the edges of steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">stung the flesh of his hand. A dark shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved ahead of him, and without hesita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, he dropped flat on the ground. Crouch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing low, he watched the dim figure walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and forth across the moonlit trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Flat as possible on the ground, Potter</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled at right angles to his original di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection, guarded by this shadowy figure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, he knew, must be one of Harrigan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">pickets. It was slow, tedious work; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twigs and branches which covered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground were dry and brittle, making great</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chances of discovery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After perhaps ten minutes he reached a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooded spot, and rose gratefully to his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had not been detected. The sentry</seg><seg type="columnLine">still warmed himself by treading back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth across the mouth of the trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Smiling to himself, Potter turned about</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started by the roundabout passage in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction of Harrigan's rendezvous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This way, although longer and more dif-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ficult to traverse, presented far less chances</seg><seg type="columnLine">of discovery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He made his way slowly and cautiously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once or twice the darkness confused him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was forced to strike a match in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take up the dim trail. The flare of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">match he carefully concealed within his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupped hands, exposing the light in but one</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction at a time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At perhaps half a mile from the spot at</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he had taken the wooded trail, Potter</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered at some distance a dim glow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In these deserted woods it could have but</seg><seg type="columnLine">one meaning. He knew that it was from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harrigan's fire; and when he went ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, it was with decreased speed and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased caution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At every yard the glow increased, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the flames became visible between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree trunks, Potter chose his footings with</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearying exactness. He reached the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the clearing without sound, and concealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself behind a huge fir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A small fire blazed in the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared space. At a short distance stood a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large pail of drinking water, and many rolls</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blankets. About the fire, sprawled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">various poses of relaxation were half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">woodsmen, some dozing, some conversing</seg><seg type="columnLine">guardedly in whispers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Closer to the fire, carefully apart from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, sat two men in close consultation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of them held up a sheet of paper to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">firelight. Unlike the others, they did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisper, and their conversation reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">Potter's straining ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The smaller of these, Potter recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Harrigan. He was a wizened little man</seg><seg type="columnLine">of perhaps forty years, sinewy of build, cat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like of movement, and bronzed to the color</seg><seg type="columnLine">of old copper by the river suns. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading to the other the figures from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheet of paper. The listener, a larger man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite unknown to Potter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger took the paper from Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigan's hand and holding it up to the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fire, scanned the figures it bore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That scale was made of the logs today,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harrigan was saying. "Look her over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make us an offer. You needn't be afraid</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trouble with Potter. He's got no nerve.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'll attend to the brands on the logs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">also to gettin' them down to your customer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">booms. So let your figure be big enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover such incidentals."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stranger busied himself with a study</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sheet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Up-Stream</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">113</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A fine flock of logs," Harrigan pursued</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversationally, and apparently without</seg><seg type="columnLine">intention of helping out the sale. Indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he seemed utterly indifferent as to whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">or not the other purchased his plunder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You'll find them mostly clears, Benson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Potter was bringing them down to his mill</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fill a big order for uppers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Potter's sense of the dramatic told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his moment to make an effective en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance had come. Despite his iron control,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his breath caught once with an eager gasp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His hand on the automatic inside the mack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inaw pocket, he stepped briskly into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle of firelight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he said evenly, grinning to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled Harrigan, "and Potter's going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take 'em down to fill that order!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Panic took the place of the camp's drowsy</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm. Every one sprang to his feet. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">startling had been Potter's appearance that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he approached, the men involuntarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreated to the opposite side of the fire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Across the low flame they glared at him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from frowning, startled eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doubtless the more imaginative of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardened woodsmen had thought, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment of his appearance, that a forest</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghost was come to pay them a visit. Potter</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave little heed to them, however, concen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trating his attention upon the quick, tiger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like movements of Harrigan, whose small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bead-like eyes were fixed on the bulge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Potter's pocket, where the muzzle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic was pressed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In all fairness I must warn you, Harri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan," Potter remarked at the first sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">activity on the little man's part, "that I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">not alone. There is a man with a gun be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind ever tree about this clearing. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">community has stood for your raids as long</seg><seg type="columnLine">as possible. I'm in dead earnest, Harrigan,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you'll be obliging yourself more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">me by just taking things easy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harrigan, a sudden surprise dawning in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes, turned a quick, nervous glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the dark rim of firs which surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. For a moment he seemed to cower</seg><seg type="columnLine">before their dark, sinister silence; but pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently his eyes became defiant again, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned back to Potter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it you want, Potter?" he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Potter laughed with genuine amuse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Isn't that question rather unnecessary?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harrigan stared blankly across the smold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Possibly," Potter continued, "you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away with that on the sheriff; but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think we understand each other, Harrigan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little man shrugged his shoulders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The others, sullen and silent, grouped</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves about their leader.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it you want, Potter?" Harrigan</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeated mechanically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Potter glanced amusedly about from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With so many rare birds, the selection</seg><seg type="columnLine">is rather difficult. But I guess you'll do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harrigan. I want you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little man grinned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You and that sheet of paper," Potter</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned good-humoredly. "The combina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion is beautiful. It cinches you nicely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even your man, the sheriff, can not ask for</seg><seg type="columnLine">more evidence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harrigan's eyebrows raised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The sheriff?

"So! You want me, eh?" He</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced keenly into Potter's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly," Potter nodded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment Harrigan's eyes dropped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground at Potter's feet. Suddenly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced up, his eyes cold as steel, his full-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lipped mouth mocking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, what are you going to do about it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Potter?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd really not advise you to start any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, Harrigan," he said smiling. "How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, that is your own lookout. I've given</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders to my men to pick you off first--at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first movement."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harrigan nodded indifferently.

His right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand slid along his belt toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">butt of a revolver which obtruded</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a large canvas holster. Of the group</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the fire, he was the only one visibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed. The others kept their hands at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their sides. But their eyes were full of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">activities of their chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harrigan's hand continued along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt and came to a stop on the butt of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They tell me you used to be a cowboy,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Potter laughed. "Think you can draw fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for those boys out there?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harrigan grinned back good-naturedly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In another moment his beady eyes nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rowed menacingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now Potter, you've had your little say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and finished. It's my turn. Here's mine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Potter!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without removing the revolver from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">holster, he fired twice, downward into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, Mr. Potter, you'd better go ahead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and take what you want. But you'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be quick. In less than a minute there</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be enough of my men around this</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp to pick the bones of you and your</seg><seg type="columnLine">gang. It's your say, Potter. Now come!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A vast doubt rose in Potter then as to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">success of his carefully planned ruse. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed the automatic from his pocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and directed it frankly across the fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't move," he snapped, and retreating</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single step, stood beside the large pail of</seg><seg type="columnLine">drinking water, considering this new phase</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his adventure. Although not one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them moved, a general grin spread over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces of the group he held at bay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harrigan was grinning mockingly across</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him. A moment passed; then another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A loud tramping of underbrush sounded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily growing nearer. A moment later</seg><seg type="columnLine">six men, panting breathlessly, burst into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the signal for, Boss?" the fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of them asked as he caught his breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Potter laughed outright, and with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muzzle of the automatic motioned them</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Over there with the rest!" he ordered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned quickly and called back over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder to his fantom reenforcements--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watch 'em close, boys!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A vague, concealed smile sparkled in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes at this new turn of affairs. He swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to face Harrigan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You come with me quietly, Harrigan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've had enough of your bluffing, now I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean business. You're the only one I</seg><seg type="columnLine">want just now. My boys will stand guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">over this fine crew of yours until I've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">you [safely away.

Why didn't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay outside the clearing? They've got us</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded and--and you walk right in</seg><seg type="columnLine">too!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An expression of vast astonishment, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly changed to sheepishness, spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the faces of the newcomers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Potter laughed heartily. He motioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Harrigan with the automatic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Harrigan, come along. No time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-" _</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hesitated abruptly. A moment later</seg><seg type="columnLine">he swung his gaze to the dark rim of firs</seg><seg type="columnLine">which circled the clearing. A sudden alert-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness was evidenced by the carriage of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The new sound drew every eye. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes passed. A seventh man stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the light of the clearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harrigan, his eyes bulging, strangled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rage with effort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God! You too!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other grinned appreciatively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait a minute, Boss. Don't heat your</seg><seg type="columnLine">collar. I just overheard what you said</seg><seg type="columnLine">to these guys and I had a look-around.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There ain't a soul in these woods but what's</seg><seg type="columnLine">right here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harrigan's wizened face was a study of</seg><seg type="columnLine">transformation from one violent emotion</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its direct opposite. A vast delight</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindled in his eyes. He turned upon Potter</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a roar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A stall! Well,I'll be crucified! Potter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're good!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hard lines of the little man's face eased</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a great laugh. As his laughter ended,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes became beady and small again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his mouth twitched at the corners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Potter!" he snapped, defiantly ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vancing a step. "Why don't you take</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you want?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He advanced still another step.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Up-Stream</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">11.5</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I call your little bluff, Potter. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">come!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Potter came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stooping, he caught up the pail of drink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing water which stood close by, and dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">its contents over the neglected fire. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hiss and a puff of steam, the flames were</seg><seg type="columnLine">blotted out. The sudden extinguishing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glare which had been in their eyes mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentarily blinded the group. In this</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment of darkness, deepened by the over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging foliage which shut out almost com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely the dim light of the stars, Potter</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His spring carried him straight to Harri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan, who was now several paces in advance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his men. With the butt of his automatic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he rapped the little man gently but with</seg><seg type="columnLine">deft accuracy, on the head; and as the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumped into a limp heap, and before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest had regained their wits, picked up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light burden and carried it swiftly toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall of dark firs which surrounded them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gaining the seclusion of the forest, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">secured a fresh hold on the limp form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harrigan and swung him across his shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a slain deer. Then he started swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the wooded trail toward the river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Behind him he heard the thud of bodies as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others scrambled about in the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hoarse cries arose; orders were bawled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some lieutenant of the man on his shoulder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A rush of footsteps came along the trail.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Other and dimmer sounds came from the op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posite direction, where, Potter surmised,</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of the crew were following the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stepping behind a large fir trunk, he slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">his burden to ,the ground, and propped it</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the tree. He secured the hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">and feet with leather thongs from his pocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and placed a gag, fashioned from his hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kerchief, over the mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All about him now arose the calls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">curses of the men beating about in search</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him. With studied caution Potter stole</seg><seg type="columnLine">from tree to tree, the limp form of Harrigan</seg><seg type="columnLine">drooping over his shoulder. And when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chase had passed far beyond him, he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the trail, and thereafter his pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage to the fork of the river was surer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swifter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half-way, Harrigan regained full con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness. Potter set him down and tight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened the thongs and the mouth gag. On his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder again, the little man squirmed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">viciously; but Potter merely put a turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure on the thong-bound wrists, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggling was given over to sullen sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mission.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down the perilously steep bank he carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">his captive and dumped him unceremoni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously into the bottom of the launch. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he whirled the fly-wheel, cast off the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">painter from the bough, and sped down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow arm of water toward the open river.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the nose of the launch swung on to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river's breast, the first dim rays of the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pending dawn appeared in the east, far</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the tips of the towering firs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sitting in the stern sheets, Potter rolled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigaret, and when it was alight, settled him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self comfortably by the tiller, and guided</seg><seg type="columnLine">the craft in the direction of the mill wharf</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the town below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he sped down-stream, his mind crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">back over the events of the night; and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he remembered that a certain girl--just the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of girl he had dreamed about back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in those college days of his, in far-away</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Francisco--had called him afraid, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed softly, confidently, contentedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN the little back room of the mill</seg><seg type="columnLine">office, Potter sat guard over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner. Harrigan, the thongs at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wrists and ankles loosened and the gag</seg><seg type="columnLine">removed, lay sleeping fitfully in the bunk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In his shirt sleeves, puffing at his pipe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Potter sat close by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was roused suddenly from his revery</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the sound of light, rapid footsteps ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proaching along the board-walk which ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of the office building. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">footsteps halted, a key was fitted into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock of the office-door, and some one entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A faint, nervous tapping sounded on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door of the back room. Potter rose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightened the thongs of his prisoner. A light</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand tried the knob of the door, and finding</seg><seg type="columnLine">it locked, the owner of the hand retreated</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the office floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Potter slipped quickly into his mackinaw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlocked the door, and stepped into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of Miss Carleton.

That his wife had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tears in her eyes was a vexation, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a woman and to a woman tears were</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural.

Moreover, from his point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">view it were more fitting to die bravely in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open than save his life by hiding in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">trench or dug-out. Death, in other words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before dishonor. He lived up to the ideal</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had in mind and gained much credit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, during the Somme push, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than fourteen months of fighting--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      EVERY man, however brave, has</seg><seg type="columnLine">r * some especial form of weakness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       Kenyon's weakness, as revealed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a front-line trench one Summer evening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was peculiar but unimportant.

And to</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Hara indeed, to his decision and cool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, he owed his life, for O'Hara had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into No Man's Land under machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun fire and rescued him from the German</seg><seg type="columnLine">wire where he lay helpless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got over your excitement of yesterday?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked O'Hara.

The dug-out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged into darkness, rocked with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">concussion, Kenyon was hurled back against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the timbered wall, the floor seemed to rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">up under his feet and hit him, and he fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, his senses numbed, seeing nothing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing dully the echoes dying away and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the noise of earth falling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rose to his feet, shaken and swearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly, coughing as the dust settled on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs.

And no mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter what efforts he put forth, no matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">how hard he worked, single-handed he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not escape. Of that he was certain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To be rescued, he must be rescued from</seg><seg type="columnLine">above--or not at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stepped back and surveyed the pile of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones and earth that he had scattered at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorway.

He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done his best, and to what purpose? As</seg><seg type="columnLine">well might he try to demolish the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">dug-out as to clear a passage to the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. He was a prisoner until a party should</seg><seg type="columnLine">rescue him. And supposing the Germans</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to recapture the trench!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He laughed shortly. Then he remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered O'Hara and crossed the small dug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to where the wounded man lay on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed in the corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "O'Hara," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> O'Hara's face was like gray wax in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of the candle, his eyes were closed, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ups parted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "O'Hara, old man, how are you feeling?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But O'Hara neither moved nor spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kenyon, with a sinking heart, touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">him gently.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not as though he had died a soldier's</seg><seg type="columnLine">death, in the open and under the sky;</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Hara, brave and witty and happy, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">died--Kenyon's mind sought a parallel--</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a rat in a trap, in the darkness, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid. O'Hara, afraid! It was incredible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No one in the battalion had shown such</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckless gallantry as had O'Hara and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">to die as he had died, a prisoner in a Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man dug-out, and afraid! The thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kenyon whistled softly under his breath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And what chance of escape had he, him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self? The one passage to the air was</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocked. Would there even be air for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to breathe? He sniffed the close, rat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scented atmosphere. O'Hara had died like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rat in a trap! Was he not also trapped?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He shivered and a sense of depression, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror of he knew not what, stole over him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From where he stood, his back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the Dug-Out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*25</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">heap of debris, he could see the whole dug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, dimly lit by the candle: the walls of</seg><seg type="columnLine">perpendicular boards, the hanging gar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments--he wondered whether their lawful</seg><seg type="columnLine">owner were still alive, whether he were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner or still fighting--the shelves, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken table, the chair, the papers stained</seg><seg type="columnLine">with blood, the straw, the rifles, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed in the corner with O'Hara lying dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kenyon swore softly. It came to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a vague possibility that he too might die</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dug-out. Supposing his men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">all killed! Who would know then what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become of him?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as he brooded on what might hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pen, each moment feeling the sense of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression and dread growing within him, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard from a dark corner of the dug-out</seg><seg type="columnLine">where paper and books and straw had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered a faint scratching.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first he paid no heed. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scratching was repeated. Suddenly alert</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every sense, he waited, scarcely daring</seg><seg type="columnLine">to draw a breath lest he miss what might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be happening. Something was moving in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner of the dug-out where the shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ows were darkest. He could see nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he could hear some animal pattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the straw and papers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then two tiny beads of red fire ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared in the darkness. Kenyon backed</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall of the dug-out, and very</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly a huge pale-gray rat, mangy and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leprous, the biggest he had ever seen, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster with gleaming teeth and long</seg><seg type="columnLine">whiskers, came into the circle of yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">candle-light and sat watching him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kenyon gazed at the animal in horror.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And loathing such as he had never known</seg><seg type="columnLine">before gripped him. His one impulse was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stooping down swiftly, he seized a lump</seg><seg type="columnLine">of white chalk and threw it with all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength. His throw went wide of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark, the chalk crunched against the wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the rat turned leisurely and slunk into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">KENYON wiped the perspiration</seg><seg type="columnLine">from off his forehead. He felt sick</seg><seg type="columnLine">with nausea. Even though no mor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal eyes had seen him, he was ashamed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Excuses to justify his terror crowded into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind. A man, placed as he was, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner in a dug-out from which there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no escape, might well be forgiven for losing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his control. He was not frightened, of that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he was positive. Would one who could</seg><seg type="columnLine">face shell-fire unperturbed, as he could, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a matter of duty, be afraid because a rat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however big or however ugly--Kenyon</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuddered--was in the same dug-out?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Impossible! Nevertheless, when once again</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard the same stealthy rustling in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner, the same slow and cautious ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proach, he trembled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time the rat, if possible more re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsive and loathsome than before, ambled</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the dug-out, not in Kenyon's direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, but toward the low bed where O'Hara</seg><seg type="columnLine">was lying. It sat up on its haunches, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dog begging, its front paws bent, its gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose sniffing, its beady eyes red in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">candle-light, its naked tail twitching, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kenyon, breaking loose from the spell that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound him, made a sudden wild rush at it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How it happened, he could not tell, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rat avoided him clumsily and crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the bed. And to Kenyon the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">horrible part of it all was that the animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">all through never hurried, never showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest fear, never recognized the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he, the man, was his master.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  ''Come out, you devil!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fighting down the disgust that rose up</seg><seg type="columnLine">within him Kenyon picked up one of the Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man rifles that lay in the corner and thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly at where he thought the rat would be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "- you, you beast! If I get you,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll--I'll choke your life out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blind rage against his tormentor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken possession of him. Even if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">doomed never to escape, the rat would die.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For O'Hara's sake he, who had won the D. S.</seg><seg type="columnLine">0. on the battle-field, must conquer his fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A slight noise made him turn quickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The rat was in the corner in which it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">first appeared, watching him almost as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though--Kenyon would have sworn it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though amused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With a snarl of fury, losing his last rem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nants of self-control, he hurled the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">rifle across the dug-out. The rat squeaked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether in fear or from pain he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell, and Kenyon was alone with O'Hara.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he knew, he knew as surely as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been told, that his respite was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">for long. The rat would return, of course.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was something vindictive and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined in the way in which it slunk in</seg><seg type="columnLine">and out of the black shadows, something</seg><seg type="columnLine">cunning and diabolical that chilled Ken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yon's blood. Even for a trench-rat its</seg><seg type="columnLine">boldness was uncanny.</seg><seg type="columnLine">126</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Kenyon waited, his heart beating like a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">steamer's piston, his pulses throbbing,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">straining his ears that he might not lose the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slightest sound and hearing close at hand</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a scuffling and a thin squeaking, and far</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">away, above his head, the dull booming</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that he knew so well. His men were fight-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing maybe for their very lives, while he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">who would lead them gladly against the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">German trenches was sick with terror be-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cause a rat, a harmless, mangey rat, had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been imprisoned with him. He could have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cried for very shame's sake. And had he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not in his pride despised O'Hara but a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">short hour since because his nerve had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">failed him?' Who was he to talk now of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">manhood or courage, after this?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  All at once, with a gasp of horror, as one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plunged without warning into ice-cold</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">water, he became aware of a lean gray form</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slinking along the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Kenyon drew his revolver. He would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">make no move until he could see more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clearly, then a bullet would finish matters</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">once and for all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But, although he had intended not to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">take his gaze from off his enemy--to fire</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and miss would be too awful--some instinct</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">forced him to turn his head quickly. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">caught his breath and could have shrieked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aloud in sheer panic. On the floor beside</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the broken table were two more rats, gray</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and hideous like the first, but smaller.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They watched him with fierce eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Kenyon's hand and arm were shaking</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as he raised the revolver and fired. As in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a dream, he saw one of the rats flatten it-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">self out, reddening the floor with its blood,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">while the other scuttled to the shelter of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the straw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With the echo of his shot reverberating</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through the dug-out, Kenyon cocked his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">revolver and wheeled about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Then, his senses in a whirl, mad with fury</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and fear and nausea, he fired three times</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in quick succession. The big, dropsical</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rat, the abomination that was driving him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mad, sat like a vulture on the edge of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bed by the side of O'Hara's body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">AS HE fired Kenyon knew that he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was shouting incoherently: what he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said, whether the string of words</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">made sense, he neither knew nor cared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Splinters flew back as the bullets plowed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">â– 	into the thick planking, but the rat crawled</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over O'Hara's body and disappeared on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">far side of the bed, untouched and, even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">now, unhurried in its movements. Ken-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yon stooped down and fired under the bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, dazed and sick, stunned by a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">misfortune, Kenyon straightened up. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had one cartridge left and no more. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">pouch was empty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment there came to him the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild thought of putting his last bullet</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his brain and so ending his agony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But would it be ended? Could he, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">British soldier--and God, what a miserable</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimen of a British soldier--desert O'Hara</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, when he needed him most? Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Hara deserted him when he lay helpless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught in the German barbed wire? Would</seg><seg type="columnLine">it be fair to leave O'Hara, dead, and unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to defend himself? Was O'Hara any the</seg><seg type="columnLine">less worthy now that he no longer lived?</seg><seg type="columnLine">No, a thousand times! He would fight on</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he had always fought, coward though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">owned himself, unworthy though the enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be, until he could fight no longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kenyon had lost all count of time, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying O'Hara he had broken his watch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but what seemed an eternity of waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed before the rat reappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not alone. The snuffling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeaking behind the timbers had warned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kenyon of what he might expect. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">could a rat, even a trench-rat, war's most</seg><seg type="columnLine">loathsome product, summon help? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed wildly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They came on him suddenly. Almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he realized it he was fighting, laying</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him once more with the rifle, sweep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a wide circle from where he stood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he stopped, exhausted and despairing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What was the good?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some he had killed--one, two, three,</seg><seg type="columnLine">four--the others--seven of them--sat just</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of reach of his rifle, that clumsy Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man weapon, and watched him. The big</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray rat, the leader--Kenyon knew it must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the leader--was still alive. Its whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">attitude was one of mockery and scorn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It seemed to be sneering at him, daring</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to do his worst. It could not speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yet to Kenyon's tortured mind it said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can not kill me. Try again, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallant officer, and you will find that I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. I am too strong, too powerful, too</seg><seg type="columnLine">clever. Who are you, proud soldier, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strive against me? My time is coming. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can afford to wait. Can you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You fiend!" said Kenyon.

It seemed to say.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Was I not right, my fine gentleman? You</seg><seg type="columnLine">can not harm me! Hero you might once</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been, but now you are afraid!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, God!" said Kenyon. "Oh, God</seg><seg type="columnLine">pity me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then to his unutterable shame, for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved how very low he had sunk, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">small a man he really was, he found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was weeping, sobbing with fear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">misery, as though his aching heart would</seg><seg type="columnLine">break, even as O'Hara had sobbed after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell had broken his nerve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was this the end then? Must he die</seg><seg type="columnLine">like this, deep underground, surrounded by</seg><seg type="columnLine">rats, a prisoner, robbed of every manly</seg><seg type="columnLine">virtue he had possessed?

And with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness came terror such as he had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">known, a terror that was agony, a terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">that stole from him his last remaining shred</seg><seg type="columnLine">of self-respect and filled him with a blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire to shriek for mercy, to force his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of his prison at all costs, to pray, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">scream, or else to die quickly, before terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shaking all over, his very strength sapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">by fear, he fumbled through his pockets</seg><seg type="columnLine">lest perchance a piece of candle still re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained. He found only letters, letters</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his wife, letters he might have an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered, a pocketbook, a bank-note-case</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of French notes and some silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">francs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The scuffling and rustling and squeaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">was growing louder and more insistent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the coming of the darkness the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rats were bolder. Their smell sickened</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He struck a match, and holding it aloft</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrank from the sight that met his eyes--</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight, nine, ten--twelve--fifteen rats. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">light burned his 'fingers and went out, leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with him, as a last impression, the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">rat, the gray, scabrous beast, sitting on</seg><seg type="columnLine">its haunches not a yard away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH that desperation that is fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed beyond all endurance, Ken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yon fired his revolver: then dashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward blindly he kicked something soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flabby and stumbling over the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell with a crash on hands and knees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sharp teeth met in the fleshy part of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumb. He screamed aloud in insane</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic and hit out madly with his revolver.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as he dealt blows right and left in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness, still on his knees, sobbing like</seg><seg type="columnLine">some hysterical woman, he called to mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the memory of other days--such happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">days they seemed--when he, an officer in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Royal South Irish Fusiliers--long lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">of khaki with the bayonets dazzling in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunshine--had fought by the light of day</seg><seg type="columnLine">with human brings. Now, alone and far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from all help, a clumsy mountebank, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing stock, he fought with rats! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this last most terrible battle there would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be no quarter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Doomed to die--like a rat! Words of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire danced before his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like a rat! He hit out with savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy, cursing like any foul-mouthed</seg><seg type="columnLine">private--he, the poet, the scholar, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hero--and crawled slowly around the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving his enemy before him, feeling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fascination of horror the soft fur bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the slain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anon, exhausted, panting for breath, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered to his feet and groped his way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where O'Hara was lying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He must not desert O'Hara, of course.</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Hara had saved him from the Germans:</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would save O'Hara from the rats.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a virtue of what must be. Stay with</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Hara! How could he leave him? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of escape was there? He was doomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">--doomed to die like a rat, fighting rats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And after that there followed a lifetime</seg><seg type="columnLine">of horror. The blackness choked him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">enveloped him like a pall. His tongue, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strip of dried leather, clave to the roof of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mouth, the pit of his stomach seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunk and empty, cold waves of fear swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him, the blood thundered in his ears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes, open to their widest, ached with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain of trying to pierce the blackness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as he crouched beside the dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy, his hands moved to and fro, up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, ceaselessly, feeling in each direction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching from time to time O'Hara's thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">128</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">features or his hands or his body to reassure</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself that all was well. When, as often</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened, his fingers came in contact with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rat, loathing and terror would overwhelm</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and he would strike with his bare fists</seg><seg type="columnLine">or make a sudden grab and sometimes, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his horror, find himself gripping a strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gling, squirming, biting handful of fur and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nails and teeth. And never for one in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stant did the rustling and scuffling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">squeaking and pattering of feet cease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Never was he free from the knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">that behind his back the big, gray rats were</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching him, biding their time, exulting</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his degradation. He, who had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud, was in their power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then when flesh and blood could no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer stand the strain, when he felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">madness in grim earnest was coming, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit one of his last three matches. It splut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered and flared up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the foot of the bed sat the big, pale-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray rat, hideous and bloated, its eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinking with the knowledge of all evil, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed nose sniffing and turned this way</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that, its purpose unconcealed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The match went out and Kenyon, shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wild curses, made a grab at the monster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When, a little later he put the muzzle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the revolver to his head and pulled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trigger, the click of the hammer mocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his effort. The bullet he had meant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">save had been wasted. It was not his fate</seg><seg type="columnLine">to die by his own hand; he must fight while</seg><seg type="columnLine">life lasted. Did he not belong to the South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Irish, a regiment that had never yet given</seg><seg type="columnLine">in to an enemy? Was he to give in now?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And once more, his breath was coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">in deep sobs, he began the slow, groping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">circular movement with his hands, knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that on every side were rats, ten, twenty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty, forty--God alone knew the number</seg><seg type="columnLine">--surrounding him, closing in nearer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer, watching him with red eyes, licking</seg><seg type="columnLine">their Ups, certain of their prey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PRIVATE SULLIVAN clutched at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lance-Corporal 0'Grady's arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "WhistI What the divil's that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terence?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two soldiers halted and listened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dug-out in which they stood, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth in succession which they had entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">without going above ground, differed in no</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise from the others they had ransacked;</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was the same look of desolation, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same unwholesome smell of damp garments</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and decayed straw and rats, the same litter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of equipment and scraps of food on floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and table, the same untidy bedding on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunks built up, shipboard-fashion, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the other against the walls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the deep stillness of the other rooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this human warren, a stillness that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been broken only by the distant thunder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the guns, was gone.

These poor devils had fled at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first assault only to be overtaken. If a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few won clear to spread the alarm their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cowardice was partly atoned for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For weapons the scout retained his knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">and war-ax; for sustenance, a pouch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">parched corn which he munched as he ran.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For hours he sped through the interminable</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest before coming to a settlement. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">consisted of half a dozen new cabins on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stillwater Creek, erected a few months</seg><seg type="columnLine">before when it was believed that St.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clair's expedition would make the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He groaned in deep relief as a tall man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kentucky rifle in hand, emerged from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest cabin.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">settler 011 recognizing the forest dress of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scout dipped up a gourd of water from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pail and ran forward to meet the runner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes lighting wildly.

The gathering darkness short-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened his line of vision and forced him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessen his pace.

Hordes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of adventurers had come and gone up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the Ohio and Mississippi without</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving a trace, except as rusty bits of war-</seg><seg type="columnLine">harness and broken bones were sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">found in the forest mold. But such wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derers had come for gold and their impress</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the country was as transitory as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trails their feel had made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This small structure of laboriously hewn</seg><seg type="columnLine">logs spelled permanency, something to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">defended and fought for.

Falling on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his knees he swept his free hand over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor of hard-packed earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There ain't no one here," he whispered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dread of finding silent forms dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him. "Thank God! Some o' the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserters got through and fetched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">word."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now that he was in the cabin he became</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious of an awful thirst. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though his lungs would burst if he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not find water. He located a gourd but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was empty. There was a kettle in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fireplace, also empty. By the feel of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashes he knew the fire had died out a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve hours back. The occupants prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably had fled early that morning, warned</seg><seg type="columnLine">by soldiers who had deserted the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the battle. Next his exploring hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell upon a tiny moccasin, and he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">frantic parents were being handicapped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their flight by a little child. With peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">persistency for detail his mind instantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided the child was a girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But of drink there was nothing. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightened and bumped his head on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough shelf. His right hand flew to it at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once and he grunted softly as his fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed about a small, wide-necked bottle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hungrily tearing off the birch-bark cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his teeth he was rewarded by a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroma of whisky. He tipped the bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly but his lips remained dry. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled as well as disappointed. The bottle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was partly filled with something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">smelled of whisky. He shook it gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">and felt its contents move. Despite his</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate situation he took time to place</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottle on the floor and insert two</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers. He drew forth some kind of fruit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Placing it in his mouth he chewed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ecstatically, murmuring--"Wild cherries</seg><seg type="columnLine">put up in whisky, only the whisky's most</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He hastily placed several more of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little cherries in his mouth, intending to</seg><seg type="columnLine">finish the bottle, when a soft movement</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the cabin warned him he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarried too long. To the untrained ear it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been the beating of a night</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird's wing, or the almost inaudible foot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall of a wolf. But Bund interpreted it</seg><seg type="columnLine">correctly. Hastily tipping the bottle up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side down in his palm he caught the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served fruit and dropped it into a pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his hunting shirt. Then he drew his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife and stepped to the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A low signal rippled 'round the opening,</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling him the cabin was inside the circle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One or more savages had come to investigate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the small building. The scout stepped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left of the door so that his knife-hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have free play, and waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no further sound but he soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">discerned a dark object on a level with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and within a foot of him. A warrior</seg><seg type="columnLine">had thrust his head over the threshold.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The scout detected his suppressed breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. , Motionless and holding his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath he drew back the knife, hoping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage would withdraw and report the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted. The warrior made a guttural</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound and began sniffing curiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bund immediately guessed the truth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Miami had caught the scent of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">preserved fruit and the faint odor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whisky. He grunted joyously and stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the threshold his right hand falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Bund's face. He essayed to leap back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shriek of warning pealing from his lips,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Bund lunged fiercely. The savage</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to his knees, the knife buried in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">throat. Over the writhing body leaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scout only to run into the arms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">several Indians.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The shouts of triumph quickly changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the death-cry as the Miami stumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the body of the dead savage. A fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang up as if by magic, and by its</seg><seg type="columnLine">flare Bund read a fearful purpose in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferociously painted faces.</seg><seg type="columnLine">136</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kendawal" exulted one of his captors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seizing liis right hand and holding it over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blazing roll of birch bark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, yer dog!" gritted Bund and making</seg><seg type="columnLine">no effort to release his hand, but showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his contempt by spitting a cherry into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of his torturer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then in the Miami dialect:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If your chief's mother hadn't been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mohican you'd be running toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting sun today.

Her heavy gray overcoat</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been hastily pulled on and left un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">buttoned. Their late encounter had flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">it open to reveal a radiant vision of a golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress, its top flounce looped with row upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">row of expensive pearls. It was an evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress--and a dress incongruous with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">modest hat and the inexpensive gray coat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This much he saw and the girl spas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">modically jerked the coat closed and cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the telltale golden mass.

It was fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes after eight; Mullaney had said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be there at 8:30. Pretty Helen Mercer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mysterious golden dress were relegated</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the background of Tom's mind and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Detective Fleming fairly leaped into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcoat and ran down the steps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">H</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BY 11:30 Tom was willing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit that the pessimistic Mullaney</seg><seg type="columnLine">was right when he ventured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prediction that "nothing'll happen."

Mullaney swept on.

There's such a mob here, there's only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing to do. Make every one give an</seg><seg type="columnLine">account of themselves--make sure they</seg><seg type="columnLine">got a right to be here, then search 'em.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They'll crab their heads off too," he inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected grimly.

He was as alert as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloodhound on a criminal's trail. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing had happened at last. He was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">an actor in a real jewel robbery. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbelievably good luck!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A searching glance around the anteroom</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved it empty. The miniature forest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">palms concealed it from the view of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main ballroom; it was a pretty little am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bush, whose marble walls, draped in Chinese</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue velvet hangings had listened to many</seg><seg type="columnLine">intimate conversations. A wicker settee,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully limited to two, was the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">furniture. From this little retreat a side</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance led to the rear hall of the hotel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixing this door with his eyes, Tom flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself on the settee to follow orders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The babble of the ballroom had grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a hubbub which suddenly gave way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ominous hush. Tom could hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">host's voice explaining the loss of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">emeralds, interrupted hysterically by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited owner of the necklace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A guest's voice, no doubt assisted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astute Mr. Mullaney rather pompously</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposed that every one be searched in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to put their minds at rest, and offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself as the first candidate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon this the babble broke out anew</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Tom, his ears strained to miss no</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of this drama into which he was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly thrust, was wishing that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been assigned a position more in the midst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of things. He was even growing a trifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">resentful at Mullaney for putting him in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">neglected station when a stealthy footstep</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside on the marble floor caused him to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">prick up his ears terrior-fashion once more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then slip noiselessly behind an outjutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle of the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hand wormed whitely between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue curtains hanging in the archway, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed apart ever so slightly and a figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">slid into the room. For a moment Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened in silence to the frightened breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the intruder; then, before the curtain</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stopped its slight swaying he stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out to confront the fugitive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The surprise was fifty-fifty. He found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself staring blankly back into the terri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied gray eyes of Helen Mercer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long moment the young man could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do no more than fix his gaze speechlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the slim golden form outlined against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dull blue background of the curtain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl's face was chalky, so white that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray eyes seemed almost black in contrast</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the pupils spread nearly to the rim</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the iris. One hand was convulsively</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed to her pounding heart crushing the-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearls on the bodice regardlessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the sight of the young man the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles in her throat twitched spasmod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ically once, then she went so limp that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was afraid she was going to faint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Mercer! What are you doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom tried to make his voice severe but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sight of that drooping figure appealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him in spite of himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Strangely enough, after the first surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">the recognition of the young man seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to brace the girl. A long, slow shudder</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook her from head to foot, then she sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly galvanized into life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Fleming!

One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the high windows which looked out each</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the door, was entirely boarded up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from within; the glass panes of the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">glistened blankly in the moonlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the sinister appearance of the house</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl's face went white and she seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door with a half-formed idea of leaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and taking her chance in a foot-race</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the trees. Before this plan could</seg><seg type="columnLine">harden into resolution the blue car had</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept around to the rear of the place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here the trees pressed so closely on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building that their rustling branches scraped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wooden veranda overhead which dupli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated the one in front.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The machine abruptly slowed, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped. The driver killed the engine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to the tense girl beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, Blondie, now, if you'll be so</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind as to step out-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reached over and unfastened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch on the door, not appearing to notice</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl's involuntary shrinking as his sleeve</seg><seg type="columnLine">brushed her knees. Mutely she obeyed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Her necklace was gripped convul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sively in her hand until the settings cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the palm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two shallow steps which led to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">porch were ankle-deep with drifted euca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lyptus leaves. Everything spoke of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest desolation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man put his hand under the girl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">elbow courteously to help her to the porch--</seg><seg type="columnLine">his manner was irreproachable, they might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been at the St. Stephen. Even in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tension of the moment, the girl was cogniz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant of the startling picture they must make.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The moon sifting through the trees cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">black shadows on the porch below. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">traced the young man's profile against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark background of the door with cameo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like clearness, the black meeting arch of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyebrows causing him to appear more</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roman warrior-like than ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The white front of his dress-shirt gleamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the loosened muffler and the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">buttoned overcoat. He stood with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head bent slightly to one side as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">listening intently, the while his knuckles</seg><seg type="columnLine">beat a careless tattoo as one will do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mind half-abstracted from the business</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hand. Under his breath, as though by</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance, he was whistling the opening bars</seg><seg type="columnLine">of "La Paloma," slightly prolonging the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaintive minor notes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl had shrunk against the rickety</seg><seg type="columnLine">balustrade of the porch, her fascinated</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze fixed on the man's profile. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white flood of moonlight her hair took on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a frosty light, almost unearthly so pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold did it become. Her deep-set gray eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">became almost black in the shadow. Li</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gap of her coat the telltale gleam</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the golden dress flashed out, the sewn</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearls gleaming opalescently as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">claiming kinship with the moonlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twice the young man tapped in seeming</seg><seg type="columnLine">indifference, but the astute gaze of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl saw his head bend even closer and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brows became one unbroken line in impa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tience. The house apparently remained as</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted as before. Then, although she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heard no noise, the girl was startlingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware that other eyes were upon them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without changing her position in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest she shifted her eyes from the man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">face to the left side of the door. The door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">frame was a mass of intricate carving.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even as she looked the wind swayed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">branch of the complaining eucalyptus and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moonlight flooded the porch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was only for a breath's space but long</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for the girl to see that a portion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the door-jamb was missing--a narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">slot about six inches by two between a</seg><seg type="columnLine">couple of clumsy scrolls. Where it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the moon glistened upon the whites</seg><seg type="columnLine">of two eyes silently regarding them. Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, like two beady shoe-buttons, stuck in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door-jamb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl smothered the scream that rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her throat, but the palms of her hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">went cold and wet. There was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">so sinister in that silent, unblinking scrutiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the girl, sick with terror, was reaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the man's arm when the eyes vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the missing portion of woodwork</seg><seg type="columnLine">reappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">V</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE door swung slowly inward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The room was velvet black, save</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the moon sought out chinks</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed shutters and pointed long</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers through them to fall in</seg><seg type="columnLine">splinters on the bare floor. As the man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl stepped over the threshold a match</seg><seg type="columnLine">flared up, to show them a dark-faced man</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching it to the wick of a kerosene lamp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He replaced the chimney on the lamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">and taking it in his hand turned toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, his grotesque black shadow suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaping up the wall behind him until it shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-way across the shadowy ceiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the swift, shrinking glance the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung about the room she saw nothing more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than might have been expected from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside of the house. A stove, red with</seg><seg type="columnLine">rust, and propped under one rickety leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">with bricks, occupied one corner. A wood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">box, half-filled, grew on the eye out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows. From rude shelves, visible in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavering dusk came the metallic gleam</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pots and pans. Three old and scarred</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush-bottomed chairs intruded themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the flickering radius of the lamplight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tenant himself bore out the general</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance--a Portuguese farmer from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent evidence of his soiled checked shirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the mud-spattered trousers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No words passed between the two men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was evident that this scene had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">so commonplace as to be undeserving of</seg><seg type="columnLine">comment. The Portuguese held the lamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly aloof and walked ahead of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a door which gradually became visible</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the light moved across the bare room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other man turned to his companion</seg><seg type="columnLine">courteously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Straight ahead, Blondie, if you please."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a brief moment the girl fought a</seg><seg type="columnLine">loathing to venture further in that house</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mystery, then, realizing how little good</seg><seg type="columnLine">objection would do her, she nervously</seg><seg type="columnLine">moistened her dry lips and followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">will-o'-the-wisp of light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Portuguese had started down a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall as bleak and dark as the kitchen had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been, his heavy-soled boots making a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous clamor on the uncarpeted floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Midway up the hall he paused and</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening a door, stood aside to let them</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl caught her breath audibly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sudden contrast was startling, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">dramatic. It was a room magically con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jured out of Monte Cristo's palace and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitted up with the same kingly magnificence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The walls themselves were ebony--ebony</seg><seg type="columnLine">inlaid with the milky whiteness of mother-</seg><seg type="columnLine">of-pearl. Even the floor was of the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark wood, polished until it shone like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back of a Maratta shield. And this black</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendor was merely the casket to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">more marvelous the jewels it held.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By contrast the rugs on the floor ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to glow; rugs, which even to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">novice proclaimed their priceless lineage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No tawdry imitations these, anilin-dyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and acid-washed to deceive the infidel;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but silk rugs from Persia, made in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden age of rugs, their pile but lightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn and their mellow colors still unfaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">though five centuries had passed since slim</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown fingers had tied the Sehna knots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the amber light of the hanging lamps</seg><seg type="columnLine">above them their blue hearts seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsate with the very intensity of color,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the old lost Persian blue. The leafy</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrolls--for they were not of the pattern</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Sunni, that austere Mohammedan</seg><seg type="columnLine">sect, but reflected instead the freer Shiah as</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be seen by the topaz cartouches en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">closing Kufic inscriptions--appeared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sway as though stirred to life by a miracu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lous wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor was this all; the eye wandered be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the seven mica-shaded lamps swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the shadowy ceiling; strayed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throne-like chairs of ebony, fascinating</seg><seg type="columnLine">by reason of the unrelieving black velvet</seg><seg type="columnLine">cushions which turned them into sil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">houettes; and lingered enthralled upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vases which surrounded the room and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">11</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emeralds and Blondie</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">163</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed jewel-like out of the mellow dusk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here even the kindling shades of the rugs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were outdone; the effect was a symphony</seg><seg type="columnLine">in color--and such color as only an artist</seg><seg type="columnLine">De Quincey might dream.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pale jasper over carved gold; ruby;</seg><seg type="columnLine">sapphire; transparent violet over white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seme with golden stars; the glorious con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trast of purple and cobalt over foil and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper notes of ivory, black and orange--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matchless enamel of priceless cloisonnc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even before she noticed the occupants of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room the girl drank the background</seg><seg type="columnLine">in; not even her fear sufficing to deaden</seg><seg type="columnLine">her amazement. Then she became aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">that two men had ceased their low-toned</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation and, quietly alert, were re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garding her from the depths of the cush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ioned chairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her companion nodded carelessly to one;</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeted the other, wrapped in a dark green</seg><seg type="columnLine">silk lounging robe with a casual, "How are</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, Clieve?" and, still steering the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him, advanced to meet a figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">which now appeared between two heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">velvet curtains across the large room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A little surprise for you, Cleete," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke lightly, but there was a certain defer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence in his manner which did not escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl. "We have in our midst, Blondie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompanied by the Chetwynd emeralds."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In spite of the perilous position in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">she found herself the girl's eyes widened</seg><seg type="columnLine">in surprise as they took in the small, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">pudgy figure, the pale-colored hair, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mild inquiring blue eyes behind the thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses. That this was the cleverest "fence"</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Pacific coast seemed ridiculous. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been a divinity student, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">advertently wandered into an exclusive</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentlemen's club and a trifle incongruous</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his surroundings. His manner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeting the girl heightened this impression.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He turned again to the man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Didn't expect you tonight, Treviflion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Croix was in about an hour ago, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Trevillion laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ij expected to meet him but ran into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blondie instead.

With her words, the unreasoning</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope that Helen Mercer could explain the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently explainable, tingled through</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom's very finger-tips. She had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">home! If she had taken the emeralds she</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't have done that. Maybe she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been sincere in her agitation the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. Maybe Mullaney had overlooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the emeralds and they would yet be found</seg><seg type="columnLine">without implicating Helen Mercer. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">honest gray eyes hadn't lied--and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't think he was a soft-hearted fool!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The purple and gold rolled across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon again--once more the world was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lit by pale gold hair and the radiance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom was a little wild-looking. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressionistic Mrs. Sproule took a back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward step. She had heard of a case once</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a young man just Tom's age had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone suddenly mad and chased his aged fath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er up into an apple tree with a bread-knife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mrs. Sproule--" odd how much music</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be injected into that name--"where</seg><seg type="columnLine">does Miss Mercer work?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom fairly sang it and Mrs. Sproule eased</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself still further into the safety zone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hoyt &amp; Brainard's," she snapped, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door was closed on the enemy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night, at eight minutes to six, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowds who passed a certain corner on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grant Avenue were edified by the sight of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man stationed there, whose head</seg><seg type="columnLine">was apparently set on a pivot. Hoyt &amp;</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brainard's block-square store had two</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrances, one main one, leading upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Grant Avenue; the other, smaller, letting</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon an alley running along one side. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only when the six o'clock closing bell</seg><seg type="columnLine">rang and the main entrance had disgorged</seg><seg type="columnLine">its belated customers, that the gentleman</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the versatile head was able to cease his</seg><seg type="columnLine">double-barrelled watch and concentrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">his vision on the small door which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to trickle saleswomen, cash girls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">buyers and department heads.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He received several coldly questioning</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks when he started nervously after</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange young ladies--these were always</seg><seg type="columnLine">blondes, by the way--but he always re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuperated and came back to root again on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot which was beginning to be his</seg><seg type="columnLine">under squatter's rights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, among the last, she came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A hurrying little figure in the familiar gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat, and her white face went whiter than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever when she saw him waiting for her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young man plunged in, breathless</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the excitement gripping him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Mercer, I just had to come down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and meet you. I didn't know whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'd go home for dinner, you know, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I couldn't wait another minute." He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">tucked his hand under her elbow to help</seg><seg type="columnLine">her off the curb quite as though it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time he had done it. "I've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">on pins and needles to see you--after last</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, you know. You promised to tell me</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it--I'm curious, although I always</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew you hadn't taken the necklace."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he had known! Of course he had!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe he had pretended to himself that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had doubted her but down in his heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had known all the time that she hadn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken it. Why, you could bank every time</seg><seg type="columnLine">on gray eyes that looked straight at you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A girl like that couldn't do anything crooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">if she were to try!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Throughout the mad torrent of his speech</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl had let her glance drop to the side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk. A little pucker of indecision ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared between the slim golden brows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Twice she had started to interrupt and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked herself. Now she regarded him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a long silent scrutiny from the corners</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gray eyes. When she did speak it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was slowly as though she was having a hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to find the words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Fleming, I'm going to tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">something because I have no one else to</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to. In a way I owe it to you--I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">never be able to thank you for letting me</seg><seg type="columnLine">go last night." She gasped a little at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture her fancy painted. "It would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been terrible for me, because--you see--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did have the emeralds."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom never knew that he stopped still.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His legs ceased their motion automatically;</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brain too stunned to send out even</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflex orders. To the growing horror and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disillusion on his face she continued:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, please, wait a minute--I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">take them--not intentionally, that is. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know a thing about it until later.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll tell you everything, then I want you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell me what to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom automatically began to walk again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as she kept pace the girl talked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN she finished, the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's face was a study in conflicting</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotions. His voice was awe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck when he spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What a little brick you are, Miss Mercer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emeralds and Blondie</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep your head like that! Why, I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">I couldn't do as well--and I wanted to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">detective," he finished a little self-con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">temptuously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, no!" The girl almost winced from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his praise and the faint pink flowed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">her pale cheeks. "Any one would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done what I did. It was self-preservation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Fleming. I had to--to play safe," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained simply. "It was not until I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">right in the club, right before that terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cleete that I realized it all. Before then</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was like some horrible practical joke, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that man's eyes--they changed so--" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">shivered again--"I just grew sick all day</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking what might have happened if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they'd happened to find out they'd made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mistake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I pretended to be this Blondie, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course--I was afraid to ask any questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fear they would grow suspicious, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tried to remember all the man called</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trevillion had said about her and act up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it. I don't see now how I ever did it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The girl's hands were working nervously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As an automobile slid up behind her with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a low warning growl she jumped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrank closer to Tom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It seemed an eternity until I dared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away from that horrible house."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How did you get home?" Tom asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Trevillion drove me back in the car,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she answered without hesitation. "I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want him to know where I lived so I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the Kingsbury Hotel. It was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">late and dark when we got there, so I hid</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the entrance until he had driven away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I ran home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom was unable to hide his admiration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You clever little thing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl shook her head vigorously to hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">her embarrassment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Fleming, what shall we do? That</seg><seg type="columnLine">necklace is around my conscience like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">millstone. When the papers came out with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that long story about it this morning I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to run away and hide, I felt so</seg><seg type="columnLine">guilty. I could hardly bear to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">people--to come to work--but I had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">return that gold dress before they dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered it was gone. Oh, why did I ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">do such a silly thing as to wear it? Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">I don't know what to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got to turn the evidence over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police, I suppose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom's tone was reluctant. He would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have preferred seeing this thing through in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">story-book fashion. The detective hero</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the movies and the best-sellers invariably</seg><seg type="columnLine">works independent of the forces of law and</seg><seg type="columnLine">order who are introduced only to show up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hero's own superior methods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The suggestion appeared to fill the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">with alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No--oh, no! " Her voice was sharp with</seg><seg type="columnLine">protest. "Not the police--the whole thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come out then." In reply to his look</seg><seg type="columnLine">of involuntary surprise, her tone grew a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trifle calmer. "Don't you see, if the store</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered that I wore the gold dress</seg><seg type="columnLine">without permission I'd never be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get another position in this city. Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">please--Mr. Fleming--can't you think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other way?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was too much in league with his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret ambitions. Tom capitulated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">shameful alacrity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, of course there must be a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get the emeralds back without yelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the whole world about it. Other fellows</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done things like that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He scowled intently for a moment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only sound was the ring of their heels</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the pavement. They were walking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Farrell Street now, where the apartment</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses lined the blocks like enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">soap-boxes; their lighted windows appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as holes revealing a center candle. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fog was already topping the hill behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great red cathedral. The girl buttoned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">collar of her coat closer about her neck, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave eyes fixed on the young man's face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Say--I've got it--I think," Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawled at length, his tongue lingering</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the words while his mind flashed back</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the plan which was solidifying in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain. "It's kind of risky though. It'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">work if you had nerve enough to follow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but--look here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In his enthusiasm he tucked the girl's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm close within his own, his head bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to her pale gold hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll hire a machine--or maybe we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can borrow one--well, never mind that</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took a fresh grip on the arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look here. We'll go down there in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine, you and I, tonight maybe. We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive up to this place, taking care no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">sees me--can you drive a car? Fine," at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">nod. "You're supposed to be alone, see.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, you go in--we'll have to cook up some</seg><seg type="columnLine">excuse for you going there but that's a mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">detail--and while this Portuguese fellow's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">taking you in I'll climb up on that porch</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair you said ran along the back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house and get in a window--or some way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Meanwhile you're keeping this Cleete</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy talking in the club rooms so I have a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to sneak into the little room and</seg><seg type="columnLine">steal the necklace back. Then all we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do is make our get-away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waved his hand as if that was a mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">bagatelle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To his disappointment the girl was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">overwhelmed in ecstasy at this attractive</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It sounds rather vague," she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, of course I haven't worked it all</seg><seg type="columnLine">out yet--however if you want to chuck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole business, I guess Mrs. Chetwynd</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">can buy more-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, no--no." The girl shook her head</seg><seg type="columnLine">positively. "I was responsible for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necklace going out of the ballroom in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first place and I'm going to see that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are recovered. And--and--I'm afraid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell the police," she added in a whisper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well--I'll tell you what--I'll take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance alone. I can find the place by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">myself and I guess I'll get in somehow-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the girl interrupted him. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were almost indignant when she looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">back at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As if I'd let you do all that dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">work alone," she exclaimed in loyal scorn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I guess it could be done, if I had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage," she reflected slowly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course it could," Tom pointed out</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly. All the romance in the world was</seg><seg type="columnLine">singing to him now. "It's simple but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there's its strength. I'm sure we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away with it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But the necklace is in the safe. Cleete</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked it up. How would you get at it?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, gee, that's right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom was crestfallen. Again nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke the muffled silence of the fog but</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own ringing footsteps. Then his</seg><seg type="columnLine">resourceful mind found the solution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If we had a cracksman--a regular safe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">opener, we could do it. You know--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy Valentine stuff of sand-papering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger-tips and working the combination.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've got a friend who can, maybe, get me</seg><seg type="columnLine">one for a night." Tom spoke as if cracks-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men could be rented like taxies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl still looked doubtful, but Tom's</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination was working on all six cylinders</seg><seg type="columnLine">now and was unstopable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say, I'll bet any amount that we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">call the trick. I'll bet that Mrs. Chetwynd</seg><seg type="columnLine">has her little old emeralds back by the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">after tomorrow and we pinch the whole--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we arrest the lot. It'll be a big feather</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my cap and it'll pull Mullaney out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deuce of a hole--I ought to do this much</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Mullaney," he said virtuously. "By</seg><seg type="columnLine">George, I will. Miss Mercer, you don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to worry a bit.

Not a splinter of light shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the shutters.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">boarded-up window in the room adjoining</seg><seg type="columnLine">the safe was more direct, but infinitely</seg><seg type="columnLine">more risky. Here the fog was so dense that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could just make out the headlights</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the machine stopped on the path before</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.

Not a sound had escaped, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the young man's excited imagination,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own breathing sounded like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistling of the Overland Mail. Below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl still hummed her plaintive little air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand pressed tightly to her pounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he reached the branch where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracksman perched, Tom was aware that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door below had opened and Helen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mercer had disappeared. The rotting ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anda stretched before them, piled high</seg><seg type="columnLine">with many years' accumulation of fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves. Tom was grateful for the drenching</seg><seg type="columnLine">fog which had made them sodden. On a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear dry night they would have rustled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crackled like so much tissue-paper under</seg><seg type="columnLine">their feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A row of shuttered windows stared back</seg><seg type="columnLine">sullenly at them, mute testimony of the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospitable days when each had sheltered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a guest and the house had been the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">of social life for the surrounding ranchos.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    very veranda slouched in a furtive way</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a spineless fellow who resents the</seg><seg type="columnLine">memories of more respectable times; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">however rotten the floor, the honest beams</seg><seg type="columnLine">held true.

To jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very stronghold of his high-class com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petitors; to outwit them by the clumsy</seg><seg type="columnLine">methods they despised--it was his idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the most exquisite humor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The long unused window started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">protest audibly at this midnight disturbing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its slumber but after being soothed by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few drops from Honest Bill's oil-can it slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothly open and they slipped over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sill into the room beyond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two men melted away from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous square of light and stood silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment, listening. Apparently the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole upper floor was unused; at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">that part which faced the outside of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. It was as Helen had guessed, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart of the building was used in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep up, to the passer-by, the camouflage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its one isolated tenant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They felt their way noiselessly around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark room to where instinct told them a</seg><seg type="columnLine">door should let on the upper hall. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">room was semi-furnished in the style of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the '6o's. A walnut highboy, bare of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">trinkets caught Tom a nasty crack on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">knee and a dark mass in one comer, peril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously like an unusually tall man, sent his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand jerking back to his hip-pocket until</seg><seg type="columnLine">his straining eyes told him that it was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a roll of carpet propped against the wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came the soft scraping of a key</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a long-unturned lock and the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow caught his breath nervously as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped into the hall beside the cracksman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The blood was tearing through his veins at</seg><seg type="columnLine">an alarming rate.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered if Helen had this same oddly</seg><seg type="columnLine">detached feeling. The thought of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadied him and made him realize the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity of it all. For Helen's sake as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as their own they must find the emeralds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and get away quickly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hurry--hurry."

His eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerked to the cracksman motionless beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the safe except for his long twisting fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">which turned the combination with in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessant patience, his ear flattened to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock to catch the faint click of the mechan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ism as it fell in place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A very agony of helpless impatience</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized the young man at the sight of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouching figure, apparently accomplishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing while the precious minutes went by</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the girl played her dangerous game</seg><seg type="columnLine">unaided in the room beyond. He plunged</seg><seg type="columnLine">his twitching hands deep in the pockets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his coat, grateful when they found and</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed about the handle of the automatic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now once again the romance of the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">had faded, leaving a terrible fear in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead.

Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulped and took himself severely in hand;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would never do to have a fit of nerves</seg><seg type="columnLine">now.

Cleete had left the little group</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was walking stright across the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward him. For one terrible moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">the young man stood spellbound, unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak or give warning to the unconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracksman behind him; hardly daring to</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe that those enlarged blue eyes behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thick lenses had not glimpsed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the slit in the curtains. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware that Helen Mercer's stricken face</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken notice of Cleete's departure and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own anguished emotions seemed but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">continuation of her own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not until Cleete was half-way</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the room that the spell was broken.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom took two steps back to the kneeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick--hide.

Cleete, everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">else wiped from his mind by this tragedy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one of his precious vases had turned his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back upon the little room and was fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">racing back to the ruin she had wrought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine--oh, fine!" some one inside of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom's body seemed to be applauding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl's act; some one who appreciated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dramatic side of this breath-taking situation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the cold-blooded critic was screamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down by the rest of his mind.

Watching his chance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he dared, the young man reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and switched off the tail-light, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others had already sighted them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore down at terrific speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few late machines were passed, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a narrow margin; one driver yelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">angrily and swinging his car sharply into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dirt as they grazed his fender.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Evidently they were being taken for a joy</seg><seg type="columnLine">party with more of a capacity for liquor</seg><seg type="columnLine">than caution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Helen was kneeling on the floor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonneau, her eyes glued to the lights of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oncoming machine, while she yelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">their progress to Tom, having to put her</seg><seg type="columnLine">face close to his shoulder to make her voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry over the rushing of the wind. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other car, with Trevillion at the wheel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Cleete and the man Clieve in the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat, bore down on them along the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">highway like some fire-spouting monster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At San Bruno, another machine, bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same direction, loomed before them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tom took a desperate chance.

On the highway</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crooks would not have dared to fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">for fear of drawing undesired attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon themselves.

A quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope rose in Tom's heart that the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine would be halted by that long</seg><seg type="columnLine">string of freight cars. He stepped hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the throttle and the car bounded over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tracks, grazed by the descending gates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little cry was wrung from the girl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then came a groan from the cracksman</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the other car suddenly appeared in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fierce headlight of the puffing engine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashing through the gates as if they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been so much tissue paper, bits of broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass and splinters of white wood dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dazzling light of the lamps.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now Tom hit it up until the speedometer</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the 60 mark.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Helen made a discovery and yelled it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom. From their superior altitude she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see the pursuing car; catching</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpses as it rounded the curves after</seg><seg type="columnLine">them--not more than this--a light was</seg><seg type="columnLine">following them, coming with a speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">which matched and surpassed either of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Police," screamed Tom in explanation</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stepped on the throttle harder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Around curves he was fairly safe, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuers, uncomfortably close now, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not take good aim; but a long level stretch</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the top of the grade appeared and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer a rain of shot struck the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind them.

One of their rear tires had blown</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. The car careened madly to the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the young man threw all his strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">to straightening the wheel. From right</seg><seg type="columnLine">to left and back she swung; their rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels defining a perfect half-arc. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he realized with a sick horror that the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels were hanging over space--seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hang there for a terrible eternity, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car slowly toppled over and Tom's last</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious thought was a feeling of mild</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise that there was no echoing crash;</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing but a swimming blackness and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd numbness in his arms--and oblivion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of the blackness grew a star, an odd</seg><seg type="columnLine">green star which slowly turned golden and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled with frightful speed on one point.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A deep voice somewhere was repeating,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"making it rich and like a lily in bloom,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was so obviously ridiculous when</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken in connection with everything else</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his eyes fluttered open. For a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment his thoughts were entirely concerned</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the other stars--there were millions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, all crowding and elbowing each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other for room in his bedroom ceiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he became slowly aware that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wretchedly cold; that what should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been his bed was oddly hard and stony</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and that his bedroom ceiling was really</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sky. After that memory rushed back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was shaken, slightly nauseated, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">miraculously alive. Close beside him, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one was crying softly and repeating his</seg><seg type="columnLine">name. He made an effort to lurch upright,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimly conscious of a stabbing pain in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">side; and found himself looking unsteadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Helen Mercer's eyes. The girl's hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">was tumbled over her shoulders in a pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold mass; her eyes shone with tears in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">starlight. Tom's eyes traveled jerkily</seg><seg type="columnLine">down her little satin evening dress, liter</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally torn to ribbons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You--you're hurt?"

Malaria, spirulam, black water, and sleeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickness are the principal diseases. In case you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not familiar with these I will explain briefly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking it for granted that you know what ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">laria is.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Spirulam is given to man by the bite of a tick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">produces a fever very like malaria, but quinin has</seg><seg type="columnLine">no effect; it lasts some time and knocks you out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the patient usually very weak, but never</seg><seg type="columnLine">have I heard of it being fatal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Black water is violent inflammation of the kidneys</seg><seg type="columnLine">(it is a matter of dispute whether black water is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">result of excessive malaria or not) resulting in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">urination of blood (hence the name). Very often</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatal as the patient dies of heart failure. Medicines</seg><seg type="columnLine">are calomel and purge thoroughly (stop quinin), and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much champagne and brandy as the patient will</seg><seg type="columnLine">take with the object of keeping up the heart's</seg><seg type="columnLine">jtfction, on which everything depends. If you get</seg><seg type="columnLine">'black water once and get over it my advice is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear out of the country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sleeping sickness is given by the bite of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tsetse fly' (rather like a horse-fly with the wings</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed). First produces a slight fever, headaches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">etc., and perhaps vomiting, afterward affects the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous system with the result that patient becomes</seg><seg type="columnLine">restless, irritable and indifferent by turns until</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally he lapses into a coma--deep--attendant with</seg><seg type="columnLine">anemia and a general wasting away. There is no</seg><seg type="columnLine">cure yet discovered. The percentage of these flies</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the germ in them ready for business is reckoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be about two per cent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But still don't run away with the idea that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country is fatal. I've lived there and the only thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">I collected was malaria and not much of that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> (2)	From a general African point of view it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly wooded. That is compared to the Congo</seg><seg type="columnLine">forests the forest there is slight and variable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There are uplands with open rolling country and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrub.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> (3)	Game (large) is fairly abundant but varies</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly. Stretches without game at all and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">other parts extremely thick--of both sorts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  (4)	No, you cannot reckon on living off the coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try.

Doyle, Toronto, Canada.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Answer, by Mr. Solomons:--I am glad you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested in dog traction. It is really quite a fas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cinating subject.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The terms "Eskimo dogs," "huskies" and "mala-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mutes" are used interchangeably by a good many</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. The Eskimo dog is the native dog of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arctic and Behring Sea coasts, and may be either a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ask Adventure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"malamute" or a "husky." The malamute is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolf-fox-coyote--"outside" dog--a combination of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some or all of these (though some people deny the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fox ingredient) which both the Northern Indians in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alaska and Canada and the Eskimos possess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The name is that of the Malamute (variously</seg><seg type="columnLine">spelled) Indians. He is a black, black and white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brindle, or gray or gray and white dog with more or</seg><seg type="columnLine">less small, pointed, stiff ears and pointed muzzle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He has more or less hair on his toes and in all parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually lacking that protection in the ordinary dog of</seg><seg type="columnLine">southern climes. The hair is downy or furry dose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the skin. He is a critter of considerable variety</seg><seg type="columnLine">of appearance in other respects than as to these</seg><seg type="columnLine">common features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The husky, on the other hand, is a more or less</seg><seg type="columnLine">pure descendant of the timber-wolf and a good speci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of hide can not readily be distinguished from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of a wolf. He is larger than the ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indian or Eskimo dog, in proportion as the latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">differs from him in the amount of wolf strain. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">isgray, with almost-black long hairs, which are more</seg><seg type="columnLine">abundant and longer on the ridge of the back, giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a much darker color when looked down upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">than in a side view. The belly is much lighter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes almost white. He is mottled, or rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaded to some extent, and the whole appearance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pelt is that of a fur. The under side of the neck,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the belly, is light gray or whitish. The best</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimens came from the mouth of the Mackenzie</seg><seg type="columnLine">River.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The natives use the "Siwash' ' harness. There is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">band 'round the neck, passing between the forelegs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one band rising thence on each side, across the ribs</seg><seg type="columnLine">diagonally and coming together at the saddle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back where the two are joined by another connect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with the back of the neckband. The three bands</seg><seg type="columnLine">are brought together, as stated, at the back and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">single trace runs back to the sled or joins another</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar trace from the dog's mate at a distance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">several feet and the two, united in one, go back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sled. It is a poor arrangement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The white man's dog harness consists of a collar</seg><seg type="columnLine">made in much the same way as a horse collar, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two traces are similarly attached. At the sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are held in place by a back strap with a broader</seg><seg type="columnLine">part above and snapping under the belly. There is</seg><seg type="columnLine">no breeching, of course. The two traces often are</seg><seg type="columnLine">united a few feet back of the dog.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This is, in fact, the usual plan with light running</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment, but the more careful dogmen and those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who freight loads use a singletree at the back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the traces. This is united to the central draw-rope</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a two or two-and-a-half-foot line. Sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">these use a kind of doubletree which crosses the</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw-rope and is fastened to it. In short we drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogs much as a team or several teams of horses are</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven, and by the use of a good many German</seg><seg type="columnLine">snaps (Arctic drivers probably call them by some</seg><seg type="columnLine">other name, now) the harnessing and unharnessing</seg><seg type="columnLine">is quickly done, or the position of the pairs of dogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly altered. Two and two is the usual way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one leader ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The collars (neck collars) of the dogs are attached</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the doubletree or lead rope a foot or so ahead by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">light line of suitable length so as to prevent the dogs</seg><seg type="columnLine">from running sideways and getting too far away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the line. The Siwash harness is not efficient,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and added to the clumsy native sleds makes the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tmlling power of the dog in actual load hauled much</seg><seg type="columnLine">ess than with the white men's teams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">191</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Their capabilities regarding loads can only be</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressed, of course, in terms of comparison with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of other draft animals, and as you are probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">not familiar with reindeer we will speak of horses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Either a dog or a horse can, of course, keep almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">any amount of load moving on glare ice, once the</seg><seg type="columnLine">load is started. But on a level, hard, snow trail at</seg><seg type="columnLine">moderate temperatures, say zero or a bit wanner</seg><seg type="columnLine">and especially if there is a little sun on the trail a</seg><seg type="columnLine">team of dogs each averaging seventy-five pounds in</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight will keep a load moving all day that weighs</seg><seg type="columnLine">three limes the weight of the dogs. This feat</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes him, I should say, the most wonderful draft</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal we know anything about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The best I ever got out of horses--and I handled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred picked animals one Winter under various</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions--was about nine tons per six-horse</seg><seg type="columnLine">team, on a similar snow trail. The horses averaged Q</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade under one thousand five hundred pounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">apiece, so they drew about twice their own weight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they couldn't keep it up the way the dogs do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under less favorable trail conditions and in colder</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather the dogs will average twice their own weight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and under almost any conditions on a broken trail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and day in and day out, twelve and fourteen hours a</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, up hill and down dale, they will lug their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight. On the Arctic we feed them a half a dried</seg><seg type="columnLine">salmon every night and on hard work a bit also at</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon. A pound to two and one-half pounds a day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">depending on the dryness of the food, the size of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog, the coldness of the weather, etc.--that is about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ration. A horse "packs" better than a dog,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The natives break in the pups by letting them run</seg><seg type="columnLine">along at first, and then tying them to the sled, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first behind, then alongside of their mother or father</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the team. They soon begin to pull from imita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and from a natural pup-desire to go faster and</seg><seg type="columnLine">see what the next turn of the trail will develop in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of interesting or eatable sights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The team is guided entirely by the leader who lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tens for "gee" and "haw," "mush" (get-up) and</seg><seg type="columnLine">"whoa." I had a leader that I trained to "gee-a-</seg><seg type="columnLine">little." It had come to be a nuisance to "gee," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">have him turn too much to the right and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">"haw" him back part way (a stupid dog will haw</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear back and then some, but a sensible one will get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea). So when I wanted him to veer off a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">points, as a sailor would say, I added the "a little."</seg><seg type="columnLine">If I wanted a right angle turn I said, "gee," and if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to turn clear round I said, "gee-round."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have no doubt you could get a dog-tcam from</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper Canada. It would be too uncertain and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pensive to get a team from the Yukon or Alaska.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A good sleigh dog is usually worth fifty to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred dollars, but very fair ones can be bought</seg><seg type="columnLine">for much less. It depends on when, where and how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purchase is made. In the Spring dogs are</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally cheaper than at the beginning of Winter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course you can get work in Alaska, just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">anywhere else.
