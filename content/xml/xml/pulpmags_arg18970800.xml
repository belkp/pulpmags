            <seg type="columnLine">HE narrow trail wound up the mountain side like a brown ribbon,</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">writhing in and out among the huge boulders and clumps of sturdy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">timber, now skirting the verge of a sheer precipice, anon following the dry</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bed of some torrent. Far above toward the azure arch towered the snow</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">clad peaks of the Andes ; below, the depths of the verdant valleys were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">almost lost in the haze of distance.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The tinkle of a silver bell was all that disturbed the silence of the day.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Around a rugged spur of the mountain came a pack train, the like of which</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">First appeared the awkward, camel-like face of the leading pack animal--</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a great llama, with a silver bell fastened to a strap about its throat. By the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">odd creature's side trotted a half naked Indian lad, with the leading strap in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his hand. Then one by one followed nearly a dozen smaller llamas, each</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with a pack strapped on its back. Two Indians walked beside them, while</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the rear of the procession was brought up by three individuals dressed in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">half native, half European costume of white travelers. Two were young</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">men, both sturdy of limb and of pleasing presence ; the other was a short,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">' ' squatty' ' fellow with flabby cheeks and little, twinkling, pig-like eyes,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">almost hidden in layers of flesh. He was well along toward fifty and when</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He was a tall, black haired man of twenty five or so, well built and athletic,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and with a sharp, penetrating eye. He was so dark that he made an ex-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"That's hall nonsense, sir," declared the trader, with some emphasis.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Them yarns are just to play hoff on strangers. Nobody but a Dago would</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" Not Hi ! " cried Fitch, with emphasis. " They say these 'ere Hinjuns,"</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and he pointed contemptuously at the half naked llama drivers, " was once a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" 'E was another of these Dagoes, I suppose," said Fitch, who might be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rather shaky on history, but had all the average Englishman's contempt for</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">"You can't convince Mr. Fitch, Ford," interrupted his friend. "That's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">impossible. Nothing but the actual sight of an Inca treasure house would</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I'll risk 'em," said Ford. " I'm bound to get some fun during my va-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cation. If it's going to be a brush with wild Indians, why let it come.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Goodness knows, after boning down at a desk in Callao for eighteen months</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">steady, I ought to stand a little excitement."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Pooh ! pooh ! " exclaimed Fitch. " You young men don't believe hall</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Fitch," said Keeth, " you're the most unbelieving man I ever saw."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" He's worse than that," cried Ford. " It's abominable. Remember,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">we're out for a holiday--at least, / am. Don't try to break down our faith</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in all the romantic traditions of the country. L,et us believe in the descend-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ants of the Incas themselves who, they say, inhabit the upper plateaus of the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Nonsense ! nonsense ! " declared the trader, with some heat. " We're</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in as wild a part of the Sierras now as a white man cares to go. There's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nothin' but mountains hand wild beasts to the north of us. Hi've been</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hover this trail dozens of times an' Hi never even saw one o' them Hinjuns</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">you're talking about. Hit's all a bloomin' booger story."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" If there'd been any truth in it Fitch would have been trading with them</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">before this," interposed Keeth drily.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" That's so," said the trader. " That's just what I would-"</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At that instant the steady jangling of the bell on the leading llama ceased.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The pack train came to a sudden stop, the animals crowding upon one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">another in the narrow path.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The trail ahead was hidden by a towering spur of rock. From beyond</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">this obstruction came the loud clash of voices and the trampling of feet.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" What's up? Another pack train ? " demanded Ford.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Fitch started forward, but before he had rounded the head of his train the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sound of voices had increased to a roar, above which the strokes of metal</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">upon metal were plainly audible.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" A fight, by Jove ! " cried Ford, and he started on a run up the trail.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But Keeth passed both of them before they reached the spur of rock. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">unslung his rifle as • he ran and when he rounded the obstruction held the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">weapon at a " ready." •</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The scene which met his gaze was a most startling one. On the narrow</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">trail above him a group of nearly a score of Indians were struggling, and the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">victim of their wrath was a single individual who stood at bay with his back</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to the rocky wall. The Indians were fairly falling over one another in their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">furious endeavors to thrust the imperiled man through with their spears.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He was a slight, lithe man--a Spaniard Keeth was sure at first glance--</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">4</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A PERUVIAN PARADISE.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">and his remarkable activity was all that had saved him up to this point. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was bleeding badly from several wounds, but was dexterously catching most</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of his enemies' thrusts upon a round rawhide shield attached to his left arm.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">With his own spear (it seemed his only weapon) he was doing no little dam-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">age to his foes. One lay face downward at his feet, quite dead.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The Indians themselves were plainly of a different tribe from those who</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bore the llama train company. They were a fiercer people--that was evident ;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and they were taller and more sturdy. Their soled sandals rattled on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rocky path and they fought like furies. The outcome of the uneven battle</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could not have long remained in doubt.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">These facts Keeth saw at almost a glance. He shifted the rifle from his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">arm to his shoulder in a trice and the crack of the piece rose above the shouts</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the savages. He had purposely aimed high, and the bullet splintered the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rock above their heads. They ceased their onslaught and fell back at once,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">turning their angry faces toward this new antagonist.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At the same moment Ford and the trader appeared beside Keeth, both</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">equally well armed. The Indians were evidently cowed by the appearance</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the Europeans with rifles in their hands. While they hesitated, the man</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whom they had attacked suddenly leaped out into the trail and ran at break-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">neck speed toward his rescuers.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The Indians started in pursuit, but both Keeth and Ford Kinsale raised</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">their weapons, and, instead of keeping on, the natives wheeled and scattered</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">among the rocks, evidently expecting a volley from the guns. In a moment</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they were out of sight, and their victim, covered with blood and well nigh</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">exhausted, fell into Keeth's arms.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Chapter II.--"Will You Go?"</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" What about your booger stories now, Fitch?" demanded Ford, as he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">assisted Keeth to place the wounded stranger on the ground.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But the trader, leaving his two Companions to care for the victim of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">pedition through Arizona and New Mexico before his twenty first birthday,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and had learned in those cattle raising countries something of the value of a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thirty foot rope. The instant he saw the stump he saw as well a way out</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the present difficulty.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He caught up the coil of hemp, made a running noose, and planted</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his feet firmly 011 the edge of the water, preparatory to making a cast.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" If the rope's long enough to reach, and that old stub holds, we're all</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">right," he thought, as he swung the coils about his head.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was a long cast, and the loop did not fall over the stub at the first or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">second trial ; but Keeth was delighted to see it drop just where he wanted</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it to the next time. However, when he had drawn it taut, he found it so</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">short that he could not fasten it at the side of the inlet, and he had to shout</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for his companions to help him. Ford and the Englishman came running</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with their rifles in their hands, fully believing that he had been attacked by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Indians ; but they forgave him for disturbing their morning nap when they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">discovered what he had done.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Hit's a great 'ead you 'ave, Mr. Keeth," declared Fitch. " Hi'd never</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thought of it."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" But will the stump hold?" asked Ford Kinsale.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" We'll all get hold of the line and try it," replied Keeth. "We know</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the rope is all right. If it holds, I'll cross over and help you fellows</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">across. ' '</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The stub proved to be firmly set in the ground, and without waiting for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">breakfast Keeth removed his clothing and prepared to make the passage of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the river. He wrapped his garments in his blanket, swathed his gunlock</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in oily rags, and slinging both bundle and weapon over his shoulder, plunged</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into the water. Ford hung to the end of the rope and steadied him, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">although Keeth's feet were almost immediately swept from beneath him, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">managed to reach the opposite shore without serious difficulty. He hurried</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into his damp clothing and helped Fitch across, and then flung the rope back</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to Ford and, with the trader's assistance, drew his friend, and the provisions,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over the flood.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Well, I pray heaven we won't have to cross another such place,"</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Kinsale panted, as they drew him to land. "I'm not half as anxious to see</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the Incas' cave as I was when poor Jose was telling us about it."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"I thought you were looking for lots of excitement this vacation," said</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Keeth slily.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Oh, we're having too much fun," declared Ford ruefully. " I didn't</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">know what I was talking about. If ever I get back to Callao I shan't ask</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for another vacation for ten years. ' '</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">They marched along the shingle for some miles further, fortunately finding</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it good traveling all the way ; but it was nearly noon before they reached what</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A PERUVIAN PARADISE.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">seemed a promising path to the top of the cliffs. The foot of this trail was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">extremely rugged, but it looked better above, and with Keeth in the lead</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they started up. Before they had climbed fifty feet the path became quite</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">easy to follow. In fact, it showed the baud of man in its construction.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was a gradual incline, extending along the face of the bluff, becoming</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wider and wider as they mounted upward. There were marks of great</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">chisels where slabs of the soft rock had been split off, and while still a hun-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dred feet or more from the summit, the adventurers reached a place where</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the ancient constructors of the road had used the waste material to build a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">substantial wall, four feet or more in height, along the outer edge. Here</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the way was broad enough for four men to walk abreast. The mortar which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">held the stone in place was still as hard as adamant. The rocks themselves,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in fact, instead of the mortar, had crumbled with age.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" What do you think of such engineering as this ? " demanded Ford.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"It is wonderful!" declared Keeth. " This must have been built three</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hundred years ago--possibly at a still more ancient date--yet the best work</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of civilized peoples today cannot surpass it. What giants those old Incas</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">must have been, for they had few tools to aid them. This was all done by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sheer bodily strength. They had 110 hoisting apparatus.".</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Hand do you mean to say them Hinjuns did this ? " cried Fitch.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"They certainly did," replied the engineer. "Probably the road was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">built about the time that Pizarro conquered the country."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Fitch shook his head over it.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"They must 'ave been a deal different from the niggers Hi've been used</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">They were still more astonished when they had gone some rods further.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">On rounding a corner in the precipitous wall they found that the ancient</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">workmen had tunneled a spur of rock to reach the summit of the cliff. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tunnel was a dozen yards in length and opened out upon the plateau on top</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the bluff. And right before the mouth of the tunnel were the ruins of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">several stone houses, built against the side of the mountain.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" An ancient town--almost like the cliff dwellings I've seen in Colorado."</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">declared Keeth. " Jose told us nothing about this. I wonder how far we are</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from the town of the Indians among whom he was a captive ? I only</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hope-"</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He broke off with a startled exclamation. On the verge of the cliff, a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">few rods from the old tunnel, was the figure of a woman. She stood in a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">listening attitude, but with her face turned away from the white men.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Evidently she had heard their voices, but had not discovered from which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">direction there were approaching.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">She was an Indian girl--almost a child in appearance--as lithe and grace-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ful as a deer. Her skin was of a brilliant bronze hue, and a great mass of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">coal black hair hung to her waist ; her head was guiltless of other covering.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">She was dressed in a tunic-like garment which fell below her knees and was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">open at the throat, displaying the full roundness of her bosom. A broad</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sash of strange texture and brilliant hue held the garment together at her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">waist. Her feet were shod with sandals, over her shoulder was slung by a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">thong a quiver of arrows, and she held a short bow in her hand. In Keeth's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">startled vision she seemed a Diana in bronze.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He was speechless with amazement ; but Ford and the trader, noticing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the abrupt termination of their comrade's sentence, glanced up also. A sharp</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">exclamation from the Englishman made the girl turn. She saw them, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wonder filled her face. Her great eyes, black as night, gazed deep into</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Keeth's own. Even in that brief instant he felt the magic of her glance.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But she remained motionless only a moment. Like a flash she fitted an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">arrow to her bow and a wild, bird-like call burst from her lips. The arrow</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was trained full at Keeth's breast and her brown fingers trembled on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">string. He dared not move as she began to step lightly backward, her eyes</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">still fixed upon him.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Suddenly Ford uttered a shout of warning. The girl, evidently forget-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ting the proximity of the cliff's brink, made a misstep. In a breath she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had plunged backward into the abyss ! The arrow flew high in the air and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a piercing cry reached the ears of her horrified audience as she disappeared.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" My God ! " cried Ford ; " she's gone ! "</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" She'll be dashed to bits on them rocks below ! " said Fitch, his usually</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ruddy face perfectly colorless.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But Keeth ran forward to the brink of the precipice. He expected to see</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the poor creature's mangled body bounding from rock to rock to the foot of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the cliff. Instead of the horrible picture which his imagination had conjured,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he beheld her lying in the fan shaped top of a stunted tree which grew out of a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fissure in the cliff just below him. Her bow had fallen from her hand and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">she lay, seemingly stunned, upon this insecure resting place.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Quick! knot that rope around me, under the arms," he commanded.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" She may slip at any moment. Hang on the rope with all your might and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">don't let it chafe against the edge of the rock."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He divested himself of his coat and ammunition belt as he spoke, and in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a moment was lowered over the brink. His feet scarcely gained a foothold</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on the rock, but Ford and the Englishman eased him steadily down. Occa-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sionally a bit of rock gave way beneath his weight and went crashing into the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gorge, and his hands were torn and bleeding before he reached the tree. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">girl had not fallen more than twenty feet ; but the shock had evidently de-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">prived her of consciousness. She lay amid the broken branches with her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">eyes closed and head hanging limply over the abyss.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Resting one foot upon a protuberance on the face of the rock and the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">other on the limb of a tree, Keeth was able to raise her in his arms. She</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">did not stir, and holding her tightly against his breast with his left arm, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fended himself off from the cliff with the other hand and shouted to his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">comrades to draw him up. He could no longer see where to place his feet</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and once or twice swung against the rough wall with cruel force. But he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">kept his own body between the cliff and his burden and she was not injured</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the least. Before they reached the summit her eyes opened and she gazed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">up into his face.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Keep still. Don't move," he said, and although she could not under-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stand the words his voice evidently reassured her. She did not seem</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">frightened, nor struggle, as Keeth expected she would. Instead she lay</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">passive in his arms, although she must have realized their danger.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then, in a moment, Keeth felt Ford's hands on his shoulders. He was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dragged upon the rock, still bearing the girl in his arms, and. set her down</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">safely upon her feet. His clothing was torn to rags. His hands were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bruised and bleeding and there was a long gash on the side of his face. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">girl darted away from them like a startled creature of the wood, evidently</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">unhurt by her fall. But she did not go far, for, finding herself unmolested,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">she stopped and looked back. .</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"By Jove, Keeth! you're a sight," cried Ford. "But get into your</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">coat and come on. We must make a break from here."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" What's the matter?" demanded Ronald, still a bit dazed.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" There's Indians about. They may be down on us any minute."</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Yes," said Fitch, " while you was a-riskin' your life for that 'ussie, we</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Keeth picked up his coat and started to put it on. But a cry from the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">girl caused him to look up. Out of the timber before them came a crowd of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">men armed with spears and clubs. They were Indians--of a lighter com-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">plexion than those usually seen in Peru--and were dressed in all the savage</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">magnificence of an uncivilized people.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">They were clothed in little but a short tunic and sandals, but there were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">brilliantly colored feathers in their hair and their arms and ankles were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">adorned with heavy bands of gold. They were fierce looking, keen eyed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">men, and without noticing the white men's superior weapons, marched</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">solemnly toward them. Their huge spears were advanced threateningly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and two or three had already fitted arrows to their bowstrings. At their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">head wralked an old man with wrinkled, parchment-like face, dressed in a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">long white robe of finely woven llama wool.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Great Scott, Keeth!" ejaculated Ford. "We're in for it. Shall we</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Fitch had already unslung his rifle, and raised it to his shoulder ; but</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" But they'll surround us in a minute," growled Fitch.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Stand back to the tunnel here. They can't get behind us then," re-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The Indians had halted a few yards away and the old man advanced a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">step. He addressed some words to the white men which none of them un-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">They waited in silence a moment and then the old man said something to his</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The girl was explaining to her people the incident which had taken place</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">just before their appearance, and was pleading for the lives of the white men</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">who had rescued her. Keeth was sure of this, and as he watched the old</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">man's face he gathered hope. It kindled with love and pride as he gazed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">down upon the kneeling girl, and the young American shrewdly saw that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">through their effort in her behalf they had reached the old Indian's heart.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was probable that she was his daughter, or granddaughter, and there was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">little wonder that the stern man loved her. Barbaric as was her dress and</seg>

        </ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">The color came and went in her dark cheeks as she talked ; her eyes</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shone ; every motion was grace itself. The tightly fitting gown displayed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">every rounded curve of her form, and although she was so petite, the matur-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ity of her figure was evident. She was a true daughter of the tropics.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">But the affair was too serious to admit of much thought upon the girl's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">beauty. It was in her power, Keeth believed, to avert bloodshed, and he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">prayed fervently that she might be successful. The fierce looking men who</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were gathered in the background could not be driven back by one discharge</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the rifles. They would fight till the last one dropped ; and if blood was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shed and he and his comrades should be finally captured, Keeth knew that</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">sounds in it. But as far as Keeth was concerned it might have been</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Choctaw. He couldn't understand a syllable. The old man talked earnestly,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pointed to the white men, then to himself and his companions, and waved</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his hand to include the surrounding territory. Keeth guessed that he was</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">his very pacific speech. But if he did, he gave no sign.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Instead, he uttered another long harangue, and Keeth began to feel that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they might stand there for a week and talk without understanding each</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">other. But here the girl came to the rescue. When the old man ceased she</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">looked to him for permission, and as he gravely bowed, she tripped timidly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to Keeth's side. She laid her hand upon his rifle and pointed to the guns</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of his companions. Then waving her hand for the waiting Indians to ap-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">broad. There were great patches of luxuriant grass and here and there</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">from the same useful animal) was likewise sleeveless and fell scarcely lower</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">than the shirt. There were sandals, too--and queer enough they were. The</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">coarse flour. There was also a jar of liquor which, although of a rather</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">clangor of brazen cymbals from the direction of the temple, and the hum of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">dispersed and then there came a commanding knock upon his door. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">opened it. Two gigantic Indians, armed with their ever present spears,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stood outside and beckoned him to come with them. His belt was buckled</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">around his waist beneath the tunic, and he felt of the butts of his revolvers</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to make sure they were in place before he obeyed. -Then he stepped forth</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and was led toward the temple porch.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Before the door the armed men were relieved by a priestly looking Indian</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in a long white robe, who motioned Keeth to follow him. He carried a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a torch, which lit the labyrinth of passages through which he guided the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">white man. Finally they halted before a heavy door and his guide rapped.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Keeth was sure that they had descended some distance beneath the level of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the ground, yet the air in the passages was cool and sweet. These wonder-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ful people had some knowledge of ventilation.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A voice--a voice which he recognized--replied to the knock. The guide</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">touched the door and it swung inward. He motioned Keeth to step within,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and when he had done so the door immediately closed and the young man</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">found himself in a long, gloomy apartment, the high roof of which was up-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">held by sculptured columns. At the further end of the room a single lamp,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hanging by chains from the roof, shed a dim glow upon a stone table. At</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the table sat the old man whose acquaintance he had already made.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Keeth walked slowly down the room and came at length to the table.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The light revealed the brown face of the patriarch, with all its innumerable</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wrinkles. But despite his appearance of extreme age the eyes glowed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">brightly in the half darkness. Keeth found himself strangely attracted by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">those eyes. They seemed to scrutinize his very soul and hold his own gaze</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">captive.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">For a few moments there was silence between them. The old man was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">looking his visitor over and a little smile curled the corners of his mouth as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he noted his fiue proportions, now so well displayed by the Indian dress.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Upon the table before him were some rolls of what looked like parchment,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">frayed and yellowed by time. Keeth saw that they were covered with markings</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in various colored dyes, or inks, and they seemed like ancient manuscripts.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Suddenly the old man spoke, and instead of the unintelligible tongue</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which he had previously* used, he said, in the purest of Castilian, yet with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">an accent which sounded strange to Keeth, accustomed as he was to the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">men mining the precious metal : first himself and his comrades ; then others</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">joined them. Houses and towns sprang up on the rugged plateaus of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mountains. The miners increased. And then he saw the peaceful valley of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the Indians again--but oh, how changed ! The light on this picture was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dim, but he beheld the prostrate forms of dead men, and pools of blood, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fearful strife. The miners were battling with the ancient occupants of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">a mantle and its face he could not see. But at length his sword clove his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">enemy through. He pulled the dripping blade from the inert body and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">waved it over his head in triumph. But, as the body of his foe fell; the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mantle came away from the face and it was revealed. It was the white, dead</seg>

        <ab>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The old man smiled quietly. " Thou art mistaken, senor," he said. " I</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Keeth looked upon him earnestly. He understood something of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">evidently what he had seen had not been suggested by the priest. Never</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could the old man have beheld that last awful picture and remained so calm.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The American was greatly perturbed.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">They passed swiftly through the silent corridors once more, mounted the</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The heavy door was closed, but it wras not barred. He could have gone</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">it would be of no use to leave the town. There was only one way out of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the valley, and without doubt that way was well guarded. The lack of sen-</seg>

        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">it was still so dark that he could not see what was going on. So, after a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">moment's hesitation, he opened his door and slipped out.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The sky in the east was aglow with the rising sun, but as yet it had not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">appeared above the rugged cliffs which shut in the valley. Here it was still</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dark. He could see the people thronging into the open court before the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">temple. There must have been nearly a thousand of them--men, women, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">children. The noise which had awakened him was made by two white robed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">priests, standing at either end of the porch, beating great gongs which they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">held in their hands.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Soon a procession appeared at the entrance of the temple, and the gongs</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ceased. But the priests leading the procession had small cymbals which the}'</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">continued to clash most noisily ; but these tiny cymbals gave out a high,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shrill note not at all displeasing to the ear.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The priests marched slowly out upon the porch, two by two. Those</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">who had no cymbals swung metal dishes of burning incense which filled the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whole place with its pungent odor. The priests filed down the steps and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">arranged themselves about the altar ; and then the old man appeared. An</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">attendant led forward a kid, and it was seized and thrown upon the altar, on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which a pile of fuel had already been laid.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The high priest held the struggling animal down with his left hand,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">raising a huge bronze knife aloft in his other. The people chanted in their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">musical tongue, while the light increased in the sky and the shadows stole</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">away from the valley.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Suddenly the sun appeared. It shot up from behind a peak of the mount-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ain and its first beam rested full upon the face and figure of the high priest.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The chant changed to a shout and the knife was plunged into the throat</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the sacrifice. Another attendant ran with a blazing torch, and in a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">moment the flames from the pile on the altar were flashing skyward. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">voice of the concourse of Indians rose like the deep, full notes of an organ.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The chant was the most solemn thing to which the American had ever</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">That day Keeth took up his residence in the temple as a guest of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">old priest. The rear apartments were occupied by his household, including</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the grandchild, Imozene. The American felt some little diffidence in allow-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">But Ronald Keeth made up his mind that that was one thing he would</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">insinuating remarks about his interest in her grated upon the engineer's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">finer nature. He could not look upon the sweet face of Imozene without</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">remembering that moment of awful peril when they hung together over the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gorge with only the frail hempen rope between them and death. How brave</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">she had been ! And how kind she was to him afterward, coming herself</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to anoint his wounds. No, he could not think of her lightly, and promised</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">himself that neither by word nor look would he take advantage of her guile-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lessness.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He spent much time with the old priest, for that strange individual</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">seemed to have taken a fancy to him. Beside, he was the only person about</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the temple with whom he could at first converse. The knowledge of their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">conquerors' language had been guarded very jealously by the priests of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Incas ; his host told him that but one member of a generation was ever</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But Keeth had a taste for languages himself, and before long he was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rapidly picking up the dialect of these people. With the priest he always</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">conversed in Spanish ; but for several hours every day he was more or less</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in Imozene's society ; and when two young folks who have no reason for abso-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lutely hating each other are thus thrown together, they must find some</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">medium of communication. Under the girl's tuition Keeth advanced in his</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Imozene, though scarcely more than a child in years (she was about</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">seventeen, as near as Keeth could figure from the Indian measurement of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">time), was a woman in thought and feeling. And as soon as they learned to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">understand each other she showed great curiosity in regard to the outside</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">world. Many things he tried to tell her she could not understand--nor was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it possible for him to explain what he meant, for her language had no words</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by which he might express his meaning. That the world beyond the confines</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of her own mountains was a vast place, full of wonderful things and wonder-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ful people, was the fact which impressed her most. She was amazed that the</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Keeth had in his pack a small map of Peru which he showed her and tried</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to explain its uses. She thought that the diagram represented the whole</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">world, and when he told her that even that vast territory, of which her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">beautiful valley was but a tiny spot, was a very small portion of the globe,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">she scarcely believed him.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" Dost thou r-eally mean that, my lord ? " she asked, laying her hand on</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">sign of betrothal, and that it was considered a great breach of etiquette for a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">man and woman to exchange such a caress unless marriage was con-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">templated.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">To say that Keeth was troubled at this information is to put it very</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mildly. He understood now the change in Imozene's behavior. He had taken a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">liberty which a proud spirited girl could scarcely forgive, and he felt humili-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ated to the dust, despite the fact that he had done the thing unwittingly.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">From remarks the old priest let drop, he thought that it was his intention to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">betroth Imozene to her cousin Gonnatzl, who would be the head man of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tribe when he was gone. Keeth wondered what Gonnatzl would do if he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">learned of what had passed between the princess and himself.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He knew the young Indian. He had been among those who had attended</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the priest and Imozene the day Keeth and his friends had been brought to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the valley of the Incas. He was a brawny, stern visaged savage--a noble</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">looking man, though a bit surly in disposition. The engineer fancied that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he looked upon him and his two companions in captivity with an unfriendly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">eye, as it was.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Two months had now passed since they had come among these Indians</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and the first opportunity for escape had not presented itself. Fitch was in a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">state bordering on desperation and Ford was in despair.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" You're taking it mighty easy, Keeth, up there with that old priest at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the temple," complained Ford. "What d'ye suppose my house in Callao</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thinks of my being gone all this while ? And I should think you would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">feel kind of funny about your own position. Do you intend to stay here for-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Please don't be an idiot, Ford," returned the engineer. " If you can</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">show me the merest chance for escape I'll try it with the rest of you. I can't</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">make chances."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" No, nor you're not looking for them," declared Ford.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" Well, what can we do ? "</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Hi tell you w^ot it is, young man," said Fitch seriously, "they're</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"I'm just as anxious to get away from here as you are," declared Keeth.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">" But I'm not such a fool as to let these people see it."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" You manage to hide your anxiety well from them--and from us, too,"</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">interposed Ford.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Hang it all, man ! what can we do? " demanded Keeth, in disgust.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Take a look around an' see wot this bloomin' valley looks like," sug-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gested Fitch. "There's no use in sticking'ere like toads hunder a toad-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stool. You get the hold feller's permission for us to tyke a look around. We'll</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">see if there's only one way through them blessed clifts."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">So Keeth, spurred on by his friends, made the request known to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">high priest. It was granted without hesitation, and the old man said he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would send somebody with them, which last was not exactly to their taste;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but they were not in a position to file objections. The guide selected</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">proved to be the young man, Gonnatzl, and this displeased the engineer</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">still more.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But the three prisoners could find no fault about the way in which they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were treated. The people gazed upon them curiously as they traveled from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">place to place, it is true, but they were unmolested. The valley was about</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">eight miles long and not over three wide at its broadest point. And as for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">escape through or over the cliffs--well, Keeth made up his mind before they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had made the circuit of the place that unless a man had wings like one of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">those condors whose nests topped some of the most inaccessible crags, or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">enough dynamite to wreck half the mountain system of Peru, there was little</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">chance of either.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The river--or more properly brook, during this dry season--crossed the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">valley from west to east. It spouted out from beneath an overhanging ledge</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and was augmented by half a dozen little rills which trickled through the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">valley or fell down the cliffs. It slanted across the meadows, at one point</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">forming a little lake in which hundreds of wild fowl sported, finally disap-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pearing in a -wide crack under the base of the eastern cliff. This opening</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was scarcely five feet high, and showed by the slime which discolored the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rock that during the rainfall the stream became no inconsiderable torrent.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">' ' Where does the water go to, prince ? ' ' inquired Keeth of their guide.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" To the under world--to the abode of gods and demons, oh, white man,"</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">responded Gonnatzl harshly. " We had a prisoner once--it was not so many</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">moons ago--who sought to escape the children of the Incas by following the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bed of yonder stream," and he pointed solemnly to the mouth of the cavern.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Keeth started, but recovered his self possession instantly. Could this be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Jose Rodriguez--and had he escaped through that forbidding entrance to</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" And what happened to him, oh, prince ? " asked the engineer.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" The gods sent a great rain and he never returned," replied Gonnatzl,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Keeth made no further comment, but when he and his friends had re-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">priests and the concourse of Indians took it up. The light grew above the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">please the young man, for he scowled darkly, and casting a malignant glance</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at Keeth and his friends, marched slowly away from the place.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" Art thou there, my son ? Listen ! Fear not the path thou shalt tread.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Death is not before thee--fear not." He was silent a moment, his face</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">growing more rigid. His lips moved stiffly. " I see--I see what thou canst</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not. Ah, my people ! my people ! They are doomed. Thy people, oh,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">His words became inaudible, though his lips still moved. Keeth placed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his ear close to them, but could distinguish nothing. The rigid lines slowly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">relaxed. His breath came more easily and the old priest sighed and turned</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his face to the wall. He had fallen peacefully asleep and Keeth stole from</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">When Keeth arrived at the abode of his friends he was just in time to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">witness a spectacle which, despite the serious matters occupying his mind,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">forced a laugh to his lips. Ford Kinsale and the trader had been reduced,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">during their captivity, to little else than rags for clothing, and at last had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been forced to abandon their European garments and don the tunic of their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">captors. They had continually made fun of Keeth for wearing the Indian</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">costume; but now the laugh was on the other side. The engineer was a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">picture of manly beauty beside his two friends.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">well, he was a sight ! He had lost none of his corpulency while in captivity,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and the llama skin tunic fitted him as tightly as his own cuticle. His waist</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">line had disappeared some years before and his aldermanic proportions were</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" Ho, ho ! that's a good one on you, Fitch ! " roared Ford, in delight.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">"And you look like a superannuated clothespin, " added the engineer,</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" I don't know about that," said Keeth. " Somehow your bones--you</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">"My ancestors were used to kilts," said Kinsale reflectively. "It's a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">"Yes; and our blankets. I'll get the torches," returned Keeth, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">forthwith ensued a long discussion of ways and means. Each suggestion was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">examined in detail, and when Keeth departed every possible contingency had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been thought of and planned for.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He remained in his own chamber till noon, and then, thinking the time</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">opportune, seized an armful of torches from a pile in one of the corridors near</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by, wrapped them in a rug and carried them to one of the side entrances of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the temple. Ford was on the lookout for him and came across the court and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">carried the innocent looking bundle to his quarters. On his way back to his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">apartment Keeth passed the young prince, Gonnatzl, near the door of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">high priest's chamber. Gonnatzl had evidently been in to see the old man ;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but what effect the dying Inzalkl's pleading had had upon fhe hot headed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fellow Keeth could not guess, for the prince passed him with averted face.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He heard nothing from the dying priest during the afternoon. He tried</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to sleep, knowing that if all went well he would be upon his feet all the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">coming night; but his mind was so troubled by thoughts of Imozene, and of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the danger menacing his friends and himself, that it was impossible. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">impassioned words of the old priest--the last he would probably ever hear</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from his lips--still rang in his ears:</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Ah, my people ! my people! They are doomed. Thy people, oh,</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Keeth repeated the words over and over. What had the old man meant ?</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">By his wonderful occult power had Inzalkl looked into the future and really</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">seen some great danger menacing his granddaughter ? Of Keeth he declared</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It wras impossible for the American to sleep while these and like thoughts</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">like a caged beast. The afternoon waned and the night began to fall. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">narrow streak of sunlight which crept across the floor from dawn to dark</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">disappeared, and through the window he saw the stars come out in the still</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">glowing sky. From the bustle and confusion outside he judged that a great</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">many people had gathered about the temple. The news that the old Inzalkl</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was [near death had gone out among his nation, and from all parts of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">valley they had gathered.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Suddenly the great brazen gongs at the door of the temple began to beat</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">slowly. Their rhythmic throbbing filled the remotest corridor with clangor-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ous sound. A hush fell upon the throng without. Keeth listened at his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">door, his heart beating tumultuously. What was the meaning of the jarring</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">notes ? Had the end come ? Had the old man already passed away ?</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But as he listened another sound reached his ear. It was a faint sobbing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">just without the portal. He unbarred the door and swung it back, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">there, in the gloom of the corridor, lying on the threshold, he beheld a pitiful</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">little heap, shaken by a tempest of sobs.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" What is it--tell me, my child ? " he said, bearing her in his arms to the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">mass of cloud was slowly gathering in the west, foreboding a storm. They</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Suddenly Keeth halted and seized Ford's arm. "What's that, old</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">man ? " he demanded. " Your eyes are better than mine."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He pointed to something moving along the brook bed toward the cliff.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Hit's a man," exclaimed Fitch.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" It's alive,.whatever it is," said Ford uneasily.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Hi've a good mind to give hit a bullet," declared the Englishman.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Hit's one o' them bloomin' Hinjuns."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Don't you dare ! " cried Keeth hastily. " Want to call the whole crowd</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">back there down on us? We'll follow him."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But the shadowy figure had already disappeared, and Keeth, remembering</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">what Imozene had said about the herdsmen being afraid to go near that por-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tion of the valley at night for fear of the haunting spirit of the other prisoner</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">who had ventured into the mysterious tunnel, went on with a rather creepy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">feeling about their undertaking. The thought was gruesome.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The water murmured among the boulders as it hurried into the dark rift</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">beneath the cliff. The three fugitives did not hesitate when they reached</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the mouth of the tunnel. Keeth led the way inside, and before going far</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from the entrance ignited one of the torches. Holding this above his head</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he went carefully forward, while the dancing light played over the slime</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">covered walls of the passage and the torch hissed as the drops of moisture</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fell upon it from the roof.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The bed of the subterranean river was strewn with boulders and broken</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bits of timber which had been swept in from the outer world by bygone</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">freshets. At first the roof was only a little above their heads ; but as they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">advanced the tunnel inclined more rapidly and it grew higher. The water</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ran over the stones with growing murmur and soon the roar of a cataract was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">borne to their ears.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" We'll be getting into a mess yet," said Ford. " Suppose we can't get</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Witliiu half an hour the noise of the falling water was so loud that they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were obliged to shout to each other any communication they might wish to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">make. They had not been able to travel very rapidly, but were possibly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">half a mile from the entrance. The water poured over a great slab of rock</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and dropped a sheer fifteen feet. Keeth quickly looped his rope over a pro-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">jecting knob and went down hand over hand. The water in which he landed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was only half way to his knees.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Come on!" he roared, waving his hand to his friends above, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">although they could not hear him they could see his motion in the light of</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Keeth again coiled the rope over his arm and they went on, now wading</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the water, for the passage had narrowed considerably. Sometimes the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">roof became quite low and they had to stoop to pass through ; but nothing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">turned them back. All three recognized the fact that this was their only</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">chance for liberty, and even Fitch made no audible complaint when he barked</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his bare shins against the boulders.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The water was ice cold in this cavern and the damp air chilled them to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the bone. It was almost a continual descent after they passed the. first fall,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and sometimes they were obliged to scramble down over the slimy rocks on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hands and knees ; at other times they could make use of Keeth's rope.</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At length they passed the cascades and went on through a straight tunnel</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for several hundred yards. Keeth figured that they were nearly a mile from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the entrance. And then suddenly, without any warning, they arrived at the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">end of the cave !</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">They were in a circular chamber, the floor of which was sand, and into</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">this sand the waters of the brook sank. Not a solitary outlet appeared.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">They were like flies in a bottle.</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Keeth's face looked drawn and haggard. Fitch sat down upon a boulder,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">puffing from his exertions. The sand below them looked damp and the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">slime clung to the walls far above their heads. Not long since that pocket</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had been full of water--probably during the last storm.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"I'm afraid," said Keeth slowly, " that the poor devil who got into this</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tunnel wasn't Jose."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He leaped dowrn to the floor of the chamber. Instantly he sank knee</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">deep in the treacherous sand. He struggled to reach the rocks again, but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">each step he took sank him deeper.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" You'll have to help me out, boys ! " he cried, and when Ford and the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">trader hurried forward they found him already waist deep in the quicksand.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Don't step down here, Ford!" Keeth warned the other. "There's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">no need of us both getting into it. Take that rope yonder and fling me one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">end. You and Fitch will have to haul me out. ' '</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">All the while he was speaking the treacherous sand was dragging him</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">down, and by the time he had got the rope knotted under his arms he had</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" What is it? " demanded Ford, hanging stiffly upon the rope and cock-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A strange, muffled, moaning sound echoed down the tunnel. It died</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">away, then swelled again to a throbbing roar. The three men looked at one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">another with startled faces.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" What the dickens is that?" demanded Ford, in an awed voice.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Fitch shook his head; but a look of intelligence flashed into the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" For God's sake pull me out, boys ! " he gasped. " It's thunder ! "</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">His words startled his comrades into activity. They laid hold of the rope</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with vigor, and after a deal of tugging managed to get him out upon the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">solid rock again. But he was so weakened by the strain and chilled by the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">exposure that he could scarcely stand.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Again that same dismal moan, long drawn and fear inspiring, came down</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the cavern, which acted like a speaking tube between them and the outer</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">world.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Go back as fast as you can, boys," said Keeth, struggling into a sitting</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">posture. " Don't wait for me. You know what these thunder storms in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the mountains are like. In a mighty short time this river will rise and</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" And you--" cried Ford.</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"And hang you!" exclaimed Ford. "What do you take us for?.</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">They seized him, despite his objections, and staggered up the tunnel.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The muttering of the thunder was now an intermittent roar. Were they in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">time? They were not sure, for, as they issued from the cul-de-sac, they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">heard the water coming down the rocks with a different noise from that it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had made a few moments ago. Clearly the storm was beginning to tell upon</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the stream, and the work of- recrossing the pools and climbing the slippery</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rocks, especially with Keeth so helpless, looked desperately hard.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Keeth demanded that they set him down, after having been hauled up</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the first incline. The rough exercise had warmed his stiffened limbs and he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pushed on as rapidly as his companions. But each moment the water in-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">creased in depth. Where they had before walked dry shod it was already</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">over their ankles.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At the first cascade Ford climbed up alone, wasting several precious</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">miuutes in the trial, for he was not as active as Keeth. The latter, when</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">once his friend was on the rock above, flung him the end of the rope. But</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he was not successful in the first cast. Ford should have taken the rope up</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with him, but he didn't think of that in his hurry. Keeth made a second</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">attempt and the rope fell back upon Fitch and knocked the torch from his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Had they another dry one ? And when that was found, had they dry</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">matches ? Ford and Fitch had not, but Keeth found a single lucifer in his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">match safe, and after a few minutes of styx-like darkness they had the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cheering presence of a flaming torch again. Then Keeth again cast the rope,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">this time with success.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Fitch swarmed'up like a performing elephant, and with his aid Ford was</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">sweeping down the tunnel waist deep. They hurried on, sometimes plung-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing into holes to their armpits, and barking their legs sadly on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hidden rocks. But Keeth held the torch high above his head and managed</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">At last they arrived at the bottom of the highest cascade--the first one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they had encountered upon entering the tunnel. The water was tumbling</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">down it and boiled at the bottom like a caldron. The three adventurers</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">looked at one another aghast. They could never climb up that rock, and it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was an open question whether Keeth, in his present exhausted condition,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could throw the rope over the knob of rock where it had been looped when</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they descended.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The water swirled around them and almost carried them off their feet by</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Suddenly at the top of the cascade, amid the driving spray, appeared</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a face--a wild, haggard face, which peered down at them with bloodshot</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">eyes.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" What is it ? " gasped Ford, shrinking back from the sight.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The creature waved its arm and fortunately Keeth understood the sign.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He coiled the rope quickly and tossed it upward. The claw-like hands of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the strange looking being clutched it and looped it over the jagged spur of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">went up, hand over hand. He was breathless when he reached the top and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was thankful for the assistance of the stranger in getting upon the rock.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the treacherous savage, but fortunately when they struck the water the In-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dian was underneath. The contact with the cold water loosed the guide's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hold ; they sank together, but Jose alone rose. He was greatly weakened</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by his struggle, and the swift current swept him down stream and around</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the bend in the river in a very few moments. He did not get to the bank</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">until he had been carried quite two miles below the bridge, and then he was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">so exhausted that he could scarcely crawl out of the water.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He lay there by the river for most of that day, but before dark climbed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to the summit of the cliff. He had a'little food and his blanket. He cleaned</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his revolvers and found plenty of ammunition for them in the waterproof</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">compartments of his belt. At sunrise the next morning he started in search</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of his companions. He discovered the place where they had descended to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the shore of the river and saw the effects of the landslide which had shut off</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">their retreat to the top of the cliff. Knowing that they could not go down</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the river, he followed along the stream, hoping to overtake them at some</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Keeth and his companions were with them. But as the white men did not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">appear at any point along the river shore, he believed they had been taken</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Therefore he ventured into the labyrinth of subterranean galleries to the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">appeared the elongated shadow of a stray llama, quietly feeding. They saw</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">no herdsmen ; if they had, they would scarcely have been challenged ; for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the dim light Keeth looked like an Indian himself, and 'jose looked as</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The eastern sky was already aglow when they reached the edge of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">behind one of the houses and crouched down to wait for the people to gather</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on the plaza. They could hear the occupants of the house stirring and soon</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the beating of the brazen gongs on the temple porch denoted that the time</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for the morning sacrifice was near at hand. The people left their houses</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and hurried to the place.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">When the sound of the sandals had died away the two fugitives ventured</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into the house. On a stone slab beside the fireplace were bread and meat</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which the woman had prepared for the family breakfast. Keeth seized a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blanket and wrapped the food in it.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then they entered another house, and another, in each finding food but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">few torches. It was quite necessary that they should have plenty of light</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wood, for Jose declared the caverns through which he proposed to lead</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">them to be a veritable labyrinth, and the only manner by which they might</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">find their way was by marks he had made upon the walls.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But the houses seemed all deserted, and as long as the people remained in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the temple court they might search for what they needed unmolested. They</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">went from house to house as coolly as though nearly a thousand savages were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not gathered within a few rods of them. Finally, from one place and another,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Jose managed to collect a goodly bundle of torches. These he strapped upon</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his back, so as to leave his hands free ; Keeth had already done the same</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">before the temple was choked with people, but all standing as motionless as</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">across the plaza to the group of priests upon the temple porch. The great</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gongs ceased their clangor, and as they gazed the crowd of white robed priests</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">parted and a figure dressed in savage magnificence swept down the steps to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The light of the torches which attendants held upon either hand fell full</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">upon the noble figure of the young Indian. Massive gold bands covered his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">arms, and great bars of gold hung from his ears. The cloak which swept the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">steps behind him flashed a dozen lovely shades. It was made of the brilliant</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">plumage of the paroquet and a chain of dull gold links held it upon his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shoulders.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">After standing a moment in silence the prince began to speak. His</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">powerful voice penetrated to the farthest side of the plaza and every word</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was easily distinguished by Keeth. His first few sentences held the fugitive</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">enthralled. Gonnatzl was arraigning the Princess Imozene for the escape of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the three white men !</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Keeth could hear murmurings of anger break out among the assembly as</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the wily Gonnatzl went on. The man accused her of forsaking her own</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">people for the love of one of the white prisoners. Keeth's face burned and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his hand clutched the butt of his pistol as he listened to the foul accusations.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He blamed himself now--oh, how bitterly !--for leaving the girl to the mercy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of her people. Yet, at the time, he had believed he was doing right.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Suddenly a rosy beam of light filtered through the fog. The sun was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rising. At a motion from Gonnatzl the torches were extinguished and the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">people commenced a wild, fierce chant. The crow'd of priests above him</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">separated and a slight, shrinking figure was pushed forward. It was Imozene !</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The high priest seized her by the shoulder and dragged her forward to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the altar. Her wrists were knotted together behind her back and her cloth-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing had been half torn from her body. With a quick twist of his muscular</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">arm Gonnatzl threw her back upon the altar, and just as the first beam of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sun struck full upon him he poised the huge sacrificial knife above her bared</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">breast.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He drew back the knife for the awful stroke. The assembly was hushed</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Suddenly the crack of a pistol shattered the silence. A tiny red mark</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">appeared in the center of the high priest's forehead and he staggered back a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">step. The knife fell clattering to the pavement, and swinging around with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blindly groping hands Gonnatzl dropped at full length beside the altar.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The awed hush was broken by frightened screams of women and the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hoarse cries of men. Several of the priests rushed forward to their fallen</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">leader ; but again the crack of the revolver rose above the tumult. One and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">then another fell, or staggered back in agony as the leaden messengers reached</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">their marks. The fusillade continued. They could see nothing--not even</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the smoke of the discharge. Simply the whiplike crack of the weapon and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the dropping of those about the altar--that was all.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The cries of the assembly rose to a terrified shriek. They scattered</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Suddenly a figure leaped out from the shelter of a house and ran across</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The American reached the altar in an instant. He whipped out his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">raised her in his arms and turned to fly. But the girl's eyes were closed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and she lay a dead weight against his breast.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Was she dead ? Had the horror of the awful experience through which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">she had passed snapped the frail thread of life ? Keeth tried to feel if her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">heart beat, but in his horror he was unable to discover the faintest flutter.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" My God ! she is dead ! " he thought, and staggered down from the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">And then, as though his touch had called her back to life, the eyes</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">beyond. Not far ahead, round a slight curve, the creek ran in between the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mountain and the railroad and was crossed by an open trestle work. Tom</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stopped a moment. All was silent. But hark !</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">him. It rushes on swifter and swifter, and with a whirr like the rising of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">quail, the velocipede hand car dashes past him in the gloom, with two</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">motionless figures on the seat. Tom drew a long breath and stepped out</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">trouble and worry for nothing. He turned down the track toward Dauphin,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when suddenly a thought strikes him--a thought that brings him to a stand-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">still and makes his blood run cold. He turned and hurried up the track.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He rounded the curve, approached the trestle work, and stood looking down</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">very ugly version having been told him. My friend had to tell the plain</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">truth, and there had been the devil to pay. The wires to St. Petersburg had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">soon as the morning's drill was over, the colonel sent for me and told me</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">what had happened. The military authorities at St. Petersburg had taken</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the harshest view of the conduct of my two antagonists. It was regarded as a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">great influence had prevented him from sharing the same fate. As it was he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had had all his seniority struck off, had been reduced to the rank of a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">subaltern, and sent off there and then under quasi arrest, with heavy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">military escort, to a regiment stationed on the most southern Turkestan</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">frontier.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"As for Devinsky, the regiment's well rid of him," said the colonel,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with such emphasis and earnestness that I saw his own personal animosity</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had had quite as much to do with the man's overthrow as the latter's own</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">conduct. But it pleased the old man to put it all down to me, and when w'e</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were parting he shook hands cordially and said, " The regiment owes you a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">pleasure, but she explained as cold, glistened in her eyes. We had a long</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and closely confidential chat; and she made me feel, more by her trustful</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">manner and gentle attitude than by her actual words, how much she had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">missed me during the days of our separation and how thankful she was to be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">free of Devinsky for good, and how much she felt she owed to me on that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">account.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">For myself I was sorry when I had to leave her. She was the only person</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in Moscow to whom I could speak without restraint; a fact that made our</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">interviews so welcome that I was loathe to end this one.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was almost dusk when I left, and as I walked home I was thoughtful and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">preoccupied. The question of Olga's safety was pressing very hardly on me</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and made me extremely anxious. The more I saw of her the more eager I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was to get her out of harm's way ; and the consciousness that she must share</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the consequences of any disaster that might happen to me were I discovered</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">troubled me greatly. I was beginning to anticipate more vividly, moreover,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the coming of some such disaster. The time was passing very quickly. It</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was getting on for nearly three weeks since the Nihilist meeting, and I knew</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that my Nihilist ' ' allies ' ' would be growing anxious for a sign of my zeal.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">They were probably well aware that I was doing nothing to redeem my</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pledge.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">There was also the undeniable danger inseparably connected with the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">infernal intrigue with Paula Tueski. I had so neglected her in my character</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of lover that I was hourly expecting some proof of her indignation. I had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">only seen her twfce in the three weeks ; and each time in public ; and though -</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Olga and she had interchanged visits, I knew perfectly well that she was not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the woman to take neglect passively.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I blamed myself warmly, too, for my own inactivity. My whole policy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had been to try and gain time, and yet I had made no use of it, except to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">get into broils which had increased the already bewildering complications.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">That this would be the effect of my quarrel with Devinsky and Durescq,</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I could not doubt when I came to think the matter over in cool blood. I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had been the means of getting them ruined ; and naturally every friend they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had in Russia would take part against me. I knew that Durescq had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">friends among the most powerful circles in Russia, and I had nothing to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">oppose to their anger save the poor position of a lieutenant in a marching</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">regiment, and a past that was full of blackguardism and evil repute. Per-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sonally this was all nothing to me ; but when I thought of the indirect</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">results it might have for Olga it troubled and worried me deeply.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Everything pointed to one conclusion---that Olga should leave Russia</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">while she could do so in safety.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I was meditating on these things when a girl stopped me suddenly, asking</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">I let myself in and found that my servant was out--a most unusual thing</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">rather than above the average of Russian servants and was already contem-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">plating his dismissal. I did not attach much importance to his present</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">absence, however ; and throwing myself into a chair sat and thought, or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tried to think, of some scheme by which I could induce Olga to leave the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">country, and some means by which her departure could be safely arranged.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">She must go at once. She had promised me to go when I could tell her it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was necessary for my safety ; and I could truthfully say that now. If she</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It was not destined that Olga should leave Russia yet. A terrible event</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">like a clap of thunder, convulsing the whole nation, and shaking for the</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Olga was to start at noon, and I proposed to see her an hour before that</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">before ten o'clock a messenger came with a request for me to go at once to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">had changed his mind and meant to arrest me. I was of course helpless ; and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could do no more than scribble a hasty line to Olga telling her of my appoint-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ment, asking her not to wait for me, and bidding her good by. But I did</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not send it. The police agent said with great politeness he would prefer my</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not doing anything then ; I could send the note equally well from the bureau.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">One of my chief reasons for holding my tongue was that as the plot fol-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lowed so soon after the Tueski murder--for the plans wrere all made within a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">week--the fact that I knew so much of Nihilist affairs at such a time, would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bring both Olga and myself under suspicion of having been privy to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">former one. In such a case everything I wished to win would be jeopardized.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">A single breath of suspicion would have been enough to sweep us both into a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">for the whole country was red hot against the Nihilists, and men of the high-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I was also much concerned as to my supposed past. I knew that the old</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Alexis was gravely compromised ; but what he had actually done, I did not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">know. If any old offenses were raked up I should be certain to be called to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">account for them now, while Olga would inevitably suffer with me.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">For those reasons I decided to hold my tongue and to seek my own means</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for causing the infernal scheme to miss its aim. I reckoned that as I was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to have a principal part assigned to me I could, by my own effort, either</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">through apparent stupidity or by wilful design, wreck the whole project;</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and with this object I thought carefully over every detail intrusted to me.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">accuracy that always made me marvel, till I ascertained the cause, the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Nihilist leaders learned the imperial intentions before they were known in</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">What the Czar decided to do was to have all the preparations carried on</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">at the last moment to make a change which would baffle any plots. He</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">meant to alter the arrangement of the train by which he would travel, and</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The object of this was of course to tliVvart any plot that might be laid to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">at him. But he would not take his eyes from me, and when I left the table</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he followed and spoke to me. ' Hamylton, old man, I did not know you at</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">him, but I thought the best way was not to speak. I did not shake him off,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">however, for that night he saw me again just when I was speaking English</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">himself to probe the thing to the bottom. He loved mysteries ; was most</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">active, energetic, and enterprising; and nothing would suit him better than</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to have imported into his rather purposeless life some such task as a search</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for me half over Europe. He was quite capable, too, of jumping to the con-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">in a belief of the kind he was just the one to raise the hue and cry in every</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">enough to brand him anywhere as an impostor should he try to pass himself</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">down the shade, and in a few minutes the extinguishing of his light indicated</seg>

        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">The strange captain thoughtfully stroked his beard. He declared then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that their luck in whaling had been unusually good that year, and unless</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the compensation was very liberal he could not think of a proposition which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would put an end to his trip. Besides, his crew, to a man, had each his share</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the proceeds and they would ask for indemnity.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Erik replied that the price was a matter of indifference to him. He would</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">" Our only object is to communicate with Europe, but it must be done with</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">is our intention to proceed still further south, where all conmunication with</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">have certain letters and private reports sent to Europe. You will most likely</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">be spoken on your trip home by some man of war or other naval vessel, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">asked whether you have seen anything of us ; that, of course, you must deny.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Those remaining behind continued the discussion. Would it be wise to</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">This proposition was generally approved. Szemsky, every one knew,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">a view to assisting in their escape. Szemsky maintained that the only means</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of exit was by the large gateway, as from there only a road led down to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shore, while everywhere else jagged rocks and cliffs rose almost perpendicu-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">small that an ordinary man could not squeeze through even were there no</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">which was a trap door, through which the supplies for the asylum were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hoisted by means of a crane. Szemsky knew that this trap door was un-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">locked and never bolted. It would be easily opened. Their descent was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">possible by means of a rope and tackle. Then the worst difficulty of all had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Szemsky spoke of several men who had made efforts to gain their liberty</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and were afterwards captured and walled in in their cells alive to starve.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Therefore to flee was taking their lives in their hands. Even should they</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"Now," Erik directed, "we must freeze the stuff, otherwise it will not</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">blown to atoms. We must attach a long rope so we can go to some distance.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">When we are at the other end of the corridor we will raise and then drop it."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Szemsky found a long, sound rope, strong enough to draw up the heavy</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">fastened to the charge of nitroglycerin, and with the other end in Szemsky's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hand, both quickly left the storeroom and hastened towards the end of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">about time now ? They had reached the center of the long corridor and the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">end of the rope Szemsky held, both at the same time, when Szemsky pointed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ahead'of him, ghastly pale. Ten men of the night guard approached,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">attracted by the noisy singing of the unconscious keeper and his crazy chorus.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">They immediately espied the fugitives and made a concerted rush at them.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">More speedily than words can tell it, his determination was reached.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">With a warning cry to Canaris, a hasty injunction to Colonel Carrington</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">His intentions were apparent. The roof and walls of the passage were</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Guy joined his companions on the shore of the river, and almost instantly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a terrific explosion took place. It seemed to rend the earth. A tremendous</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">down beside the canoes, they made a hearty meal, and washed it down with</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Ah ! but that is a very important thing," said the colonel. " I possess</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">some acquaintance with the geography of this part of Africa. Are you</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">source, which as yet remains undiscovered, lies only a hundred miles or more</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to our west, aad it flows to the southeast. This stream before us appears to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">head in a southwesterly direction as near as I can judge. It is possible then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that it joins the river Juba at a distance less than two liuudred miles from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">here. In that event our journey does not appear so formidable."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Pardon me, sir," said Canaris quickly, " but from what I have been</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Guy's stirring speech was just what was needed to rouse the flagging spirits</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the party, for the colonel's graphic description of the contemplated journey</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had produced a very depressing effect.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Preparations for the start were begun at once. The two canoes were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">first tested and found to be absolutely seaworthy. Then the provisions,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the torches, the lamps, the oil flasks, and the rugs were divided into two</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">For economy one torch was to be used for illuminating their way. The torch</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Sir Arthur was to hold in the rear of the canoe. Eight paddles had been</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">found in the cavern, thus providing an extra supply in case of possible loss.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was difficult to believe that the sun was shining brightly outside. No</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ray of light pierced the blackness of the cavern, and the dead silence was un-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It was a solemn and impressive moment, and Guy's voice had a touch of</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A last survey of the cavern was made to see that nothing was forgotten,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and then all took their places in silence, the canoes swung slowly out from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shore, and, caught by the current, shot off into the gloom on the first stage</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the most awful journey ever made by living men.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Guy sat slightly in front of the stern, keeping the canoe straight with an</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">occasional touch of the paddle, for the velocity of the current made labor un-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">necessary, aud close behind him was Sir Arthur, holding the flaring torch</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that lit up the water for a short distance ahead and served to guide the second</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">canoe, which was only a few yards in the rear.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">" If this current continues all the vTay," observed Forbes, " eight hundred</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">For an hour or more they traveled on in almost unbroken silence.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">On either side the shore was invisible, and overhead the glare of the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">This peaceful monotony, however, was rudely shattered. A low hum-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">gestion Forbes relieved Sir Arthur of the torch, and scarcely had this change</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been effected when the current carried them into a swirling mass of spray.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Both canoes grated and bumped against rocks, and then, before the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The glare of the torch seemed to anger the monster, for it advanced a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">A general rush was made for the canoes, and it would have been no diffi-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Come away, Melton," he cried ; "it will only make things worse if you</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">As he spoke he advanced recklessly until the muzzle of his rifle wras</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The stunning report shook the cavern, and as Forbes turned to flee, the</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He struggled to his knees, fighting desperately to loosen the tightening</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then, with a mighty hiss, the serpent flapped wildly toward the water,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The colonel ran to his assistance, and at that moment a single cry came</seg>

        </ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">It was Melton's voice surely, and the familiar tones reached Guy's ears</seg>

        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">In their haste the lighted torch had been left behind, but fortunately the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">A few rapid strokes of the paddle brought them within sight of a strug-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">side, Guy dropped his paddle, and, leaning out, seized the drowning man by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the collar. With almost superhuman strength he dragged him into the canoe</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">without assistance.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">" Thank God ! " he cried, " he's safe. Speak to me, Forbes. Are you</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But Melton lay white and helpless in the bottom of the boat too exhausted</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">"He's all right," said Canaris. "Don't make him talk. Take your</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The Greek was right. Far above them shone the flickering torch, and</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">"I can't paddle and hold the torch at the same time," said Canaris.</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">And they bent to the paddles with a will, shouting from time to time to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">encourage the colonel and Sir Arthur. It was even a harder task than they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had feared--to force the canoe through that fierce rush of water. And for a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">time it seemed as though they were losing instead of gaining ground.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But at last the distant light grew brighter, and soon their friends could be</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Ten minutes' more labor brought the canoe to the small eddy behind the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">wearily out and bore Melton tenderly up the slope. His clothes were foul</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and slimy from the serpent's embrace, but he did not seem to be injured.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">A few drops of stimulant would have had a good effect, but as this was</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">His wet clothes were stripped off and wrung out. Then he was wrapped</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">patient, much to the relief of all, recovered from his prostration and insisted</seg>

        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">Mr. Singerlay and Mr. Barkpool are the two wealthiest citizens of Montoban. The former</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Onongo Mill, and presides over the Onongo Bank. They have long been enemies, and their</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">quarrel is shared by their sons, Dolph Singerlay and Phin Barkpool, but both the latter are beset</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by the same desire : to have a steamer of his own on the lake. Andy Lamb is the son of Mr.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Barkpool's engineer, and he rescues Diana Singerlay from the persecutions of Tom Sawder, a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">young hoodlum. Phin quarrels with him in consequence, and the father is dismissed from the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">getting steamers from their fathers, rob the banks of which their fathers are the respective heads.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">They are surprised in their work by a professional burglar, called Poddy, and his assistant, Tom</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Sawder, who capture the two young gentlemen, together with a hundred and fifty thousand dol-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lars, and carry them off in a rowboat to Bunkel Island in Lake Montoban. Here they are kept</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in a grotto, effectually concealed from view, while Montoban supposes that the two banks have</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been robbed by the sons of their respective presidents. Andy Lamb, however, has his doubts</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on this point, and he tells Rynon, an officer who has been put on the case, about a strange man</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he has seen on Bunkel Island. Although Rynon declares that this is no trail, Mr. Singerlay</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the most cautious manner away from the spot. When he had gone less than</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a rod, he halted at an opening in the rocks. It was a rent not more than</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">At this aperture Phin stopped and put his head down into the rent as far</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It was Tom Sawder's idea that he might be put into a tight place if the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">might catch him alone, and perhaps both of them together might get the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">1 his was the argument that induced the chief to surrender one of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">head " when he was done with them. Tom might fire at them at any time,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and he was disposed to do so.</seg>
        </ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">The hoodlum regarded the prisoners as a decided impediment. He was</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">that the two boys were the guilty persons. Andy was somewhat staggered</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in his belief, but it still seemed to him that the stranger must have had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">something to do with the robbery. What was he doing on the island?</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Why had he taken so much pains to conceal himself if he was an honest</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Andy left the mill, and then he saw one of the policemen examining the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">that half the strength of his case had been removed by the absence of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">boys, but he cudgeled his brains to recall all the events at the island.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Suddenly it occured to him that Tom Sawder was missing as well as</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">At the same time he asked Rynon a few hard questions, which the officer</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">having probably stolen them. Where were those boards ? Not a splinter of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">one of them could be found. What had become of them ? Tom could not</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">trouble to reply to Andy's suggestions. He had been an officer for twenty</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">years, and he was not going to be led by the nose by a boy. He knew what</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Andy realized that it was useless to attempt to get ahead any farther with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">such an officer as Rynon ; and he thought he could borrow a detective from</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">said Andy, for he could not think of leaving the island until he had made a</seg>

        <ab>

            <seg type="columnLine">Rynon had examined the island without finding the slightest evidence that</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">another measure of the same kind, he examined his revolver, which was not</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">care even to meet Tom Sawder face to face, for that would mean fight ; but</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">three of them growing in the form of a triangle promised him the security he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The persons who were approaching reached the plain. They looked about</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the three savins which hid him, but they had only searched in the open places.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">They seated themselves, and having assured themselves that no one was near</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they spoke out loud.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The first time one of them used his full voice Andy was astounded and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">was time for one of the robbers to be on the lookout for them. Andy was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">almost sure he heard a sound in the direction of the entrance to the grotto.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">But they could discover nothing either with the eye or the ear.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Andy was burning with curiosity to hear more of the experience of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">more before he reported to Leffwing, who stood at the head of the police</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">force of Montoban.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He conducted his companions to the shelf of rock by which he had</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Dolph decided that they could not cross the channel in the tender, and</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Phin was the more timid of the two prisoners, though he had a fair share</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of pluck. He had heard, or thought he heard, noises which indicated the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">approach of one of their persecutors, and they made him nervous. If Poddy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had thought they were absent too long, he was more likely to send Tom to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">so in the estimation of the leader. But Phin thought that a good excuse</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would be little consolation after any one of the trio on the rocky shelf had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">been shot. He preferred to avoid the shooting, and his companions agreed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with him.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was a thing understood from the beginning of the conference that Andy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">should convey the prisoners back to Montoban ; but when they looked at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the lake, they all agreed that it was impracticable to do so in the tender.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The little boat was quite as handsome as the sloop to which it belonged,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but it was hardly big enough to hold more than two persons. It was long for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">its beam, and would upset upon the smallest provocation. It answered the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">purpose for which Dolph used it when the lake was reasonably smooth.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">In the present rough condition of the water, it would simply have been</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">suicide to attempt to cross the channel in so small a boat. All three of them</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">agreed on this point. It was necessary, therefore, for the prisoners to report</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Andy could not arrange any plan with them, for he was not willing even</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">to trust himself alone in the tender. He must remain on the island for the</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Of course a force from the town would come to the assistance of the boys</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">as soon as the situation was made known there. This was all the arrange-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ment that could be made. Until this could be done it would not be prudent</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to allow the robbers to know that a visitor had been to the island.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Phin had proposed that Andy should work around the island in the tender,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and cross the strait on the west side. Dolph, however, was sure that it was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">even rougher in the narrow passage than in the wide one, for it was more</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">exposed to the action of a northeast wind. The only thing they could do</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was to wait ; and to boys this is the hardest thing in the world to do. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">prisoners returned to the cave, leaving Andy standing on the shelf of rock.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The engineer's son was quite as eager to do something at once as his late</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">companions had been. But the weather was decidedly bad. It had been</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cloudy since nine o'clock in the morning, and the sky was blacker and more</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">threatening than it had been when Andy arrived.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It looked like a storm, and the wind was continually increasing. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">waves broke against the rocky shores of the island, for the wind had a sweep</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of two miles, and the rollers were heavy for a small lake.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Andy felt as though his wheels had been blocked, for he could do</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nothing, in spite of his good intentions. He wondered if Mr. Singerlay,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when he wras told that he had been left on the island with nothing but the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">frail tender, would not send the Dragon back for him. The magnate must</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">see that it was impossible to return in the little craft when the wind was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">blowing a stiff gale.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But Mr. Singerlay was not likely to think of the boys' peril; at this time</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he had enough to keep his mind busy. But Andy was sure his father would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">think of him when night came, and he did not return. At the worst, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was satisfied he could stand it till the next morning, though it was not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pleasant to think of spending the night out of doors on the island, in a storm</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from the northeast.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He had heard the tender bumping against the rocks in the water cave</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">where he had put it. He was afraid it would be injured by the commotion</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the waves, and he decided to go down and look out for it. Possibly he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could find a shelter during the storm under the rocks. He had visited the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">place many times before, and he knew, or thought he knew, all about it.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The rocks, as at Castle Hills and the Bay of Islands near them, seemed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to have been shaken up by some convulsion of nature at an earlier period.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">If they had been rent and split up by an earthquake or a volcanic eruption,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">they would have been, left very much as visitors found them.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">They were pierced in every direction with crevices, apertures, and clefts</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of all shapes and sizes. There were half a dozen of these holes on the east</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shore of Bunkel Island.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The one which Andy had chosen, on account of the shelf which afforded</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a good chance to land on the island, was an opening in the form of a shelter</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tent. He had been in it several times, but he had never had any desire to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">THE BUNKEL MYSTERY.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">examine it carefully. He knew that the rocks were honeycombed with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">openings, as a load of large stone chips would be when dumped on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ground from a cart.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Andy had backed the tender into the cavern, which was about ten feet</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">deep, so that he could secure the painter on the shelf. He drew the boat up</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to his landing place, and stepped into it. Letting go of the cord which held</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it, the tender immediately drifted back to its former position. The stern</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rested against an upright mass of rock.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The wind did not blow directly into the little grotto, and the water in it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was sheltered by the abutment on the weather side. Andy shortened the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">painter so that the tender should not hit the rock at the stern. Then, with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a small line he found in the boat, he rigged a stay on each side, which he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">attached to the rocks.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Thus secured, the boat pitched and rolled on the uneasy waters, but it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was .safely moored so that it could not strike the rocks at any point.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Andy seated himself in the stern of the tender, and put on the overcoat</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he had brought with him in anticipation of rain, for the air was quite chilly.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He could hear the roar of the surging waves as they-beat upon the rocky</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">shore ; but he felt quite comfortable.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">In this easy position he began to consider the events of the preceding</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">night. He found abundant occupation for his thoughts ; but he had hardly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">entered upon the subject when he was startled by the sound of a voice quite</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The sound did not seem to come from the direction of the lake,'where the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">only opening he knew anything about was situated. The voice seemed to be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the very heart of the rocks. It appeared to come from some point over his</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He was alarmed, not for his personal safety, but because the security of</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Andy was not a smoker, but he made the fire in the cook stove for his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mother in the morning, and he carried a tin box of matches in his pocket.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He lighted one of them.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">By the feeble light of the match he discovered that there was a consider-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">side, he moved the tender over to the aperture. Pieces of rock had fallen</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from above, and formed a rough platform just above the water.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">It followed that, if he could hear the persons above him, they could hear</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">As he reached over and put his head into the aperture, which was like an</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">that no direct rays of daylight could penetrate through it to the lower cavern</seg>
