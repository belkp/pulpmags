            <seg type="columnLine">a half hour we found a dry creek bed whose bare rocks</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">house which we avoided. Whatever crop was grown in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the fields had not yet sprouted, so we soon found our-</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> It seems that the navigation of Zongainian prolos across</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the voids of the Universe is a most complex process. A</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">line is made between two stars, its exact length computed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with extreme accuracy, and the ship directed with a con-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tinuous acceleration for just half the distance. The craft</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">is then turned around and after a short "glide" at peak</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">velocity it begins to slow down reaching a speed of zero</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">relative to the destination within a few thousand miles</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> The amount of acceleration is determined by the dis-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tance and is limited by the extra strain it puts upon the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">human system. If a prolo, so we were informed,-turned</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">off its power while out in space, everything inside it would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">be weightless. This produced excessive nausea and might</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">result in the death of passengers, so the plan was adopted</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of letting the acceleration maintain a continual inertia</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">force and consequently an artificial weight. On long</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">trips this acceleration was much increased to save time.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">The officcr said that we would cover the distance to Dun-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">saan in about eight weeks. "This is a very fast ship," he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">explained, "it is not a passenger craft, but what you</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would call a battleship--we have international difficulties</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Ver Moti explained as follows:</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> When half a voyage is accomplished the motors are</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">turned off and the prolo turning about, presents its crystal</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">free "gliding," the motors are turned on, this time slow-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing the ship. The deceleration takes as long as the accel-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">eration. The period of free gliding, however, was what the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">crew looked forward to, as everything on board would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lose weight. Different people, explained Ver Moti, were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">affected in various ways. Some become frightfully nau-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">seated; others have fits; while many are wholly unaffected</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">by their weightlessness. Crews are picked for immunity</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from "gravity-sickness," as prolos by gliding at peak</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">velocity can cover much distance using a minimum of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fuel. Usually our ship glided for an hour or so, when</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the crew put on a sort of acrobatic circus trying all kinds</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of tricks of floating.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Late that "afternoon" the captain announced that the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Well, all things end at last and so did our journey.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Once again the stars appeared in the sky, changed color</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Then observations were suddenly stopped by the ring-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">as the iron hand of momentum pressed down. For a few</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">moments my very breath was squeezed out and then the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">weight was released. This drastic measure secured the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">this we walked, the beam of Hanavan's light following the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">upper moulding. We had not gone fifty feet when out of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a side hall there came a thin ribbon of metal covered with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">transparent insulation and fastened to the wall with some</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">kind of glue. This we ripped down, cut and placed in a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">coil where it could be found on the way back. Then on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">again.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> The hall descended gradually until after we had pro-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gressed a half mile, there appeared a large ornamental</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">door leading directly onlo the stone paving. With a sigh</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of relief we hurried into the open, away from the gloomy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">passage. At the edge of the canal were a number of Hat</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">slabs of stone and here we stopped to eat. According to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Hanavan's watch we had been gone three hours and a half.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Lunch of Zongainian concentrated food does not take</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">long and so, after doubtfully considering the canal wa-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ter, we started out with our thirst unslaked. About a mile</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">down the great street there was an intersection where we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could make out a heap of wreckage and a mass of twisted</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wire. Toward this goal wc turned our steps, following</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the canal. Once Milroy saw a large yellow eel-like thing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the water, but lack of lines or hooks saved it. And</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">once we were all startled by a raucous squawking from</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the upper floors of a building. We never saw what kind</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of a crcaturc it came from.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> The distance to the pile of wreckage was much greater</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">than we had estimated, for after an hour's steady tramp-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing it was still quite a way off. Prof. Milroy grew tired</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and suggested that we try inside the building again. Ac-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cordingly we entered the nearest door where almost at our</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">feet we found a big roll of fine wire, the ideal thing for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the damaged induction coil. After a short rest it was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">decided to go straight through the building instead of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">retracing our steps the length of the street.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> To a sane person this may sound foolish, but our ner-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">vousness had made us anything but sane. Our first relief</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">at getting into the open was now replaced by a fear of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">being seen by someone or something hidden in an upper</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">window--by some queer twist of reasoning we thought</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that by keeping to the darkest halls we might sneak through</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">without being found out. Whatever it was we could hide</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from, I don't know, for during all the time we had been</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the city we had found nothing alive.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> However, we entered the structure and choosing a ramp</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">leading in the general direction of the space ship, started</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">up. We marched on for four solid hours thereafter with-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out catching the slightest glimpse of light. The hall,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">now wide, now narrow, wandered on in a course grad-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ually more tortuous. In the walls were innumerable</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">round locked doors. Hanavan said they must be the en-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">trances to apartments. Fatigue and a growing horror of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">our condition quenched any curiosity.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Near the beginning of the fifth hour after leaving the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">street we discarded the bundle of wire. Bitterly we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cursed it and the day we set out on this mad adventure.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">A little later we came to a halt.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Physical exhaustion prevented further walking--no</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">matter where we were. After discussing the question of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sleeping in the open hall we proceeded to batter down</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">one of the doors in an endeavor to find a reasonable</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">amount of shelter. The door soon gave, but when we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">entered the chamber we received a terrible mental shock.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Standing in a group in the center of a round chamber</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were four people; weazened, hideously yellow and all</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pointing or making some kind of gesture at us. We</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sprang back and Lord Hanavan raised the wire cutter--</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">our only weapon.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> The four made no move--they only watched us with</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">glittering yellow eyes. For ten seconds we stood in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">doorway as motionless as those before us, and then Hana-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">van slowly lowered his weapon. We peered closer and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">then Milroy managed to gasp out "They're dead! Em-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">balmed! Stuffed!" The next instant we fairly tore out</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of the room and in spite of our exhaustion ran far up the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">corridor before pausing. Avoiding the now sinister</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">round doors we finally huddled together in a remote cor-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ner of the passage. After extinguishing all lights, we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lapsed into a fitful slumber broken by nightmares of pur-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">knees, listening. For many minutes we waited, hearing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">nothing. Milroy insisted, in whispers, that he had heard</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">footsteps and a dragging sound, and Hanavan once si-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lenced us to listen long for the repetition of distant</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">laughter. It never came. Perhaps it was the creature</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> In any case it was apparent that unless we could soon</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">escape from these endless passages we would go insane.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">At first we feared to put on our lights, but once it was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">done we felt better. The hall was empty as far as the</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Before resuming the trek we had a short conference.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Lord Hanavan wished to return to the street the way we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had come, but Milroy and I opposed him. There were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">too many side tunnels, too many forks. And besides, the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thought of passing that open door and the grisly statues</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">inside would have deterred us.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> It was finally decided that the best course was to as-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rend to the city roof where we could go in a straight</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">line and find the wrecked landing stage more easily. But</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">how to get there was the question. We commenced march-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing as we talked, keeping to those passages which had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">some upward slope. An hour or more passed this way</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when around a corner appeared a light. Hurrying to it,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">we found ourselves looking out of a window far above</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">another street; below lay the same wide, double, stonq</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">avenue with the sluggish canal in the middle. But the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cheering thing was the sight of a broad, flat roof less than</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fifty feet overhead.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Prof. Milroy essayed a weak cheer, and we started again.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Less than a hundred feet brought us to the bottom of a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ramp, at whose other end I could discern the grey sky.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">We fairly ran up that last passage. Abreast, Hanavan</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> For some moments we fairly capered, so great was our</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">joy at escaping, and then we commenced to observe our</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> The ramp terminated upon a platform upon which we</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stood. On three aides it sloped gently down to a flat</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gravelly plateau, extending a hundred yards lo the nearest</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">street. Across that another building roof, at the same</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">level, continued. Mile after mile the roofs extended, a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">vast plain crossed with chasm-like streets and dotted at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">intervals with skeleton-frame towers. Far away we could</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dimly make out through the mist a mass of immense</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">buildings. Hanavan pointed to these and said, "That's</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">evidently the 'down town' section. We are only in the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">suburbs."</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Now that we were comparatively free, the next job was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to find the prolo. This would have been simple except</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for the fact that we had not the slightest idea which way</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to go, and that the landing stage was nowhere to be seen.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Hope ran high, however, so choosing al random we started</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">along a street toward the nearest steel tower.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Hanavan's idea was to climb it, but after less than a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">half-mile we found the route blocked by a cross street.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Somewhat discouraged we sat down on the parapet and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ate a little more of the concentrated food. It occurred</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to us that it migbt be a good idea to be sparing. Some</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ten minutes passed, when Prof. Milroy leaped to his feet</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with a whoop of joy and, pointing skyward, commenced</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a wild dance. Following his arm Hanavan and I looked</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">up pa9t a steel tower into the haze, and there cruising</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">slowly in our direction was the prolo. Crying something</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about the visibility of a moving object, Hanavan started</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">running toward it in an erratic course. I followed, first</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spitting out in great relief the unpalatable Zongainian</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> The prolo evidently sighted us immediately, for it ac-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">celerated and dropped lower. As it neared us I saw a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">door open on one side and several heads appeared. Sud-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">denly I collided violently with Lord Hanavan. He was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">standing still, wildly beckoning to Milroy, a hundred feet</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">not the same prolo . . . larger . . ." Not comprehending</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his words, I looked more closely at the now near craft.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">It was larger and of a different design. The next instant</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it was hovering thirty feet above us and I could see the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">faces peering down. They were angular . . . yellow . . .</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">foreign looking.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Swiftly the ship descended until its landing rail grated</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on the roof. Immediately a dozen men sprang out, all</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">ian they cried, "Who are you? From what prolo do you</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">come?" Struck by a sudden fear we could not answer at</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">first. The leader of the party appeared to become angry,</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> I awoke first, quite without memory of what had hap-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pened. I was lying under a glass panel frame like a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">counter in an American store. This enclosed bed, for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">such it was, was one of six in a big square room, flooded</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with sunshine from windows and a skylight.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Outside lay a wide formal garden, a small lake, and be-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">yond, a mounting range of forest-covered hills. My mind</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">still groping, I sat up and nearly cracked my skull 011 the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ceiling of the sleeping compartment. At this jolt recol-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">a moment. Suddenly my attention was attracted by a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">muffled shouting and thumping. Startled, 1 looked into</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the next bed in which lay Prof. Milroy, tangled in the cape</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he still wore, shoving and pushing at his enclosure.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Seeing that 1 was awake he made motions indicative of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">escape and gestured toward the other bed-cases. I now</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">observed that each contained a slumbering figure; who-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ever they were they had not awakened. At this moment</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Prof. Milroy found the mechanism opening his bed and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the top rose like a jackknife bridge allowing my comrade</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to roll out on the floor. His first act was to direct me by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">many gestures and shouted phrases, to pull down a lever</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">inside, causing the glass case to open. The next instant I</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> His first words were an exact echo of my own thoughts.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Milroy walked to the window. "At least," he murmured,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and seemed to be aiming for the ground just beyond the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hedgerow on our right. We had a brief view of it, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">strange enough it seemed. The wings were unusually</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">short and stubby. The fuselage was enormous in pro-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">portion--perhaps fifty feet across and as much long. It</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was shaped like a cylinder and was dull silver in color.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> "Come on!" Mason burst excitedly through the hedge</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">clothes on the thorns of the cat-vine, but thinking nothing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of it. We ran for five minutes up a slight slope of shrubs</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and weeds and were stopped by a stone wall. It was no</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ordinary Connecticut dry rubble wall, but rose twelve</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">feet high and was well cemented. Trees made a thicket</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which concealed its existence until we were within a few</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">VER it!" answered Mason and with the agility of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">But our view was not better in the least. Beyond the wall</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wc found that the ground rose, heavily wooded. It was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a scene of some charm and beauty, but our curiosity was</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It lay in a cradle of wooden spars and frames. Behind</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it was a low building of brick with smoke issuing from a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tall chimney. There was no noise except for a rhythmic</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">down a tube, magnified, and led by mirrors to the two ob-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">servation glasses. The range of observation, or rather</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the angle of vision, is about 45 degrees in any direction</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and made huge beckonings with his other arm, but the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> "We haven't another minute to waste," announced Mason</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">ever. Then we turned about and started off--Haworth</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the lead, myself next and Mason (with the compass)</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bringing up the rear. After fifty steps I turned around</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and noticed that the mists had swallowed up the scene of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">direction in which it lay by the confused murmur of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">apart we proceeded over the rocky surface in as straight</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a line as we could, with due alterations called out by</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">a line of shadow appeared. It was the jungle-swamp.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> "We might as well keep together now. We have only</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> I just followed the others blindly, rifle clutched tightly</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">were sore for several days afterwards. We cut across</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and retraced our steps, walking now more quickly than</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">we had done, and soon came to the end of the jungle.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Here it bore away to our left. I wanted to follow it (I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wish we had) but the others felt sure that our course lay</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to our right.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> "If we turn right here," said Haworth, "and keep going</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> But my panic made me obstinate and I started off and</seg>
