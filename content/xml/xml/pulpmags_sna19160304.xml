            <seg type="columnLine">and desolation, and the sense of a great</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Jim Hermon had lost his head over</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Orchid Parry. He had presented to her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the parasitic plant which he had found</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">had gotten himself in bad odor with his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">orchid had been insufficient price for the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">lady, and Hermon had married Mary</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Rice, either in a fit of pique or because</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of her immense fortune. I thought the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">prcbabilities were in favor of the latter</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hypothesis.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Unquestionably aware of her hus-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">band's feeling for Orchid Parry--all</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Cinnapolis knew of it--Mary Hermon</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">showing. Then Miss Parry had taken a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hand in the game again. The absence of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the orchid from her costume argued that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the plant--or plants--had died, and she</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> So much was clear to me. The only</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">a reward for his perilous trip? It would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not be in money--for the green orchid</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was priceless. Connoisseurs had offered</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fabulous sums for a root, but Miss</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Parry had laughed at the idea of selling</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">it. So far as 1 had been able to find out,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">no one had so much as seen it growing.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">She would permit no one to touch the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">faded. That was just the sort of thing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that appealed to her. She liked myster-</seg>

        <ab>
