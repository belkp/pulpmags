He felt himself flushing as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">under an insult, and he muttered:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm much obliged to ye, but I guess ye</seg><seg type="columnLine">needn't bother."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hillis laughed uneasily. He studied Unter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bumer's face for a long time. Finally he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said as if quite anew: "You are going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell the commissioners just what you told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little bit ago was your honest opinion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yards?

He finally dismissed it by</seg><seg type="columnLine">making up his mind that he had done the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper thing, but even as he slept he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamed dreams of anger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next morning, he decided to change his</seg><seg type="columnLine">views concerning the yards--if that were pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible.

He knew that, for one wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, it would have filled him with keen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est pleasure to have battered the president to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death.

Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that the prisoner's nails were care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully trimmed and cared for did not escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dill's eye as he drew near and sat down by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graham in the chair which the warder drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">into place for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A minute the two men looked at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other.

To Piano, everything.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Working on the editions for a month or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two, each edition consisting of 10,000 sheets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he scraped off a little wax here, a little there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he had accumulated, all unnoticed, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball possibly the size of half an egg. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a long time, but Piano had more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough--had seven years yet to serve, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect. Time was no object.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wax was easily hidden at the back of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the drawers, under a pile of old, dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">carded manuscript. When enough had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtained, he smuggled it, via the subterran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ean channels that exist in every prison, to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplice whose exercise hours allowed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">access to the iron door separating the eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard from the corridor leading to the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">office. After a couple of weeks or so, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wax found its way back to Piano. On it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a certain impression. Piano studied this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Confiding in nobody, not even the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">two convicts who worked with him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching his chances, using a minute now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then, when he happened to lie alone in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office-cell, he fashioned a key from a strip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of cast-iron which he detached under the ma</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine where there was not one chance in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred it would ever be missed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one could have made such a key, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wax impression, even with a file and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">appliances, but an ex-safebreaker and yegg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Piano did it, with only the tiny screw-driver</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was used for repairing the machine. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">took him a long, long time, but at last it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was done, the key hidden where the wax had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been, and the wax was crumbled up, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit by bit thrown into the waste-basket and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so lost to view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this time, other work had been going</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward. One of the steel strips of the mime-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ograph frame unaccountably broke, about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">month after Piano began his work on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper. A new one was ordered and put on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pieces were thrown into a drawer, inno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cently enough. There were two of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next day, two pieces were taken away, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warder never thought of fitting them to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether to see if they made up the total</seg><seg type="columnLine">original length. Had he done so, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have found some three inches missing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That three-inch strip of thin steel stayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a few days tucked away under a box.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After that, with now a bit of labor, then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit, it gradually became a file. A file that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Piano knew could easily be bound with</seg><seg type="columnLine">string to the blade of the little screw-driver.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The screw-driver handle, he figured, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be easy to hold and would prove all-around</seg><seg type="columnLine">convenient.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sizing up the situation, at last, he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">account of stock on his inky fingers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Key. All right for that. File. O.

First, he had to choose an</seg><seg type="columnLine">268</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon when he could have at least half</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour to himself in the basement room;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and second, that hour must come coincidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the presence of old man Flynn in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front office. Flynn was a superannuated</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard, stupid and somewhat short of sight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but still serviceable enough to sit at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk and receive visitors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The front office work, of course, was never</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculated to bring him into any direct con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tact with the prisoners. Piano did not reckon</seg><seg type="columnLine">on having much trouble with the man, es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pecially if the lights had not been turned on</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hall at the time when he should pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">ihrough it toward the street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With considerable skill he obtained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">information that Flynn was usually on duty</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monday, Wednesday and Friday afternoons</seg><seg type="columnLine">from four to six. The attempt, then, must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be made at one of those times. Piano waited.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Waiting, he used his few free minutes, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then, to good advantage, constructing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">close imitation of a warder's cap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The abundance of pasteboard, paper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mucilage and cord, gave him all needful ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terials. He fashioned the thing with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">editorial scissors, painted it blue, and black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened the vizor with different colored mime-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ograph inks; then lettered the front of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">very cleverly with the gold paint wherewith</seg><seg type="columnLine">on special occasions the editors were wont to</seg><seg type="columnLine">decorate the cover of their magazine. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was done he surveyed it, in private, under</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dim light, .and assured himself that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">good. Then he emptied a file-box, put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers into other boxes, hid the cap in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">empty box and stood the box in behind a</seg><seg type="columnLine">row of others on the top shelf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I guess,'' said he, " things will be doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon, now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Everything ready, he one evening took a</seg><seg type="columnLine">copy of The Mentor to his cell. This copy</seg><seg type="columnLine">he marked, here and there, with little pin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prick?; he then mailed it out to an .address</seg><seg type="columnLine">in South Boston. It passed inspection all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. The recipient studied it carefully and</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared for action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For more than three weeks he waited pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiently, never by any look or word betray-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing himself, till everything should fall just</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. At last his chance came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a rainy April afternoon, the twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">first of the month. All day the clouds had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowered. Gray mists had hung over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, thickened by smoke and steam from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railway just to west of the prison walls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">by fog drifting up from Miller's River, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond. There had been no exercise in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rain-splashed, dreary yard. Everybody</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed depressed and irritable. The chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">editor, his work done, had been drafted off</seg><seg type="columnLine">to help in the book-keeping department.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Piano and the other man had been left alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was just after four o'clock. An inspection</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been made; Piano knew that the chances</seg><seg type="columnLine">were against anybody else visiting the base-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment till supper time, half an hour later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now!" thought he, straightening up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his work and looking his companion</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair in the eyes with his peculiar squint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tired, eh?" asked the other, sighing as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he paused for a moment over the stencil he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was graving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not half so tired as you'll be in about</seg><seg type="columnLine">one minute," answered Piano, " if you so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as peep! Now, no questions! Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">put your hands together, so--and be quick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm going to tie you up! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man gaped at him; but Piano's words</seg><seg type="columnLine">and look left no room for controversy. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">obeyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Piano lashed him quickly with cord that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fastened a bale of paper. "This," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">he, "will keep you from getting a taste of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark-hole or the sweat-box. I'll gag you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so; now then, all you have to say is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I strong-armed you, and you're safe. You'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">only have to stay this way a little vyhile. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess you can stand it!" With great speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and skill he triced the man, then shoved him</seg><seg type="columnLine">over into a corner, made him lie down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There you are, now," he remarked. "Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member, if you ever snitch--well, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know!" The man, glad enough to help a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow-convict, after all, only winked in sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nal of comprehension and lay still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You ' round ' on me, and I'll get you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure as guns! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Piano gave no further heed to him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened a drawer, fumbled in the back of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought out his steel file and quickly lashed •</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to the/screw-driver. Then, going over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window, he knelt and began working</seg><seg type="columnLine">away at one of the bars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the first stroke, the file plowed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mixture of wax and dirt that had con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cealed a cut more than half-way through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bar. Piano labored fast and hard. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">five minutes he had finished that bar and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had begun on the other, which had likewise</seg><seg type="columnLine">been prepared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A step sounded somewhere outside, far</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the hall. Piano waited, listening in-"</seg><seg type="columnLine">tently. His face was a trifle paler than</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual, but calm. His eyes were steady. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound died away. Again he threw himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the filing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE STEELED CONSCIENCE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">269</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Both bars, now, were cut. Before bending</seg><seg type="columnLine">them inward, Piano did a very curious thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He peeled off his coat and trousers, threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">them on the stone floor, and reached for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bucket that stood in the corner. Into this</seg><seg type="columnLine">he emptied the contents of three tubes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue ink, tubes which he ripped up with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">file and squeezed out almost with a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">gesture. He snatched the big benzin bot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle from the shelf where he had placed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the last clean-up of the machine, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">emptied it into the bucket, too. Hastily he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred the mass with the scissors. The ben-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zin quickly dissolved the thick, pasty ink.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There resulted a large quantity of thin blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Into this liquid he threw the trousers, sop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped them up and down, turned them, dipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. He drew them out and wrung them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From dark grey they had become dark blue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The coat he treated likewise. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly enough liquid left. He swabbed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat round and round, spreading the color.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He held it up and surveyed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Rough work," said he, judicially. "But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it'll have to do, on a pinch. After the rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">wets me down, I guess the general effect will</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass. It's got to! But Fill just take these</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, anyhow, in case of trouble." And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped the scissors into his pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It took him hardly a minute to dress, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon he stood in the office-cell, clad from</seg><seg type="columnLine">head to foot in wrinkled blue clothes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Lucky there is lots of rain, this p.m!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he added.- Then lie set the cap on his head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran over to the desk, took the key that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had made, and pocketed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mum, you!" he commanded, turning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tied-up convict on the floor. " You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how long a boxman's memory is! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A moment he stood listening. Came a far</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroke on a gong, followed by the faint slam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming of a door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Work's over," said he. "They'll be at</seg><seg type="columnLine">supper, now. Couldn't be a finer time! " He</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused, as though he had forgotten some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. " Hm-m! " he added. Then he drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scissors from his wet pocket, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">two or three firm cuts squared off his pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard. " I guess that will help some," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">concluded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Over to the window Tie stepped, seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">first one bar, then the other, and with a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">markable display of strength, bent them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauled them inward, twisted them aside. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched a mucilage-pot from the desk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">,-poured a handful of mucilage into his palm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smeared it quickly over the large pane</seg><seg type="columnLine">of glass. Then, picking up a sheet of news-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">paper, he pressed it against the gummed</seg><seg type="columnLine">window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One sharp blow with the scissors handle;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass broke, but, held by the paper, did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not fall jingling to the bricks outside, as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would otherwise have done. Piano deftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">enlarged the hole. In less than two min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes lie had broken the pane almost entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and had laid the pieces of glass on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor. The way was now clear, for him, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the yard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood an instant peering out. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">yard was deserted. Under the white glare of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a light on the wall, nearly opposite, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet bricks and little puddles of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparkled unevenly. No sound, save the pat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering of the rain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I guess she'll do," remarked Piano, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a calm voice. "So long, buddy!" He paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">no further attention to the tied-up man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner, but stuck his head out through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the window, cautiously looked up the yard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then down it, noted that nobody was in sight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and--silent as a ghost--straddled the sill. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">•second later, he was outside in the rain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One glance told him that the guard upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall was around the corner, to westward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the coast was clear. Quietly, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">concernedly, he walked with a quick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">firm step down the yard, turned an angle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prison, and approached the door lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into the corridor that he knew com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">municated with the office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I sure do smell of gasoline, something</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage!" thought die.

With a precision,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a skill, a nicety due to long years of experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence he manipulated it, listening intently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He tried again. It resisted. He gave it the</seg><seg type="columnLine">full strength of his hand. The lock yielded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grating; the bolt slid back.

Piano reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of the steps, turned to the right and</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced in the direction of the little tri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">angular space where Chapman, Austin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Washington Streets all converge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had now perhaps fifty yards to go be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he could swing into Chapman and make</seg><seg type="columnLine">a break for the railroad, a quarter of a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">southwest--his objective point. Flynn, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steps, was bawling something after him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew not what. Other cries arose. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">gong began to bang and rattle. Piano spat</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a curse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing to gain, now, he realized, by sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terfuge or any more delay. He jammed his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cap tight down onto his head, picked up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels and broke into a swift run. Behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him he heard cries and sharp, excited voices.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A revolver cracked. Past his head zooned a</seg><seg type="columnLine">waspish bit of lead. Piano fled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up in front of him loomed a man, a civi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lian, with outspread arms. Piano leaped at</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, brandishing the scissors. The man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage died; he jumped aside and swore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Piano doubled the corner of the wall, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, and like an arrow sped along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brick sidewalk through the gloom. His feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shod in rough prison leather, clattered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid-fire tattoo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were only a few people abroad. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">street was ill lit by occasional flaring gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamps. Piano's blue clothes and vizored</seg><seg type="columnLine">cap confuscd folk. He had a block or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">the start of any real pursuit. And, cleverly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he shouted as he ran:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Hey! Stop! Stop! Head him off!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hey, there he goes! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus shouting, pointing wildly, he di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">A'erted attention as he passed the gaping,</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional citizen like a streak of blue, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague and swift form in the dow'n-settling</seg><seg type="columnLine">fog. That was all he wanted, now, just to</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent interference from in front. As for</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything behind, he knew he could outdis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance all comers for a few minutes, till his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind should begin to fail. " Just let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the track, and I'm all right!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now he was there; now he leaped past the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gateman's shanty, darted westward, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering crowd shouting behind him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">impeding the officials. Now, right at hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw a train of box cars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Here's luck, eh ? " thought he, and like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm-blown wraith vanished under one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up again, on the other side, he scuttled</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the freiglit-yard. Behind him he</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard shouts, cries, confusion. Despite his</seg><seg type="columnLine">panting breath, the pain in his lungs, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaping of his overtaxed heart, he laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " The bulls will get a run for their coin</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyhow, a good one!" he gibed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There he goes!" yelled a voice. A rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">came whirling, then a lump of coal. Piano</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a dive between a couple of cars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled on hands and knees, unseen, across</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spur track, and reached another string of</seg><seg type="columnLine">empties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, as he scooted along the cinders be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween that string and a file of oil-tanks, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">overall-clad brakeman suddenly barred his</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage. Piano saw the man crouch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">double his fists.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Waiting not to be attacked, the fugitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE STEELED CONSCIENCE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">271</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">snatched up a broken fish-plate, weighing</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps ten pounds, and hurled it, full force,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with most excellent aim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The brakeman flung up his arm, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped it, limp and broken, with a howl</seg><seg type="columnLine">Piano rushed at him, landed him a blow'</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the jaw, and passed, agile as a hunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">jack-rabbit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He heard a whistle blowing; then came</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rapid tolling of a big bell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Lots doing, eh ?

Two tracks from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, a clattering bump-bump-bump told him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a train was being moved. Warily he dodged</seg><seg type="columnLine">under a car, crawled across a vacant track</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reached the slow-moving train.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stepped between two of the cars and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoisted himself on the bumpers. Crouching,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was carried slowly past the tower. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he heard angry yells. Rightly he surmised</seg><seg type="columnLine">that some officer or other was shouting at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engine-men, ordering them to shift no</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling-stock till the yard had been searched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a satirical smile he peered out from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shelter. Dimly through the fog he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">men stumbling along the track toward him;</seg><seg type="columnLine">two or three lanterns splotched the gloom</seg><seg type="columnLine">with yellow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come along, and welcome!" he gibed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing over to the other side of the train,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which now gritted to a stop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the brake-shoes stopped squealing, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped lightly to the ground. "There she</seg><seg type="columnLine">is! " he exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before him rose a high board fence, over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of which he saw piles of seasoning</seg><seg type="columnLine">lumber. Piano skirted this fencej slinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">double in the railroad-ditch, slopping</seg><seg type="columnLine">through mud and water, directly toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise of pursuit which now sounded ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">louder. As he went, he scrutinized the fence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Ah!

Calmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he filled the pipe and lighted it. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoking like an honest man weary with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard day's work, he made his way through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lumber-yard to the gate, passed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">unchallenged with the crowd of home-going</seg><seg type="columnLine">toilers, and thereafter vanished wholly from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ken of the law.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just a little over a week later, Number</seg><seg type="columnLine">2704 received by mail from New York a</seg><seg type="columnLine">book which, after having been inspected at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office, was allowed to reach him.

In the next instant the other offi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cers had Longbaugh handcuffed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " G-r-r-r-r-r--" came in a hoarse guttural</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Longbaugh's set teeth, while his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly glowed green. He did not attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">move. From his hip-pocket the officers took</seg><seg type="columnLine">another gun, a .45 single-action, that may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen to-day in the historic collection of noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Frms in St. Louis police headquarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the prisoner, like a chained grizzly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was led to the patrol-wagon, which had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">summoned with more police.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as gentle as a lamb now, but his eves</seg><seg type="columnLine">were like a hawk's. Large, gray, with great</seg><seg type="columnLine">black pupils, they took in everything, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doors to the windows, back to the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him, then suddenly blazed as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced for a fleeting instant toward a corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Forgotten Gun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That glance was so vivid that the officers</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned instinctively. On a small table in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner was a large revolver which some</seg><seg type="columnLine">officer had carelessly laid down and forgot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten. Three officers made a jump for the gun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the others stepped between it and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Longbaugh, the game's up. Any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one else here with you?" asked Desmond</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasantly. The prisoner did not reply. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">did not even look at his questioner. He ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to be very disinterested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " He'll get over that when he's had time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cool off and think it over," said Desmond.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" Put him in ' the holdover,' and allow no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to see him or speak to him--not even any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the police, remember," the chief added.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So they led him down-stairs and placed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a dark cell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then began ten days of as hard a game of</seg><seg type="columnLine">"sweating" the truth out of a prisoner as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Desmond ever knew.

The note-book contained some figures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, that seemed to be the amount of money</seg><seg type="columnLine">each of the gang had received from the hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. A brass key that looked like a hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">key, was also found on the prisoner.

From that region he was brought back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to earth by a shrill and familiar " Hallo! "</seg><seg type="columnLine">Opening his eyes, he saw Freddie in front</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him, and Freddie's face plainly showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he felt genuine pleasure in again meet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his friend of the badge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Morning, Freddie," said Pete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good morning," replied Freddie, with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">accent on the first word. .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How's de baby sister?" went on Pete,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after an awkward pause.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " She's all right," replied the boy. " Have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you any little sisters?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Naw," said Pete.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Any brothers?" pursued Freddie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Naw."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Freddie looked puzzled, and a trifle sorry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but continued: " Where does your father and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother live ? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Ain't got none,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The boy gazed thoughtfully at the man in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of him, and asked: " Who puts you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed and hears you say your prayers? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Peter the Great shifted uneasily in his seat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" I puts myself to bed," he asserted.

Instead, he reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his pocket and produced the doll.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Freddie took it with a grave " Thank you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, after examining it closely, he said: " You</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't mind if I give this to Beatrice, will you?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am a boy, and I don't play with dolls."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dat's dead right," assented Pete. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never t'ought of dat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," added Freddie earnestly, "I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">much obliged to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At this moment there was an interruption.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A French maid, wheeling the perambulator</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which was baby Beatrice, appeared on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked suspiciously at Pete, caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold of Freddie's hand, and led him away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatening to tell his mother about his " talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to these brutal men." . She also insisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Freddie should throw away the doll, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">on this point the little chap was obdurate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sticking to the toy manfully, while Pete</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned approvingly at his action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  From that time on for two or three weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pete, pretty nearly every fine day, was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found in the park trying to speak to his small</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend. Occasionally he brought with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">some bizarre gift, such as a carved coconut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell which he had managed to persuade a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailor friend to yield, a, dried star-fish, ba-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nanas, and, in one instance, a highly colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">lithograph of the Jeffries-Johnson fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Freddie's parents, acting on the reports of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the French maid, naturally objected to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquaintance that existed between the child</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his queer friend. They harbored thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of kidnapers and other equally unpleasant in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividuals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So it came about one day that Peter, clean,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sporting an immaculate collar and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath devoid of the odor of tobacco and whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ky, was warned by a park policeman that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">park squad was "onto hirrf^" and that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good mind to take him to the arsenal on gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral principles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">PETER THE GREAT.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">321</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This followed hard on a statement made to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him by Freddie, while the latter's lips quiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered regretfully, that he had been forbidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak to or to even look at his Cherry Hill</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peter turned away from the park. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, in the society of the gang, in an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">availing attempt to forget the boy and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">affection for him, he imbibed more than his</seg><seg type="columnLine">quota of whisky, only to awake the following</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning feeling disgusted with himself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his surroundings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He was not accustomed to take his rules of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life from the police, and, in spite of the warn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that he had received, he still continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunt those portions of the park where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew his little favorite was usually to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Sometimes he caught sight of the child,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and felt himself rewarded for his trip up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">town. On his endeavor to speak to Fred-</seg><seg type="columnLine">die, however, the boy,, with tears starting, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes, would always answer: "I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk; mother says I am not to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  With a little sob, he would pass on, leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Pete to wander gloomily down-town, feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a distaste for the " hill " by contrast with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his late happiness up-town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day Pete, in spite of himself, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">again journeyed to the park,, and late in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon was leaving it &amp;t the Sixty-Sixth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street entrance, sullen, weary, and disappoint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed. As he ascended the steps he saw, to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">delight, in front of him Freddie and Beatrice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompanied by their white-capped guardian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Not daring to show himself, and yet eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look once more upon the face of the boy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he followed them cautiously up the avenue</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Seventieth Street.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There the nurse and her charge started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross the street. The avenue was crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with moving vehicles. Between them the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nurse thought she saw an opening, but an au-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomobile suddenly bore down upon her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">simultaneously from the other direction more</seg><seg type="columnLine">carriages began to shut her in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The automobile did its best to slack up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But--a tire snapped. The report started two</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirited horses just behind. Instantly the ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals began to rear and tug furiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a shriek, the panic-stricken woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned the children, and sought safety in</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Peter had seen it all. He dashed in under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heads of the crowding horses, and, in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant, over the driver's'seat. He reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the children just as one of the frightened team</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the baby-carriage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next moment he had swung Freddie</seg><seg type="columnLine">onto his shoulder and rescued baby Beatrice</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the entangling folds of her lap-robe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">handing her to a scared coachman behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Then, ir. some miraculous fashion, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to make his way to the sidewalk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being grazed on the forehead by a glancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Freddie was in a state of childish panic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indeed, Pete had a good deal of difficulty in</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding the terror-frenzied child in his arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the sidewalk was reached.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There the little fellow's fear-befogged brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow or other identified Pete with the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cidents of the moments before, and he shrieked</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his rescuer to put him down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dat's all right, Freddie," began Pete</seg><seg type="columnLine">soothingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Let me go!

It is doubtful</seg><seg type="columnLine">if Legs Brown himself knew.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a boomer brakeman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, as such, he traveled by no</seg><seg type="columnLine">schedule whatever.

Hence, Brown's own nick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">name. Notwithstanding his fragile propor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, however, when occasion arose he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">wield his huge fists with force sufficient to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fracture a jaw-bone, or drive a man's ear</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the side of his head--a fact that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been demonstrated to the sorrow of more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">one belligerent hobo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the long train of flat cars writhed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">and out among the sand-hills, Brown, sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned a short distance ahead of the caboose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the only person visible. According to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his habit when unusually elated, he stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly erect, with hands clasped before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and his soft hat pulled down over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bullet-head, in the manner of a Hebrew</seg><seg type="columnLine">comedian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At intervals he wailed forth the words of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a song to the effect that the life of a sailor is</seg><seg type="columnLine">fraught with hardship, inasmuch as a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth, Johnny by name, had been drowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the deep, blue sea. Many verses he sang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and each one varied from its predecessor only</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the name of the victim. From which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">symptoms, it was plain diat something con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducive to his happiness had occurred, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">might soon be expected to occur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His joy, in this instance, was that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">anticipation, and its source may be told in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one word--trouble. Although he never vol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">untarily sought a conflict, Brown was not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave the scene of a fight while there re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained a chance of participating therein.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the last stop, Murphy, the conductor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had received a telegram warning him to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared for an attack when they entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sandville. A large number of hoboes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered there, and had taken possession of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the town, explaining to the unhappy citizens</seg><seg type="columnLine">the necessity of majority-rule, if the republi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can form of government was to be maintained</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Previous experience similar to this had</seg><seg type="columnLine">detracted from the novelty of the situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">for die few inhabitants of Sandville; but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoboes were becoming bolder, and spoke of</seg><seg type="columnLine">capturing the next train that came thidier, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purpose of making their escape. Where-</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon, the station-agent had grown alarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sent the telegram.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Among his other characteristics, Brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">was intensely loyal to the road that chanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to employ him. Any action such as that con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">templated by the hoboes was resented as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal affront. Furthermore, at this par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticular time he knew that the president of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road was but a few hours behind in his spe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cial, and Brown deemed it his duty to do all</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his power to prevent any unpleas;(ntness</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the great man should arrive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Therefore, as they drew near the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">359</seg><seg type="columnLine">360</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hamlet he returned to the caboose and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred with the conductor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " They's no use runnin' clear in, Jim. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">better stop on the edge of this here metropo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lis, while I go in an' reconsider the force of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enemy, as they say in the array."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " I wouldn't advise you to go alone, Legs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You can't tell what those boes'll do if they're</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Why, Jim, you know them fellers're like</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheep. The only reason I can see for 'em act-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in' like this is because they got a leader.

Besides, if a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bunch of us go in, they'll git ready for</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, you can go while we stop for</seg><seg type="columnLine">water.

Then, turning to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's comrades, he broached the business of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " I want to tell you dirty bums that I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to take charge of this here city govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment from now till I leave. If any of you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got anything to say, why, you can step up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">say it. You might be able to bluff these pore</seg><seg type="columnLine">devils that live here, but I've seen too many</seg><seg type="columnLine">boes not to know what you're made of.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're all under arrest, an' the first man that</seg><seg type="columnLine">moves'll git plugged." The brakeman placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hand on his hip-pocket, which, by the way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">held nothing but his red bandanna handker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Now, I want to see the man that's at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of this outfit. Who put you up to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">job?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of the men shrugged his shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">contemptuously. "You better wait till you</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear from Bully Hackett before you pinch</seg><seg type="columnLine">this gang. Guess that's him now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Following a sound of shuffling footsteps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the illustrious leader himself appeared in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway. Bully Hackett's visage was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of which the worst dreams are made.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While it was rendered somewhat vacant by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the absence of his nose, one of his eyes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the major portion of his upper lip--unwilling</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacrifices to the god of war--his expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost none of its ferocity on that account, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shaggy hair and beard gave him a look</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was scarcely human.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Mr. Hackett had been engaged on a private</seg><seg type="columnLine">foraging expedition, and knew nothing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">happenings within the saloon, nor saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brakeman, as he came toward the bar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Wot's the matter?" he inquired savagely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Didn't ye see that freight pull in?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  By way of attracting his attention, Brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck him smartly on the part of his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">formerly occupied by his nose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Yes, an' she'll lay there till she rots, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">she waits fer you to take her out. By the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">I git through with you, you'll be ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawl in your hole," said the brakeman. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen the train-crew_ gathered in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadows outside the door, and now had little</seg><seg type="columnLine">to fear from the other hoboes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Possessed of keen perceptions, as are all</seg><seg type="columnLine">LEGS BROWN HAS A ROUND-UP.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">361</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">great leaders, Hackett at once suspected that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brakeman liad struck him intentionally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his one eye gleamed redly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yah-h-li!" he snarled, too angry for</seg><seg type="columnLine">more intelligible speech.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better take off your coat, because I'm not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a goin' to knock you out. I'll make you quit</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a dog, so the rest of these gents'll see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are," stated Brown, removing his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer garment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hackett waited not for further advice, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashed out so viciously with his right arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Brown was taken unawares', and, had it</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been for the bar at his back, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gone down ignominiously. Even so, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in an evil plight, for the tramp, seeing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his opportunity, rushed in, raining blows ,on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face and body of his opponent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, indeed, did it seem that the brake-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had been overconfident in his boasting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The other hoboes shouted encouragement to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their champion, and the train-crew were only</seg><seg type="columnLine">restrained from joining in the fight by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conductor, who continued to voice his belief</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Brown's prowess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Veteran of a hundred battles, Brown's first</seg><seg type="columnLine">move was to stop the flailing arms. This he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did by the simple expedient of twining his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own about them. Gradually, with the appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent sinuosity of a boa-constrictor, he wrapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his limbs about those of the other, and, for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, lifted his own feet clear of the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making Hackett support the weight of both</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bodies. Then, unmindful of his strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gles, Brown as carefully freed himself, send-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the hobo backward with a solid jolt on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot where his first blow had landed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Brown was intent on proving a theory that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had long held, namely, that a man, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">inwardly a coward, may fight with seeming</seg><seg type="columnLine">bravery so long as the blows of his adversary</seg><seg type="columnLine">have not the appearance of being well-judged</seg><seg type="columnLine">or aimed with accuracy; but that a succession</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blows, however light, on a sensitive spot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">will make him quit if he has the least vestige</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a yellow streak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the next few minutes, so fiercely</seg><seg type="columnLine">did Hackett assail him that the brakeman</seg><seg type="columnLine">was almost entirely on the defensive. More</seg><seg type="columnLine">than once he felt the impact of the tramp's</seg><seg type="columnLine">horny fist on his face, but he still held to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose. When the opening offered, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand flashed out, striking with invariable</seg><seg type="columnLine">precision the spot he had selected for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hackett manifested his displeasure at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">mode of warfare, evidently thinking that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown acted dishonorably in profiting by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">absence of his nasal feature. At each of-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fense the tramp rushed in with the avowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">intention of ' demolishing the whole of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown's material body; and, to avoid these</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushes, the brakeman executed a series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumps that would have done credit to a grass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopper. Finding no obstruction in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, Hackett went on until his head struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall, which so diminished his speed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was enabled to make a short turn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again face his opponent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a long time they fought, neither gain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the advantage. Brown was bleeding free-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly from the mouth, and one eye was fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">swelling shut; but his antagonist was also</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly bruised, the remnant of his nose being</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite raw. Of the two, Hackett seemed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more fatigued. Excessive drinking had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him short-winded, and he breathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily. The brakeman now began to force</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fighting, striking more often and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater force, but ever in the same spot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hackett gave ground, and once he glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, as if seeking a way of escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stand up an' fight, why don't you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">panted Brown. " You claim to be the cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peen bo. Well, I ain't no kind of a cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peen, an' here you're tryin' to quit before I</seg><seg type="columnLine">git warmed up. What kind of fightin' do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you call that? Come on an' mix it a little."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Hackett had had enough. His spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gone, and he slunk back into the crowd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whimpering.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop 'im, boys; stop 'im," he pleaded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" My Heavens, my mug's broke in! I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight no more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You don't need to be scared. I'm satis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed," answered Brown. " I knew you was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quitter the minute I seen you, an' I wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show you up, so you couldn't lead these</seg><seg type="columnLine">dubs into no more deviltry. What'll we do</seg><seg type="columnLine">with 'em, Jim?" he asked, turning to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conductor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The best thing will be to lock 'em in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">box car, an' hand 'em over to the sheriff at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rennington," replied Murphy, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarding the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the dark recesses of the caboose he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought forth an old revolver.

Five miles be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond, the left side of the canon fell away so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the right-of-way came out on the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face again, and continued due west into die</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the cut-off, 'the distance was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve and a half miles from Supai to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forks, where, before, it had been sixty-five.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rails had been put in from Ash Fork</seg><seg type="columnLine">as fast as the road-bed was cut out.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sure walking Turkey. About twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet from the tunnel Bart let him go. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't need an ear-trumpet to hear what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him, although I was a good three car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengths to the windward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, Mr. Smartley," Bart remarked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a voice as soft as the rough side of a coarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">file, " if you have any further doubts as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">who is running this job, you might take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter up direct with Mr. Martin.

As I had made it a</seg><seg type="columnLine">point to get a little closer to the scene of acr</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, I heard him say:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Miss Martin,.

The best Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Martin got was his promise to take her over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire piece of track just so soon as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered it entirely safe. With that, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked over to the engine with us, helped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lady up into the cab, and for once Den-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ny Reagan started off like a gentleman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was much obliged to Denny for run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning so slow.

I let her know that Mr. Bartholomew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">E.	Goldsworthy was the man who conceived</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea of building the cut-off, that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man who had built it, and that in more</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways than one he'was a greater man than he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time we got up to Supai, Miss Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin wasn't talking very much, and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that day-after-to-morrow look in her eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She wasn't seeing much of the landscape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She didn't see Smartley when we 'most</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened the life out of him, as we passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He edged up against the rocks so tight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that I wouldn't be surprised if you could</seg><seg type="columnLine">find his imprint there yet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A week went by, and Smartley did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear in the vicinity of the tunnel. Bart</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw him every evening at the conferences in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the private car, which had become a daily</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurrence; and one morning, when I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">loading a flat with steel beams, I saw Smart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley, Miss Martin, and her mother starting</seg><seg type="columnLine">out for a little stroll up the mountain. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">night the private car went over to Williams,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was almost a week before it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought back and set in on the spur again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When it did return, General Manager Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tin sent a messenger for Bart. After the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conference an extra gang of laborers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered down to the tunnel from the section</seg><seg type="columnLine">just above Supai.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were on short time, sure enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everybody was predicting that the tunnel</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be through within a month. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, I listened to all the straight tips I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard, and then I went to Bart with them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and asked him to give me his best guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">on it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bart got out a blue-print. By standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my head and looking cross-eyed, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost able to make out what it represented.</seg><seg type="columnLine">However, Bart knew just what it was, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he demonstrated to me that there was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one more week's work for a few able-bodied</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, and the tunnel would be in shape so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it could be used.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There would be a few little things to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">done after that--putting on the final coat of</seg><seg type="columnLine">varnish, hanging the mottoes at the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trances, and the like; but when .Bart got</seg><seg type="columnLine">through explaining, although I didn't quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand some of the figures carried out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sixth decimal place, plus " X " over</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Y," I just went out and added up how</seg><seg type="columnLine">much I had bet on the game so far, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubled it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was betting a hundred dollars to a bean.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I couldn't help but feel sorry for the Mexi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can inhabitants; for if I won, and demand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed quick payment, I would have had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bean crop of the United States and Mexico</seg><seg type="columnLine">sewed up in a sack and a call on th£ fu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures for five years to come. Then the bears</seg><seg type="columnLine">got busy, and I came near going broke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they brought that extra gang down</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Supai and^pitt them on the job, Bart</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a mistake.i There was one fellow who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a large, scar on his head. Bart should</seg><seg type="columnLine">never have allowed him on the premises. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the same gentleman with whom Bart was</seg><seg type="columnLine">having the little argument that evening at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Cinder Pit when I first met the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">ON SHORT TIME.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">371</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">roadmaster. If Bart had forgotten him, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mexican had a better memory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I suppose the court would rule that my</seg><seg type="columnLine">testimony, being based on hearsay, should</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be put on record, but my source of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation was the Mexican saved ' from</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowning in Cosnino Creek by Bart Goldie;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and though what I say now might not in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluence the court, what he told me direct</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly made a strong case in my mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Bart and I went to work that Fri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day morning, Bart was in great spirits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " I'll show you an imitation of a real day's</seg><seg type="columnLine">work," he remarked, just as if getting up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning so early that he met himself go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to bed the night before wasn't enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence that he was doing a real job of</seg><seg type="columnLine">work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he got down to the tunnel he made</seg><seg type="columnLine">things fly. It was about ten o'clock. Bart</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the tunnel. The extra gang was</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing some minor work at the east entrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the long hole, and as we had all the steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">.--even the rails which were to go into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel as fast as it was cleaned out--down</seg><seg type="columnLine">,to the spot, I had little to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I had never watched the operations at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of the excavating, and I wandered down</seg><seg type="columnLine">into-it until I found Bart. I thought I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would get a few dollars' worth of sight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing, provided Bart didn't take me by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">collar and march me out, as he had Smartley.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I must have been in- there about an hour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we heard a yell. It wasn't much of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">yell at that. Sounded as if some one had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped on a setter pup's tail. With the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel walls to hold the sound in, the effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't just exactly pleasant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Bart and I were down at the head of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drive, more than a quarter of a mile from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the east entrance. We both heard the yell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Bart started "to go back and investigate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then came another yell. It sounded to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">like some one calling: "Goldsworthy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The floor of the tunnel came up and hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in the face. I felt an awful pain in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears, and, being badly in need of rest, I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">off to sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I don't know how long I slept there on</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rock floor--quite a while, I guess; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I came to, Bart was kneeling over me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a torch was burning near on the tunnel floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if the yell I had heard before I went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep was creepy, the chorus of vocal noises</seg><seg type="columnLine">that greeted me when I came to would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a credit to a train-load of snakes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  , " How do you feel ? " asked Bart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," I replied. "What's hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened ? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Cave-in about a hundred yards inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mouth of the tunnel. Can you walk? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Walk!

Bart inspected it as if he was look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for a diamond, and I sat down on a gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erous chunk of stone and hoped that some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one would tell Miss Fowler that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven me to this miserable fate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Mexicans put in their time in a mara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thon race from the cave-in down to the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the drive and back, and then over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same route again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would have been a great race if half of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them hadn't collided with the other half in</seg><seg type="columnLine">making the turn.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">torches began to dance about, the blaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed dying down. I wondered what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become of the Mexican and his saint, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then Bart Goldie took me by the shoulder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook me until my bones rattled, and held</seg><seg type="columnLine">the torch down so close to my face that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost took a bite out of the flame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bart looked awful big right then. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't see up as far as his head, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice sounded as if it was coming from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of Bill Williams Mountain and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">down a well at the bottom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Baldy!

Once I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, and there was Bart still swinging that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sledge; his torch was sitting up on a boulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his side. Dugan had gone. I suppose he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran off with Bennett.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, I remembered I wanted to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bart about the pay-checks which were de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posited in the Winslow Bank. Of course,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they wouldn't be of any use to me; and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Fowler was born in Kansas, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed through that State once, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about tiie closest kin I had. I wanted Bart</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see that she got them, but I didn't want</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to spend them on Bennett. I staggered</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to where he was, and I made him stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">work long enough to hear my story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Bart Goldie," I began, " I've got a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand dollars down in the Winslow Bank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I must have about seven billion dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">bet that you will finish this tunnel in time</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the mail special.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't know that I had been punctuated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a period for about twelve hours later. I woke</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to find myself in the little crib with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fussy covers, looking straight into the eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Miss Fowler. I knew that I was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing groundhog after having seen my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow. I was wondering if I would hit a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloudy day the next time I heard her voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mr. Murray, are you awake?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You know, I didn't dare tell her I was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">because I wasn't sure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know.

I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I heard her laugh, and I opened my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes again, and, durn me, I was awake.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Right back there in that good old hospital,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Miss Fowler waiting on me again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I began to remember things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's Bart Goldie?"

While I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">didn't have a chance to look over the ground .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">until after the tunnel had been completed, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had a source of information which placed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me in possession of a few facts. While they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were never made public, they finally reached</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the right party, and put an entirely different</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">face on the whole affair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That Mexican whom Bart pulled out of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Cosnino Creek, a short time after he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">made roadmaster, proved to have been the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">owner of that warning screech which Bart</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">„ and I had heard just before the cave-in. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seems that while I was sitting there in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tunnel, trying to make an inventory of my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">good deeds so that I might have them in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dexed for ready' reference should I be called</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upon to show my credentials, Bart had taken</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a body from beneath the rock which had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fallen in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Th^t body and myself found ourselves</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">occupying the same ward in the hospital;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and while I, according to Miss Fowler, had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only been troubled with a tendency to talk</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in my sleep, the Mexican was really in bad</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   His head was battered in, one arm was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">broken, a few of his slats were cracked, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he was almost beyond the need of the rip-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">track; but Miss Fowler's nursing, assisted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by the doctor's pills, brought him far enough</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">back to life to enable him to talk. Before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I came out of the hospital I had a story</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that made me sit up and take a little notice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The Mexican's name was.Juan something</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or other. He told me that he had been carry-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing powder from the little powder-house to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the tunnel for over a month. On the day</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the accident he had passed Smartley talk-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing to Romero Garcia, who will be remem-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bered as the man with whom Bart once had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">quite a tobasco-sauce argument over at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cinder Pit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About two hours later, Juan Bean-eater,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Chili-chaser, saw Garcia lighting a fuse</seg><seg type="columnLine">which ran up the side of the tunnel about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards from the entrance. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">Juan saw this his intellect, which had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown signs of working faster than a slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk, became wildly active, and it was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">noise factory working at full capacity' which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had disturbed the dark quietude down to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the head of the tunnel where Bgrt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I were talking when the explosion came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seems that Juan, after going into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel about a hundred yards beyond where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw Garcia light the fuse, decided that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be unable to reach the men in time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">warn them and get back to the sunlight, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he turned back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He told me that he made just as fast time</seg><seg type="columnLine">going out as he did coming in, but he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">get by the charge of blasting powder. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big works came off, some of the scatter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing rock caught up with him, and he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">within an ace of being transformed into an</seg><seg type="columnLine">imported porous plaster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This little piece of gossip interested me;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but there was another trifling item of news</seg><seg type="columnLine">for which I yearned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A friend loaned me a novel once, entitled</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Mabel's Other Husband; or, Who Drew a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lemon?"

They have been passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over by the passenger and freight trains of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">company, and, according' to statements from offi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cials of the road, have measured up to every re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quirement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Concrete cross-ties have been made before this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but on being tested, have exhibited a lack of elas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticity, making them impracticable, as a rigid road-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed is injurious to rolling stock. However, this tie</seg><seg type="columnLine">is said to overcome this objection. It is made in</seg><seg type="columnLine">two sections, being disjoined in the middle, thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving elasticity. A cross-section extends out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">each side, slightly beveled from the center bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to each end of this cross-section, which allows the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail the necessary spring. A steel bar, countersunk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is placed on top of the tie sections which joins the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail, extending under the rail, and clamped on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside of the rail, while a steel clamp on (he inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rail, resting against a boss on the steel bar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and inside of the rail, is secured to the cement tie</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a bolt running through the tie. This arrange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment makes it impossible for the rails to spread or</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The problem of securing a cross tie to substitute</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood has long been a subject of deep concern to all</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroads. The life of the present wood tie is from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">five to seven years, while that of the concrete tie is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">practically indefinite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Jt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">YOU MAY--AND WE THANK YOU!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Editor, The Railroad Man's Magazine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">MAY I take the liberty of sending you a rail-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">road poem which I happened to come</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">across?

It adds another chapter to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long story of railroad men in South America:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We found a nice bunch of fellows on the Pan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ama Railway, and the train-master passed us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Panama without a question. There T left Dodson</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took the boat for Lima, or rather Callao, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the seaport. I found a tremendous difference in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rates charged for passage on this steamer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">First-class fare was more money than I had, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck passage was surprisingly cheap. I invested</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that and fixed the rest of it with a steward as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as they cleared the yard, without any trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all. Most of the passengers were customers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his, as that seemed to be the usual method of pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cedure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arrived in Lima O. K., and, on reporting, found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that my job was at the front, and I had to cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of the hill to get to it. Many people are</seg><seg type="columnLine">made very sick by the rarefied air at the summit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they set a car off up toward the top for those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who wish to go back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I remembered your theory about equalizing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">(•ressure of air on the ear-drums by frequent swal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing during the ascent, and, whether that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything to do with it or not, I suffered no incon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venience except from the cold. I found use for</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the clothes I could comfortably carry, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not any too warm at that. The Indians who live</seg><seg type="columnLine">in those mountains seem utterly indifferent to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold. You often see them standing barefooted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the snow to watch the train go by.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I drew a freight run, bought a lot of clothes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked myself into a good tight caboose with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good stove in it. Had pulled down a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pays, learned the road, and was beginning to figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">- .n how long it was going to take me to save that</seg><seg type="columnLine">two thousand, when--it happened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wc were running down the hill, on the inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mountains, with five flats loaded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">"cholo" laborers and their families, moving camp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead of the engine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I did not like the make-up, but there was no help</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it. as there was no siding where wc picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">them up. The line was nearly all sharp curves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tvith the country straight up on one side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">track and straight down on the other. Just a</seg><seg type="columnLine">.rooked scratch on the hillside.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I took the head-end myself, put a " cholo "</seg><seg type="columnLine">brakeman on the third car back to pass signals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we started. Wc were dropping down at about</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen miles an hour, when I sighted a big boulder</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that had rolled from up-country somewhere right</seg><seg type="columnLine">onto the middle of the track.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I signaled, and yelled, but that brakeman was</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking to a woman, and the engine cab was out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight behind the curve. Of course, a woman was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cause of my trouble, as usual, though I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">even know her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I sprung the air, side-stepped, and some few of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people fell off, but three cars were pushed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge and fell, rolling down an almost perpen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicular slope for about three hundred feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something like two hundred men, women, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">children went with them and were, all of them who</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not fly, more or less hurt. Twenty-one were</seg><seg type="columnLine">found dead up to the time I left. I had a main line</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounder in the caboose, and cut in on the wire to</seg><seg type="columnLine">report and order the ambulance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I consuJted with the engineer as to the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing for us to do. You know the law there holds</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "captain" and "maquinista" responsible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">any injuries caused by their train. The engineer</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that he was afraid to take to the country, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its ice, snow, and Indians in the mountains, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwellings few and far apart, and preferred lo stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">and take his chances with the authorities. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that he was really afraid of the country. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too bull-headed to run.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I rubbered into the jail at Lima once, and pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred to die some other way. I stayed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreck as long as I could do anything to help the</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation,'but when the relief train was reported,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I packed my grip. Taking the "cholo" brakeman</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had caused the trouble, with me, I faded away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The brakeman did not want to go at first, but as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed him for guide, interpreter, and pack animal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I talked the fear of the law into him until he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as anxious as I was to escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I don't like to think about that trip. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been told since that I could have gotten out through</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brazil, via the Amazon River, with less hardship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the only trail I knew was the Pacific Ocean, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">I headed west. That is the roof of the world, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, and it isn't a flat roof, either. It is clear up</seg><seg type="columnLine">above civilization. Nothing can live long up there</seg><seg type="columnLine">except those Indians and the llamas. The mule</seg><seg type="columnLine">line is just above the snow line, and they use llamas</seg><seg type="columnLine">for packing freight in the high hills.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A llama is a slightly overgrown goat who spits</seg><seg type="columnLine">at you instead of butting. They can live and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrive on snow and mighty thin air--and there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing else up there. There are mighty few towns</seg><seg type="columnLine">and roads in the country, but I had to keep away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the few there were, for I did not want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet the ruralies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I had to sacrifice speed to safety all the way, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was forty-two days after the wreck when I final-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly sneaked into Santa and put up at a sailors'</seg><seg type="columnLine">boarding-house down on the water-front.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was a wreck. I didn't know myself when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked in a glass. I got a suit of clothes from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boarding-house slop-chest, and when the Panama</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat came along, I managed to get aboard and stow</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. I was afraid to book a passage, and did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have enough money left, anyway. Gave a steward</seg><seg type="columnLine">all I had, except five dollars, to fix me up for Pan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ama, and kept out of sight until we had passed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last town on the coast of Peru. *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When T went up on deck I found two mining</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineers from some mines just beyond where I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the wreck; and they gave me the first news I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had heard of it. They said that the engineer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wrecked train was in jail, and the best they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could expect for him was a five-year sentence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">ON THE EDITORIAL CARPET.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">383</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That made me glad I had taken a chance. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would go through it again rather than spend five</seg><seg type="columnLine">years in one of their jails.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They also told me that the whole Peruvian army</seg><seg type="columnLine">had my description and orders to bring me in dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">or alive. They could hardly believe that I had ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tually made a getaway, and it certainly was a mira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cle, for an American traveling alone arid on foot in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that country is bound to attract considerable at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention, and a gringo isn't very well liked, anyway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That road owes me three days' pay, but, under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circumstances, I don't think I will go back after it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">--Bill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"CASEY" JONES.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Editor, Thf.
