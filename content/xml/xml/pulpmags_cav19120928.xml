But it was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">use. This dog was to have no bone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it served him jolly well right, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">being such an impatient upstart, and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">free and forehanded at the kissing</seg><seg type="columnLine">game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she hadn't seemed to mind my</seg><seg type="columnLine">forehandedness in other ways at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning of the acquaintance. On that</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirst evening when I came aboard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Loyalty at Florakiva I had been as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed to a seat near the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain's table, right alongside of her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she had inspired me at once. Fall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in love with Angela was a mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy thing to do. There was gipsy</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmth of color in her face, her lip had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a high-born curve, and her nostrils be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke a dainty pride. Eyes--well, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">rarely find such eyes outside of Span-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish-speaking countries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, I had seen plenty of girls with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark hair and dark eyes in the South</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seas, and some really pretty ones, but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a rule, the faces of the island girls</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't express anything greater than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire for a piece of roast pig or some</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinsel thing to hang about their necks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Angela's face was all animation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were seated near the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, that first delicious evening, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long way from the chaperon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was nobody to introduce us; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I cracked the ice by handing her the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuffed olives, judging that one of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">style would find them to her liking; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within ten minutes I was telling her</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about the islands, and my life among</seg><seg type="columnLine">them -- that is, all except some things</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would look a little better in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">background, though they were not so</seg><seg type="columnLine">immoral--only trading tricks that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">invented and practised long before I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever saw the South Seas. She attended</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely, especially to the tales of pearl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">divers and sharks, and more than once</seg><seg type="columnLine">those delicate nostrils quivered and di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated, while the dark eyes gleamed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">sympathetic interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From that moment I had devoted</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself to her, despite the presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard of an offensive third person,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was trying to do the same thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This offensive third person, who, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way, didn't seem to be in the least</seg><seg type="columnLine">offensive to Angela, was Mr. Wallace</seg><seg type="columnLine">Little. He had been the principal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grammar-school in Ohio, and had all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Middle Western ways, plus peda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gogy, for which, in the male gender,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had an instinctive distrust, not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say dislike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now Little was an obvious mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomer, for he stood six feet two and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a trifle slim, but husky-looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, and with a rather prominent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adam's apple. How Angela could</seg><seg type="columnLine">overlook his shortcomings, or I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">say longcomings, was beyond me. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will own that the fellow had a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye, a deep, manly voice, and could talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">fairly well to women--too well, indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to suit me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the great, big bulging fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I couldn't get over was that Wallace</seg><seg type="columnLine">Little was going on with Angela, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other schooima'ams to the Philip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pines, while I was to be left behind at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Butaritari.

He and his long legs were now</seg><seg type="columnLine">escorting her all over the ship, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was reading to her every afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">while she sat in her steamer-chair.

Little had been reading to An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gela for two solid hours by the watch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was brooding on the forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck, feeling mighty glum, when I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the king of Alamaka coming out in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">big fancy canoe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  1 knew the chap. 11 is name was Tau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matoa, a round-faced, slim-built fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of forty, pretty badly given to dissipa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion but active enough.

Taumatoa said</seg><seg type="columnLine">it must be there, but we simply couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">find it. Perhaps we kept offshore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little too far, but I didn't like the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that surf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When at last, amid the restless ur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gings of the girls and the importunities</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Miss Peck, I consented to land any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, and headed her shoreward into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quietest cove I could find, the tide</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung us in more sharply than I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reckoned upon, though the wind at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that point was offshore, and our crude</seg><seg type="columnLine">sail was not drawing.

To be sure, we were cast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aways upon this island and might not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to get off for some time; but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">really, I was not as sorry for that as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been had Angela been on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her way to Manila and I left there</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, with no hope ol ever seeing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet face again. Moreover, the ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture had been the means of break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her silence and of her showing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new and sympathetic regard for me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There had been little opportunity in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat for any interchange of senti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. but doubtless there would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenty of it on the island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only word she had with me,after</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting ashore, was about Wallace Lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle. What did I think about his prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able escape from the sinking steamer?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again I had to reassure her as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the undoubted safety of the school-</seg><seg type="columnLine">master. though I was not so sure of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself. Meantime I had moments</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I was pleased to think that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself and not Little who was there</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her on that lone atoll- And so</seg><seg type="columnLine">396</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CAVAUER.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">selfish is human nature that there were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">times during that long night of watch-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing when i was glad, as long as the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shipwreck had to come oft', that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">voyage had not proceeded and that I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was with her on the island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But when I looked at the row of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">women's heads that, in the firelight,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">showed indistinctly from under the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">canvas, I felt such an awed and fearful</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sense of responsibility as 1 had never</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had before. Nine women on my hands</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and a brown islander who would be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sure to be making trouble! Was ever</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a man more weighted down with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heavy duties of wardship?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Xo wonder that I took so little ac-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">count of what might have happened to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the other passengers and the .ship's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">company, afloat in open boats upon the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">merciless sea. When I did think of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">v them it was to take it for granted that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">all had made land somewhere, or would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">do so before they suffered any great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hardship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Once I wondered if the captain of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the Loyalty had stuck to his ship and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gone down with her; but that sort of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thing had always seemed such a gratui-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tous act of heroism that I wasted little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">speculation upon him. I took some wet</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cigars from my coat-pocket and dried</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them before the fire. When I lighted</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one of them it tasted a little salt and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">burned badly; but it was better than no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tobacco at all to a smoker like myself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As the ghostly plumes of the coco-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nut-trees began to glimmer in the early</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dawn, I awakened the king and bade</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him search about for water. This he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">did with alacrity, and I went again to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the top of the little sand-dune summit,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which proved to be not more than ten</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">or twelve feet above the ocean level.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">From here I gazed uf&gt;on an empty sea</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and at the insignificant ribbon of coral</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upon which I stood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The island seemed to be about two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">miles long by a mile and a half wide,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">including the inner water. The strip</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of land enclosed the lagoon, save at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lar end, where a winding creek ran out</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to sea, and this strip must have been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">only about twelve hundred feet wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">at high tide, though it was now much</seg><seg type="columnLine">wider, for the tide was low and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagoon shallow alongshore. A bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile came to my lips when I caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of that far-off inlet; for I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if I had found it the night before</seg><seg type="columnLine">our long-boat would now have been in</seg><seg type="columnLine">good trim and ready for use in case</seg><seg type="columnLine">we should decide to leave the island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sun rose a little higher out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eastern sea. and the palms and pan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">danus, with their long green leaves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beamed upon me like old friends. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was used to the sight of them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they gave me hope, though 1 could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished that they had waved above a</seg><seg type="columnLine">more pretentious stretch of land--one</seg><seg type="columnLine">that afforded, for one thing, a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">better chance for water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As my eye again roved over the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospitable atoll it caught sight of some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing down near the mouth of the la-</seg><seg type="columnLine">goon--the indistinct outline of the hull</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a small wrecked vessel of some sort,</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-heeled over and nearly covered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sand. There could have been barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything more than the ribs of this old</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft left there, and the sight was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismal one, but somehow 1 took cheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it. for it was a sign that there once</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been human beings upon the island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If sailormen had once come there</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might come again. But this hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as uncertain as the crazy flight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea-birds that circled about the bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones of the ship and lent to them such</seg><seg type="columnLine">an air of being forever deserted of men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that my mind soon took on a gloomier</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain. And yet methought it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be worth while to pay a visit to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient wreck a little later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Girlish voices came to my ears, and.</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning. I saw the schoolma'ams troop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down to the lagoon. They looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little bedraggled after their hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">day's work and their nignt in the open,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they had their spirits with them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for now and then a laugh rang out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cry of delight over some new dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery. They were making for a brush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">screened cove where, a little later.

They took</seg><seg type="columnLine">it for granted that I knew everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">about tropic islands, and their volley of</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquiries was rather confusing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What island was it?

But at present</seg><seg type="columnLine">it boasts a population of eleven. If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistake not, it lies in Southern Micro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesia, a little below the equator. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">atolls are very interesting, and many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the larger ones are inhabited. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">consist, like this one, of strips of coral</seg><seg type="columnLine">reef, from a few rods to thirty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">in length, encircling lagoons and cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered by bright-green vegetation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " But perhaps I am only repeating</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you have already learned in your</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal-school studies," I added apolo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">getically. " And breakfast is more im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant, anyway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Pray proceed, Mr. Sibley," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Peck. " The information about</seg><seg type="columnLine">atolls given by geographical text-books</seg><seg type="columnLine">is, as I recall it, very meager and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">adequate; and being familiar with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">South Seas, you are doubtless able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell us much that we should know</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw that at last I had struck upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that was in her line, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made her view me with a more tolerant</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye. So I went on to tell what I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">of such places, dropping the lecturer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain, however, as it was a little too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much for my limited speechmaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers. I told them that the atolls</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the " tiny deserts of the Pacific."</seg><seg type="columnLine">with little elevation above the sea. and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the rainfall was very light upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Then springs must be scarce here."</seg><seg type="columnLine">remarked Miss Peck. " Do you think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we shall lack for water? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It is hard to say," I replied.

Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">she looked at me with her accusing air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if to make me feel my sense of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponsibility for the smallness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coconuts on Schoolma'am Island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I wish the Boston markets were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little handier," said I, with a tinge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">irony, " but as they happen to be about</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight thousand miles away, we'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to refrain from patronizing them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of the girls laughed; but Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Binney lifted her shoulders again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Peck frowned. Clearly they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not appreciate my way of disposing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their objections. So I assumed a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious air and tried to reply to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the questions that had been fired at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me from the teachers' institute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It soon became clear to them that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had almost as vague an idea as to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">location of the island, its proximity, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a civilized center, or our likelihood of</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving it at an early date, as any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. But I was optimism itself as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our prospects.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " There should be plenty of fish in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lagoon," I said.

Nearly all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them were inclined to make the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the situation, and were looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the beach and off to sea, thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">they saw islands and sails when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't. T had to answer a lot more</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions, straining the truth at times,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the glamour and stage business that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I threw around the island, together</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">w ith the fresh morning air and the fun</seg><seg type="columnLine">of preparing breakfast, kept them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine spirits. To be sure, Taumatoa's</seg><seg type="columnLine">report that there was no fresh water</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be found was a little disconcerting;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but.l had forestalled that. Besides, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a secret hope that it might rain, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which event we might catch some water</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the canvas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a breakfast of tinned meat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea-biscuit, we all went over and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plored the grove, in w hich, I was care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful to explain, there couldn't be any</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of animal life--they were des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perately afraid of snakes and gorillas</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and then I saw that Miss Peck had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been right in her observations about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">size of the coconuts; and the pandanus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or screw-pines, upon which the island-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers often rely for food, were scraggly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a whole tree yielding but a few kernels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As to subsistence, the outlook was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not very encouraging.

Angela at their</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, bearing something white in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. She brought the object over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed it to me, her face slightly</seg><seg type="columnLine">flushed and her eyes averted a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Here's your flag." she said quietly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" We didn't have very strong thread to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sew it with, but T think it will hold to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether for a while."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Thank you,' I replied. " Just the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing. I'll hoist it over this mound."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I hunted about and found a long drift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pole to which I attached the white flag,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and soon it was flying over the mound</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the light breeze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Out of the tail of my eye I caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">proud looks from the schoolma'ams as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the banner was spread out in the wind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but, when I faced about at them, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all looking steadily over at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day was fair and the sea lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the island like a slab of indigo.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The tide had receded, leaving the boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying on her side on the wet sand. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">went down to her and looked her over</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully. There were two large holes</seg><seg type="columnLine">near her bow, where the reef had</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken through her thin, steel shell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she was badly dished-in along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle. These dishings might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightened out, but, as to repairing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the holes, that job was certainly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond me, with my primitive facilities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But though I despaired of being able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to set to sea in the boat, I determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep her, unseaworthy as she was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so summoned all hands to drag her</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the beach to a safe position. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">king did not come at my call, as he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still asleep under his palm-tree, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">schoolma'ams heaved away on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">painter and at the sides, while Dorothy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shaw and I shoved at the stern. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">way Dorothy laid her shoulder against</seg><seg type="columnLine">that boat, and braced to her task, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">good to see. She certainly must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done more than any two of the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls.

But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble was that Schoolma'am Island</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, as you might say, newly built by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the patient millepora, and, though there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were plenty of trees, the nuts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither many nor large. As for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sap, it is true, as w ise naturalists have</seg><seg type="columnLine">held, that life can be supported by it;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I have heard of native tribes, living</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon small atolls that have resorted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it when the nut crop was short, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of them have starved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This may have been on account of</seg><seg type="columnLine">too great a population. It was impos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible for me to estimate how long nine</seg><seg type="columnLine">women and two men might survive</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the visible food supply in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">grove. The pandanus-trees were dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointing. too. On close observation</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of them proved to be fruitless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One thing was quite evident--we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">go fishing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I got some safety-pins from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls, and of these I fashioned hooks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Out of some strands unraveled from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canvas we twisted a few strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines. I baited the hooks with min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nows caught in the shallows, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grudging help of Tom I managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hook about a dozen fish out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagoon. They were all strange to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">teachers, but the king pronounced them</seg><seg type="columnLine">edible. We tried to land a big turtle</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was swimming about among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seaweed, but he got away, though at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one time Tom might easily have cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured him had it not been for his lag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gard indifference to the task.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But there was still other work to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">before sundown. It did not seem right</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the girls should sleep out in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open when housemaking was so easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">SCHOOLMA'AM ISLAND.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">405</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the island. So I pressed Tom into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the service of pole-cutting, and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean time I hacked oft a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches with my hunting-knife. W itli</seg><seg type="columnLine">these we fashioned a snug shack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thatched over with coconut-plumes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carpeted with. matting made of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves and fiber, which Tom showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiie schoolma'ams how to weave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What a delightful shelter! cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angela when it was finished. " It s</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an Indian teepee, only more</seg><seg type="columnLine">roomy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Let's get all our things together in</seg><seg type="columnLine">here," suggested Dorothy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " There's not much to get." said An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gela cheerfully.

Her playing put heart into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">castaway women, some of whom had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been pulling rather long faces as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twilight gathered over the island. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that the violin was going to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great comfort to all of us, and you may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sure that no one listened more raptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the ardent trader who was dead in</seg><seg type="columnLine">love with the player.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But through it all I kept reverting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my discovery of the flooding of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island, wondering how recent it was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hoping that some sort of craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">might come along and take us away</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the next great storm should</seg><seg type="columnLine">break upon the shore. Even after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">music ceased, and the schoolma'ams</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone to sleep for the night in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shack, after much chatter over the nov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">elty of their bedchamber, I sat by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire smoking one of my precious cigars</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">--they were becoming very few now--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thinking with what devastating</seg><seg type="columnLine">force a tidal sea, backed by a hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ricane, might sweep over that little dot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Searching for the Pearls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7TMID these dismal reflections would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come, now and then, a thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wrecked pearl-hunters and of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure they probably had left some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where upon the island, but the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragic possibility of the inundation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island was the one that claimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of my thoughts. Tom slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">soundly beside the lire which I kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">going during my almost sleepless vigil</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the long, clear night of stars</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chilly moving airs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After breakfast next morning, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that serious inroads were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">made upon the water. I directed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kanaka to procure some palm sap. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">set about this task with better grace</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he had been showing for his other</seg><seg type="columnLine">work; for, despite his covert attacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the water--I knew lie had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">dipping into it whenever our backs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were turned--his thirst was still with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took one of the large coconut</seg><seg type="columnLine">shells and cut it in half. With the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point of a knife that he constantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">wore in his belt he drilled two holes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper edge of one of these halves</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tied into them a bit of twine. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls watched his movements interest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly, and when he walked over to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the smaller trees they followed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a word. With the shell dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glirrg from the string which he held in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his teeth, he climbed the tree until he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached a clump of flower-stalks. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">he cut off with his knife, and as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell to the ground the girls picked them</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, smelled of them, and then looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously up at the Kanaka while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened the shell below the pruned</seg><seg type="columnLine">flower-stems.

In a little water-worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">channel that ran along her starboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow I found a piece of anchor-chain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">red and flaked with rust, and, farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">aft, I discovered a capstan-bar partly</seg><seg type="columnLine">embedded in the sand. Here and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were corroded copper spikes and bits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of glass, that might have come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her broken ports, ground dull by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the sake of keeping him busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I made a little closer examination</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wreck, 1 set Tom tojvork with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ax, cutting off the cooper sheets</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that part of her bottom exposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to view-. Then, with a piece of oak</seg><seg type="columnLine">board which I had fashioned into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape of a spade, I went around on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other side and began to dig about here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there in what was left of her hull.</seg><seg type="columnLine">An hour of this work brought nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">more important to sight than the rusty</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrel of an old musket and a few bits</seg><seg type="columnLine">of broken crockery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The morning was a hot one. and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was on the sunny side of the tilted</seg><seg type="columnLine">408</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CAVALIER.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom, I had to pause more than once</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wipe the sweat out of my eyes.

In the course of</seg><seg type="columnLine">another hour I had pretty well settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that they had gotten aboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">about as big a tonnage of good, clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell as I had ever seen in a vessel of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that size.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom's voice, coming from around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stern, set me to scattering sand;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as I had kept the shell pretty well</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered as I worked along, he saw none</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it when his eyes lighted upon me</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I sat, hot and tired, upon a de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cayed timber, looking off unconcerned-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly over the lagoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Too much hot work.*' he com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained.

But that old wreck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the treasure that probably lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden within it held me longer than T</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have stayed- An hour or more</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed, during which the digging pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gressed slowly, as T was tired and heat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">harassed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was now down to the bottom planks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the side of the ship that lay upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beach, and was scraping along aft</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and chucking out an interesting lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient junk--rusty iron clews, tnar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">linespikes. battered gimbal lamps,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces of an old-fashioned air-pump,</seg><seg type="columnLine">musket - barrels, metal snatch - blocks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and among these, telling their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragic story, human bones. 1 regret</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say that my respect for these grisly</seg><seg type="columnLine">relics was not what it should have been,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for in my greed for the treasure 1 flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">them out as carelessly as I did the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once I had a twinge of conscience</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I thought of Angela and the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">innocent girls off in camp there with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that irresponsible Kanaka. Indeed. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to climb out of the hole and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasten to them when I gave one more</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunge with my spade, and it grated</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon something that looked like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of some sort of a box.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In another moment, after a wild</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust with the spade, I determined that</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was precisely what it was. 1 flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself down upon my knees, pulsing</seg><seg type="columnLine">all over with a fervent excitement,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearing away the remaining sand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">debris with my fingers. Soon an ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">long piece of heavy brass, green with</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, about one foot wide and two in</seg><seg type="columnLine">length, lay under my trembling hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I made no doubt that it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lid of a chest--the treasure-box of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I seized my spade again and jabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it down into the sand alongside of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest, seeking for the hasp or handle</seg><seg type="columnLine">by which it might be opened. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">crude tool struck something hard, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment later I was lifting out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">human skull, the only sign of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had lost their lives for the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tents of this little brass box. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no other bones near at hand. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">skull probably had been washed away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the rest of the skeleton in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">general dissolution and jumbling up of</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything aboard; but there it was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinning up at me, and somehow, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid it aside upon my pile of debris,</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 couldn't help taking it for a lucky</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What I took to be proof of this was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">               \</seg><seg type="columnLine">SCHOOLMA'AM ISLAND.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">411</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that at the side of the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded hollow where the skull had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lain was the padlock that had secured</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lid. This lock was of iron, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so deeply corroded that it tumbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the attack of my spade. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking hands tried to pull up the lid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was welded to the chest by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green seal of time. I kicked it sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral times, and then with my hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a vigorous tug that brought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole chest, which with its contents</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have weighed about forty pounds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of its resting-place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Panting from my fierce exertions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I laid the box upon the pile of debris,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave it a few bangs with my shovel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then pried away with frantic fingers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lid yielded, with a strange creak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon its ancient hinges. The move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment tilted the chest forward upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pile, and instantly a little rill of age-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dulled coins came pouring and jingling</seg><seg type="columnLine">out upon the sand. These coins I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust into my pocket after glancing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one and noting that it was a British</seg><seg type="columnLine">sovereign, dated 1847.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Righting the chest and placing it se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curely upon a flat-lying timber, I drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lid back and looked in. At first</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was visible only a sodden, musty</seg><seg type="columnLine">mess of rotten canvas--little bags tied</seg><seg type="columnLine">with moldy leather strings, their puck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered tops intact, but the rest of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">fabric fallen apart with age. Clawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">away the ancient litter from a corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the chest, I saw where the coins</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come from. There were several</seg><seg type="columnLine">handfuls of gold and silver, the gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">red with years and moisture and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver blackened. So far as I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see by cursory glances at the coins none</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore a later date than 1849. anc^ they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all British, showing that the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtless had been manned by English-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though glad of the gold, you may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sure my fevered imagination played</seg><seg type="columnLine">more fondly with a treasure of greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">value. I pawed away the encumbering</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of canvas, and there they were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiling up at me with their gray, iri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">descent eyes--the pearls! Such a no-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ble though ill-assorted collection I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never seen. The chest was half full</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As my fingers went diving like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">miser's into that pearly hoard there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a w'orld of gloating in my greedy</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. I scooped up hundreds and hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds of gleaming gems, and they rat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled back into the box. Some of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were yellowed with canvas-rot or</seg><seg type="columnLine">greened by contact with the brass: but</seg><seg type="columnLine">what mattered it? In the hands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the polisher the}r would soon lose their</seg><seg type="columnLine">external discoloring, and my sweat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blurred eyes were seeking for size and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape and not for color.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  And the size and shape were there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">I picked out pearls as large as hazel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nuts, and saw^ that it would take but</seg><seg type="columnLine">little work of matching to sort out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">necklace of these fit to adorn the neck</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a queen. For those old sailors had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered for me bag after bag of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big pearls of the days when the virgin</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagoons yielded jewels over which pi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rates fought and died--such jewels as</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gleamed from the throats of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spanish princesses of olden times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Here, under my hand, in this great</seg><seg type="columnLine">casket, was the ransom of a king! For</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I knew anything at all about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">value of pearls--and I hadn't been</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocking about the islands four years</seg><seg type="columnLine">without learning something--these</seg><seg type="columnLine">were worth at least half a million of</seg><seg type="columnLine">money. A good many pearls had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed through my hands in the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">..cf trade, but none had ever been like</seg><seg type="columnLine">these.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Angela!

No, my first estimate had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been a wild one.

As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">left Tom to his reflections and walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">campward, the fear of this overflow</seg><seg type="columnLine">again oppressed me, effacing for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time the glory of my morning's discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ery ; and as I neared camp, where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls were sitting quietly on the benches</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking low among themselves, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped for a moment, studied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grove above me and an idea suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into my head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It w'as a plan for a high-and-dry</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">refuge of some sort. It hardly seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">passible that when the waves should</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweep over the island they would rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher than ten feet above the highest</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. Well, as nearly as I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure it out, the ground at the foot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coconut-trees rose to the proud al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titude of six feet above sea-level, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the tallest was about fifty feet, a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son who climbed up into one of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be safe enough at high-water if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tree was not washed away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now there were evidences that trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been uprooted by the waves, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were many that lay prostrate, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been so lodged among the standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunks that the sea could not carry them</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Others, whose roots had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">washed by the overflow, leaned against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upright ones, and, though half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead or sickly, were making brave ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forts to get a new hold upon the soil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My idea was to take the dead and</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaning trees, cut off the roots and</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches, and fasten two or more of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, high up and horizontally, to four</seg><seg type="columnLine">sturdy upright trunks that I now se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lected. and. by laying other poles across</seg><seg type="columnLine">this rude sill, make a sort of platform</seg><seg type="columnLine">to which we might all retreat in case</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island should be inundated again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The four trees, which were tall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight, and firmly rooted, were at</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a distance apart as to make con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venient posts to support a floor about</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve b)' fifteen feet in size.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The idea of this safe refuge from</seg><seg type="columnLine">an in sweeping flood or tidal-wave</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck me as such a feasible one that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to get to work upon it that very</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. But I was nearly worn out by my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arduous labors at the wreck, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungry as a bear. Beside there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of any storm. It would be best</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wait until morning and go at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work with fresh vigor. So I strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">into camp and sat down at the table</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon which the schoolmistresses had</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid luncheon, though none of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were eating.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It seemed strange that they had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">called me. but what seemed stranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the hush that stole over them as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">SCHOOLMA'AM ISLAND.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">415</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down at the table.

Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how it occurred to me not to question</seg><seg type="columnLine">this odd and sudden aloofness on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">part. Glancing over at Angela, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat near the other end of the table, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that she was gloomy and preoccu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had been scheming to get her apart</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the rest to tell her of our won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful good fortune, thinking to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">her the pleasure of being the first to</seg><seg type="columnLine">receive the great news. But evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reason, whatever it was, for this</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange treatment of me, had affected</seg><seg type="columnLine">her most of all. While the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked but little, and only among them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves, addressing no word to me, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said nothing.

Even when I brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pot and pan from the mound where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had left them, she took no interest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the discovery. But Dorothy's eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightened and she at once set to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">to scour them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Now we'll have something to cook</seg><seg type="columnLine">in," she said with a satisfied smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" There's nothing like having a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">kitchen things in camp."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a time the schoolma'ams made</seg><seg type="columnLine">no comment on the taboo I had placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the king.

At that moment their shares in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the treasure were pretty well below</seg><seg type="columnLine">par. I felt like a crusty old moneybags</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was revising his will, and thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it would have paid them hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">somely to scout the chief's story, what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever it was, and to believe well of me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps some of the pride of wealth</seg><seg type="columnLine">was added to the pride of name, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I thought the matter over I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">inclined to be as cool and as distant as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had suddenly become.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I lighted my last cigar, leaned back</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly, saying nothing while I blew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white smoke up into the palm branches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the cigar was smoked down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inch-long butt which I hated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw away, but at last did manage to</seg><seg type="columnLine">toss aside into the sand, I watched it</seg><seg type="columnLine">as its glow died out, then rose, gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered up some food from the table, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked slowly down to feed Tom. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">schoolma'ams were talking low among</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves as I left, but Angela was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting apart in the shade, looking off</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently over the lagoon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Misser Sibley." cried the chief, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I approached the cabin and saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing a few rods away from it</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the green brush, " me no stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that house.

But even after this was done</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the rubbish was removed so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inside of the cabin looked clean and</seg><seg type="columnLine">inviting, it was plain to be seen that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no attraction for the superstitious</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Being in no hurry to go back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp and again be subjected to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chilly treatment of those icy maidens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had lain about in the shade of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabin while Tom performed his task.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think he felt that the labor I was ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">king him perform was part of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">punishment for the evil word he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed about me with the women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Feeling rested after an hour or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a little better humor, I began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make light of the attitude of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">schoolma'ams which, it seemed to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">judging by our situation upon that</seg><seg type="columnLine">little island in midocean, could last but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a short time. Again I turned my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts to the erection of the plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form among the palms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have been all among the island anti</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">atolls of Micronesia and I have never</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen, even on the lowest lying ones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">most exposed to storms and tidal</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves, any attempt at the erection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a safe retreat as our little hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">of castaways was to be provided with</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the coming of a great overflow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it was practical and might save all</seg><seg type="columnLine">our lives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom was told of the plan and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked to come with me, which he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">the more readily since the flashing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my automatic had illumined his dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligence. The idea of the platform</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not strike him very hard, as it in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volved labor. In his slothful way he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would rather have run the risk of be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing washed out to sea than to go to all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this trouble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Voices came from the shack as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed it, but none of the schoolma'ams</seg><seg type="columnLine">came out to greet us. I had hoped that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angela would come to me and demand</seg><seg type="columnLine">if Tom's story, whatever it was, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">true. But [ saw' nothing of her, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little later, while we were beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">our work, I heard her violin flinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a merry air that I djd not recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nize. This piece of bravado made me</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile, for T knew that she was not so</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy as she was trying to appear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gave Tom a twelve-foot stick of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lximboo as a measure for the poles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him how thick they were to be.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was soon chopping away in quite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">meek and docile mood. He gave an</seg><seg type="columnLine">industrious grunt whenever his ax de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended and stopped frequently to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">an impressive show of wiping the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweat from his face. The four trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had selected as posts for the platform</seg><seg type="columnLine">were of the largest and best rooted</seg><seg type="columnLine">palms in the little grove, about fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards from the shack and in plain view</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About the roots of these I piled all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loose lumps of coral I could find</seg><seg type="columnLine">near at hand, to prevent the washing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the roots by the waves, stacking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crusty chunks to a height of three or</seg><seg type="columnLine">four feet around the poles.

As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed the poles up to Tom I glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">over toward my wards from time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the old fox-goose-and-corn story</seg><seg type="columnLine">all over again. If I went down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreck alone there would be the danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that lurking islander poking into</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp and renewing his wooing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women, there was no telling in what</seg><seg type="columnLine">offensive way. If I took the teachers</seg><seg type="columnLine">along they would try to find out what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the brass chest, and if 1 caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom and forced him to go with me his</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity would also be excited. If I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could find the fox, and tie him up so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would not get at the goose. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might go that evening in the dusk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the corn. But how was one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fasten a fox if one couldn't catch him?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This problem bothered me for hours.</seg><seg type="columnLine">During a part of that time I kept scan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning the grove and peeping about in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brush for the king, but no trace of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him did I see. The girls, who had be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun to be somewhat fearsome of him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood upon the mound from time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">time and kept a lookout for him. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">the female of the species were in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">least consistent, the schoolma'ams</seg><seg type="columnLine">would by this time have treated what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had told them of me as so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">raving. But it was plain that the story</seg><seg type="columnLine">had stuck. Save in the case of the hon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est Dorothy, their attitude toward me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">though not unfriendly, was changed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The change was a subtle one, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the shadows of the palms length-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened upon the beach I went over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Dorothy was standing alone near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cupboard and quietly handed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">my pistol, telling her I was going out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in search of Tom, who might elude me</seg><seg type="columnLine">SCHOOLMA'AM ISLAND.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">423</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and creep into camp while I was absent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At first she scouted the idea oi dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger. but I insisted upon that point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I'll tell the girls to keep watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him," she promised, in reply to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautions as to vigilance.

" I'll hurry</seg><seg type="columnLine">away now before it gets any darker."</seg><seg type="columnLine">With my knife ready at hand, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">strode down to the lagoon and along</seg><seg type="columnLine">its smooth beach, with the purpose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing either Taumatoa or the treas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure into camp. As a matter of fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was more intent upon securing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure, for I doubted not that the fox</seg><seg type="columnLine">would return when he got hungry</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, for he had a particular fondr</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness for tinned beef.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I passed down the long stretch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jungle, and presently the lonely out-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lines of the old wreck rose before me</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the twilight. All was still down</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, save the drone of the surf and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the humming of the evening wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the bleak, bare ribs of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water-worn craft. I entered the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">hulk amidships. As I did so I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled and dismayed to see a dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure dodge away from the bow, steal</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently aft, and out between the stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing timbers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Tom! " I yelled at the top of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice. "Here! I want you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he flung on over the sand along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lagoon, taking no heed of my call.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had he found the treasure, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hidden it away from me? Pulsing</seg><seg type="columnLine">all over with the thought, and in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty unpleasant frame of mind, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed up to the bow. There I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coral covering of my cache strewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">about in the peak of the hull, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brass chest stood fully exposed to view'.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lid of the treasure-casket had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled back and stood open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gave an eager, searching look into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chest; and though the light was dim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw at once that the contents had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been disturbed. A part of the pearl</seg><seg type="columnLine">treasure was gone--how much I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not tell, but at least a double handful. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had reached the wreck just in time. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't have given a tw'o-bit piece for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my share in that treasure had my com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing been delayed ten minutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> True, the island was small; but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were plenty of good hiding-places</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon it; and as for hunting down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">robber, it might have been hard work</seg><seg type="columnLine">for one man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Shutting the lid tightly, I took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest under my arm and hurried camp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward. It was quite dark before I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, and I sang out so that the girls</seg><seg type="columnLine">would know who was coming. All was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet; the rascally Tom had not visit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed the place. In the dusk I was able,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without attracting any attention to what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I carried under my arm, to reach the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush shack, where I intended to sleep,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the girls had removed their belong-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings to the platform and were now up</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, with the ladder withdrawn.</seg><seg type="columnLine">424</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CAVALIER.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After hiding the treasure-box in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand in a corner of the shack.

Then I shook my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self out of my morbid state, w^ent back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lay down again upon my rough</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bed, with my eyes still staring toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the palms. At times, when a great gust</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook them, their branches clattered</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly. It was as if a group of ghosts</seg><seg type="columnLine">clapped their hands. What a dismal</seg><seg type="columnLine">night! There was an irritable feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">down my back as if a spider or some</seg><seg type="columnLine">other insect were moving about on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin. My tired muscles twitched, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">once or twice, when I dozed off, I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if I were falling from a great height,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and suddenly leaped up from the couch</seg><seg type="columnLine">aud was wide awake in an instant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Truly a torturesome night!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, while I lay with my eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the ladder, counting its twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one rounds up and down and up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down again in the starlight, the beck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oning and clattering of the palms lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">their hold upon me, and I fell into an</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneasy slumber, out of which I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly startled by the uncanny feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a hot breath upon my face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I opened my eyes, I suddenly be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came conscious of a dark figure bend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over me, and an upraised hand that</seg><seg type="columnLine">held a steel blade, glimmering palely</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the starlight. Quickly my own hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot out and grasped a greasy fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm, upon which it vainly tried to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hold. I realized at once that my sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den movement had averted the mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derous descent of the Kanaka's knife,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it did not avert his intention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">slay me.

I determined to get hold of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">at all hazards, and quickly decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon a bold move, the only one that</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred to me in my hard-pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">state. I pounced upon his back from</seg><seg type="columnLine">my corner and tried to get a hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his neck. But again I could get</seg><seg type="columnLine">no grip.

Would it</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be best to keep him tied up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut for a day or two until a full sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his subjugation should sink into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick-shelled coconut?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On first catching sight of me com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into the cabin there was a gleam</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sullen defiance and rebellion in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big liquid eyes of my prisoner, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of food appealed so strongly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that these dark looks soon gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to more pleasant ones. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted the free use of his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he ate, but he objected strongly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their being tied again, declaring that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be a " good man " and do</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever I directed.

I still held to the quixotic no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that for the present it was best</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep from the schoolma'ams all</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of Tom's attack upon me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the same time I felt that there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no harm in telling them I had captured</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and made him a prisoner.

When I took out my watch and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made it repeat the hour I was vexed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find it was only a quarter past nine. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was vexed because I knew it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours before I could sleep, There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to smoke, nothing to read, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 longed for human companionship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The girls were sitting by a little lire</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had lighted near the platform.

And so I lay there until, one by</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, they mounted the ladder in a queer</seg><seg type="columnLine">little procession, and pulling it up after</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, went to roost in their odd retreat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As 1 look back upon it all now, it was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">not the days that I spent upon that</seg><seg type="columnLine">island that seem so irksome to me. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the nights. When they closed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was always an eery feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">abroad, and to-night more than ever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 could not get it out of my head that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was something sinister impend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. You will say this was quite natu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ral after my tussle with the murderous</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom only the night before, but I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen the Kanaka safely secured and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not thinking much about him. Nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was it the thought of an oncoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm, for of that I should have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned bv a violent increase of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind, which was now blowing steadily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not heavily, from the west. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet, so impressed was 1 with a feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of approaching danger that I lay awake</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my eyes fixed upon the platform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have known persons to go to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country for their health and to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">back with fully developed cases of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">somnia referable to the strangeness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their surroundings, and I tried to trace</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own symptoms to this cause and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discount all the danger, but it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be discounted. For in spite of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-assurance that he was safe from</seg><seg type="columnLine">mischief, my thoughts kept reverting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Tom. and something told me that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be looking after him again. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like the farmer who must be get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting up in the night and going out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that his horses are safe, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">with just as little relish for the noctur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nal chore that I rose and went down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom's shack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I reache* 1 the place, struck a</seg><seg type="columnLine">match, and looked in.

It was not Tom. for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had no knife or other sharp instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment at hand. It was some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">schoolma'ams, whose precious sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathy for outraged humanity had led</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to take this misguided step.</seg><seg type="columnLine">SCHOOLMA'AM ISLAND.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">435</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, they had overreached me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown their contempt for masculine</seg><seg type="columnLine">judgment and masculine brutality.

I saw it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a piece of absurd chivalry, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">sparing them the constant fears they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have had on their own account</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they had known that the Kanaka was</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of such a bloodthirsty attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he had made upon me the night be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor was there much comfort in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">probability that, because of my fancied</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish for retaliation upon him as an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">former against me, they would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have credited my story and would still</seg><seg type="columnLine">have clamored for his release.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it made me more sore than ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think that they could not have relied</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon my judgment. In my male self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficiency it seemed clear to me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they should have done so in any case.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Judge if I was not hot as I picked up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the several strands and took them up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waning light of the camp-fire and</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved to myself that they were really</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I was so distraught with anger, par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticularly when I recalled the sneering</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks and biting tones of Miss Peck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Miss Binney during our verbal</seg><seg type="columnLine">tussle, that for a time I was for throw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing over my guardianship of the supe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rior-minded females and letting them</seg><seg type="columnLine">shift for themselves. I believe that if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were not for Angela and Dorothy I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have done so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Going back to the coral cabin, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver in hand, I peered into the shad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ows of the near-by palms, hoping that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I might espy the runaway Tom.

So</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went back to my shack and lay, pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">in hand, where my eye could take in as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much of the camp as possible. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man's burden now lay more</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily upon me than ever, and I had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new and more justifiable sense of dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger than when I had first lain down for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About two in the morning, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dipper was lying low in the northwest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sleepy glance toward the roost re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vealed to me the sight of something</seg><seg type="columnLine">detaching itself from the black border</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the grove and stealing toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls' camp. It was a low, creeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, and, in my drowsy state. I at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first took it to be a wild animal of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort, but, nearing a palm trunk that</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed a corner-post of the platform,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creature rose suddenly and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb the tree, with the obvious inten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of mounting to the tent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course it was that infernal Tom!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Instantly I sprang up and made toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, with my automatic in my hand. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought to surprise him by dodging in</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the trees and pouncing upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him before he could learn that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the alert; but I had not gone ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps from the shack before my foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught in a tangled mass of palm-roots,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I fell headlong, dropping my pistol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I rose quickly and groped about for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weapon, found it at last, and flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, impatient of the loss of time. Soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark square of the roost rose above</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I determined at once to climb one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tree-supports, and. if possible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">capture the intruder without awaken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the schoolma'ams.</seg><seg type="columnLine">436</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CAVALIER.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As things turned out, it would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been better for me to have called out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and frightened him away, for lie had</seg><seg type="columnLine">now gained the platform; but 1 did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish to alarm Angela and Dorothy, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only ones among the teachers who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not forfeited my esteem. Also 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought this the best way to effect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">recapture of the released prisoner, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have jumped down and escaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">had he heard me approach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, silently, and without hesitation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I climbed one of the nearest tree-posts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and paused for a moment upon a cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner of the platform to recover my</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath and look for the intruder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There he was on all fours, his head and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders inside the tent.

I whispered:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Come out of there, you beast, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll blow your head off!

When I</seg><seg type="columnLine">set out to renew the hunt the girls all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to go with me, but my pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tests, in which 1 did not fail to cite the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry example of what had happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day before, made them desist from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their importunities at last.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I know I could be of some assist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance to you," said Dorothy in a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointed tone, " but, of course, if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't want me, I won't go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You just stay here and help guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the platform," I directed.

Still, though 1 had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not distinguished myself in the matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of running shots, it pleased me to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the one that had grazed his cheek</seg><seg type="columnLine">had saved Angela out of his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Going down to the coral cabin across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hot sands, I stood there for a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">while in its welcome shade, and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the open space in the direction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wreck. The lagoon lay like a pan</seg><seg type="columnLine">of quicksilver under the cloudless sky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I had never heard the outside surf</seg><seg type="columnLine">send up such a low, lazy roar.

To this arrangement</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they reluctantly consented. After all,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they were as brave a lot of girls as ever</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was, and I could not help being proud</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of their soldierlike loyalty and sym-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pathetic comradeship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But brave as they were and ready</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to aid me, it must have been a hard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tramp for the girls over that torrid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sancl and through the thickets, where</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the air was stiflingly close and humid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They trudged valiantly forward, how-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ever. rarely resting for a moment, for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they were as determined to remain near</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">me as 1 was to keep the allotted dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tance ahead of them. Their faces were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">red. and their hair tousled, but they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">held to the pace, their sticks in their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hands, and their bright eyes peering all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">about. About noon, after we had ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plored every cluster of palms, every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thicket, and every stretch of barren</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">coral sand, from our camp to the lower</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">end of the island, I halted under a wide-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">spreading palm, and as the girls came</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">up, I gave them a good rest there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Isn't it terribly hot?

I can hardly breathe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> *' It is warm," rejoined Miss Peck</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather severely, for she, like the rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us, was tired of the girl's querulous</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone; " but we shall have to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " But there's such a sticky, stuffy</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel in the air," persisted Miss Binney.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" It's generally been quite dry, but now</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's so sultry--almost prostrating."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something significant was conveyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me by her idle words.

As I did so, I became con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious of a meteoric condition that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably held for some time, though,</seg><seg type="columnLine">owing to the rigor of the search, I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not observed it before. A coppery glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">was reflected from the sky upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island, turning the bright verdure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the palms to a sickly, spectral green and</seg><seg type="columnLine">making the dead waters of the lagoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">burn with an unearthly liquid light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the sand shone forth a pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The air was thick and more oppress-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ive than in a tight, steam-heated room</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the mercury at ninety.

It might be an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour or two before the hurricane struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island, and it might be half a day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Going back to where Miss Peck sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shade, still fanning herself, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke to her quietly about the coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm, and urged her to take the girls</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Do you think there is any immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate likelihood of its approach?" she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She saw me hesitate in my reply and</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly added with a smile: "Oh, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancy you don't apprehend that.

But to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was not so easy, for he probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been resting there in the shade and</seg><seg type="columnLine">refreshing himself, while I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">plodding up and down in the jungle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was dog-tired and heat-worn.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had headed straight on through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jungle toward the lower end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island, but though he was still gaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">on me, I managed to keep him within</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight or sound, and soon I saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking through the brush and across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sand, on the way to the lagoon. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">I emerged from a tangle of devil-vine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">four or five hundred feet behind him, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced up the open stretch toward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">camp, and saw the schoolma'ams stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing midway between me and Flagstaff</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mound. The white flag was flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight out from the pole, and I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a stiff breeze, the forerunner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm, had struck the northern part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island, and would soon be sweeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">my way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom was nearing the lagoon on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slant that was taking him back toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wreck. But of a sudden I saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause and turn a little, his head up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes taking in the great, black cloud</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was swinging rapidly down from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the northward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the cool breeze, blowing down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island, whisked over the lagoon, streak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing its smooth surface, I saw without</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise the brown brute wheel about</seg><seg type="columnLine">and make northward toward camp. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">say without surprise, because it must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have flashed upon his native intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gence that the coming storm boded de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction to life upon the island, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the safest place to be was on top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the platform, which he knew had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">built to serve us in just this kind of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergency. It is true that he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have climbed a tree above the threaten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wash of waters, but in such a storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">as was coming, only one tree out of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred might stand, loosely rooted as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were, while the well-braced, c&lt;^ral-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaped posts of the platform would</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably endure a pretty harsh siege</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the wind and waves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His back-tracking, slight as it was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been to my advantage, for the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance between us was lessened, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he was soon gaining again, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we ran up the smooth lagoon shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the freshening wind in our faces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I still hoped to overtake him, counting</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the handicap of the treasure. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for one advantage, he was barefoot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was probably why he had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept to the jungle with its spiked devil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vine ; and. what was unaccountable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. his burden of treasure did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to weary him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I remembered how heavy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contents of the brass chest had been in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hands I could not see, for the life</seg><seg type="columnLine">452</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CAVALIER.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of me, how he could run so fleetly over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sand, if the white bundle contained</seg><seg type="columnLine">it all, which 1 was beginning t&lt;_&gt; doubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">My heart sank when the thought came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me that he might have left the great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er part of it hidden somewhere in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the sea swept the island, as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatened to do, judging by the sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">uplift of the surf, which was now roar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing loudly, our chances of finding his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cache after the waves subsided would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be pretty slim. But 1 was grimly de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined to have whatever of the treas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure he carried, and to have him, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the chances of either acquisi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion seemed remote at the moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He kept on ahead of me in the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creasing wind, making straight up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagoon shore toward camp, gaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly but steadily as we made our way</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the heavy sand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now let me relate the most ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">asperating of all the baffling circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances that beset me on that fatal</seg><seg type="columnLine">forenoon. Those schoolma'ams--of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, it relates to them! Instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping on toward camp, as I had par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticularly directed, and as they had ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressly promised, what should they do</seg><seg type="columnLine">but stand in a huddled bunch on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagoon beach, in about the same posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in which I had sighted them on</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting into the open. In other words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had moved no farther on the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the platform and safety, but were</seg><seg type="columnLine">intently observing the cross-island</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marathon and looking as if they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to take a hand, or a foot, in it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently I saw them separating.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Peck waving her club and Dor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">othy shouldering her ax. While I</seg><seg type="columnLine">groaned inwardly, and tried to wave</seg><seg type="columnLine">them on toward camp, they stationed</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves in a straight line, some little</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance apart, Miss Peck nearest the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagoon, and awaited the coming of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate Taumatoa, their skirts flut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering wildly in the wind, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now blowing a gale. It was plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">their intention to intercept the flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kanaka, and to assist me in running</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again I waved to them to be off to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">camp, which was about half a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, but my signals meant no more to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them than the leaves in the wind. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">by this time, let me tell you, there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only leaves, but branches flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the sand and into the troubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">lagoon, whose waves were lashing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore in a cheap imitation of the titanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">rollers that were running up the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Great rushing ink-stains were streak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the sky and blotting out the sun,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air was full of sand, and soon it</seg><seg type="columnLine">became difficult to see the brown run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner ahead, while only now and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">could f catch sight of the heroic school-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ma'ams, where they still bravely held</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently the wind became so strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was hard to make headway</seg><seg type="columnLine">against it, but still pursuer and pursued</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed on. The race was an uneven</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. and after all. I must have gained</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little upon the chief, for when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">neared the girls, I was not more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">two or three hundred feet away, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">could catch little glimpses of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the gathering murk of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying sand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taumatoa made a feint as if to buck</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the line, and then, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the girls had gathered there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dodged down toward the lagoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the obvious intent of running</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the end. Miss Peck, being near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est the lagoon, was in a way to encoun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter the savage chief, but through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying sand I caught a glimpse of Dor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">othy rushing down that way to help</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Again I yelled to them to hurry</seg><seg type="columnLine">on to camp while there was still time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach the platform, but the wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">blew my words away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seeing that the lagoon side was</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocked by Dorothy and her ax, sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported by the others with their clubs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chief without hesitation splashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the water, that he might round the</seg><seg type="columnLine">line in that way. Dorothy pluckily</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashed in after him, and the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls lined up on the beach and kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving along to intercept him, if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">SCHOOLMA'AM ISLAND.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">453</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">should come ashore. The waves of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little lake were running so high that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came near tumbling the chief oft"</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet two or three times, so he waded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a little nearer toward the beach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I was now well up with the teachers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shouting every little while for them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be off on their way to the platform,</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling them that I would attend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom, but they gamely kept after him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Twice, when I was within thirty or</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty yards of him, I leveled my pistol</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the intention of firing, but each</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I desisted, not caring, after all, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">risk my last bullet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The chief began to see that he was at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a disadvantage in the water. Taking a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">moment when I had rushed to the as-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sistance of Angela, who had tripped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and fallen in the sand, the heavy wind</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">having made her lose her balance, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dashed shoreward and made another</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dash to get around the women on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beach. As it so happened, Miss Peck</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ran directly into his path, brandishing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her club. He made at her with his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">knife, but before I could spring to her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aid, she had hit him upon the forehead</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with her heavy stick, and the knife</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dropped from his hand. She struck at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him again, but he jumped in close to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her and, seizing her by her heavy hair,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stooped to regain his knife, while she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">screamed lustily for help, and tried to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beat his legs with her club.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  By this time I had nearly reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place where the two were contend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and was rushing in to throw my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self upon the Kanaka in his half-recum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent position, when Dorothy, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little nearer, sprang toward him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her ax upraised.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He saw us coming and, picking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">-the knife, he started forward still in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent position, and dashed away up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach in the teeth of the wind, one hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">still clinging to the white bundle, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the other was a dark, mysterious ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject, something like a bird's nest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So again the chase was taken up,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Tom leading us all, myself second,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the teachers stringing out behind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the wind hooted over our heads</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and roared in our ears, and the leaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the sand scudded about us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom had not gone but a little way</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I saw him drop the dark object</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his hand, and as it flew toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in the wind it opened out, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next instant it was fluttering lov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly upon my breast--a big, brown</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch of human hair. I knew whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was,- because I had seen from what</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular head it had been wrested--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Peck's. I brushed it aside and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">went flying down the wind, while I</seg><seg type="columnLine">chased after the fleet Kanaka.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For now it was a race for the plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form, with Tom too far in the lead for</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfort. His obvious intention was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gain the safe retreat above the threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening sea, and probably to prevent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of us from climbing to the place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he could do so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You may be sure, considering this</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatening state of affairs, that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad I had saved that last cartridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      CHAPTER XX.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      My Last Cartridge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7T S nearly as possible my eyes held to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bounding silhouette of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kanaka making its unsteady way over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the low, undulating dunes that lay be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween us and camp. His black figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">would beat its way up one side of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sandy hillock and then down again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For, by this time, the wind was a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinct factor in the race, and particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">so with the skirt-hampered girls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Such fleeting glances as 1 cast be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind dimly revealed the forms of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">or more of my Dianas outlined by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind, against which they were fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way. I was glad to see that An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gela was holding her own with the rest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I feared that if the gale increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of them would be able to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">the platform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently, the air grew less gritty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All the loose grains seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been blown away. So that far ahead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direction of the camp, and away</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the struggling form of Tau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">454</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CAVALIER.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">matoa, 1 coiild see the flying spume</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from the breakers as it was tossed like</seg><seg type="columnLine">cotton-balls high over the land. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">spray fell upon the dark, wind-tortured</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">palms of the grove like snow, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">seaward the air was full of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A mass of lather, blown up from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside beach, was thrown at my feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, as it rolled back toward the girls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shuddered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was this the first assault? Was this</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hour I had foreseen from the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our landing upon the low atoll?</seg><seg type="columnLine">How long would it be before the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">island should be swept over by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves which, judging by the increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">volume of their roar, were rising at</seg><seg type="columnLine">every moment, as the wind and tide</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly were rising.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To gain the platform was now our</seg><seg type="columnLine">only hope. But what if Tom got there</seg><seg type="columnLine">first and kept us from mounting? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew his nature, and knew he could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">as merciless as that. It might be that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would let the women up, though, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his maniacal mood, there was no count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing upon it, but there was one thing I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could rely upon, and that was: that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never permit me to get up there</seg><seg type="columnLine">as long as he could fight me off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those heaps of coral ammunition!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I groaned to think that we had pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided him with stones to heave down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stung to new effort by this madden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing thought, I set myself against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wind and pushed on so determinedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I soon had the cheering satisfac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of seeing that I was gaining a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the wild Kanaka. If I could but</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach him and detain him, no matter at</seg><seg type="columnLine">what cost, until Angela and the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">should arrive at the platform--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a victory worth fighting for.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It might mean the lives of all of us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But here was the irritating feature</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pursuit: The terrific buffets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind so hampered our progress that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was coming to lie like a race of</seg><seg type="columnLine">turtles. Neither Tom nor myself was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now proceeding at anything faster than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dragging walk. But I kept gaining a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little, and, before long. I was almost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">within pistol-range, while not far</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, through the feathery spume</seg><seg type="columnLine">which now llecked all the island, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see the platform, with the over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned tent thrashing crazily from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastenings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I decided to approach the camp by</seg><seg type="columnLine">way of the grove, thinking to gain a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little by its shelter, and willing to risk</seg><seg type="columnLine">the danger of the toppling palms if</seg><seg type="columnLine">only 1 could keep him from getting pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">session of the platform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But no sooner had I turned toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grove than I saw him do the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, so I was not to be advantaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">by that, though I thought I might gain</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him somewhere among the over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned trees. There was a tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">uproar in the grove, the great gusts</seg><seg type="columnLine">bellowing through it in a bull-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">chorus. From the sharp serrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches, which cut the gale, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a prolonged hiss as of escaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam, while the tumultuous clatter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flat, hard leaves was like the noise</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some colossal mill. Great leafv</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">branches hurtled through the air, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coconuts pelted the ground with re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounding thumps, and now and again a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall palm would measure its length</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the ground or fall supine upon its</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though my strength was pretty well</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent. I should have reached the plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form as soon as he but for the over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw of one -of these very palms. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">branches crashed down upon me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">threw me to the ground. Luckily I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not struck by anything but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighter foliage, but when I had disen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangled myself from the mass of ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dure. and gotten to my feet, I saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">savage chief spring toward the ladder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mount it quickly, and pull it up after</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When 1 approached the place my</seg><seg type="columnLine">welcome home was a well-aimed coral</seg><seg type="columnLine">lump that came near putting an end to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, for it whizzed past my head within</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inch or two. But as he was rais-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing another lump to fling after the first.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I raised my automatic, took careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">aim, and fired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment I saw no result from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shot save that he did not pick up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stone, but retreated a little way</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the edge of the platform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When next I saw him he was press-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his left hand upon his right arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the shoulder, while a look of pain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and anger flashed forth from under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">scowling brows. My last bullet had</seg><seg type="columnLine">crippled him. That was something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be thankful for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I darted toward the nearest post of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the platform, seized it, and was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to climb up when a piece of coral, about</seg><seg type="columnLine">half the size of my head, dropped sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly upon my back.

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned and hurried off for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">Elevated train; and, possibly half-way</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the block, he turned back for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant--and forward as quickly. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he had suspected, Harvey was look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing after him, and even in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar attitude he had pictured men-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ially. Hands behind his back, head</seg><seg type="columnLine">low and thrust forward, the younger</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother was staring in pensive wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the elder and smiling compassion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And for 110 particular reason, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile--which had irritated Howard in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old days--fairly maddened him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment now.

Instead of that--yes, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunder! Harvey was still standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">there and grinning his compassion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A minute or so and the mood passed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and- Howard laughed outright as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced up the Elevated steps. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most natural thing in the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harvey had inherited, in its entirety,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nature of their gay, petted, pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure-loving little mother, and, like that</seg><seg type="columnLine">same little mother, he was pure gold all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way through; while Howard, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally nice care as to details, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have acquired ever}'- trait of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">sober, energetic father. That was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole proposition, from end to end;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and very likely, when once he had set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled the boy down to business, that light</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature of Harvey's would be a blessing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his brother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But just now business lay ahead, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">big business; and long before he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled in his Pullman chair, the elder</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street's mind was absorbed in it. Har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vey, somewhere or other behind, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">old enough and large enough to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">care of himself; ahead were Marchand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his little clique of moneyed men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was to be quite a feather in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cap, this Philadelphia transaction -- a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal so huge in its proportions, so fear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully involved in complex details, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ordinary mind might well have</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrunk away from it. Alone, Howard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Street had engineered the better part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thing in most perfect style; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">468</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CAVALIER.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">now, with Marchand sailing for Europe</seg><seg type="columnLine">day alter to-morrow, they were going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wrestle out the final details.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, in some six or eight weeks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Marchand returned, and the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liminary contracts were due to expire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world would be mildly startled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the putting through of what might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">termed a real real-estate deal, with Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howard Street's name carefully adver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tised and Mr. Howard Street's bank-</seg><seg type="columnLine">account considerably the fatter. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, all of it. just the sort of man's-</seg><seg type="columnLine">size affair with which Howard had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been seeking to identify himself; now</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was coming true.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Marchand and the car were at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Broad Street Station when the train</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled in, and Marchand took him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge. The big man's family had</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted him weeks ago; the servants</seg><seg type="columnLine">were going to-morrow; and the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference would be held in all the unlis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tening emptiness of the big home. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel dinner, and Marchand and How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ard Street settled in the former's li-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brary for a short evening of details and</seg><seg type="columnLine">documents.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Morning dawned rather unfortunate-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, with the arrival of a telegram from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kenton, telling of the stalling of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">train in a wreck, two hundred miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">west. Kenton was as essential to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair as money itself, and now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would hardly be on hand before late</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon. The others, half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, drifted in and waited; papers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were signed, signatures witnessed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">checks passed--with blank spaces left</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Kenton and an apathetic notary</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowsing over his newspaper in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The traveler arrived no more than in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for the dinner Marchand had or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered from a near-by hotel. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing on again; indeed, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to board a nine-o'clock train for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the South ; and there was another grand</seg><seg type="columnLine">scurrying of papers--and. when Ken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton had flitted on again, a confusion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things in general that would have pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cured most people a clean ticket to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">madhouse. Tt would have to be straight-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ened out; and, alone in the house, Street</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Marchand set about the straight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening. Midnight came and went. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly three in the morning, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">million or so of documents neatly bun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dled and ready for the safe-deposit</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaults, two utterly fagged men tottered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to two bedrooms above and rolled into</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As concerned Howard Street, nine</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock in the morning found him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">as vicious a headache as he could re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member in all his life! He grunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and yawned and shuffled over to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror; and he laughed a little and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head; late hours, obviously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not for him. When a man ha*</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a rule of slipping into bed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">eleven, tired out, an extra four hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">are likely to leave their marks--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they seemed to have left them on How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ard. for his eyes were dark-circled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired, and the corners of his mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">drooped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was more rushing ahead--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning chat between Marchand and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his watchman, a galloping breakfast, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad race for the train, and a plunging</seg><seg type="columnLine">express for New York. Marchand</seg><seg type="columnLine">left him at the station and whizzed</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildly off in a taxicab for his pier.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Howard Street, yawning still, boarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">a humbler surface-car for the Hotel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barnard and his comfortable rooms.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no particular need of diving</seg><seg type="columnLine">pell-mell for his office; he had worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard enough last night, and he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">get down to business after luncheon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a shave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment he chatted with the clerk</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the hotel desk.

And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> his little silver cigar-box was standing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> open, with ashes here and there and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> everywhere; and his stationery was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> piled, in ever}' possible way, on his trim</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> desk; and--yes, even half a dozen of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> his neckties were ranged on the back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of a chair, as Harvey had left them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> after making his selection. An unin-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> formed observer might have scented</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the recent passing of a cyclone.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed perfectly incredible in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">particular case, and yet--there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brick-red flush on Street's cheeks as</seg><seg type="columnLine">his train came into the city. He had.</seg><seg type="columnLine">or he had not, made a sad and clumsy</seg><seg type="columnLine">break.

These hunches were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. working in the dark, as he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">compelled to, very much what whiskers</seg><seg type="columnLine">are to a cat.

So intricate and so wide-reach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing were the secret wires of his infor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mation that he knew he could wait, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spider at the center of its web, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the betraying vibration awakened some</seg><seg type="columnLine">far-reaching thread of that web.

The world, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">great detective had found, was indeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small one. From its scattered four</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">corners, into which his subterranean</seg><seg type="columnLine">wires of espionage stretched, would in</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, come some inkling, some hint,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some discovery.

For months past</seg><seg type="columnLine">every police chief in the country had</seg><seg type="columnLine">held his description of Binhart.

He was traveling</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the name of Bannerman, wore</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hair in a pompadour, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown a beard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blake took the first train out of Chi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cago for Denver.

He blinked con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentedly across the table at the man he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was " buzzing." The trick had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned. The word had been given. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that Binhart was headed west-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward again. He also knew that Bin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hart had awakened to the fact that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being followed, that his feverish</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements were born of a stampeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of capture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet Binhart was not a coward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Flight, in fact, was his only resource.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was only the low-brow criminal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blake knew, who ran for a hole and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hid in it until he was dragged out. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">more intellectual type of offender pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred the open.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Binhart was of this type. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was suave and artful; he was active</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodied and experienced in the ways of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world.

Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">how much he had planted away after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Newcomb coup no one knew. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one denied that it was a fortune. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ten to one that Binhart would now</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to get out of the country. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would make his way to some territory</seg><seg type="columnLine">without an extradition treatv.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would show Copeland and the commis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sioner and the world in general that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was still a little life in the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog, that there was still a haul or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could make.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So engrossing were these thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Blake scarcely heard the drum</seg><seg type="columnLine">snuffer across the table from him, pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">testing the innocence of his ways and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purity of his intentions. Then, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second time that morning. Blake</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely bewildered him, by sudden-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly accepting those protestations and</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreeing to let everything drop. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary, of course, to warn Sheiner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to exact a promise of better living. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blake's interest in the man had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">departed. He dropped him from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme of things, once he had yielded</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his data. He tossed him aside like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sucked orange, a smoked cigar, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">burnt-out match. Binhart, in all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements of all the stellar system,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the one name and the one man</seg><seg type="columnLine">that interested him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Loony Sheiner was still sitting at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that table in Antoine's when Blake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having wired his messages to San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pedro and San Francisco, caught the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first train out of New Orleans. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sped across the face of the world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawling nearer and nearer the Pacific</seg><seg type="columnLine">coast, 110 thought of the magnitude of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that journey oppressed him. His im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agination remained untouched. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither fretted nor fumed at the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">this travel was taking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In spite of the electric fans at each</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of his Pullman, it is true, he suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered greatly from the heat, especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the ride across the Arizona</seg><seg type="columnLine">desert. He accepted it without com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaint. stolidly thanking his lucky stars</seg><seg type="columnLine">that men weren't still traveling across</seg><seg type="columnLine">America's deserts by ox-team. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad when he reached the Colorado</seg><seg type="columnLine">492</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CAVALIER.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">River and wound up into California,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the alkali and sage-brush and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yucca palms of the Mojave well behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He was glad in his placid \sav</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he reached his hotel in San Fran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cisco and washed the grit and grime</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his heat-nettled body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But once that body had been bathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fed, he started on his rounds of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">underworld, seined the entire harbor</seg><seg type="columnLine">front without effect, and then set out</seg><seg type="columnLine">his night-lines as cautiously as a fisher-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in forbidden waters. lie did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">overlook the shipping offices and rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way stations, neither did he neglect the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotels and ferries. Then he quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunched at Martenelli's with the much-</seg><seg type="columnLine">honored but most-uncomfortable Wolf</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yonkholm, who promptly suspended</seg><seg type="columnLine">his " dip '' operations at the beaches</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of respect to Blake's sudden call.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing of moment, however, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned from the startled Wolf, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coppa's six hours later, Blake dined</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a chink smuggler named Goldie</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hopper. Goldie, after his fifth glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wine and an adroit decoying of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk along the channels which most in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terested his portly host, casually an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced that an Eastern crook named</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blanchard had got away, the day be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, on a certain mail steamer. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was clean-shaven and traveled as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clergyman. That struck Goldie as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">height of humor, a bank sneak having</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nerve to deck himself out as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gospel-spieler.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His elucidation of it, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought no answering smile from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">diffident-eyed Blake, who confessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was rounding up a couple of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nickel-coiners and would be going East</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a day or two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of going East, however, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurriedly consulted maps and time-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables, found a train that would laud</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in Portland in twenty-six hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started North. He could eventu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally save time, he found, by hastening</seg><seg type="columnLine">on to Seattle and catching a steamer</seg><seg type="columnLine">from that port. When a hot-box held</seg><seg type="columnLine">his train up lor over half an hour.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blake stood with his timepiece in his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hand, watching the train-crew in their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">efforts to " freeze the hub." They con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tinued to lose time during the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">At Seattle, when he reached the docks,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he found that his steamer had sailed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">two hours before he stepped from his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sleeper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  11	is one remaining resource was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">steamer from Victoria. This, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">figured out, would get him to Hong-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Kong even earlier than the steamer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which he had already missed. He had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a hunch that Hong-Kong was the port</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he wanted. Just why, he could not ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plain. But he felt sure that Binhart</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would not drop off at Manila. Once</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">on the run, he would keep out of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">American quarters. It was a gamble;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it was a rough guess. But then all life</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was that. And Blake had a dogged and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inarticulate faith in his " hunches."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Crossing the Sound, he reached Vic-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">toria in time to see the ship under way,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and heading out to sea. Blake hired a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tug and overtook her. He reached the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">steamer's deck by means of a Jacob's-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ladder that swung along her side-plates</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like a mason's plumb-line along a fac-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">f tory wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Binhart, he told himself, was by this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">time in the mid-Pacific, untold miles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">away, heading for that vast and mys-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">terious East into which a man could so-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">easily disappear. He was approaching</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gloomy and tangled waterways that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">threaded between islands which could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not even be counted. He was fleeing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">toward- dark rivers which led off</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through barbaric and mysterious si-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lence. into the heart of darkness. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was drawing nearer and nearer to those</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">regions of mystery where a white man</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">might be swallowed up as easily as a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rice grain is lost in a shore lagoon. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would soon be in those teeming alien</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cities as underburrowed as a gopher</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">village.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But Blake did not despair. Their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whole barbaric East, he told himself,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was only a Chinatown slum on a large</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scale. And he had never yet seen the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slum that remained forever impervious I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the right drag-net. He did not know :</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SHADOW.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">493</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">how or where the end would be. But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he knew there would be an end. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">still hugged to his bosom the placid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">conviction that the world was small,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that somewhere along the frontiers of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">watchfulness the impact would be re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">corded and the alarm would be given.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   A man of Binhart's type, with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">money Binhart had, would never</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">divorce himself completely from civili-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">zation. He would always crave a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">white man's world; he would always</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hunger for what that world stood for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and represented. He would always</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">creep back to it. He might hide in his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heathen burrow', for a time; but there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would be a limit to that exile. A power</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stronger than his own will would drive</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him back to his own land, back to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">civilization. And civilization, to Blake,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was merely a rather large and ram-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-	bling house equipped with a rather</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">efficient burglar-alarm system, so that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">each time it was entered, early or late,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the telltale summons would eventually</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">go to the right quarter. And when the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">summons came Blake would be waiting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To the Orient.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">|T was by wireless that Blake made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">what efforts he could to confirm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his suspicions that Binhart had not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dropped off at any port of call between</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">San Francisco and Hong-Kong. In</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">due time the reply came back to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Bishop MacKishnie " that the Rev.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Caleb Simpson had safely landed at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Hong-Kong. and was about to leave</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for the mission field in the interior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The so-called bishop, sitting in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wireless-room, received this much re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">layed message with mixed feelings. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">proceeded to send out three secret</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">service code-despatches to Shanghai,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Amoy, and Hong-Kong. which, being</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">picked up by a German cruiser, were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">worried over and argued over and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">finally referred back to an intelligence</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bureau for explanation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at Yokohama, Blake hurried</seg><seg type="columnLine">.ashore in a sampan, met an agent who</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be awaiting him, and caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">a train for Kobe. He hurried on, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">different to the beauties of the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which he wound, unimpressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the oddities of the civilization with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he found himself confronted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His mind, intent on one thing, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to react to the stimuli of side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">issues. From Kobe he caught a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamer for Nagasaki and Shanghai.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This steamer, he found, lay over at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">former port for thirteen hours, so he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifted again to an outbound boat</seg><seg type="columnLine">headed for Woosung.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was not until he was on the tender,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making the hour-long run from Woo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sung up the Whangpoo to Shanghai</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, that he seemed to emerge from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his half-cataleptic indifference to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">environment. He began to realize that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was at last in the Orient.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they wound up the river past</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp - nosed and round - hooded sam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pans, and archaic Chinese battle-ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sea-going junks and gunboats fly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing their unknown foreign flags, Blake</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last began to realize that he was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new wrorld. The very air smelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">exotic; the very colors, the tints of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sails, the hues of clothing, the forms of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things, land and sky itself--all were</seg><seg type="columnLine">different. This depressed him only</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaguely. He was too intent on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future, on the task before him, to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">his surroundings much thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blake had entirely shaken off this</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague uneasiness, in fact, when twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes after landing he found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a red-brick hotel known as The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Astor, and guardedly shaking hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an incredulously thin and sallow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced man of about forty. Although</seg><seg type="columnLine">this man spoke with an English ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent and exile seemed to have foreign-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eered him in both appearance and out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">look, his knowledge of America was</seg><seg type="columnLine">active and intimate. He passed over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the detective two despatches in</seg><seg type="columnLine">cipher, handed him a confidential list of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hong-Kong addresses, gave him cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain information as to Macao, and an</seg><seg type="columnLine">494</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CAVALIER.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hour later conducted him down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river to the steamer which started that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night for Hong-Kong.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Blake trod that steamer's deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">and plowed on through strange seas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">surrounded by strange laces, intent on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his strange chase, no sense of vast ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venture entered his soul. No appre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciation of a great hazard bewildered</seg><seg type="columnLine">his emotions. The kingdom of ro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mance dwells in the heart, in the heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">roomy enough to house it. And Blake's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart was taken up with more material</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. He was preoccupied with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">new list of addresses, with his new</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines of procedure, with the men he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must interview and the dives and clubs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bazaars he must visit.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">response had come from a consulate</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretary. One wire in all his sentinel</seg><seg type="columnLine">network had proved a live one.

As</seg><seg type="columnLine">he steamed southward over smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">seas, threading a way through boulder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strewn islands and skirting mountain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous cliffs, his movements seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take on a sense of finality. He stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the rail. wratching the hazy blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">islands, the forests of fishing-boats and</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-pooped junks floating lazily at</seg><seg type="columnLine">anchor, the indolent figures that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could catch glimpses of on deck, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green waters of the China Sea.

Some echo of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">witchery of those Eastern waters at</seg><seg type="columnLine">times penetrated his own preoccupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">soul. A vague sense of his remoteness</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his old life at last crept in to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He thought of the watching green</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights that were flaring up, dusk by</seg><seg type="columnLine">dusk, in the shrill New York night, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamps of the precinct stations, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamps of headquarters, where the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">building was full of moving feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifting faces, where telephones were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringing and detectives were coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">and going, and policemen in uniform</seg><seg type="columnLine">were passing up and down the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone steps, clean-cut, ruddy-faced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong-limbed policemen, talking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughing as they started out on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">night details.

Against a background of dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue hills he could make out the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blue and white of the houses in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Portuguese quarters, guarded on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side by a lighthouse and on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a stolid square fort. Swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">around a sharp point, the boat entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inner harbor, crowded with Chi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nese craft and coasters and dingy</seg><seg type="columnLine">tramps of the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blake seemed in no hurry to disem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bark. The sampan into which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped, in fact, did not creep up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore until evening. There, ignoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rickshaw coolies who awaited him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he passed an obnoxiously officious</seg><seg type="columnLine">trio of customs officers, he disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">up one of the narrow and slippery side</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets of the Chinese quarter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He followed this street for some dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance, assailed by the smell of its mud</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rotting sewerage, twisting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning deeper into the darkness, past</seg><seg type="columnLine">dogs and chattering coolies and oil</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamps and gaming-house doors. Into</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of these gaming houses he turned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing through the blackwood sliding</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and climbing the narrow stairway</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor above.

He continued to smoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">listlessly, like a sightseer with time on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hands and in no mood for move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. The brim of his black boulder</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowed his eyes. His thumbs rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">carelessly in the armholes of his waist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coat.

But all the while he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">most acutely awake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For somewhere in that gathering, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew, there was a messenger awaiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Whether he was English or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Portuguese, white or yellow, Blake</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not say. But from some one</seg><seg type="columnLine">there some word or signal was to come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He peered down at the few white</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in the pit below. He watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man at the head of the carved black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wood table, beside his heap of brass</seg><seg type="columnLine">" cash,'' watched him again and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he took up his handful of coins, cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered them with a brass hat while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">betting began, removed the hat, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be dividing the pile, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wand in his hand, into fours. The last</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of the last four, apparently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the object of the wagers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blake could not understand the game.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It puzzled him, just as the yellow men</seg><seg type="columnLine">so stoically playing it puzzled him, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the entire country puzzled him. Yet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtuse as he was, he felt the gulf of</seg><seg type="columnLine">centuries that divided the two races.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These yellow men about him seemed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">far away from his humanity, as de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tached from his manner of life and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, as were the animals he some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times stared at through the bars of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bronx Zoo cages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A white man would have to be pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">far gone, Blake decided, to fall into</seg><seg type="columnLine">their ways, to be satisfied with the life</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those yellow men.

And he felt now that Bin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hart could never do it, that a life sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tence there would be worse than a life</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentence to " stir." So he took another</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigar, lighted it, and sat back watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faces about him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For no apparent reason, and at no</seg><seg type="columnLine">decipherable sign, one of the jrellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">496</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CAVALIER.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">faces across the smoke-filled room de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tached itself from its fellows.

There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no touch of fear on her face. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more curiosity, the wilful, wide-eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity of the child. She even</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed a little as she stared at the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">truder. Her rouged lips were tinted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">carmine so bright that they looked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wound across her white face. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">gash of color became almost clownlike</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it crescented upward with its way-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward mirth.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thrusting one arm into it when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure drifted into the room from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matting-hung doorway on Blake's left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As she saw this figure she suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung oft the coat and stooped to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tea-tray in the middle of the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blake saw that the newcomer was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinaman. This newcomer, he also</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw, ignored him as though he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">a door-post, confronting the woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">and assailing her with a quick volley</seg><seg type="columnLine">of words, of incomprehensible words</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the native tongue. She answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the same clutter and clack of un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known syllables, growing more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more excited as the dialogue continued.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her thin face darkened and changed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her white arms gyrated, the fires of</seg><seg type="columnLine">anger burned in the babylike eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She seemed expostulating, arguing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">denouncing, and each wordy sally was</seg><seg type="columnLine">met by an equally wordy sally from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Chinaman. She challenged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rebuked with her passionately pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger; she threatened with angry eyes;</seg><seg type="columnLine">she stormed after the newcomer as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed like a shadow out of the room;</seg><seg type="columnLine">she met him with a renewed storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he returned a moment later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chinaman now stood watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, impassive and immobile, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had taken his stand and intended</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stick to it. Blake studied him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">calm and patient eyes. That huge-</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbed detective in his day had</seg><seg type="columnLine">" pounded " too many Christy Street</seg><seg type="columnLine">chinks to be in any way intimidated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a queue and a yellow face. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not disturbed. He was merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the woman turned to the man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">darin coat, and caught it up, shook it</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, and for one brief moment stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully regarding it. Then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly turned about on the China-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blake, as he stood watching that</seg><seg type="columnLine">renewed angry onslaught, paid little</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to the actual words that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was calling out. But as he stood there</seg><seg type="columnLine">he began to realize that she was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking in Chinese, but in English.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Do you hear me, white man? Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you hear me? " she cried out, over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">over again. Yet the words seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolish, for all the time as she uttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">them she was facing the placid-eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinaman and gesticulating in his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Don't you see," Blake at last heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">her crying, " he doesn't know what I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying! He doesn't understand a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word of English!" And then, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then only, it dawned on Blake that</seg><seg type="columnLine">every word the woman was uttering</seg><seg type="columnLine">was intended for his own ears. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was warning him, and all the while</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretending that her words were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">impetuous words of anger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Watch this man!

There was something ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">surd about it, as absurd as a moving-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture film which carries the wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">text.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " He'll pretend to take you to the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SHADOW.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">499</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you want," the woman was panting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" That's what he will say.

The newcomer clut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered a quick sentence or two to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">countryman, and was still talking when</seg><seg type="columnLine">a third" figure sidled in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those spoken words, whatever they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, seemed to have little effect on</seg><seg type="columnLine">any one in the room except the woman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She suddenly sprang about and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploded into an angry shower of denials.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a lie!" she cried in English,</seg><seg type="columnLine">storming about the impassive trio.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" You never heard me peach!

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blake strode to the middle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, towering above the other figures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwarfing them by his great bulk, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured of his mastery as he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been in a Chatham Square gang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the row here?" he thun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered, knowing from the past that</seg><seg type="columnLine">power promptly won its own respect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" What 're you talking about, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">two?"

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three contending figures, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever. ignored him as though he were a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tobacconist's dummy. They wei»t on</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their exotic cackle, as though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no longer in their midst. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not so much as turn an eye in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction. And still Blake felt reason-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably sure of his position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not until the woman squeaked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a frightened mouse, and ran whim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pering into the corner of the room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lie realized what was happening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was not familiar with the wrist</seg><seg type="columnLine">movement by which the smallest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodied of the three men was producing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a knife from his sleeve. The woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">had understood from the first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " White man, look out! " she half</seg><seg type="columnLine">sobbed from her corner. " Oh, white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man! " she repeated in a shriller note</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Chinaman, bending low. scuttled</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the room to the corner where</seg><seg type="columnLine">she cowered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blake saw the knife by this time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was thin and long, for all the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">like an icicle, a shaft of cutting steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground incredibly thin--so thin, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, that at first sight it looked more</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a point for stabbing than a blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">for cutting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mere glitter of that knife elec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trified the staring white man into sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den action. He swung about and tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to catch at the arm that held the steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">icicle. He was too late for that, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fingers closed on the braided queue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By means of this queue he brought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinaman up short, swinging him</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharply about so that he collided fiat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced with the room wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, for the first time, Blake grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a comprehension of what sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded him. He wheeled about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stooped and caught up the papier-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mache tea-tra\* from the floor, and once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more stood with his back to the wall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He stood there, on guard, for a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure with a second steel icicle was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidling up to him. He swung viciously</seg><seg type="columnLine">out and brought the tea-tray down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand that held this knife, crippling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fingers and sending the steel spin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning across the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then with his free hand he tugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">the revolver from his coat-pocket, lidd-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it by the barrel and bringing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal butt down on the queue-wound</seg><seg type="columnLine">head of the third man. who had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife, but was struggling with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman for the metal icicle she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught up from the floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">500</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CAVALIER.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the five seemed to close in to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, and the fight became general.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It became a melee. With his swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">right arm Blake battered and pounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his revolver-butt. With his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand he made cutting strokes with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy papier-mache tea-tray, keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">their steel, by those fierce sweeps, away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One Chinaman he sent sprawling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving him huddled and motionless</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the orange-covered divan. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">second, stunned by a blow of the tea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tray across the eyes, could offer no</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistance when Blake's smashing right</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealt its blow, the metal gun-butt fall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing like a trip-hammer on the shaved</seg><seg type="columnLine">and polished skull.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the white man swung about he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the third Chinaman with his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the woman's throat, holding her</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat against the wall, placing her there</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a butcher might place a fowl on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">block ready for the blow of his carver.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blake stared at the movement, panting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for breath, overcome by that momen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary indifference wherein a winded ath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lete permits without protest an adver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary to gain his momentary advantage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then will triumphed over the weak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of the body. But before Blake</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get to the woman's side he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Chinaman's loose-sleeved right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand slowly and deliberately ascend.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As it reached the meridian of its cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cular upsweep he could see the woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise on her toes, rise as though with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some quick effort, yet some effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Blake could not understand-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the same moment that she did so</seg><seg type="columnLine">a look of pained expostulation crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the staring slant eyes on a level</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her own. The yellow' jaw gaped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with blood, and the poised knife</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell at his side, sticking point down in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flooring. The azure and lemon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">y el low' that covered the woman's body</seg><seg type="columnLine">flamed into sudden scarlet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It wras only as the figure with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">expostulating yellow face sank to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, crumpling up on itself as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell, that Blake comprehended. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick sweep of scarlet, effacing the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">azure and lemon, had come from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden deluge of blood that burst over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woman's body. She had made use</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the upstroke, Mexican style. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">knife had cut the full length of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's abdominal cavity, clean and</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight to the breastbone. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been ripped up like a herring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blake panted and wheezed, not at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of the blood, but at the exertion</seg><seg type="columnLine">to which his flabby muscles had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">put. His body was moist with sweat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His asthmatic throat seemed stifling his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs. A faint nausea crept through</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, a dim ventral revolt at the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that such things could take place so</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily, and with so little warning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His breast still heaved and panted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he was still fighting for breath</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he saw the woman stoop and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wipe the knife on one of the fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chinaman's sleeves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " WVve got to get out of here! " she</seg><seg type="columnLine">whimpered, as she caught up the man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">darin coat and flung it over her shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders, for in the struggle her body had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been bared almost to the waist. Blake</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the crimson that dripped on her</seg><seg type="columnLine">matting slippers and maculated the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cream white of the mandarin coat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " But where's Binhart?

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want that man Binhart!" per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted the detective.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Not here!

They were groping their</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SHADOW.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">501</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">way along a narrow passage. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped through a second door, closed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and locked it after them, and once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">groped on through the darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How many turns they took. Blake</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not remember. She stopped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered to him to go softly? as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to a stairway, as steep and dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a cistern. Blake, at the top. could</seg><seg type="columnLine">smell opium smoke, and once or twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought he heard voices. The wom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">an stopped him, with outstretched arms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the stair Tiead. and together they</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood and listened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Blake, with nerves taut, waited for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some sign from her to go on again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He thought she was giving it, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a hand caress his side. He felt it</seg><seg type="columnLine">move upward, exploringly. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time that he heard her little groan</seg><seg type="columnLine">of alarm he knew that the hand was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">hers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He could not tell what the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">held, but his movement was almost in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinctive. He swung out with his great</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm. countered on the crouching form</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of him, caught at a writhing</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, and tightening his grip, sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body catapulting down the stair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way at his side. He could hear a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver go off as the body went tumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rolling down--Blake knew that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a gun not his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Come on, white man! " the girl in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of him was crying, as she tugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his coat. And they went on. now at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a run. taking a turn to the right, ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">king a second descent, and then another</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the left. They came to still another</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, which they locked behind them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then they scrambled up a ladder, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could hear her quick hands padding</seg><seg type="columnLine">about in the dark. A moment later she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had thrust up a hatch. He saw it led</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the open air, for the stars were above</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt grateful for that open aw, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coolness, for the sense of deliver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance which came with even that com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parative freedom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Don't stop!

RATH</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SYNOPSIS OF PRECEDING CHAPTERS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a six weeks' expedition into the unexplored north woods, Jane Boyce, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman prospector, engages Ben Mitchell as guide. There is something unusual</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Jane's requiring a guide, for she is a perfect woods woman herself, and a fine speci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of physical womanhood. But there her attraction ends, for she is apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">without heart, utterly methodical and unhnman in her movements, entirely introspec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive and uncommunicative. She treats Mitchell like a piece of baggage, and his loneli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness drives him almost frantic. Jane's mission into the wilds is unknown, but thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be gold. One day Ben disobeys her orders by taking the obvious side of a rock in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid instead of the side he w'as told to take. As a result the canoe upsets in the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">swirl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Jane rescues Ben from the rapid as a necessary commodity. One day she compels</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to lie blindfolded on the bottom of the canoe while she makes a long paddle ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently through a rocky gorge. Then he is marooned on an island while she takes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe for the day, returning with a bag of gold. Ben resists this action next day, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a struggle, Jane falls and cuts her head severely. Ben nurses her back to conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, but is thunderstruck to find on her awakening that she is seemingly a totally dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent woman. She says her name is Molly Hope, and of Jane Boyce and the past five</seg><seg type="columnLine">years she knows nothing. Moreover this new- creature is kind, and womanly, and lov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. They prepare to return to civilization, but Ben is overcome with the realization</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Jane alone knew' the way through Blindfold Passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XII.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Search for Escape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">^| *HE realization that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">110 more knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xl w I	the route than she start-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">me' Jane Boyce was</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a memory. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">her had vanished the pilot. I looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Molly Hope helplessly, but she did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not see me. Her eyes seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">fixed on something afar, and I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was thinking of her home and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her people.

One was the fact</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that I wanted a chance to explore for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the channel by which we had entered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the lake. The other was the girl her-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">self, who was now so utterly unfa-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">miliar with woods travel that she need-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ed an opportunity for a brief bit of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">training. I had also thought that her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">head might prevent her from under-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">taking a journey so soon; but in_ this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I was mistaken, for her magnificent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">health was asserting itself. In fact, it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was this physique of heTs that I relied</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upon to carry her through the rough</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">work that was ahead of us. She would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have to learn much, but her body was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">already inured to the task.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But while I hesitated to set out. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">none the less realized the need of an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">early start. Our provisions were ample,</seg><seg type="columnLine">TWO WOMEN, OR ONE?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">505</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">provided we traveled at the same speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Jane Boyce and I had maintained;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I knew we would be unable to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">that rate of progress. Molly Hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">was virtually a novice, and, further,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wound in her head would prevent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the use of a tump-line by her in crossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">portages- Beside that, I had a reluc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance to ask this woman to undertake</seg><seg type="columnLine">the severe physical labor which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a mere incident of the journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Jane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There had been a change in com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand. I was the captain now. True,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was without a course for a part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distance, but I relied upon my</seg><seg type="columnLine">woodcraft to help me there. That part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the journey which I had made with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes open did not worry me for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant. Most of it I had crudely</seg><seg type="columnLine">mapped, and even in the absence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that chart my memory would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">served me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our reversed conditions had a salu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tary' mental effect upon me. I felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had recovered my self-respect. Jane's</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner had constantly impressed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a sense of inferiority that hurt my</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride. The most irksome part of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that I realized much of it to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">true. She had been my superior in</seg><seg type="columnLine">many things; wholly so in a knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the new country through which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed. That was not pleasant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man who considered himself a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woodsman and a guide. I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">educated to feel a sense of responsi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility for the safety of my employers;</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Jane I had been a mere puppet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">serviceable only to cook her food and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry her burdens. Her service had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a humiliation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The new woman demurred at first</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I suggested another day at our</seg><seg type="columnLine">outpost camp; she was restless to be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gin the return. I said nothing then of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most disturbing reason for the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay, but I dwelt entirely upon her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of preparation for the trip. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at the matter in a sensible way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and soon agreed with me. I offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to begin her education immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">after we had breakfasted, and I secret-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ly promised myself a chance to search</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the unknown passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her first night of consciousness as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Molly Hope, she admitted to me, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspired in her vague anxieties. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had wakened several times, not be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of any discomfort from her in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jury, but apparently because of a rest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessness born of her strange situation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The stillness of the woods had awed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her rather than frightened her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strangeness of her awakening after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the five lost years was constantly pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent in her mind. She had dreamed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, but it was as Molly Hope, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">visions of her home, and not as Jane</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boyce, following her lone career in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wilderness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had been wondering, despite her</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete mental separation from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woman Prospector, whether there lin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered in her a subconscious memory;</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether the muscles developed during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chapter she had just closed would</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinctively follow their long training.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It surprised me to discover that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed not the slightest notion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">things that had been second nature to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. She had the strength to do all</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jane Boyce had done, without the least</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea how to use it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was even timid about entering</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canoe, although she assured me she</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew' how to swim. The absence of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat surprised her, and when I suggest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed that she kneel, as Jane had done,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she did so doubtfully. Nothing aston-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished her more as we made that first</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimental trip to discover that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">position neither cramped nor tired her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but was, on the contrary, quite com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of the uses of a paddle she had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">conception other than that gained from</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching canoeists at a summer resort</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had once visited. But the paddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">is at once the most primitive and natur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">al manner for man to drive a craft; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is merely a development of the swim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming instinct. Rowing is artificial. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not take her long to wield her blade</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, although I could see that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning again at the bottom.</seg><seg type="columnLine">506</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CAVALIER.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Wliither to go in search for the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage I had no idea whatever. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">I lay blindfold in the bottom of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe L remembered clearly sensing</seg><seg type="columnLine">our return into the bright sunlight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a period of travel through cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimness. From the instant of emer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging from the passage until the canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">had touched the shore where our camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">was made i had roughly judged the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interval to be in the neighborhood of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten minutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But that was mere conjecture; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might just as easily have been twenty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the elapse of time under the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition which Jane had imposed is con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusing to calculate. In ten minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could easily have driven the canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mile; in twenty minutes twice that</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance. Whether she had followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a straight course was also beyond my</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge. She might have doubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and forth among the islands in</seg><seg type="columnLine">order to destroy my sense of direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a certainty. The passage might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">within a quarter-mile of us, for there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was mainland as near as that, or it</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be eight times that distance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While I had no serious doubt of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability to locate it. nevertheless the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waste of time that it might involve</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave me some uneasiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were numerous islands in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake, though neither so many as in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjoining one nor so uniform in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">character. I first made a circuit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own, scanning closely those por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of the surrounding hills that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in view, and finally I struck for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">west shore, as being the most likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">for our purpose. Tt was half a mile</seg><seg type="columnLine">across, and showed patches of bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff that looked promising from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance. On the other side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake the hills were sloping and verdant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was exhilarating to be at the paddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, particularly after my experience</seg><seg type="columnLine">in being marooned two days before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It pleased me, also, to note that while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Hope found the manipulation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her paddle a strange proceeding, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoyed the novelty. Constantly she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would ask me if she were doing it cor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rectly. and I found a readiness in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow suggestions that was encour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aging. The motion of the canoe ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">to disturb her after a while, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned to know that the canvas craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">could rise and dip and even roll to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable angle with perfect safety.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Balance in a canoe becomes instinctive</seg><seg type="columnLine">with practise, and I saw signs that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be long in acquiring it. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no hint of memory in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">good progress she made; the work was</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming easily to her simply because</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had the physique ready-made to</seg><seg type="columnLine">undertake it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " By and by, when you get used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a canoe." I said, " I'll show you how</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use the stern paddle and steer."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You think 1 can learn that? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. " I know it. As a matter of fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although you do not know it, you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the best steersmen I ever saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a canoe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She rested her paddle across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunwales and looked back at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Isn't it strange, she said, musing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. " that all this should seem utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">new to me. It isn't difficult, exactly;</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's just new."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Are you tired? " I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Not a bit. That is so puzzling, too."</seg><seg type="columnLine">" It's not astonishing, though," I an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered. " Jane was absolutely tire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Is that what you called me--Jane ? "</seg><seg type="columnLine">" You ordered me to call you that,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I explained. " It was shorter than Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boyce. Miss Hope."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The conjunction of the two names,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made unconsciously, sounded rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely, and she noticed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It must be very curious to you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said, " to know a person by two</seg><seg type="columnLine">names, each given to you in good faith.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I would like you to forget the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. if you will, and call me Molly, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is good to have short names in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is convenient," I answered. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was glad to call her Molly, because</seg><seg type="columnLine">t here was something pleasant about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name. But as forgetting either Jane</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boyce or her name, I knew full well</seg><seg type="columnLine">TWO WOMEN, OR ONE?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">507</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that to the end of my life there had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been stamped upon my mind a memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, even though unpleasant, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">never fade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what did I call you?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, suddenly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Mitchell," I answered, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh. " Without prefix or handle or</seg><seg type="columnLine">decoration--plain Mitchell. But if it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">just the same to you, I'd prefer to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">called Ben while I'm working at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">job. Then, after we get back to civili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zation, you can give me all the conven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional titles that an American citizen</seg><seg type="columnLine">has a right to enjoy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Very well," she assented, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nod, and she was picking up her paddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">again when I interrupted her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " By the way, Jane was paying me</seg><seg type="columnLine">two seventy-five a day. Does that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked at me with a puzzled air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but saw a whimsical look in my eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You've no idea." she said, " how</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd it is to be told of things that you've</seg><seg type="columnLine">done and don't remember.

I haven't the least</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea about that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Better be careful," I warned her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughingly, " about assuming your for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mer financial obligations. You don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what they may be. But the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventy-five was a bona-fide bargain."</seg><seg type="columnLine">" It seems little. I shall owe you</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than that," she answered, gravely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both of us, I think, had forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the bag of gold. All ideas of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jane's mine had been swept from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind by anxiety to locate our home-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward route, and from hers, by her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">longing to get news of her people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were close under the cliffs of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">west shore now, and I let the canoe run</seg><seg type="columnLine">along to the southward for nearly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile, scanning the rocks closely. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">contour of this shore-line was almost</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">straight, with no coves or bays.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stunted and half-starved evergreens</seg><seg type="columnLine">clung tenaciously to its steep sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherever the rock was not wholly bare,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but nowhere was there the slightest</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion of a passage through, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">even a cavelike aperture to hold out</seg><seg type="columnLine">encouragement. I swung the canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">around when we had gone as far as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">judged would equal the greatest dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance that Jane could possibly have</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered, and started back over the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, still studying the rocks care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a while I noticed that Molly</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ceased paddling and was half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced about, watching me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Are you looking for something?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Don't you know?

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Yes, I do recall you said some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about that," she answered.

But I saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the incident had started a line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought in her mind, nevertheless, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was pondering over it as she re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed her paddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For two miles more we skirted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore, going northward now, but still</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was the same unbroken line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff. This brought us to the north end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lake, and we followed that. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruggedness of this shore was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickly covered with verdure, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a dip in the hills that suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">another basin beyond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were low, wooded points,</seg><seg type="columnLine">separating from each other a series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bays, and into each of these we went,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scanning every yard of the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrowly. There was not a break in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boundary-line of solid land, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even a little brook coming down from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hillsides. I was disappointed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat worried. The west shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the north had. from their outward</seg><seg type="columnLine">aspect, given the most promise of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining the mysterious passage, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">both were within the distance that Jane</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boyce might have covered from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time we emerged into the daylight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Molly noticed the baffled expression</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my face, for she said, rather sadly:</seg><seg type="columnLine">" I wish I could remember; I wish I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could help you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I don't," I answered, bluntly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But why?"

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was filled with indentations, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though we kept close to the rocky edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the way, there was no sign of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last we reached a point beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it would have been impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Jane to have covered the distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">to camp within the time I allowed her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Filled with the wonder of the thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I reluctantly headed the canoe back to-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ward our island. It was nearing noon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it would not help matters to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">without lunch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Molly joined in the work of pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paring the meal, and was not so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a culinary novice as she had modest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly declared herself to be. But her ways</seg><seg type="columnLine">were those of the kitchen, and not of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woods, and the primitive awkward-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of our appliances bothered her for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a while.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We talked but little as we ate, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my thoughts dwelt entirely upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious situation in which we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed. I had explored the three shores</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherein the passage must surely lie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">allowing more than a sufficient radius</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cover the time occupied by Jane after</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had emerged from the channel, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">without result.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would be useless to go farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">south. How far the lake stretched in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that direction I did not know, nor did</seg><seg type="columnLine">it matter. I had covered every bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore that was within possibility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">consideration. The only thing to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to go over the ground again. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">I knew in which direction the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake lay my work would be narrowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, but I had not the slightest no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of it. Yet this speculation over</seg><seg type="columnLine">its compass direction put an idea into</seg><seg type="columnLine">my head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I'm going over to that west shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">again," I told Molly, " to climb that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill.

Will you</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay in camp, or do you want to come ? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I want to come," she answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly. " I don't want to be left</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This feeling of hers was impressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon me in the days that followed; she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not afraid of the wilderness, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she did not like to be left alone with</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. Again, she was the antithesis of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jane Boyce.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After some search along the west</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore.

I drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canoe out at the foot oi the steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb, and we started- upward, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Molly insisted on accompanying me</seg><seg type="columnLine">even here.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not particularly dangerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, but it was nothing but sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">toil. We scrambled over rough ledges,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung ourselves along with the aid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strongly rooted trees, and crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up steep inclines where the hands as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as the feet had to be employed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">always working upward. I estimated</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the top must be six or seven hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet above the surface of the lake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were both hot, breathless, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">weary when we reached the summit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She stood the journey fully as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">1, however; and with every fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">demonstration of her strength and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardiness I gave thanks that in the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey that lay ahead of us I had for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a companion one who was not a phys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical, if perhaps a mental, tenderfoot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I began to think, alter all, we might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to travel as rapidly as I had jour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neyed with Jane Boyce.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a fine sweep of rolling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooded country to be seen from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eminence on which we stood--but 110</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake. East, north, and west I studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">the view. We were high enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">overlook the hills on the opposite side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our own lake, which lay glimmering</seg><seg type="columnLine">below us in the afternoon sun; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no water visible beyond. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake we had left behind, I knew, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a considerable body, and its distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">from us was not great. This made my</seg><seg type="columnLine">failure to get even a glimpse of it all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the more astonishing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went over the landscape again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, with no better result.

The cliff on which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood was bare of trees at the top, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could see far to the westward, across</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a rocky, jagged, and waterless expanse.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The lake below us, which contained our</seg><seg type="columnLine">island and our camp, was like a beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful, living map, but 1 had no eyes for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. .Molly seemed to find something</seg><seg type="columnLine">attractive in it. but 1 was looking for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Well," 1 said, at length.

It was impossible, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I should not be able to locate our</seg><seg type="columnLine">route, ultimately; and if our supply of</seg><seg type="columnLine">provisions had not made time a highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">important factor, I think the mystery</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the thing would have entertained</seg><seg type="columnLine">me for a few days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I was puzzled and uneasy over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the failure to find a solution of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem, after the magnificent view of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surrounding country which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heights of the west shore afforded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was something unnatural about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. something of the dark wizardry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jane herself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While I had not much hope that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills of the east shore would offer even</seg><seg type="columnLine">so favorable an opportunity to study</seg><seg type="columnLine">the landscape as those of the west, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">TWO WOMEN, OR ONE?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">511</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nevertheless determined to try them</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first thing in the morning.

But she was sure that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in this lake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thing was impossible. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been taken through a narrow, dark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">passageway, I knew for a certainty--</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one water into another.

One</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake was as different from another as</seg><seg type="columnLine">black from white. And yet--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What Molly had told me puzzled me</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond measure.

They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">unique in the regularity of their ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rangement and the uniformity of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">size and contour. Yet it was evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl had seen something to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had not given a glance. I had paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the slightest attention to our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheet of water and its reaches to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">southward. My eyes had been roving</seg><seg type="columnLine">eastward, northward, westward, look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for the lake that seemed to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now I wras vexed with myself that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had thus limited my scrutiny from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hilltop. Not that it was possible the</seg><seg type="columnLine">islands she described were really in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own lake, for where then was the cool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark, and narrow passage? But it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely possible that she had actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked upon the water for which I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching, and that the barrier which</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay between it and us had escaped her</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Over and over again I questioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">514</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CAVALIER.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her on this point, but she was uniform-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly positive she had not made a mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">take; everything she had seen lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">within our own lake. Her certainty</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">discouraged me. At first I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had chanced upon a discovery of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the utmost importance. Now it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she had merely sighted a group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">islands which, if not really like those</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which Jane had piloted me. at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least had some strong points of resem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Do you think I saw anything that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">will help us?

We</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked much about ourselves and about</seg><seg type="columnLine">her family. Not often did we speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the strange creature she had been;</seg><seg type="columnLine">at night it seemed to make her shudder</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think of Jane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We watched the stars grow more</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerous in the darkening sky. chart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing themselves in the still water at our</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet.

And off in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance came the deep, dusky notes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moose calling to his mate. The sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled her. and led us into a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">avenue of thought that kept us out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our blankets until nearly midnight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Will you take me up the cliff again</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the morning?

Molly had not arisen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I thought it useless to awaken her</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely to take her on another toilsome</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb. I slid the canoe quietly into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water and set off for the west shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">with long, swift strokes, my mind ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive and eager with speculation over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the islands of -which she had told'me</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So anxious was I to hurry up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steep ascent that I came near losing</seg><seg type="columnLine">my life when about half-way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top.

It re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired no effort after that for me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put a curb upon my impatience, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the rest of the ascent cautiously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">TWO WOMEN, OR ONE?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">515</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The morning sun and breeze had</seg><seg type="columnLine">banished much of the mist as 1 reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of the cliff, and I turned toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the south, where the lake stretched off</seg><seg type="columnLine">to its greatest length. And there I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the islands of which Molly had spoken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were the islands of Jane Boyce!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I would have known them anywhere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far as I could have distinguished the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlines of land and water.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to be utterly sure. 1 wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">my reason as well as my instinct to tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that 1 was looking upon the lost and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought for place. But there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistake about it. They were there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful, green, and quiet in the early</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight, as mysterious as the day I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had first seen them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And they were in this lake!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The expanse of water was unbroken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">save by scattered islands that lay be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween me and the tiny archipelago be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">5rond. Molly was right again. Where,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, was the narrow passage through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Jane had driven the canoe?</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was not the slightest sign of it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no visible spot in the landscape that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could possibly contain it. I began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder if I had fallen- asleep as I lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">blindfolded that day and dreamed an</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience that was a mere fiction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brain. But no; I was sure of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage, sure of my own wakefulness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some time I stood there, trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reconcile the situation in my mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The effort was futile. Once more be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore I descended I carefully surveyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the islands, making a map of them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my brain. To reach them was so easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it seemed almost untrue. And be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond them lay the trail home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With feverish strokes I drove the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe back to our camp, after a cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tious descent of the cliff.

I could take Molly</seg><seg type="columnLine">home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was standing close to the water</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">as I swung into the little cove at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot of our camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You went without me," she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">reproachfully.

It was she</seg><seg type="columnLine">who got the breakfast, while I busied</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself rolling our blankets into packs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking down the tents and hunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">around for the articles that invariably</seg><seg type="columnLine">get to lying loose, even in the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">methodical camp. It was not a bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast, either; I have eaten both bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter and worse in the woods of my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooking. She worked without the fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cility or the speed of Jane, and I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that things came unhandy to her;</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet it saved me a lot of time that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">should even be able to do that much.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was no less impatient to start than</seg><seg type="columnLine">she. We were now out three weeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">516</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CAVALIER.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">from our starting-point, and we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">provisioned for only six. It was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be expected that Molly would travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">as rapidly as Jane; I was allowing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference of at least four days, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant we would be exceedingly short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if not actually out of grub, by the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">we reached the Deep-Water. Another</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason for my impatience was a desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to solve the mystery of the dark, cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage which, despite the surprising</seg><seg type="columnLine">discoveries of the early morning, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet willing to concede was merely a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of the imagination.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Molly washed up the dishes and put</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tins and cooking utensils into their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bag, while 1 loaded the canoe with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavier duffel. After that I collected</seg><seg type="columnLine">the litter that had resulted from three</seg><seg type="columnLine">or four days of camping and burned it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was a useless procedure, off in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lonely wild, I admit, yet it grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of habit. No man who has con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sideration either for nature or for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">camper who may follow him will leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind him a trashy camp. I hate to</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk into one, and I don't want any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body to be inflicted with one of my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">making. And then, when we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to set out, I poured a few pail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuls of wrater over the smoking ashes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our fireplace, which is the last and</seg><seg type="columnLine">never-to-be-neglected ceremony in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp, and joined Molly in the canoe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was her first voyage when we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully laden, and for a time she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">plainly nervous over the fact that our</seg><seg type="columnLine">gunwale was several inches nearer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water than when she made her trial</seg><seg type="columnLine">trips in the canoe. But when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped the fact that we had greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">stability, even if less freeboard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, her timidity subsided and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to give an eye to things about</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here, of course, she was utterly dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent from Jane Boyce, who saw noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing but the road ahead, and who cared</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing for some beauty that might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be almost at her elbow. Molly's inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est in the things that bordered our path</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one factor that cost us time. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all a wonderland to her; she was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">like a little child wandering through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream - garden. Added was the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she could not ply a paddle as had</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jane. This was the thing that attracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">my notice more strongly. She crouched</seg><seg type="columnLine">on her knees as did Jane, and--in fig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure, at least--she was the same splen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">did athlete; but she neither possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unconscious skill nor the dogged</seg><seg type="columnLine">perseverance of the woman who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappeared. Her paddle would falter</seg><seg type="columnLine">as her eyes wandered to some new vista</seg><seg type="columnLine">abeam, and sometimes it would cease</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether. I made no attempt to urge</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to steady effort, but merely in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased my own exertions to overcome</seg><seg type="columnLine">the difference.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I lay our course southward in the di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection of the magic islands. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">among which we were passing now</seg><seg type="columnLine">were typical of the ordinary lake in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the north country, and it was still al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most impossible to believe they lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the same sheet of water that</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained the curious little archipelago</seg><seg type="columnLine">at which I had marveled several days</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. In fact, although with my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes I had seen it from the hilltop. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still reluctant to admit the absence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a hidden channel through which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">must pass. I had a vague sensation</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, after all. we might be pursuing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere mirage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our route I kept near the middle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lake, and in a few minutes we</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared the island group that lay at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">north end. Two miles or more beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">us was now visible the green allurement</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Islands of Jane. Between them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and our canoe lay a solitary island</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we would pass close on the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand if we held our course. It was ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently small when I first sighted it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat rugged, and not well favored</seg><seg type="columnLine">with shrubbery or trees; but as we drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearer I perceived that it lay pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward us. like a needle, and possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">considerable length. We were giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">it a berth of a couple of hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we reached a point abreast of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">when some idle curiosity impelled me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to swing the canoe almost at a right</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle and head toward it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">TWO .WOMEN, OR ONE?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Molly stopped paddling and watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearing rocks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Are we to stop here?

As we drew nearly oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">site to it, it became evident that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a cave, but rather- a crevice, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks were open at the top, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">they hung closer to each other than at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water's edge. Again I stopped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe, Avhen we were within a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards of the opening. A premonition</seg><seg type="columnLine">that speedily developed into a convic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion seized me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Molly looked around with a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">shiver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " It looks spooky," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " It looks like an explanation," I an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered, sending the canoe forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of what? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Of the passage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Molly was wide-eyed as she turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">from me and again examined the rag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ged, gray rocks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You mean--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " That I believe Jane played a trick</seg><seg type="columnLine">on me," I finished for her. " It's ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traordinary, but it won't take long to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out whether I'm right about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The canoe had reached the jaws of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cleft, and as I looked upward I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see a strip of sky, stretching in</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of us like a bright, blue ribbon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The passage, as far as 1 could pene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trate the gloom with my eyes, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be straight, although its rocky walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">were irregular in contour. The chan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel was perhaps a dozen feet wide at its</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest breadth, narrowing gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it receded from us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here was the explanation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery of the passage. I had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong after all. But who would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamed of such a channel through an</seg><seg type="columnLine">island? Never before had I seen such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a curious phenomenon in the north</seg><seg type="columnLine">country. The island itself, I remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bered having viewed from the summit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the west cliff, but from that distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was nothing that suggested the</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence of a passageway, even had I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of looking for it there. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">grain of the rock ran almost perpen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicularly, as if the original deposit had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been upended by some convulsion so</seg><seg type="columnLine">purely local in its character as not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">affect the surrounding islands, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealed no characteristics of this kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The island was apparently split from</seg><seg type="columnLine">end to end, through its greatest length,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though a monster wedge had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to make the clearage. To what</seg><seg type="columnLine">depth it was split I had no way of judg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, nor ain- apparatus for sounding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">channel. That the rocks had not di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided in an absolutely straight line wras</seg><seg type="columnLine">obvious, else there would have been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vista of open water at the farther end.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some scant shrubbery overhung the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of the cleft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I urged the canoe slowly forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a length or two into the passage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">518</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CAVALIER.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and then paused again to puzzle over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">this geologic oddity. It was very cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">and still between those walls of solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone, which ran to a height of perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty feet from the water's edge at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entrance and were evidently still</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher toward the center of the island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was not the island itself at</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I marveled most. It was at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cunning of Jane. Nothing could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">more completely deceived me into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">belief that I had been taken from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake into another than the method she</seg><seg type="columnLine">employed. She knew, of course, better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than 1. the utterly different characteris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tics presented by the north and south</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends of the lake, and this dark cleft in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an island that lay midway furnished</seg><seg type="columnLine">her the means of bewildering me. Once</seg><seg type="columnLine">at our camp, she had planned to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a prisoner each day. so I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no opportunity to solve the riddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had no doubt whatever that Jane</seg><seg type="columnLine">intended to take me back under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same conditions, so that I would never</seg><seg type="columnLine">have known or suspected the ruse to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which she had resorted. Even now I</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe she intentionally neglected to</seg><seg type="columnLine">place a gag in my mouth, so I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak aloud and confirm in my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind the impression that I was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">conducted through a dark, narrow pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage. Her remark, when we reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp, that she should have gagged me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">was merely another step in the decep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Constantly, since the transformation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had been watching Molly for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of memory, even though it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be subconscious, of the days when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been the woman prospector. Little</seg><seg type="columnLine">incidents of the day's routine, the do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of things which were a second na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture to Jane, I thought might arouse in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her a recollection. But I had watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">in vain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now I was observing her closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, for it seemed that if anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">would awaken memory it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">some grim, fantastic thing like this cleft</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the island. It was always with a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain apprehension that I looked for such</seg><seg type="columnLine">manifestations; so, too. I always felt a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of satisfaction at each confirma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the fact that Jane was wholly</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone from her. I wanted Molly to for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">get; 1 wanted no more of the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature who had made such an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">canny impression upon me that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost succeeded in changing me from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a normal being into one as abnormal as</seg><seg type="columnLine">herself, which I believe she verily would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done had she not so suddenly van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Molly turned to me with a shudder</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we lay motionless just inside the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Must we go this way? " she whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered. Even the whisper sounded hol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, and there was a faint echo that</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '' I'm curious to see the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">through," I answered. " Unless you</seg><seg type="columnLine">really object we'll go ahead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Suppose." she said, with a glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward at the strip of sky, " the rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">should close in on us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I believe there's no fear of it. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it alarms you, we'll back out and go</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the island.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " No; never mind." she said. " Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't let's talk while we're in here: it</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounds so unearthly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She placed her paddle in the canoe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew her sweater over her shoulders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crouched down in her place while</seg><seg type="columnLine">I began the trip through Blindfold Pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage, as we afterward named it. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something awe inspiring about this</seg><seg type="columnLine">waterway through the cleft, and, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I felt it to be quite without dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger. I shared something of her feelings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we penetrated nearer to the heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the island the channel turned slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly to the left and became narrower,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while a glance upward showed me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the height of the walls had nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubled. For a few minutes each day</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was probably a little sunlight in</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, but the orb was not yet high</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to afford that as we slowly went</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward. There was a sort of half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light in the place that seemed to throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">no shadows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I remembered that at one point on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the voyage with Jane the canoe had</seg><seg type="columnLine">TWO WOMEN, OR ONE?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">519</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">scraped slightly, and I was watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this evidently very narrow spot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The explanation of the incident came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a moment. We turned again to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right and I beheld a few feet ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us an immense boulder, which seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first glance to completely block the</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage. It was a rock that had fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">from above, wedging itself between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliffs before it touched the water. As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined the obstruction I perceived</seg><seg type="columnLine">that at one side there was about three</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet of head room, with even less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of width between boulder and cliff.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Molly crouched lower as I gently urged</seg><seg type="columnLine">the canoe forward, and I, myself, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stoop in order to clear the overhang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing rock. It was not a pleasant experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence. While we were underneath this</seg><seg type="columnLine">great stone I could not help wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">what would happen if the cliffs should</seg><seg type="columnLine">open but a few inches more, instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">closing, as Molly had seemed to fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was only about twenty feet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this overhung passage, a chill, dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">place where there was no room to han-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle a paddle, and where I kept the ca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noe moving by placing my hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the damp rocks and pushing us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward. Once or twice we scraped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as we had done when Jane was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pilot and I the blindfolded passenger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think Molly breathed a sigh of relief</seg><seg type="columnLine">as -sve got out from under the boulder;</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know that I did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another slight turn in the channel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the farther end was visible. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls began to spread away from each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, and in the roomier space I picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up my paddle again and drove us for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward quickly. To tell the truth, I want-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed to get out of the place. Some fool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish apprehension even caused me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance over my shoulder, as if I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected to see the passage closing after</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, like the dark and fearsome paths</seg><seg type="columnLine">we sometimes tread in nightmares, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways with the leaden feet which cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">carry us away from a danger that</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatens. A moment more and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged into the sunlight. Beyond an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbroken stretch of calm, shining wa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter lay the islands of Jaue Boyce.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Molly threw off her sweater and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched her arms wide, as il to throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">off some burden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Did I--did Jane actually take you</seg><seg type="columnLine">through that place ? " she asked with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">involuntary shudder, as she turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look back at the entranee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Jane did," I nodded. " But I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanker after it much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It frightens me just to think of it! "</seg><seg type="columnLine">she exclaimed. " But it frightens me</seg><seg type="columnLine">more to think of her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " There are your islands.-' I said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing. " They look pleasanter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shall we go on ? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For answer she took her paddle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried the blade with a deep, strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroke. There was more than half an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour of traveling before we reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nearest of the islands, and I head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed directly for the center of the group.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had I possessed an)- serious doubt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ability to follow a fairly straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">course among them I should have skirt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed either the west or the east shore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would inevitably bring us to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream through which Jane and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the lake. But I felt certain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the conformation of the hills that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could see beyond, that the inlet was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost due south of us, and that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">islands lay directly in our path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we swept into the first of the nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row channels that separated one from</seg><seg type="columnLine">another, Molly paused in her paddling</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and uttered an exclamation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">delight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It's like something in a fairv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">story," she said. " We have left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ogre and his den behind us.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Truly, those islands are one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant places of earth. The sun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting hot now, and we ran close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shady shores, where the trees sheltered</seg><seg type="columnLine">us from its ravs. The green gentleness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these curiously regular bits oi* land</seg><seg type="columnLine">invited us to linger aud almost caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moll}- and I to falter in our resolution</seg><seg type="columnLine">to push the return journey swiftly. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I shook off the spell and kept the prow</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily southward, as nearly as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winding channels would permit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we finally emerged from the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">520</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CAVALIER.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">placid channel, Molly looked back with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sigh of regret at the scene we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving behind us. I put the canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">about and headed for the nearest island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " We're at least justified in stopping</seg><seg type="columnLine">for lunch," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Thank you for that." she an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered. " I hate to see them go--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet I want to get home, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While we ate a hasty meal we began</seg><seg type="columnLine">the business of naming things in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">virgin country. Very likely the Indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ans had named these places centuries</seg><seg type="columnLine">before; it may even have been that Jane</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boyce had christened them anew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though if she did she kept her nomen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clature to herself. But by right of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery, Molly and I made free to</seg><seg type="columnLine">disregard all names that may have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">given in the days past.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She demurred when I insisted that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curious water we were about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">quit should be called Molly Lake, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was willing that the place where our</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp had been should be named Wa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">king Island. It was there she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakened from the long years when her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind slumbered, and when Jane had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in possession of her body. As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have already told, we called the nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row cleft through which we had come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blindfold Passage: the island itself we</seg><seg type="columnLine">christened The Barrier. This was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">memory of the idea which Jane had in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stilled in my mind by her subtle strat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">egy. The green islands 1 associated</seg><seg type="columnLine">so vividly with Jane that she finally let</seg><seg type="columnLine">me have my way; I told her that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Woman Prospector at least should pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sess the privilege of having her name</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried with her in the wilderness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So we called them The Islands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jane. Incongruous it was. perhaps, tor</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all things they were different from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jane; yet they were what we hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jane might become in whatever strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">place to which her disembodied spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">may have journeyed. The cliff wre had</seg><seg type="columnLine">scaled became Discovery Hill, in honor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its service in pointing the road.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the island where we halted I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see the mouth of the little river</seg><seg type="columnLine">down which Jane and I had come on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">our last day's journey together. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">current was sluggish, and I knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could follow the stream for many</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles, even against it, before the hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">toil of portaging would come. As we</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered its channel--Mitchell River it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is on my own crude map, so christened</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Molly--both of us turned by a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon impulse to take a last look at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake and The Islands of Jane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To Molly this was the setting of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the strangest scenes of her life; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 think, despite her longing to return</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her people, she had a vague feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of regret as we left it behind. I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I did. The lake, with all the cu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rious things it contained, had cast a</seg><seg type="columnLine">spell of fascination upon me. I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was leaving buried there a being</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had played a brief but extraor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinary part in my own life, where her</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange spirit would sleep forever,</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere among the stalwart hills,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gentle islands, the still, shining wa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters, and the waving pines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good-by, Jane!" I called softly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we swung around a bend in the river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the lake was shut from our sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Molly turned and looked at me. then</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowed her head for an instant and</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed her hand across her forehead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Good-by, Jane." she murmured, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she resumed her paddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not care to urge the girl too</seg><seg type="columnLine">far on her first day of travel, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">camped before sundown on the river-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank, a few miles below a rapid where</seg><seg type="columnLine">I feared we w'ould have to portage the</seg><seg type="columnLine">following forenoon.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to look forward to the meeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her people confidently; she pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured her mother, her father, and her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">brother waiting for her. As she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived, she expected to find them alive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I encouraged her in this, simply for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">own sake; there was no way of reason-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to a conclusion, for it was purely</seg><seg type="columnLine">a matter of faith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I found the girl to be a mixture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave and gay; sometimes there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick flashes of humor in her that as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonished me, when I remembered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">burden of anxiety she was bearing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Often she would look at me swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">after one of these revelations, her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">again serious, and her mind apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering if I judged her to be heart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less because of a sudden flood of</seg><seg type="columnLine">merriment. I think that I never misun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstood her.

Always I</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed with her, for my own nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">is buoyant, and it had long been in</seg><seg type="columnLine">bondage under the black magic of Jane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From things she told me, from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech, and from the whole trend of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her thoughts, I found Molly to possess</seg><seg type="columnLine">a breadth of view and a sympathy so</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly unlike the woman who had dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared that for a time it seemed im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to realize the fact. Her par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ents had given her the opportunities</seg><seg type="columnLine">for education, rather than educated</seg><seg type="columnLine">her; she had followed the bent of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">independent and receptive mind. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ever willing to learn even the sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plest things. The life into which she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had awakened was all new, and a virgin</seg><seg type="columnLine">field for her study. At every turn she</seg><seg type="columnLine">found wonders in it that fascinated her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager brain. She brought a freshness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vision to bear upon things which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become commonplace to me. and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I envied her. It was like walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a new childhood for Molly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Often we wondered together whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">the missing years would ever be recon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed ; but Jane, in her secrecy, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left scarcely a clue. The first year we</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled over most. It must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the period of preparation for her new</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, but it had not been spent in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deep-Water country.

But in the camp hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plotting out of a past fur Jane</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boyce frequently occupied us. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">winters away from the Deep-Water</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a series of mysteries. Molly</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked to think that she had gone back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the States, perhaps hovering some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where near the beloved family. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">even speculated as to whether Jane had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever seen her mother as she wandered</seg><seg type="columnLine">along her solitary path. My own be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lief was that Jane probably did not go</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the borders of the nearest Cana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dian city; I pictured her as a creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">unwilling to stray farther from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place of her ambitions than necessity</seg><seg type="columnLine">decreed. Yet, here I realized my rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soning to be faulty; for Jane, had she</seg><seg type="columnLine">chosen, could as easily have spent her</seg><seg type="columnLine">winters in the Deep-Water country as</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the more luxurious surroundings ot</seg><seg type="columnLine">a town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The thing that battled us beyond all</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempts at progress, however, was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trend of Jane's mind. Time and again</seg><seg type="columnLine">I questioned Molly to learn if, even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleeting moments, she ever had impulses</seg><seg type="columnLine">which in any manner suggested the</seg><seg type="columnLine">career the Woman Prospector had</seg><seg type="columnLine">carved for herself. She could recall</seg><seg type="columnLine">none. She had neither experience ol</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woods nor an interest in them. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no thirst for riches, and she need-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed none. Her family. 1 learned, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">not wealthy according to the modern</seg><seg type="columnLine">standards, coukl give her every luxury</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pleasure that a gently bred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal-minded girl craves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  There seemed to be absolutely noth-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing in her life to serve as a basis for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the narrow but highly concentrated am-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bitions of Jane. Most dreams have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their suggestion in some thought that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lias come into the waking mind. Jane's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">life was a dream that had 110 origin in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mind of Molly. Had Jane, in be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming another woman, chosen some</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuit within the experience or knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of her past, the thing would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been so amazing, even though she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had remembered nothing of the years</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone before; but to turn abruptly into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a path of which Molly had never so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much as thought was as inexplicable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us as the amazing effect of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">accidents to her head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I have said that Molly viewed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical changes which had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrought in her with astonishment. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">she also discovered a delight in them</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could not conceal. I know that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed for a large mirror; for I sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised her one day studying an image</seg><seg type="columnLine">of herself in a glassy pool of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">near our camp. She was leaning for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, turning from side to side to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">new glimpses of the strong but charm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing figure that was her heritage from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jane. She turned quickly when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">became aware of my scrutiny, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh and a blush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " I*m just a woman, after all." she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. " I want to look at myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " By no means an idle occupation."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I observed, studying her in admiration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The remark was perfectly harmless;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but, somehow, I was sorry after I made</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. I did not want Molly to think I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">addicted to cheap flattery, nor to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flict on her the embarrassment of it;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I was satisfied she had no love of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. But if she fell I had struck a false</seg><seg type="columnLine">note, she turned the conversation easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">and without apparent notice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Tliese clothes still astonish me."</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said frankly.

What sort of dresses did Jane</seg><seg type="columnLine">have ? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I was obliged to confess an igno-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rance of Jane's wardrobe, beyond her</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession of a heavy corduroy skirt</seg><seg type="columnLine">TWO WOMEN, OR ONE?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">523</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had seen her wear at the Moose</seg><seg type="columnLine">Island post.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Dreadful!

"I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Deep-Water to Buffalo once</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a rig like this, with no hat, and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">even a coat, and walked into the swell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est hotel I could find at the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " But you're a man, and men can do</seg><seg type="columnLine">things like that.

But Molly was purely femi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine, with all the instinct of adornment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It pleased me to see her that way; I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had my fill of woman freaks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another day I caught her singing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The notes were deep and rich and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded, unspoiled by the training that</seg><seg type="columnLine">teaches technique above all other</seg><seg type="columnLine">things.

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It's one of the purest and most</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural I ever heard," I replied truth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It's so queer," she said, after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause. " I didn't ask because I wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to praise it. I really wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know. Before the accident happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">--before Jane came--I used to sing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it w^as with a very small sort of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice that had no power or volume, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">really not any sweetness in it. I sang</seg><seg type="columnLine">correctly enough. I imagine, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a commonplace, parlor voice, with-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">out any individuality. But now, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 sing some of the old songs, I cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">help realizing that my voice is utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">new. It's bigger, for one thing, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can use it so easily that it astonishes</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. The noise of it almost frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">me at first; it seemed as if somebody</seg><seg type="columnLine">else were singing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You're just beginning to appre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciate how much Jane did for you," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">told her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I suppose so," she answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully.

Nearly all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy carrying fell upon me. Molly</seg><seg type="columnLine">was willing, but she was hampered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her head, from which I had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet removed the stitches, and she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">also unfamiliar with the work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Neither did she possess the stoicism</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Jane, who I doubted not was often</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscle-weary, yet who never gave a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign that the heavy labor annoyed her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our mental attitude toward difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical tasks goes a long way toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">making them a plague or a pleasure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While I think Jane never found pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure in them, she was at least quite in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">different to them. Molly's attitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unlike. She did not shirk, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">toil was of the mind as well as of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I rigged up some light packs for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her that she could carry with shoulder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">straps, and with these on her back she</seg><seg type="columnLine">would trudge over the portages while</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sweated under the heavy loads. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">overland transportation of the canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonished her; she told me that until</seg><seg type="columnLine">she saw how the trick was done by</seg><seg type="columnLine">balancing it on my shoulders she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered how in the world she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">524</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CAVALIER-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ever be able to carry one end oi it over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rough trail.

She made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey in safety, but it was only on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the comparatively smooth paths that 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever trusted her to handle the canoe. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think she felt that I regarded her as</seg><seg type="columnLine">less a woodsman than Jane, although I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never would admit it when she ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The day we reached the rapid from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Jane had dragged me uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious made a deep impression upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.

It seemed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Molly had her whims. Well, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad of it. She was very human. More</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that, she was what Jane never had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been nor never could have been--she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very charming. I used to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that clothes went a long way toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">making a woman. Now I knew better.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jane, booted and trousered like a lum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">berman, was repellant. Molly, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same rough garb, was attractive. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jane had no soul, while Molly had. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a difference more than physical. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been cured of my illusions about</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had been wondering how long our</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair weather would last, and the follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing day put a prompt and unpleasant</seg><seg type="columnLine">end to my speculations. A drenching</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm came out of the east, to add to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the difficulties of the steady climb</seg><seg type="columnLine">which now confronted us. For two</seg><seg type="columnLine">days it poured almost without cessa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and the nights were chill and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerless. I dared not linger on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail, although I pitied Molly every</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I saw her toiling onward in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">soaking clothing. We wrere too short</seg><seg type="columnLine">of provisions to warrant a halt until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the return of fair weather; there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to do but drive onward through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wet. When it seemed as if clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">skies were coming again a new storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">piled in upon the heels of the other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our water-proof tents kept dry inside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we managed to keep dry blankets,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was rarely that either of us had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dry thing to wear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were no comfortable camp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fires at night. We crawled miserably</seg><seg type="columnLine">into our tents after each evening meal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lay there, listening to the rain spat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering noisily on the taut balloon silk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Breakfasts were damp and without</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheer, and then would come the task of</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaking camp in the downpour and</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking up the day's struggle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Molly bore it without a word of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaint, for she knew the necessity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">making quick progress: but 1 could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that her spirit was affected by the hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. The rain bothered her, worried</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. To prevent her from acquiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">too unfavorable an idea of a wet wil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derness, I would tell her that rain was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not so bad, provided you did not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to move camp and travel, and that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had often been quite comfortable in</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar storms. She would smile and</seg><seg type="columnLine">assure me that it was all right, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she really did not mind it: but I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">better. For her own sake I could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished for her a few days of the stony</seg><seg type="columnLine">indifference of Jane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were close to the top of the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridge when our week of bad weather</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally came to an end, and as I look</seg><seg type="columnLine">back upon that period of travel I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced that it was the worst I ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew. Molly was wan and haggard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but always straightening herself brave-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly whenever I looked at her, and evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently fearful that I would notice the</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs of strain in her face and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">droop of her shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought this was sheer weariness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of body and spirit at first, but when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skies cleared, and the woods dried, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Molly still seemed under the same spell</seg><seg type="columnLine">of languor I began to realize that some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else was the matter. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken a cold some days back and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped a cough, which she had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to shake off. It seemed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all her physique she had lost some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing of the resistance of Jane; she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become more sensitive to her environ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. I gave her some medicine for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cough, but it did not seem to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold or to give her much relief. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, however, she never uttered a syl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lable of protest against our rigorous</seg><seg type="columnLine">routine of travel, but less and less was</seg><seg type="columnLine">she able to do her share of the work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One night her coughing in the ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">joining tent awakened me, and I called</seg><seg type="columnLine">526</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CAVAUER.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to her to learn if there was anything I</seg><seg type="columnLine">coiil* 1 do for her; but she assured me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was of no consequence, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an hour after that i could hear her</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to control the paroxysms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was about noon of the following</seg><seg type="columnLine">day that the climax came. Molly had</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely touched a mouthful of break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast, and had been faltering at her pad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle all forenoon. Finally I saw her</seg><seg type="columnLine">place her hand to her side and gasp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without a word I put ashore at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest favorable spot and helped her</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the canoe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " You re ill, Molly," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I don't think it's anything," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered, smiling weakly at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her face was flushed, and I placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hand 011 her forehead, which 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">found to be burning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Is there a pain in your side where</seg><seg type="columnLine">you put your hand ? " I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She nodded, and compressed her lips,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then another fit of coughing racked</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I got the blankets out of the canoe</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly, made a temporary couch for</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. and began pitching a hasty camp.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My heart was heavy and anxious. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">symptoms of the girl left me no room</seg><seg type="columnLine">for doubt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Molly had pneumonia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVI.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Love Cure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">QNCE I had nursed a fellow camper</seg><seg type="columnLine">through an attack of pneumonia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few years before, and I had seen it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mining camps, where there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">physician to be had. I had seen men re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover from it, and some die. But never</seg><seg type="columnLine">had I been entrusted with the sole re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponsibility for a sufferer who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopelessly cut off from medical aid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and who would have to make the fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">with no other reliance than the weapons</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nature. There was not even a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort or a luxury I could offer Molly. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a hundred miles from the nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">outpost of civilization. Her life was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hands of her Creator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The first thing I did was to fix a</seg><seg type="columnLine">place for her. 1 wanted her to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">air. all the air she could breathe; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather seemed to have settled fair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was 110 need to shut her with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the walls of a tent. So I took her</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent and mine and made a isort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">canopy of them, with the four sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">open to the winds, and then 1 laid a</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep pile of balsam boughs under it, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">she could rest as easily as the rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jacilities of the woods would permit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Alter i had this rude open-air hos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pital ready for her I carried her to it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped her well in the blankets, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastened to see what I could do with</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough and ready remedies. I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">put much faith in what medicine I car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried in my kit, although there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stimulant there in case it should become</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary. She had the customary chill</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I was preparing her bed, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">A\as quickly followed by a heightening</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As soon as I had settled her as com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortably as the conditions would per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit, I started a fire, mixed a batch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dough, got out the frying-pan, and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan making a quantity of soggy flap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jacks. I had picked up the trick from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a guide who was a sort of backwoods</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor, and had utilized it once with</seg><seg type="columnLine">success, in the absence of other appli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ances, the hot cakes are applied to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient's side, over the spot where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain thrusts like a knife. Also. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heated flat stones in the fireplace I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily constructed, wrapped them in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our sweaters, and made them do service</seg><seg type="columnLine">as water-bottles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tried not to show any anxiety in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the presence of Molly, who thanked me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her eyes more than with her lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">for everything 1 sought to do for her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in my heart I was frightened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was very ill. Her struggle to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep up the pace at which I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving her during the past few days</seg><seg type="columnLine">had plainly weakened her: she was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her best to combat a disease that at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacks swiftly and mercilessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a few hours she whispered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that the pain was less, but her short.</seg><seg type="columnLine">TWO WOMEN, OR ONE?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">527</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dry cough was shaking her in pitiless</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion, and the fever was mounting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The little clinical thermometer I car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried had been broken the day of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">upset in the rapid, and I had no means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of measuring her temperature; al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though this did not matter much now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the mere record of the mercury</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not have enabled me to do any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing more for her. Her pulse had be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come swift and tumultuous, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs were fighting for air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In intervals of attendance upon her</seg><seg type="columnLine">I set the camp to some sort of rights, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">I realized that we were in for nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">short of a week's siege, and perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">more, unless she made a quick conva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lescence. It seemed like selfishness to</seg><seg type="columnLine">waste time in getting meals for myself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I knew the absolute need of keep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my own strength up in this crisis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and could not neglect this irksome</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the camp routine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Molly knew fully as well as I how</seg><seg type="columnLine">seriously she was stricken, but her cour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age was splendid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Pneumonia ?

There was so little I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do that most of the time I simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat by Molly's side and watched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle. Occasionally she dozed off into</seg><seg type="columnLine">restless sleep, but the cough ga\e her</seg><seg type="columnLine">little surcease from consciousness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Night came, the air began to cool and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the breeze was stilled. I lighted a can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle, placed it where the light would</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall so that I could watch her face, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled myself for a long vigil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our situation was not one calculated</seg><seg type="columnLine">to inspire either hope or confidence. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">travelers would come through this</seg><seg type="columnLine">lonely track in the wild, and there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely no method by which I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">summon help for her. A hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles away were doctors aplenty: it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a saying around the Deep-Water that</seg><seg type="columnLine">every third man you meet in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods is a physician. But they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">as remote from us as if they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the great seas. It was out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the question to move the girl. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the remainder of our journey been</seg><seg type="columnLine">along an uninterrupted watercourse I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have considered the attempt: I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have made her comfortable in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom of the canoe, and she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been little the worse for traveling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But with portages to cross and rapids</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shoot, the thing was impossible. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight must be made where we were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with no help unless it should come al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most as a miracle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One of her hot. dry hands found its</seg><seg type="columnLine">way from underneath the blankets, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I took it and held it. When the fits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">coughing seized her her fingers clung</seg><seg type="columnLine">convulsively to mine. She seldom</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke to me, but often her great dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes watched me. It seemed as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">she were quieter and more content</seg><seg type="columnLine">when her hand was lying in mine, so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat there, never leaving her. save when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she whispered for a drink of water or</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I found it necessary to renew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hot applications.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is curious how sympathy discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers in us emotions of which we may</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been totally ignorant. My mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was filled with anxiety and pity for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Molly, at first to the exclusion of every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing else: now I began to think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what Molly meant to me. It was diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult to analyze, this sentiment for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman I hated but a few short days</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago. Jane Boyce never awakened any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing but hot resentment or cold brood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in me; Molly Hope stirred my na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture in a different way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I sat watching her came a reali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zation that somehow Molly, unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">to myself, had become a part of all my</seg><seg type="columnLine">528</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CAVALIER.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts and plans: she had taken a</seg><seg type="columnLine">place in my life as naturally and quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if the arrangement had been or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dained long before. Everything I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">nr contemplated took into considera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion the relation of Molly to it. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence had become a part of mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">before 1 was aware of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I wanted her to live. There was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">element of selfishness in the desire of</seg><seg type="columnLine">w hich 1 was fully aware. 1 wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Molly to live, not merely for her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">sake, or for that of her people, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtless had lung believed her dead;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I wanted her to live for my sake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too. It seemed as though I had some</seg><seg type="columnLine">right in her. I had been the means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing her back into the flesh; she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no right to depart from me. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsibility for her restoration had</seg><seg type="columnLine">bred in me the notion that I was also</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible for her life thereafter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this vague, desultory thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried me through the first hours of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night as I huddled at her bedside,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shivering now and then from the sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">chill of the air. but not daring to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her so much as the single thick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of a blanket to throw over my</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the next point in my discoveries</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unsuspected desires I was carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly by a simple incident. She indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated that she was thirsty again, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought her a cup of water, raising her</seg><seg type="columnLine">by passing my arm under her shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that she might drink. She swal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed a little, and then her head fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearily back against my breast. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes looked up at me slowly, her lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled faintly, and she murmured</seg><seg type="columnLine">something in which I caught my name,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but did not understand. Her burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand groped for mine and held it as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed her back among the blankets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, just as plainly and calmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though I had known it for days, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that I loved Molly Hope. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the explanation of all the rest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as she lay there fighting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath, I seemed stabbed with the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain that had stricken her; her suffer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was now my suffering; her peril</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was mine also. Whether Molly loved</seg><seg type="columnLine">me was a matter to which I gave not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest thought; it was quite be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the question then. It was enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know that I loved her; it accounted</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the desire to possess, for all the pity</seg><seg type="columnLine">and anxiety and fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sometimes I dozed from sheer weari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, although I tried to fight off sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">My eyes were closed and my head bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon my breast when the first touch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight awakened me. I bent quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">over and saw that Molly slept, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">peacefully and normally, but apparent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly in utter exhaustion. Our hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still clasped, and I disengaged mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently, so as not to awaken her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was with difficulty that I arose</seg><seg type="columnLine">and moved my cramped limbs to start</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blood. And then a baffling sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">impotence and helplessness came over</seg><seg type="columnLine">me as I looked down upon the sweet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feverish face of the woman who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taught me first to hate aud then to love</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. I could only watch and wait, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All that day, and the night that fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed, Molly fought her fight bravely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">never flinching when the pain racked</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, never complaining when the fever</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned fiercely. It was with a sinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart that I watched the disease make</seg><seg type="columnLine">inroads upon her strength, and as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">became weaker there were periods</seg><seg type="columnLine">when her mind wandered, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked without knowing what she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I would kneel close to her, bending</seg><seg type="columnLine">my ear to catch the words, and some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times it wrung my heart when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up at me with eyes that gave no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of recognition. A newr fear seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">me and tortured me. What if Molly's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind should go upon another long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange journey, perhaps never to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn? What if Jane should steal back</seg><seg type="columnLine">into her body? The body might live,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it would mean nothing to me with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out Molly; rather, it would be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mockery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hour by hour I listened to her mut- ;</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered phrases. She was talking of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother and her home ; she was speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to her brother Frank; she w*as</seg><seg type="columnLine">.WHERE THIEVES BREAK IN.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">529</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">writing a letter to her father.

Still Jane had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not come. Then she was a little girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, going to school, and I breathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sigh of comfort, for Jane was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">remote now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, in broken sentences, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to talk about the woods, and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart almost stopped beating as I bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">to catch the words. She was learning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use a paddle; she was toiling over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough trail; she was climbing the steep</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of Discovery Hill. Then she</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke of the green islands, and finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was talking about our camp in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Molly Lake. I longed to take her by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shoulders and aw'aken her. but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dared not. Some horrible fascination</seg><seg type="columnLine">held me as I knelt there and heard her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">step by step, going backward to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">turning point in her life, as remorse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessly as though she were being drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward it by an unseen force. W ould</seg><seg type="columnLine">she pass again into the dark personality</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Jane when she reached the meeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ways?

" said Lloyd. " You know."</seg><seg type="columnLine">" I know what you're thinking. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">think it's wrong because that is what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were taught when you were a kid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, if I show you that your teachers</seg><seg type="columnLine">w^ere all liars, perhaps you won't be so</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that they taught the truth. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were kids we were told that hon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esty w-as the best policy. Well, now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we've grown up, we see that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lie. It isn't the best policy. It's just</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hobson's choice for the pikers. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the man who can be dishonest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away with it, honesty is just plain</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolishness. At school we were told</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if we wxre virtuous we would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy. Now, we see plainly that that</seg><seg type="columnLine">also was a lie. The world is just plumb</seg><seg type="columnLine">full of honest and virtuous people who</seg><seg type="columnLine">are poor and unhappy, and crooks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">moral lepers who are rich and having-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one grand time of it. Well, the answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">is that everything's going to be squared</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the hereafter. But what do we know</seg><seg type="columnLine">about a hereafter? They told us two</seg><seg type="columnLine">lies when we were kids. Why, isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">this hereafter business another one?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tell you, Harry, you can say what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you like about morality or honesty, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever you want to call it, but I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty near ready for anything "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lloyd sat silent a moment. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking an answer to Parsons's sophis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try. But he could find none. He knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his heart that Parsons was "wrong,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he didn't know how to make him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">see it. Then his curiosity came to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">top.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " What's the scheme?

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Yes, but we couldn't walk far."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, we won't need to. We will</seg><seg type="columnLine">take half a million first, and speculate</seg><seg type="columnLine">with it. We could cover that up for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few days. It's an even chance that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">win or lose. If we win, all right. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">put the original money back and keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">our winnings. If we lose, we take all</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can put our hands on. Then we</seg><seg type="columnLine">toss up to see which one of us takes</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blame and goes to jail. That's an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other even chance. See, each one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us has two even chances of escaping?</seg><seg type="columnLine">That makes a three-to-one chance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't it? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Yes, I guess so," said Lloyd.

''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Easy," answered Parsons.

He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been practising to cut the ace of dia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monds for nearly an hour. He real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized that he could not be certain of do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it, but he knew the chances were</seg><seg type="columnLine">very much in his favor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Shall we make it one cut? " said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parsons, figuring to himself that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut would give him a better chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheat than if several were required to</seg><seg type="columnLine">win.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " All right," answered Lloyd.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " -Ace high ? " asked Parsons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Of course," replied Lloyd, feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonished that Parsons should happen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to propose exactly the things he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wished. " Do you want to riffle them ? "</seg><seg type="columnLine">He handed the pack to Parsons, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">shuffled and cut them in all ways known</seg><seg type="columnLine">to card - players. Lloyd watched his</seg><seg type="columnLine">every move.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Parsons saw aces and kings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">queens flit by as the cards slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his hands, but he could think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of no way of making it certain that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would cut one. Finally he handed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards back to Lloyd, who gave them</seg><seg type="columnLine">a perfunctory shuffle and laid them on</seg><seg type="columnLine">53G</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CAVALIER.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the table. As he faced them the broken</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">corner of the ace of diamonds was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his left. The thumb of his right hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">would cover it perfectly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parsons cut the cards once and</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightened them out. Still Lloyd's</seg><seg type="columnLine">ace was in the proper position. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parsons had nicked a queen with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger-nail, and now he saw the nick</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiear the bottom of the pack. He spoke:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Go ahead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lloyd reached out in an apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">careless manner and picked up perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty cards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parsons picked up the same number.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They both held the cards face down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right?" said Lloyd, feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain that he had his ace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Sure," said Parsons, happy in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that he had been able to cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">the queen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Both men turned up their cards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Well," said Parsons, tossing his on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table, "I lose; here's the letters."</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he pushed them toward Lloyd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who threw down his cards and put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two envelopes into his pocket. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he opened the drawer of the table and</seg><seg type="columnLine">raked the cards into it pell-mell. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to get his ace with the broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner out of sight as quickly as pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Well, Harry," said Parsons, try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to be game, " I congratulate you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's nothing for me now but to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope that Consolidated Wire will go</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I hope so, too,'' Lloyd replied. " It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would certainly be the easiest way out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of things for both of us. Is there any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing more to be done? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not for you, Harry; but I've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot of things to plan, so I must hurry</seg><seg type="columnLine">along."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I have to call for Marjorie in half</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour," answered Lloyd. " I'll go</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Well," exclaimed Parsons as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the street, " it's raining."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I'll lend you an umbrella," Lloyd</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly answered, and ran up - stairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">before Parsons could interpose an ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jection.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It gave him a feeling of relief to do</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">something for Parsons, even so small</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing as lend an umbrella.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Where's yours?" asked Parsons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing that Lloyd had brought down</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">only one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Oh, I've only got a step or two."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parsons thanked him, took the um-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brella, and wrent his way. That night</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took his turn at lying awake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lloyd felt as if he must walk for</seg><seg type="columnLine">leagues and leagues before he met his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife. He had lied in telling Parsons</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had to call for her in half an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour. He was really not due for near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly two hours, and he spent the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">time in walking aimlessly in every di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection. He had no umbrella, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgot that it rained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His clothing became soaked to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">very skin, and he was chilled to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marrow, yet he walked on and on. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nearly an hour late in calling for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wife, and when she saw his damp</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition she hurried him home with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out asking any questions, and urged</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to get out of his wet clothing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lloyd slept well, but woke in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning with a heavy cold. He worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">all day in alternating chills and fever,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went home a very sick man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Consolidated Wire had opened a</seg><seg type="columnLine">point under the price at which Parsons</seg><seg type="columnLine">had bought it, so there was nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do but wait. During the day it dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">another point. The activity in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock which Parsons had expected, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been predicted by most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the financial writers, seemed to be hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On Wednesday morning, about five</seg><seg type="columnLine">o'clock. Lloyd awroke. In the semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">consciousness of sleep's borderland he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered why he had so much diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culty in breathing. As more of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">faculties resumed their functions he</seg><seg type="columnLine">became convinced that some practical</seg><seg type="columnLine">joking cooper had drawn a steel barrel</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoop tightly about his chest. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">only take in a mere pinch of air before</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that at least felt like a steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoop stopped him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHERE THIEVES BREAK IN.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">537</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He tried to call his wife, who slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the next room, but he found that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could barely whisper. So he lay, gasp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, for nearly two hours until Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jorie came in to wake him, as she al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways did about seven o'clock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  She saw at once that he was serious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly ill, and immediately telephoned for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their doctor. He came, heard about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lloyd's run-down condition, his upset</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach, the wetting and chill of Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day evening, and told Mrs. Lloyd that</seg><seg type="columnLine">her husband had a dangerous attack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pneumonia; that she must order a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained nurse and a tank of oxygen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin a vigorous attack on the disease</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it was too late.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That morning Parsons noticed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lloyd did not appear, and wrondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it. All day Consolidated Wire was</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady, with little trading, though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock-wise gossips in the cafes and on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street corners said that it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet before the storm. But no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">was agreed on what the storm would</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. Some said Consolidated Wire</seg><seg type="columnLine">would collapse; others that before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inevitable crash came it would go up</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hundred points, in which event</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lloyd and Parsons would win exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">two and one-half million dollars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parsons made a mental memoran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dum to call Lloyd up in the evening to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see what the trouble was, though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed it to be merely an aggrava-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the cold he had on Tuesday.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But some friends asked him to din-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner, and after dinner they went to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">musical show, and after the show</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had something more to eat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink. Parsons forgot all about call-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing- Lloyd up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thursday morning he heard from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the other tellers that Lloyd was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not expected to live. Half an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">later the news circulated through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank that Lloyd was dead. At almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same hour the crash came in Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solidated Wire, the stock dropped for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty points in about as many minutes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the holdings of Parsons and Llovd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the name of Amos R. Cummings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were wiped out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parsons's first thought was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lloyd's death solved one problem for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him very nicely. It provided an easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">means for hiding the money until his</seg><seg type="columnLine">jail term was over. His plan had al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways been to bury the money in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">cemetery, because a cemetery is almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only place not subject to condemna-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion proceedings, and therefore prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically certain to remain undisturbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an indefinite length of time. Lloyd's</seg><seg type="columnLine">death would save him the trouble of</seg><seg type="columnLine">even digging a hole in the ground. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would merely sneak the money into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lloyd's coffin and let them bury it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But then suddenly, like a flash, Par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons saw that it was not going to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary to hide the money anywhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lloyd was dead. Why not take what</seg><seg type="columnLine">money he could and fasten the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">business upon the dead man? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then there was Marjorie Lloyd. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenness of his good fortune almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">stunned him. He was a man of des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny. Men even died when necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his pathway might be clear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he saw that he must get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two letters for which he and Lloyd</seg><seg type="columnLine">had cut the cards on Monday evening.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where were they? Beyond a shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of doubt, in Lloyd's pocket. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">small possibility that they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbed. Still, the time to see was</seg><seg type="columnLine">right now. And the time to take what</seg><seg type="columnLine">money he could was right now, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the belief that Lloyd had taken it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be more plausible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Parsons left the bank that afternoon</seg><seg type="columnLine">with packages of money amounting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly a million dollars distributed</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his person. He went straight to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his room and locked himself in. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he got out his copper boxes and select-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed the one which the money fitted ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">actly. It was about the size of a three-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pound box of candy, only a trifle wider</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shorter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He packed the money in tightly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping out only a few bills of small</seg><seg type="columnLine">denomination, and got out his solder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing kit. He had a small Bunsen burner</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a rubber hose, which he attached</seg><seg type="columnLine">538</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CAVAUER.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to his gas fixture. He scraped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edges of ilie box, applied the acid, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then drew a gleaming line of hot solder</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the joints. He had practised this</seg><seg type="columnLine">many times, and he made a perfect job</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did up his box of money in ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary wrapping-paper, and took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Subway for the Lloyds' flat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The undertaker had been there and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clone his work. Lloyd reposed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple casket in the bedroom in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had died.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Airs. Lloyd, her mother, and one or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two near relatives were in the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Mrs. Lloyd greeted Parsons</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally, and, after a word or two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanks for his conventional expressions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of condolence, suggested that he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to step in and look at his dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went in and stood over the coffin</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment, his hat and his precious</seg><seg type="columnLine">package in one hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His eye calculated the space under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the coffin lid. Yes, there was 110 doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">but what he could slip the box of cur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rency under there, easily, and probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">push it back as far as the dead man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees, where there would be not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest danger of discovery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He turned to make some ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">remark to Mrs. Lloyd, but found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had not followed him into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. She had gone back to the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">room and left him alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was too easy, lie had not ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected such luck as this. Again, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saluted the star which ruled his destiny.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked about. * Yes, there, just in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the clusct door, was the very coat</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Lloyd had worn all day Tuesday</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the bank. I'arsons recognized it at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once, because he had been present when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lloyd ordered the suit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He glided over to the closet door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and put his hand in the coat-pocket.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt some papers, he drew them out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yes. there were the letters, lie put</seg><seg type="columnLine">them quietly in his own pocket and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed his place at the head of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">coffin. He waited a moment and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">went into the living-room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Lloyd asked him if he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">act as one of the pall-bearers, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered that he would gladly do so.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went to his room, changed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">date on Lloyd's letter from the thir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teenth to the seventh, then went out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinner, returned, and went to bed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found a box containing a million</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolen dollars an uneasy roommate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the night advanced, he heard num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers of mysterious noises. A dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">times he got up and put the box in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">different hiding-place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He told himself a hundred times that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no sense in feeling nervous</seg><seg type="columnLine">or worried. He convinced his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason that the noises he heard were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same noises that had passed un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed night after night ever since he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had occupied this room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He tried to read. But he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">fasten his mind on anything. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoked imiumerable cigarettes. Final-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, he shaved, bathed, dressed, and sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">up, waiting lor morning. It came on</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaden feet; he went to breakfast and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the bank, arriving there, as he in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tended, considerably before any of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lloyd's desk was undisturbed. Par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons put the letter in a wire basket con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining a lot of miscellaneous papers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was addressed to Mr. Andrews, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first vice-president, and would undoubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly be seen and delivered as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inevitable clean-up of Lloyd's de^k</seg><seg type="columnLine">took place: probably that very day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At one o'clock Parsons went out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunch, but could eat nothing. On the</seg><seg type="columnLine">street, while returning to the bank, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea came to him that he was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowed. At first he scoffed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">notion and tried to tell himself that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was only another part of his fool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish nervousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the belief kept recurring, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally, he decided that the only thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do was to prove absolutely that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was mistaken. So he walked deliber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately to Broadway and Wall Street and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood there a moment as if waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a car. A Columbus Avenue rattler</seg><seg type="columnLine">came along.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">___... - . i. , -</seg><seg type="columnLine">WHERE THIEVES BREAK IN.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">539</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waited until every one who ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to want that car got aboard, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he jumped on. The car started,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a man broke out of the crowd on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner and boarded it. Parsons</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a detailed mental photograph of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. If any one was following him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was the man. He rode to Lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">penard Street and got off. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">got off at Canal, or, at least, Parsons</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought he saw him get off there, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he became panic-stricken at once. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurried east, to the Subway, and took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a train going north, making sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one got on after him. He went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his room, took his troublesome treasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started for Lloyd's flat. He de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided that if he was being shadowed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it proved that they had discovered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">loss of the money and suspected him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would put the money where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be safe, until he wanted it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, come what might, he could al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways have ultimate riches to look for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before he reached Lloyd's flat he</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought some flowers, and put his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">precious parcel in the box with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Mrs. Lloyd opened the door,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said: " I came back with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers. I just thought I'd like to ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">range them myself. May I ? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Oh, thank you, Mr. Parsons/' she</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied quietly. " Of course, go in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went into the room, unwrapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flowers and arranged them over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot of the coffin. While doing this</seg><seg type="columnLine">he also managed to slip the box of</seg><seg type="columnLine">money under the coffin-1 id, and to push</seg><seg type="columnLine">it back about eighteen or twenty inches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He fussed with the flowers for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment longer and then came out. Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lloyd met him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I'm glad you brought those," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.

Parsons's heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced like an auto-engine opened wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">and running free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt for a moment as if lie must</seg><seg type="columnLine">yell, tear his hair, throw ink-wells and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponge-cups and money in every di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection, run amuck like a crazy negro</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Indian. He felt the blood being</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced by the violent action of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart into every vein and artery and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gland of his body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But by a tremendous effort he com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelled himself to remain quiet; to ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear as though he was going on with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his work in the regular way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a moment or two, Mr. An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drews came to Lloyd's letter.

Parsons saw his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face set, saw him hurrv through to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end, fold up the letter, hold it in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and appear to fumble through</seg><seg type="columnLine">some papers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently he went back to his office</seg><seg type="columnLine">and closed the door. Nothing more</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened. Parsons waited as long as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt that he could, without exciting</seg><seg type="columnLine">comment, and left the bank. Again he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in a condition bordering 011 nerv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous collapse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had eaten practically no lunch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now he could eat no dinner.

But even this</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could not do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He finally took his hat and left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house.

On the front page, under na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming head-lines, was the announcement</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tiie bank's loss. He hardly dared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">read it. for fear some one would see</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and suspect his secret. He put the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper in his pocket, bought all the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers, and went back to his room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then lie devoured every word of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was astonished that the bank had</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted the thing to get into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspapers at all.

But here was Lloyd's letter</seg><seg type="columnLine">published in full.

The loss of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Titanic was referred to as a case in</seg><seg type="columnLine">point.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some criticized the Colonial Na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional Bank for lax system, and others</seg><seg type="columnLine">excused it on the plea that it had grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">so rapidly that its methods of handling</seg><seg type="columnLine">money had not been able to keep pace</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the increase of its deposits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although Parsons could not under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand why the bank had not kept the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing out of the papers, the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lloyd's letter was clearly accepted as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one explanation of where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money had gone, partly restored his</seg><seg type="columnLine">composure. Where an hour before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had felt that it would be easier to walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a police station and confess than</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go to the bank, lie now felt that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could put on a fair enough face to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">any one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he reached the bank there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big crowd standing in the street and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the sidewalk. The doors were</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed, and a policeman was preventing</seg><seg type="columnLine">any one but employees from entering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parsons gave his name and was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately admitted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went to his desk, and had hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened it before a boy told him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Andrews wanted to see him in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">directors' room.

He rode a station</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the Lloyds' and walked back, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">as not to be too early.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He kept reviewing in his mind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interview with Mr. Andrews in the di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rectors' room.

But then he reflected</seg><seg type="columnLine">that nothing could be gained by keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dead man unburied. There was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest question about Lloyd hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing died a perfectly natural death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the whole, despite his fearful</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatigue and growing nervousness, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt easier in his mind than he had felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the previous Monday evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he and Lloyd had cut the cards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door of the Lloyds' flat was</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened by the short, rather thick-set.</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray-haired man whom Parsons had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen in the directors' room and sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed a detective or lawyer. This lat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter surmise now appeared to be currect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Marjorie Lloyd came forward and</seg><seg type="columnLine">introduced him as Mr. Decker, her law-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yer, and explained that he had been at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the bank that morning on her husband's</seg><seg type="columnLine">behalf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " The whole business is perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazing to me," said Parsons.

Parsons had a dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">recollection of having heard that cre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mation was a pagan practise, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped desperately at the converse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I'm afraid none of us have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">very good Christians," answered Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lloyd sadly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Well, now is the very best time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn over a new leaf." said Parsons</seg><seg type="columnLine">with hypocritical piety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Bv disregarding a death-bed re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quest ?

He admitted that he was up</seg><seg type="columnLine">against it, or he wouldn't have called</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a lot of sapheads like us to do a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's thinking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What he wanted was to get Billy</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry just before the game, and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cause of his anger so far out of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach that he couldn't get at it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would take his wrath out on the Ken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yon team.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The reason that his previous experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments had failed was because Billy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">always succeeded in coming down solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his two hundred and fifty pounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the object that was supposed to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">the charm, and the instant and com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete crushing of that object always had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effect of immediately restoring any</seg><seg type="columnLine">particles that might have started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stray from Billy's good nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This set us all thinking; and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">night, as I jumped into bed. I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the solution. That solution was Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Pink was the queen of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">GETTING BILLY'S GOAT.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">551</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">co-eds, and the prettiest girl in two</seg><seg type="columnLine">States. It was secretly surmised among</seg><seg type="columnLine">a choice few who were in on the game</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was as good as engaged to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Head-coach Tom Burns. Billy, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't dance, and therefore didn't think</seg><seg type="columnLine">much of girls, was not one of the few</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were in on the game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Considering Tom's feelings in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction, I didn't have any trouble in</seg><seg type="columnLine">convincing him that all Miss Pink had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do was to smile once or twice on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man and his peace of mind would begin</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumping around like a squirrel in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rat-trap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My plan was to get her to cast a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those smiles on Billy. It's a well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known axiom that a fellow in love is</seg><seg type="columnLine">particularly susceptible to the grouch</seg><seg type="columnLine">germ, and it's just a step from a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue grouch to a tearing rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I predicted that in two weeks we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get the thing so well under way</seg><seg type="columnLine">that on the day of the final game all</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would have to do would be to light</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fusee, and then run like the mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief to get far enough away before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The end that I outlined to Tom was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have Miss Pink come up to Billy just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he was leaving the locker-building in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his football clothes, and reach out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slap him on the face, preferably on each</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She could throw in some words at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time, like " liar " and " cheat,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">or whatever the ladylike phrases were</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would convey the same meaning.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This, I reasoned, would rouse the tem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">per of a mummy. And. of course, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Billy couldn't hit a girl, he would go</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the game and begin tearing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes off of the Kenyon team.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom agreed that the basis of the plot</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't bad. But he didn't think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite so much action in the final play</seg><seg type="columnLine">would suit Miss Pink. He said I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right idea, but that if I'd ever been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in love I would realize that it wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">take as much as that to make a man eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">granite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> According to his views, the best way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get Billy's goat would be to have the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lady of his choice suddenly announce</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the day of the game that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged to another man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 wasn't born yesterday; and I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">right away that Tom thought this</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be a good method to clear up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own difficulties and at the same time</seg><seg type="columnLine">rouse the sleeping lion in Billy. So I</seg><seg type="columnLine">played into his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 1 guess you're right," I said. " It</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure would give Billy a jolt if Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pink should tell him that she was en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaged to you, when he was thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was the king-pin. Do you think</seg><seg type="columnLine">you stand in strong enough to pull the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trick off at the proper moment? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a fool question for me to ask.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If there was one line where Tom con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered that he was strong, it was with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ladies. He wasn't far wrong,either;</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he was no end of a hero, and girls</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that kind. But I had an idea that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was having harder work bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss- Pink to terms than he liked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">admit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This seemed tough on Tom. for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was plain as day that she was the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl he had ever met whom he was head</seg><seg type="columnLine">over heels in love with. I don't under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand girls, because I have red hair;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I shouldn't have been surprised if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was just because she didn't fall down</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of him that made him so keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Well," said Tom, looking a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">fussed, " you certainly have got a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nerve. But if you can keep a secret,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll tell you something. I'm not en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaged to Miss Pink yet. but I hope to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be. And I think that for the good of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the college I can get her to play her</seg><seg type="columnLine">part, and we'll let Billy know of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">engagement at the right moment tu win</seg><seg type="columnLine">that game."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day Tom was beaming. So.</seg><seg type="columnLine">after practise, I asked him how things</seg><seg type="columnLine">were progressing. And because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to talk to somebody and because</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had started in to make a confidant of</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, he told me all about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seems that when he had first sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested the plan, she had refused abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely to have anything to do with it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">552</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE CAVALIER.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But after he had made a strong appeal</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her college spirit, and explained how</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary temper was to football, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that unless she helped we would lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big game, she came aiound condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The conditions were that she re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">served the right to drop out at any mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and that if any engagement was</seg><seg type="columnLine">announced, she was to be the one to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">the announcing. And Tom assured me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she wasn't the kind of a girl that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would back out, and that she would do</seg><seg type="columnLine">her best for Buckeye. He was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take Billy to walk that night and</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet her accidentally, and had an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuse all fixed up to leave them together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now that everything was arranged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I began to feel a little uneasy in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscience. I liked Billy, as did every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body else, and it seemed to me that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were playing him a pretty low-down</seg><seg type="columnLine">trick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I'd never been in love, and had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea how easy a thing it was to get over.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I reasoned that Miss Pink and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom knew what they were doing; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if they considered it harmless, why</seg><seg type="columnLine">they ought to know, and tried to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Things began to turn out beautifully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as we had planned. I guess a mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">man doesn't stand much chance when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl really sets her cap for him. Billy</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell like a lamb, and even took to</seg><seg type="columnLine">writing poetry. His whole manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed, and he carried around his two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred and fifty pounds as if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were barely enough ballast to keep him</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected with the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom gave him a clear field, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">good of the team; and when he wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">at practise or attending lectures you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be pretty sure he was with Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pink, or waiting for her somewhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Everybody noticed it. and smiled at it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">and liked Billy and Miss Pink all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">better for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This went on for two weeks, right</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the afternoon of the final game.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then came the explosion. It was big-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger than we had expected--so big that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom got caught in it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few of us were walking down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field with Tom. He was very</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous, not listening to anything we</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, and I knew it wasn't all caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the game. Right in front of us were</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Pink and Billy, waiting on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner. As we passed Billy called to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom, and he joined them. We went on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 heard later that Tom tried to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, but she wouldn't let him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Please stay, Mr. Bums," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You have both been such good friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me that I want you to be the first to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear a secret. I'm engaged--but don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell, because it isn't out yet. Richard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randolph is a distant cousin, and I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">so anxious to have you meet him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She smiled up at them with those</seg><seg type="columnLine">big, round, trusting eyes of hers; she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so confidant they would be delight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed, and so absolutely unconscious that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was causing the slightest uneasi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness to either of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They tried to say the right thing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and left her to wait for her girl friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were going with her to the game.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And when they joined us at the locker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room they were like two full-sized hur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ricanes done up in quart bottles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nobody but I knew what the trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, and I didn't guess but half of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom sailed into us in true football</seg><seg type="columnLine">style, and the talk he gave us was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lyric. I've never heard nor read of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a speech before a battle that could touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. It put fire into us as if he was pour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it in with a dipper, and we ran out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on that field ready to consume all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we touched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That game will live forever in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">history of Buckeye College. Kenyon</seg><seg type="columnLine">came on the field with a heavier team</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the idea that they were going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a cinch. They found ten furies</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one demon, and there was as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance of stopping Buckeye as stop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping the north wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Billy was the demon. From a quiet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">peace-loving Hercules of an hour be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he had changed into an avenging</seg><seg type="columnLine">torrent of wrath. Four men couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold him, and his path when he ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the field was lined with cripples,</seg><seg type="columnLine">GETTING BILLY'S GOAT.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">553</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with one or two of the bravest, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">courted death, clinging to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The odds turned right around in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first ten minutes, and the college in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleachers went wild with delight as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashed on to victory. The score at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end was twenty-nine to nothing, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was lots of fight still left in us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two men fought even as the cheering</seg><seg type="columnLine">under-grads carried them twice around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field on their shoulders. These two</seg><seg type="columnLine">were Tom Burns and Billy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a big bonfire on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">campus that night, and everybody,</seg><seg type="columnLine">co-eds and all, attended. At about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of it there was a cry for an ax;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as I vaguely remembered having</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen one around the corner of the grand</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand where the carpenters had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">working, I went for it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I made plenty of noise coming, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were two people around there in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark that didn't hear me. They</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were Miss Pink and Billy. I was near</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to hear what they were saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I stopped, and I couldn't help lis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tening. Miss Pink was talking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I--I said it for a joke," she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard her mother's tired, shuffling step</seg><seg type="columnLine">setting the table for the early break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast. Then the whole house rattled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was the dining-room door shutting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was perfectly still. The girl sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">where she.was listening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few moments a heavy, uncer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain tread came up the stairs.

He stood there</seg><seg type="columnLine">mumbling for several moments, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">lurched across the hall to the spare</seg><seg type="columnLine">room.

She turned quickly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the broken gate and cut across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the neglected orchard toward the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">farmhouse that was slowly tumbling to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces, like some old person who has</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost all energy and self-respect, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the memory of better days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the tangled hop-vine over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back porch Tom Dillon stepped for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward.

His big</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand trembled, and the girl felt his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart beating heavily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked up. running her fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightly over his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I was afraid, perhaps, you couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">git out."

A</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensuous, physical content crept over</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.

He now had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little over sixty dollars; to these he</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentally added the twenty which Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gorry would pay him every week, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood amazed before the net monthly</seg><seg type="columnLine">surplus his careful figures gave him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Besides, there was his one-third of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the profits of the Perfection Cigar</seg><seg type="columnLine">Company at the end of the year--Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gorry had said he would make him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">millionaire. And now, there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tillie, and there never would be any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one else.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Howt rich was he, and how poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trenton George's widow and her help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less baby? He looked out of his win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dow at the great, unsympathetic city</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the river, and sighed for the for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">saken woman whom he did not know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day Carl opened a bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">account with his hoard and sent his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead shopmate's widow a check for ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars.
