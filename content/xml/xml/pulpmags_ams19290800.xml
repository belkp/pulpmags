O'Conor Sloane, Ph.D.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">N many cases, space is so abundant that there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">no object in economizing. Yet as a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">geometry, to say nothing of other scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">aspects, it is interesting to consider the economy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of space. Often, when we wish to get as near</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfection as possible, we go to nature for our</seg><seg type="columnLine">teacher, for she far excels us. Economy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, however is affected by various circumstances, which in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a senfe makes it undesirable to attain. If we go to geometry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will find that the largest volume of space to be enclosed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the smallest partition is a sphere. Thus baseballs are very</seg><seg type="columnLine">economical in the quantity of horsehide with which they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed to be covered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, it so happens that mankind works with tubes and other</seg><seg type="columnLine">volumes constructed on the basis of angles. Boxes have their</seg><seg type="columnLine">top, bottom and sides all at right angles, practically. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be long, short, high or low; in the great majority of cases</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the enclosing parts, metal or pasteboard, are at right</seg><seg type="columnLine">angles, one to the other. Here there is no economy of wood</seg><seg type="columnLine">or of other enclosing material. If we want to adhere to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of economizing our boards, and do not abandon the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">angle construction, the best we can do is to make a cube of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our box.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is interesting to recall the fact that the Chinese, who are</seg><seg type="columnLine">very wonderful artists in their own way, adhere pretty closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the cube in making their tea boxes. If we wish to construct</seg><seg type="columnLine">a house, with the greatest economy of enclosing wall and roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">and floor, we should make it cubical--its height, width and</seg><seg type="columnLine">depth equal. This, of course, is based on the assumption that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is only one floor. An extra floor would complicate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem a little.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The bee gives a wonderful example of this economy. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">hexagonal cells with so many "party walls" exhibit the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">economy in material for that type of enclosure. The stems of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vegetable vegetation are circular in cross-section and represent</seg><seg type="columnLine">an economy of space where indeed it would seem to be hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An interesting example of a sphere in the engineering world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the spherical gas-holder, which has been introduced in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field of gas-making, and which is sometimes of very large</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensions, and holds gas under considerable pressure, perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">containing three or four times its own volume. Fruits, you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">will notice, incline very much to the spherical, so we can see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that nature does economize.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now suppose we go to the opposite extreme, and consider</seg><seg type="columnLine">examples of the most reckless waste of space. We need go</seg><seg type="columnLine">to no greater space waster than Mother Nature. Let us</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the Solar System. If the volumes of the planets were</seg><seg type="columnLine">added together, and compared with the volume of space which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is devoted to them, the waste involved would appear prodigious.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sun, in a general way, occupies the center of the planetary</seg><seg type="columnLine">system. It radiates heat and light in all directions. If we let</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outermost planet give us a radius of a sphere, a propor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionately infinitesimal amount of heat radiated by the sun will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be received by it and the other planets. Nature is even a greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">waster than she is an economizer. If separate calculation were</seg><seg type="columnLine">made for each planet, taking its distance from the sun as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">radius of a sphere, the waste would be found to be incredibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">great. And this is the identical waste that has been going</seg><seg type="columnLine">on for ages and is still going on. Our sun, the glory of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetary system, may be called an abominable waster, and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the good that we get out of it in the way of light and heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems infinitesimal compared to what it is radiating into space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As far as we know, this heat is absolutely wasted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And let us consider another point. According to the modern</seg><seg type="columnLine">conception of the atom, it is a small planetary system. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">inconceivably minute, but is supposed to be made up of parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">which are far more infinitesimal. It is supposed to be com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed of a nucleus, around which negative electrons are ih</seg><seg type="columnLine">constant motion, like the planets around our sun. In other</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, an atom is supposed to consist principally of empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, whose volume is determined by the orbits of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">planetary electrons, as they are sometimes called.

It was a staggering</seg><seg type="columnLine">punch, and the guard reeled and released his grasp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sobbing young woman. But he recovered and, plac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his whistle to his lips, blew a shrill blast that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring a dozen minions of the law to his assistance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once more Kirk swung, this time with all the power of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his trained right arm. The guard lay still where he fell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, we're in for it," gasped Kirk. "This way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ducked behind an adjoining pillar and the greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of the group trooped after him. A few of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fainter-hearted ran for shelter in other directions, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">several more of the red guards appeared on the scene,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but at least twelve followed into the shadows that lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the confines of the square. A light pop from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stubby weapon in the hand of one of the guards sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">a missile spinning through the air--a soft, rubbery</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that struck the rearmost of Kirk's follow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers squarely in the middle of the back with a squashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound and immediately wrapped twining coils of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">material about his body, gripping arms and legs se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curely and bringing him to the pavement in'a helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">heap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Run, run," shouted Kirk, darting into a dark pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sageway. He drew back at the entrance and allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of the panting, stumbling humans to pass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the last one had entered, he flung himself against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heavy door and slammed it shut, shooting the bolt</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as the officers reached it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE passage was almost dark, being illuminated</seg><seg type="columnLine">only by a narrow beam of light that filtered</seg><seg type="columnLine">through an imperfect floor joint somewhere above. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was sufficient to reveal the figures of his frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">followers huddled together only a short distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He produced an electric torch as the pounding on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door became louder and more insistent. The wel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come radiance of its beam cast grotesque shadows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trembling, gray-clad fugitives on the walls of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">damp and little-used passage, and a feeling of pity</seg><seg type="columnLine">surged through him as he observed their beseeching,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear-ridden countenances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Follow me, friends," he called out cheerfully, lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the way into another passage where a second door</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bolted behind them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They clattered down a winding stair that finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought them to a chamber with circular stone walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and an opening in the center of its floor. Through this</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening dropped the leader and, one by one, his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions followed. They found themselves in another</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage which ended at a metal door of polished new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. Kirk Paulson placed his lips close to a disk of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shiny black that was set in the exact center of the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spoke a word in a low tone of voice. The door</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly opened, revealing the brightly lighted cage of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lift.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're safe, friends," he exulted; "at least for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When all had crowded into the lift, he spoke another</seg><seg type="columnLine">word of command into a disk adjoining the automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">operating mechanism on the wall of the cage, and, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually increasing speed, they started upward. Up.</seg><seg type="columnLine">up sped the lift until it seemed they must have reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the roof of the city, two hundred and fifty levels above</seg><seg type="columnLine">their previous position. Then the motion slowed down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and soon ceased, the cage coming to a rest at a gleaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal door, similar to the one through which they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered at the base of the shaft. At a word from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader, this door opened as had the other, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged wonderingly into clean brilliant sunlight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were not on the roof; rather they were under</seg><seg type="columnLine">its crystal expanse and in the most amazing room they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever entered. Along the walls were many benches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereon reposed strange machines, retorts, beakers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the many instruments and supplies that make up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete laboratory equipment. Kirk laughed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewilderment of his flock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is Barton's laboratory," he announced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Philip -Barton hurried in at this moment and, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of the group of gray-clad refugees, he uttered an</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclamation of surprise, not unmixed with pleasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, Kirk," he exclaimed, "what brings you here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with so many of your followers?

He bolted the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly in its air-tight casing and proceeded at once to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the navigating cabin where he found his companions</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting. His wife was still in tears and he patted her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand comfortingly as he stepped to her side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Don't feel badly, dear," he said. "Everything is for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best and we are going to outmaneuver them yet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trust in me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, Philip," she said, smiling bravely. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know best. And it could not be helped, anyway."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philip stepped to the control platform and waved a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mocking salute through the port window to the purple-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coated committee that stood stolidly waiting for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">departure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Farewell," he chuckled inaudibly. "You are due</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a shock before long."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haines had pulled a lever alongside the hull of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel and huge sliding panels in the crystal roof over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head slipped back, leaving a clear rectangular opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the outer air. Philip manipulated the controls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Inquisitor rose vertically from its cradle, soaring</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly to a great height above the crystal expanse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city's upper surface. Mona and Jack Sterns gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through one of the lower windows at the swiftly reced-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing black rectangle, that marked the spot they had left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom Easton stared moodily at the unfamiliar instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments to which Philip Barton paid such close attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, so far so good," laughed Philip. "Their sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise comes later."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no reply from his companions, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung the nose of the vessel about and headed due</seg><seg type="columnLine">south. The shimmering expanse of the world's largest</seg><seg type="columnLine">city rapidly faded from view, and they were soon out</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the Atlantic off the coast of New Jersey, speeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">southward at five hundred miles an hour, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumbling waters some twenty thousand feet below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In the Inquisitor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A LMOST entirely a product of Philip Barton's</seg><seg type="columnLine">AA genius, the Inquisitor was much that it did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">^ appear to be. It had been carefully searched by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carter's henchmen, but to them it presented no fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">394</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tures differing greatly from the many private air yachts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wealthy class. But a number of secret com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partments had escaped their careful scrutiny and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">these were many things that would have astounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Hidden also from alien eyes was Kirk Paulson</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his group of friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Philip Barton, immensely wealthy by inheritance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was of atavistic type. Early in life he had rebelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the selfishness and arrogance of his class. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet two years of age at the conclusion of the great war,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had grown up with the generation of profiteers who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had increased their wealth enormously, and concen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated it in powerful groups, which eventually ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained complete control of the government. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still in his teens he had his first encounter with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest of the industrial giants, Jerome Carter. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had taken an instinctive dislike to the man, and, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">matured, he watched the unbelievable increase in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's wealth and power. Deeply interested in engi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neering, he had applied himself assiduously to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">studies, but this had not prevented him from acquaint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing himself with conditions among the working classes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had grown rapidly worse under the increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">dominance of Jerome Carter. His interest in the mul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titude in gray increased as their misfortunes piled up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and became more and more unbearable. But his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventive genius was of such value that he was practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">commandeered by the government, and had, of late</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, been very carefully watched and guarded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seeing that his beloved country was headed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">disaster and for an industrial revolution of colossal</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnitude, he bent his thoughts and efforts toward a</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution of the difficulties and the prevention of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemingly unavoidable catastrophe. His secret ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periments were conducted in a laboratory he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleverly concealed in the quarters assigned to his use</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the government, and the secret equipment of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory was transferred to a hidden compartment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Inquisitor, when it was completed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His inventions were in use throughout the civilized</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, and were of inestimable value, particularly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the field of air travel. It had been his discoveries that</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolutionized aviation in 2219 and brought him into</seg><seg type="columnLine">prominence in the engineering fraternity at the early</seg><seg type="columnLine">age of thirty. For nearly three centuries previously</seg><seg type="columnLine">the relation of the gravitational to the electro-magnetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">field was known, it having been proved mathematically</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the twentieth century. But it remained for Philip</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barton to discover means of utilizing this knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the benefit of mankind. His method of producing</seg><seg type="columnLine">contra-gravitational fields had eliminated the use of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings and vertical lifting propellers on all types of air</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft. And later his reaction motor obviated the neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sity of the horizontal propellers as well, and provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only much greater fuel economy, but entire inde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendence of the density of air as a medium for obtain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing propulsive effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The engine room of the Inquisitor was provided with</seg><seg type="columnLine">two contra-field generators, each of sufficient power</seg><seg type="columnLine">to support the vessel when fully loaded. These gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erators were of the most improved type, and were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected to fore and aft pole pieces from whence the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contra-gravity flux emanated. When these were ener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gized, a field was produced that could be varied in in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensity at will, as well as reversed if the necessity arose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The basic discovery of the graviton had led Barton to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the development of this unique apparatus, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">zenith of perfection had been reached in this particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">portion of the Inquisitor's mechanism. The graviton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">be it remembered, was identified by Barton in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory as a close analogy to the magneton, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">final element of magnetism whose relation to magnetism</seg><seg type="columnLine">is similar to that of the electron to electricity. Its re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lation to the earth's gravity field being determined, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a logical, though by no means a simple, step to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">artificial generation of gravitons, both positive and</seg><seg type="columnLine">negative. The method of producing a negative gravi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonic field surrounding two poles composed of the metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">bartonite was his final development, and the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">found itself in the possession of a practical means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting away from the surface of the earth by the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsive force of the opposing fields.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Earlier types of air craft using the Barton gravitonic</seg><seg type="columnLine">field were propelled horizontally by the old style, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficient propeller, drawing them through the air at</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeds not much in excess of three hundred miles an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour, when driven by an electric motor that obtained</seg><seg type="columnLine">its power from the energy broadcasts of the Etheric</seg><seg type="columnLine">Power Syndicate. Philip's next efforts were along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines of improving the method of propulsion, and, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">much research, he developed the reaction motor, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon superseded the antiquated propeller drive. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">compounding of the new alloy, extron, provided a ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terial that gave off great quantities of electrons when</seg><seg type="columnLine">subjected to an electric current, which heated it to not</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than 180 degrees Fahrenheit. The reaction motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a simple mechanism resembling an electric furnace</seg><seg type="columnLine">to which was attached a lengthy tube of insulating ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terial having an inside diameter of nine inches.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Inquisitor was provided with seven of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors in the stern and five in the bow, their twelve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot lengths of tube radiating in the several directions</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary to permit of discharging their high velocity</seg><seg type="columnLine">ionic streams at any desired angle to provide for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving and steering and stopping of the vessel. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">discharge ends of the tubes were set flush with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer surface of the hull, and the extron chambers at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inner ends were of sufficient capacity to contain ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terial for a journey of twenty hours' duration without</seg><seg type="columnLine">recharging, the heating elements being energized by</seg><seg type="columnLine">collectors, that obtained power from the above named</seg><seg type="columnLine">Syndicate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a precautionary measure against the possible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though not probable, failure of both gravitonic field</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators, two reaction motors were installed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertical position so that their repelling streams could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">directed earthward. While not of sufficient power to</seg><seg type="columnLine">support the vessel completely, nor to propel it vertically,</seg><seg type="columnLine">these motors would prevent its falling with great</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough speed to cause serious damage, thus providing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a valuable safety device.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As a private air yacht, the Inquisitor was the equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any in United North America. In other respects it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was far superior to any. Of true streamline shape, two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet in length and with a maximum diameter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fifty feet, it was a thing of beauty as its silvery nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed southward over the course prescribed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banishment decree. Its luxurious suites and cabins</seg><seg type="columnLine">were unoccupied and silent. Philip and his three com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions remained in the navigating cabin until the coast</seg><seg type="columnLine">line was lost to view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	* *</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARTON'S ISLAND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">395</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ACK STERNS broke the silence.

Then we must do some acting ourselves--</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretend extreme fear, despair and demoralization, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Inquisitor does a nose-dive into the Atlantic, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the searching and penetrating rays of the detectoscopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">can not follow. A short journey under water will</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw them off the track and we can emerge later and</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue on our way--but not to Biscoe Island."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He grinned appreciatively at the exclamations of sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise that greeted this announcement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They can not overhear our conversations with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">detectoscopes, can they?" asked Mona anxiously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, indeed, though I have an instrument hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard, with which that very thing can be accomplished.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What is more, there are many things in the Inquisitor</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they can not even see, though they are watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">us closely at this moment, and we must be careful</seg><seg type="columnLine">that our expressions do not betray the trend of our con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation.

Swifter and swifter it fell, descending rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at an angle of about forty-five degrees. Then suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was all over. The nose of the vessel entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves with a great cleaving effect, throwing a shimmer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing spray in every direction as the smooth hull buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">its length from sight. The splash returned to the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face like that following a stone tossed into a puddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the waters closed over the vanished air yacht.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Randall Haines laughed aloud. "Saves a lot of work</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the Department," he said. "We should have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy watching them for all of a year had this not hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened. I must report it at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better wait a bit, sir," admonished Olsen. "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel will return to the surface unless the hull was</seg><seg type="columnLine">battered in by the force of its dive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE searching ray of the detectoscope played over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface of the ocean for more than a half hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the vicinity of the accident. Olsen even tried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrating ray but it was of no avail since the variable</seg><seg type="columnLine">refractive effect of the tumbling waves broke up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen images completely. A further methodic search</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the surface for several miles in all directions from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point where the Inquisitor had vanished produced</seg><seg type="columnLine">no results.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Haines gave vent to a startled exclamation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's that, Olsen ?" he asked in excitement, pointing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a small object that bobbed about on the surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark waters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The magnification was increased rapidly until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">object became life-sized on the screen. It was a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooden packing case, and in black letters on its cover</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the name "Inquisitor." There was no further</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt of the loss of the vessel and its passengers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Randall Haines could contain himself no longer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he hastened to the television radio in the adjoining</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. After a moment of setting a number-combina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion on a series of dials on the instrument, the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">features of Jerome Carter appeared in a brightly illu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minated square on its face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, Haines," greeted the unpleasant voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What's the news?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They've been sunk!" was the reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sunk?" asked Carter in startled voice, "What do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There was an explosion in the engine room of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inquisitor and she went down out of control.

He seemed about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to burst. "By God, Haines!" he ejaculated.

Here and there they</seg><seg type="columnLine">exchanged furtive glances and passed signs that boded</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill for the plutocracy of the upper levels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within the hour there was rioting in New York and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in several others of the large centers, but it was quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">subdued by violent action of the red guards. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitiable multitude in gray was without an organization,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without a leader of sufficient ability to unite them in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> President Haven bore the brunt of recrimination</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaped on the government by the workers and by cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain of those of the purple, who were friends and ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirers of Philip Barton. He was openly accused of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">murder of his own daughter, and, when he attempted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to address a crowd that had gathered in Capitol Square</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Washington, he was hissed down. After this ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience he retired to his own chambers under heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard. But in the innermost recesses of his thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was glad. He did not believe that his daughter was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost, nor that her husband and his companions had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowned in the cold waters of the Atlantic. He trusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philip Barton, and to himself he repeated, over and</seg><seg type="columnLine">over again, the assurance he had been given by the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventor, that a reported disaster would be a ruse and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to be credited. But his position was extremely</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult and he called on Carter for assistance and ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vice. But that wily person had eliminated himself as</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely as if he had vanished from the face of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. It was impossible to locate him by radio at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his offices or at his living quarters. With trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">brewing, he had left the President to face it alone. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret council of ten had likewise become non-existent</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far as any possibility of locating them was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerned. But the Secret Service was loyal to its duties</seg><seg type="columnLine">and President Haven felt certain of his safety from</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal violence when he reached his own rooms, es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">corted and guarded by nine members of the Depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> TNKNOWN to the wearers of the purple, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were three gathering places of the gray. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">largest, in New York City, was cleverly hidden in a dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">used warehouse space below one of the deepest sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">levels. This space was of sufficient size to permit more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than two thousand workers to listen to the exhortations</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the few speakers, who had the temerity to address</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">them from time to time. Another was located in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago, this one being fully as large as the first. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">third, somewhat smaller, had been recently established</seg><seg type="columnLine">in San Francisco. The three headquarters were inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">connected by a secret television-radio public address</seg><seg type="columnLine">system, and the growing organization activities, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been interruptd by Barton's exile, could thus be</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried on without knowledge of the red police or of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world at large.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Less than five hours after the reported loss of Philip</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barton's vessel, these three halls were crowded to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">utmost, and a red-faced individual addressed the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">audiences from the platform of the meeting place in</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York. He was Arnold Baxter, a close friend of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirk Paulson, and he spoke vigorously and pointedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Friends," he said, "we must not deceive ourselves in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this matter of the exiling of Philip Barton. We must</seg><seg type="columnLine">not place the blame upon the shoulders of his father-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in-law, President Haven, though he signed the decree</seg><seg type="columnLine">of banishment. It has become increasingly evident dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing recent years that there is a guiding hand, a dictator</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the policies of our government. And that dictator</seg><seg type="columnLine">is none other than Jerome Carter. We may rest as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sured that it was by his influence this dastardly action</seg><seg type="columnLine">was taken. And to me, it is clearly evident that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">persuasion of our President to sign the fatal paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">was accomplished only by a clever presentment of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banishment decree, as something that could not possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">result in harm to his daughter or to her husband. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">this vicious arch-enemy of ours, Carter, had planned</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleverly that the voyage of the Inquisitor was to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vide a simple and completely masked means of getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barton out of the way forever. He has accomplished</seg><seg type="columnLine">his purpose, to our everlasting loss and sorrow. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">dear friend now lies at the bottom of the Atlantic and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his great work must be continued by another. Kirk</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paulson is the only man in United North America</seg><seg type="columnLine">who can measure up to the necessity. Is Kirk here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no response for a few minutes. Then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">piping voice spoke up from the rear of the auditorium:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There was a group in Cooper Square at noon time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirk was among them. But they were dispersed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">red guards, and he has not been seen since. My sister</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the group and we have heard nothing from her</seg><seg type="columnLine">either."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another example of this unbearable tyranny,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted Arnold Baxter. "They have undoubtedly been</seg><seg type="columnLine">incarcerated by the red police. But we must not delay</seg><seg type="columnLine">for long. Philip Barton must be avenged and, oh</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends, if you but realized it, our power is more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficient to accomplish the overthrow of the present</seg><seg type="columnLine">regime and the establishment of a new order of things</seg><seg type="columnLine">--government actually "of the people, by the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for the people." Our number is legion and, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the fact that we are unorganized, we could this</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute take things in our own hands. True, we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been kept uneducated and undernourished. We have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been divided and sequestered to prevent this very or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ganizing. And why? Because we are feared by those</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the purple. Full well do they appreciate the strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could muster were we properly led and banded to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether. And that is the very reason for Jerome Carter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear of Barton, who befriended us well, but a bit too</seg><seg type="columnLine">openly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The republican form of government is sound in</seg><seg type="columnLine">principle and I do not believe that any of us are in</seg><seg type="columnLine">398</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">favor of a substitute.

The control has gradually passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the hands of the people, where it belongs by con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stitutional right, to the hands of a few men who have</seg><seg type="columnLine">amassed huge fortunes by inheritance, supplemented</seg><seg type="columnLine">by profiteering in the labor of our down-trodden mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions. These have subsidized the politicians and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlled the elections for decades. They have forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passage of laws which benefit their own class and</seg><seg type="columnLine">discriminate against ours. This class legislation has</seg><seg type="columnLine">poisoned our entire social structure, until, during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past two generations, we have degenerated into the suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fering, hopeless lot we now are.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But an end must come to everything, and this last</seg><seg type="columnLine">act of Carter's is the final blow that must precipitate</seg><seg type="columnLine">action.

Full</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity had been restored just before the dive and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had pulled the lever which opened the sea-cocks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitted water to the ballast compartments.

The ballast tanks were</seg><seg type="columnLine">filling rapidly and his first action was to close the sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cocks, first in the bow and then in the stern compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments to restore the vessel to an even keel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He then glanced at Mona and his male companions</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw that, though considerably upset by the experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence, they were alive and not much injured. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled encouragingly at Mona's questioning glance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then turned full energy into the stern reaction motors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The pumps were at work emptying much of the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had taken aboard and it was not long before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had risen to a depth of about a hundred feet below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface and were headed southward at full speed.

The dripping hull of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship rose eagerly to the controls and they soon resumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the normal air-cruising level of twenty thousand feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, Jack," he said, when the course had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed to the southeast and the speed increased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred miles an hour, "I wish you would take</seg><seg type="columnLine">the controls for a time. I want to get some of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments working and see what is happening back</seg><seg type="columnLine">home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This arrangement being made, he greeted Kirk's fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowers and mutual introductions followed, after which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mona took the women in charge, and Tom the men, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">being assigned to staterooms in the vessel which was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be their home for some time to come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He retired to one of the secret chambers with Kirk</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paulson, and the two men were soon busily engaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a detectoscope, which was one of the portions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the equipment of the hidden compartment. A series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sliding panels in the neutroloy wall was opened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">permit the directing of the rays of the instrument in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a northwesterly direction without interference. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">city of Washington was soon brought into view on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rectangular screen and Philip immediately found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Administration Building with the searching ray. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">400</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the penetrating ray in service lie quickly obtained ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess to the President's private office, where he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">two secretaries at work. But President Haven was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not there. He observed that the secretaries were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versing occasionally in jerky, half-frightened mono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">syllables and he hastened to bring into service one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his most recent inventions, the detectophone. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">model was the only instrument of its kind in existence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was capable of picking up the speech of those far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">away assistants in the Administration Building and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bringing their words to the Inquisitor over the rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">projected from the standard detectoscope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Haven didn't take it as seriously as I expected,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke one of the men visible on the screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," replied the other, "That occurred to me also."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But Carter's scared."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They say he can't be located."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So I heard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's Haven?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Home, I guess."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PHILIP had heard all he wished and he soon adjusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the searching ray to reach for the location of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">President's living quarters. These were quickly pene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trated and he found Ross Haven in his own spacious</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing room with Mrs. Haven and Frances, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngest daughter. The detectophone was still in oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation, and the voices of the three came clearly to Philip</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Kirk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, Daddy, are you sure?" asked Frances, wiping</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes with a corner of her handkerchief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I trust Philip," was the reply. "He told me defi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nitely that he planned to make it appear that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost and assured me that any news to that effect would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be untrue."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I do hope you are right," spoke Mrs. Haven</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a tone of extreme anxiety. "If anything has really</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to Mona it will be the death of me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't worry now, mother," spoke the President,</seg><seg type="columnLine">patting her shoulder comfortingly. "Philip would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made the statements he did unless they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">true."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kirk looked at his superior. "Hadn't we better set</seg><seg type="columnLine">their minds at rest ?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I think we had," replied Philip, "but, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship in motion we can project only our voices. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be enough though. Get Mona here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure," agreed Kirk, starting at once to locate her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philip busied himself with another contrivance that</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied a space on the long bench adjoining the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tectoscope and the detectophone. This invention had</seg><seg type="columnLine">also not been disclosed to the world, though Philip had</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfected it more than a year previously. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectophone, which, by a simple connection to the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tectophone and utilizing the searching and penetrating</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays of the standard detectoscope, enabled one to carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a two-way conversation with persons pictured on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mona returned with Kirk just as he had completed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the necessary connections, and, when she saw her</seg><seg type="columnLine">parents and sister pictured before her eyes, and heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">their familiar voices in worried conversation, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">uttered an exclamation of surprise and joy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What was that?" asked her mother in a startled</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, "I thought I heard Mona speak."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You did, mother, you did," Mona exclaimed. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am safe on the Inquisitor and can see you and hear you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanks to one of Philip's secret inventions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But--but," stammered her mother, looking about</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a confused manner, "I hear you perfectly. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can not see you, and your voice seems to come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">nowhere. It is everywhere in the room."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Philip laughed aloud. "It must seem mysterious at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, Mrs. Haven," he said. "But it is an accomplished</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact nevertheless. And we are all safe, just as Mona</seg><seg type="columnLine">says."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The President spoke. "What actually happened?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I drove the Inquisitor under water," replied Philip,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"after making it appear that an engine room explosion</seg><seg type="columnLine">had damaged the vessel beyond repair. We traveled</seg><seg type="columnLine">below the surface for two hours, but are now in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air and headed toward an almost unknown island under</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own emergency power."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mrs. Haven cried her relief on her husband's shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der as she heard the distant voice, and Frances was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited, that she could not wait to talk with her beloved</seg><seg type="columnLine">sister. The two-way conversation was carried on for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time, and Philip betrayed great concern, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned of the effect the report of his death had pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced among the masses in the lower levels of the cities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They must not start trouble now," he said, "or they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will upset all my plans. I must increase speed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">get to our destination at once so our further work can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be started. So, farewell for a time, folks. We'll get in</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch with you often."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was thus a happy-faced group that faded from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen, when Barton changed the adjustments to</seg><seg type="columnLine">search for Jerome Carter. He was unable to locate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dictator either in his New York or Washington office,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or in his home, so he returned to the navigating cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took over the controls from Jack Sterns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We must rush to our destination," he announced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Trouble is brewing fast at home and there are certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">things I can do only from a headquarters on solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How much further is it?" asked Kirk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About four thousand miles air line. Our island</seg><seg type="columnLine">is not far from St. Helena, where the emperor Na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poleon spent six years in exile more than four cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turies ago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then we're bound for a stylish neighborhood for</seg><seg type="columnLine">exiles," laughed Tom Easton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Philip, "and I want to get there in two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can you do it?" asked Jack, in surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think so. We're going up about twenty miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">further where there is practically no air resistance. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course the rotation of the earth is against us, if our</seg><seg type="columnLine">height makes us independent of it, since it travels from</seg><seg type="columnLine">west to east at the surface speed of nearly a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles an hour. But we are cutting across the plane of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the equator at an angle of about forty-five degrees, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">the adverse effect can be only half of that speed. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">I think the Inquisitor can do 2500 miles an hour at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher altitude."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The altimeter already showed eighty thousand feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was still mounting. The speed indicator soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed nearly fifty miles a minute, so there was little</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt of accomplishing Philip's desire.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARTON'S ISLAND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">401</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DARKNESS had long since been overtaken when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philip slowed down the vessel and maneuvered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a lower altitude. By his dead reckoning they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">about reached their goal, and he sent Jack to the plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form on the upper surface of the ship to take observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. While Jack was aloft Philip bent over his chart</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pointed out the position of the island; longitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve degrees and twenty minutes west, latitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-one degrees and two minutes south. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes Jack returned with the sextant and his ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servation checked the dead reckoning almost exactly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had reached the island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All was in darkness beneath save for the light of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon as it shimmered on the tumbling waters. Slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Inquisitor was dropped to two thousand feet alti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude and the searchlights were directed downwards.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The searching pencils of white radiance soon located</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rugged coast line, where foaming white breakers</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashed rhythmically against rocky cliffs, that reared</seg><seg type="columnLine">their tops safely out of reach. It was less than two</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles ahead, and in a very few minutes the Inquisitor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been maneuvered to a landing in a clear space well</seg><seg type="columnLine">back from the rocky shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Philip mustered all hands, hitherto hidden in one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secret compartments, as soon as the landing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made, and they set to work with a will as he directed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to convey to the outside the sections of a knocked-</seg><seg type="columnLine">down structural tower and several cases of apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">and parts which were required in the experiments to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow. The light metal sections were rapidly assem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled in the flat open space alongside the vessel, great</seg><seg type="columnLine">flood-lights being brought into play to light the scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">as brightly as day. .Within the hour a cage-like struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture reared itself skyward to a height of more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">seventy feet, and Philip and Kirk erected a pivoted</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizontal member at the top, which was assembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">from short joints of shining metallic tubing to form</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cannon-like tube of some twenty feet in length. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">small electric motor was attached to gearing that swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">this member about its vertical axis and a similar motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">applied to the horizontal axis, so that the tube could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be swung to any point of the compass by remote con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trol or to any angle with relation to the horizontal. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulated cables were brought down the lattice-work of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tower and carried into the Inquisitor where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were attached to a mechanism in the laboratory com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," said Philip, when the work was completed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his satisfaction, "we are ready for some serious work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I do not believe we are much too soon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He first brought the detectoscope and its allied in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struments into action. The first search carried the ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servers to the extreme lower levels of New York City</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it foscused on the meeting being addressed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arnold Baxter. Kirk Paulson expressed his glee at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the size of the gathering, but his face took on a serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression when the first words of the speaker were</seg><seg type="columnLine">made audible by the detectophone:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And friends," intoned the voice of Arnold Baxter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"we must strike our first blow to-morrow morning. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">it shall be a decisive blow that will show our power in</seg><seg type="columnLine">no uncertain manner. Paulson is not here--Philip</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barton lies in a watery grave--but we must act. Jerome</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carter and the council of ten must go. Much as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">all hate the thought of bloodshed, there is no other way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have the living addresses of all eleven, and these must</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be visited before dawn and each must pay the penalty</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his life.

Philip Barton must be avenged and</seg><seg type="columnLine">our once glorious country must be restored to its birth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right of freedom and happiness. Who will volun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teer ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a storm of cheers from the crowd in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">auditorium, and from the loud speakers connected with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Chicago and San Francisco meetings came clearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clamorous approval of the gatherings assembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at those points.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kirk's face paled. "Great Scott, Philip," he ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed, "they are mad. It means a bloody civil war</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they are not stopped."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just what I feared," agreed Philip. "And we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He energized the projectophone mechanism and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought the image of Arnold Baxter very close in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen. All members of the party on board the vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">were assembled in the laboratory, and they watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">and listened to the proceedings in breathless silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Speak quietly to Baxter now, Kirk," directed Philip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kirk placed his lips to the microphone and whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered, "Baxter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leader of the gray assemblage was panting from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the excitement and exertion of his speech, but he turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head sharply at sound of the voice that whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his ear from nowhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Baxter," repeated Kirk, "it is I, Kirk Paulson."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In great surprise Arnold Baxter swung about in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">directions, as if expecting his friend to materialize from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surrounding air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In heaven's name man, where are you?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, about five thousand miles away," said Kirk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"with Philip Barton, who does not, as is supposed, lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a watery grave.

Expressions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">disbelief surged through the crowd, and it was some</seg><seg type="columnLine">little time before the clamor was silenced. Then the well-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known voice of Kirk Paulson swept through the hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the astounded listeners were compelled to believe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Friends," said Kirk, "this mad plan must be aban-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doned.

We are not ghosts and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">images will be merely light images, having three normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensions even after their projection through inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vening space."</seg><seg type="columnLine">402</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The far-away audience watched the platform, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened in strained silence, while Philip worked rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get the apparatus of his projectoscope in operation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the laboratory of the Inquisitor, the witnesses</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched as closely as did their friends in distant New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York. Philip and Kirk mounted a small insulated plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form, over which was suspended a huge helix of glit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering copper ribbon that glowed with a mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple light when a generator started purring in a cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner of the laboratory, and numerous vacuum tubes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wall cabinet lighted up at the touch of Philip's finger</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a switch. Two small levers, operating on semi-cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ular plates graduated in degrees were manipulated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">control the direction of the tube at the top of the tower</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been erected outside the vessel. Philip moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">these levers carefully until a circular spot of reddish</seg><seg type="columnLine">light appeared on the platform of the distant audi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torium. Then he spoke:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Friends," came his kindly voice, "if you will keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">your eyes on the spot of light which has appeared be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore Arnold Baxter you will observe the gradual ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terialization of my image and that of Kirk Paulson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pressed a button at the side of one of the levers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the hum of the generator lowered in pitch as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the increased load. The watchers at both ends of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the circuit gasped as the living images appeared on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform--hazy at first and weaving about from static</seg><seg type="columnLine">interference, they soon developed into clear-cut, sub-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stantial reproductions of the two men on the little trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitting table in the Inquisitor's laboratory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The crowd in the distant meeting hall broke loose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nothing could restrain their demonstrations for</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly ten minutes. Finally, becoming impatient at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the delay, Philip silenced them with a thundering voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and told them of the importance of their deserting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan proposed by Baxter, and of their remaining in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">active to permit him to carry out his own plans in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">behalf. He spoke to them for about fifteen minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made arrangements to speak at the same point each</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening thereafter, until his activities had brought re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sults. When the projectoscope was switched off and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the images of the two men vanished, the din in the hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">was terrific and Kirk Paulson gloated over the success</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the experiment while Philip changed the adjustments</seg><seg type="columnLine">and started a search for Jerome Carter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We may rest assured that he is up to some deviltry</seg><seg type="columnLine">by this time," he said grimly, as he searched first the</seg><seg type="columnLine">offices and then the living quarters of the great man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It finally occurred to him to search the Administration</seg><seg type="columnLine">Building and there, after several ineffectual attempts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he eventually located the secret meeting room, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carter was in session with his ten lieutenants. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first words heard from that point were the instructions</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Alexander DeWolf regarding the pollution of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water supply, and the witnesses on board the Inquisitor</seg><seg type="columnLine">paled and gasped their horror at the fiendishness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great Scott!" exclaimed Barton, when Carter's</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARTON'S ISLAND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">403</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting was dismissed, "the man is a far worse rascal</seg><seg type="columnLine">than I suspected. We are none too soon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE directed Kirk to follow the movements of De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wolf with the detectoscope and set about bring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the projectoscope platform a crystal sphere of</seg><seg type="columnLine">about eighteen inches diameter. This he placed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cup-shaped receptacle, which he set in the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the platform. Then he returned to the adjusting mech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">anism of the searching ray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the screen they followed DeWolf to the fast air</seg><seg type="columnLine">liner, that carried him from Washington to New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">in less than fifty minutes. They followed him to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">very rooms, where he was seen to sit before his desk</seg><seg type="columnLine">and start writing orders to twelve trusted subordinates</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the twelve great cities named by Carter. These were</seg><seg type="columnLine">written on radiogram blanks and were intended to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">delivered in the morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Time to take serious action," said Philip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started the projectoscope generator and the crys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal sphere glowed with an unholy wavering radiance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that shifted color so rapidly as to set the eyes pulsating</seg><seg type="columnLine">with immediate nervous reactions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep your eyes off that sphere, folks," he ordered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The controls of of the projectoscope were adjusted</seg><seg type="columnLine">until a red circle of light appeared on Alexander</seg><seg type="columnLine">DeWolf's desk. Then an image of the shimmering</seg><seg type="columnLine">sphere itself materialized in that spot and DeWolf</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang back in alarm. But his eyes could not leave that</seg><seg type="columnLine">awe-inspiring phenomenon. He seemed drawn to it by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some irresistible force, and the watchers saw his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">dilate in fear as the pupils jerked spasmodically in</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhythm with the flickering colors. In less than two</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes he stiffened in his chair to the rigidity of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone image, eyes wide open and staring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those messages will not go out to-night," laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philip. "That was a successful demonstration of long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance hypnotism. Mr. DeWolf will not awaken</seg><seg type="columnLine">until we use our projectoscope on him again--when</seg><seg type="columnLine">advisable. Now, let's all get some sleep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was an astonished and awed group that broke up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few minutes later and retired to the staterooms of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inquisitor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Exploring the Island</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NEXT morning Philip awakened with the dawn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he prepared to sally forth at once to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">over their surroundings in daylight, being care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful not to awaken Mona as he bathed and dressed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found that Kirk had preceded him and was ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amining the results of their previous night's work on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the projectoscope tower. It evidently pleased him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of the haste with which it had been accomplished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he greeted Philip with a broad smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good morning, Philip," said Kirk. "Are you ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a check on our friends back home to see what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be up to in the early morning hours?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not for some time yet, Kirk," was the reply. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget that the sun rises here about four and a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours earlier than in Washington. Our friends of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple are not accustomed to rising before dawn."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's right," admitted Kirk. "And I imagine some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our companions here will not be up and about for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour or more, either."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quite likely," laughed Philip. "At least I'm sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Mona will not. She was exhausted when we re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tired last night. In the meantime suppose you and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">look over the island a bit. It is three years since I last</seg><seg type="columnLine">visited it, and I should like to see what changes, if any,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have taken place in that time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They made their way over the smooth, moss-covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks of the extensive plateau on which the Inquisitor</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested and soon neared the edge of the cliff which sep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">arated them from the remainder of the island. There a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful sight met their view, for before them spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">a huge depression, all that remained of the crater of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">extinct volcano whose dying activity had thrust the</seg><seg type="columnLine">island above the surface of the waves. The sloping</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls of the crater were covered with strange vegeta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, tropical in character yet lacking in the hugeness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and denseness of the jungles of Africa on account of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the comparative youth of the undeveloped island. Birds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of brilliant hue flitted among the trees and the air was</seg><seg type="columnLine">redolent of the odors of virgin forest. From the oppo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">site side of the crater, fully two miles across, there cas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caded a waterfall that spilled its sparkling waters down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sloping wall of rock and formed a stream that</seg><seg type="columnLine">wound its way through the verdant valley and disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared among the trees in the lowermost portion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">depression. The skies were cloudless, and the early</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning sun already gave promise of a much warmer</seg><seg type="columnLine">day than the one they were accustomed to in the uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formly cooled and heated cities of their own country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is back to nature with a vengeance," laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirk. "I have not visited the country in more than ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, and have seen no growing things since, except-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing potted plants and flowers. Let's go down into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley. I see a natural pathway down the rocks that</seg><seg type="columnLine">should not be difficult to follow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better not," said Philip. "We have many things to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplish to-day, and we might spend several hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">down there if we ventured into the valley. I lost my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in that undergrowth three years ago and spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly a full day finding my way out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS they became absorbed in their contemplation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the beauties of nature there was another of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inquisitor's passengers who had been awakened by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">early morning sun and who was busily preparing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the vessel on a mission of curiosity. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of Kirk's friends, Aline Sarov, an attractive, Titian-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired miss of twenty, who had spent the past eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of her life in the confining work of the Synthetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Food Products Corporation. Never in her short and</seg><seg type="columnLine">uneventful experience had she been awakened by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerful inpouring of the sun's rays through a bedside</seg><seg type="columnLine">window. Her every awakening, as far back as mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ory carried her, had been to the automatic flooding of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her small, eight-level room with artificial sunlight sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied over the cables of the Manhattan Power Division</seg><seg type="columnLine">at precisely six o'clock. And the real sun, which she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen but four times in her lifetime, was so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">more comforting and pleasant. She reveled in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmth of the beam that slanted across her room, then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sudden accession of exuberant vigor, rushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the corridors of the Inquisitor and out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open air*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When she reached the outside she breathed deep of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ocean breeze and could scarce refrain from shout-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her happiness aloud. With quick, light steps she</seg><seg type="columnLine">made her way across the rocks and soon reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crater's rim, where the unexpected sight of its sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">404 \</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">denly revealed beauties struck her with such force that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she stood rooted to the spot for many silent minutes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So absorbed was she in the strangely marvelous view</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she did not see the two men, who stood not a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet away, watching her with pleased and kindly</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally Kirk called out, "Aline!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a startled glance in their direction, the girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">flushed and seemed about to return in haste to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inquisitor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come," called Kirk again. "Come and join us."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"All right," she replied, her momentary embarrass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment forgotten. "I thought I was the only early riser</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the yacht, so I was a bit surprised by your greeting."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She approached the two men somewhat timidly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Good morning," she greeted them, when she reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot where they awaited her coming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good morning," returned the two men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Philip's keen gray eyes noted the softness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">words as spoken by Kirk and the mounting color of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl as she took the hand of the handsome young man</seg><seg type="columnLine">in gray. Sensing the situation at once, he soon made an</seg><seg type="columnLine">excuse and returned to the Inquisitor, leaving the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">younger people together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You look wonderful this morning, Aline," was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirk's first remark after Philip was out of sight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Do I?" she replied innocently. "It must be the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vigorating sea air that brings the color to my cheeks."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, it is more than that, Aline. You look happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carefree. It is the freedom from the dull mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">notony of the daily grind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps you are right, Kirk," she agreed solemnly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I do feel different. I feel as though I were an indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vidual rather than a mere cog in a great machine--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great, purposeless machine. And what is it all about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirk? You have promised to explain it all to me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am so ignorant and so anxious to learn. Why are our</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives as they are ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Kirk looked tenderly at the sweet face which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more taken on its customary wistful expression.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is a long story," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But we have plenty of time," she said. "Please tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me--Kirk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well," he agreed. "I'll do my best."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Side by side they sat at the rim of the crater and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirk unfolded to her eager ears the story of the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velopment of conditions as they had come to exist in</seg><seg type="columnLine">United North America.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The trouble has not become acute until recent</seg><seg type="columnLine">years," he began. "In fact, it did not begin to assume</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious proportions until after the great war. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually began in the dim past--about three centuries</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago. At that time the United States of America was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">richest nation in the world, even as United North</seg><seg type="columnLine">America is at the present time. The world was then</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovering from a rather widespread conflict, in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the nations had become involved, but of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effects were as nothing when compared with those</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great war of 2179 to 2191. The foreign nations</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovered with comparative rapidity and, in less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty years, the war that had then been considered so</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreadful became little more than a memory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MEANWHILE the wealth of our country con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued, and the prosperity of the lower and mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle class grew apace. In those days there were three</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">classes, the middle one of which has since disappeared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was in the early days of industrial development,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and what were known as public utilities enjoyed an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unprecedented growth. The use of electricity was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its infancy, but growing rapidly, and it was not long</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the public utilities became the strongest single</seg><seg type="columnLine">factor in the old United States. Serving the public</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the matter of light, heat, power and transportation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were given monopolistic rights by the people, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">being a foregone conclusion that the people would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">served. There lay the great danger, the danger of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">essentials of life falling into the hands of a unified in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest. And the public utilities saw to it that unifica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was accomplished. The monopoly created by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">public eventually came to prey on the public which</seg><seg type="columnLine">created it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The utilities formed huge combinations, aided and</seg><seg type="columnLine">abetted by the gullible public, and these undertook to</seg><seg type="columnLine">control the politics of the people who created them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dictate the policies of the government. The pros-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perity of the middle class contributed surely and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">evitably to the accomplishment of the result, for they</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon became of sufficient affluence to dabble in what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was known as the stock market. In New York and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">other large cities there were trading places where se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curities and papers representing actual shares in various</seg><seg type="columnLine">business enterprises were dealt in. But these trading</seg><seg type="columnLine">centers were actually controlled by the moneyed inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ests, though for a time they allowed the middle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower classes to profit and to approach, though scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever reach, the independence of wealth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was all a clever scheme in the minds of a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">great financial wizards, you see. The period of intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">public interest in speculation continued for many years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the combinations and mergers of great industrial</seg><seg type="columnLine">and public utility interests increased by leaps and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounds. Executives and officials of the great corpora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions formed "investment trusts," wherein they pooled</seg><seg type="columnLine">their vast holdings of the stocks of varied corporations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the intention of preventing the collapse of prices</seg><seg type="columnLine">and still enabling the individuals to "cash in" on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper profits. The public continued to buy and buy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, in order to gratify their anxiety to amass riches</seg><seg type="columnLine">for themselves, their savings were withdrawn from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks in ever-increasing amounts and eventually found</seg><seg type="columnLine">their way into the coffers of the unified industries and</seg><seg type="columnLine">utilities. â¢ The collapse of the banking system followed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then came the collapse of the stock market and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor, misguided public saw their paper profits dwindle</seg><seg type="columnLine">and disappear under the onslaughts of the professional</seg><seg type="columnLine">manipulators of the market. After their supposed profits</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone, their actual savings followed, and, within a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very short time, the middle and lower classes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">without funds, and the upper class was in possession of</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost all of the tangible wealth of the nation. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushing of the National Banks and the Federal Reserve</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not so easy, as this could not be accomplished with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out legislation. But this proved to be no great stum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling block to the great financial minds, for they had by</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time become so very powerful and influential that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were enabled to force through Congress almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">any legislation they desired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gold had been used for many years as a basis for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the monetary system. This also was done away with</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the banking system was disrupted. Further</seg><seg type="columnLine">legislation was enacted and the government mints were</seg><seg type="columnLine">\</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BARTON'S ISLAND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">405</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">closed down, the coining of gold, silver, nickel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">copper being discontinued. The paper money of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">government, which had previously been issued against</seg><seg type="columnLine">reserves of gold and silver, went the way of the bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">notes, which had lost their value with the collapse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the banking system, and the country came into the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete control of the industries and utilities. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper became the medium of exchange, and the security</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this paper was the actual plants and properties of.</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corporations."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"DUT," objected Aline, "the President and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">â D members of Congress are elected by the people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If the public saw all of this coming, why did they not</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevent it by electing government officials who could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be influenced nor subsidized by the corporations?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Because," explained Kirk, "they pulled the wool</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the eyes of the people in those days even as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done in our own time. But they were devilishly</seg><seg type="columnLine">clever, and in their justice be it said that for more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">two centuries conditions under their rule were far</seg><seg type="columnLine">better than they had been previously. For a time, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, there was chaos, and from it emerged a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">order of things. Those of the middle class who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost their all dropped in status to a class in some cases</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower than the low. Those few who had managed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">retain some of their profits were elevated to the fringe</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the upper class. The middle class as such was gone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, with the re-stabilizing of exchange by the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">system of the industries and utilities, the first step of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great leaders was to alleviate conditions in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower classes and to thereby obtain their everlasting</seg><seg type="columnLine">gratitude. In the furtherance of their own designs, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was necessary to use the working class, and the work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing class was made to benefit in direct ratio to its will-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingness and ability. Those of education and ability</seg><seg type="columnLine">were quickly elevated to higher stations in life and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire level was raised. There was less work than ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">for everyone and the standard of living improved until</seg><seg type="columnLine">all were enjoying more of the luxuries and comforts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life than they had ever known before. The advance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">science contributed greatly to this, and the invention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">new labor-saving devices and the ultimate complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrification of the entire nation lightened the labors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all. Of course the few great men at the heads of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vast corporations were in possession of practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of the actual wealth, but who cared? The actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery of the government was running more</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoothly than ever before. Each worker found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own comforts and rewards could be increased by</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased effort and more especially by improvement</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his or her own education. There being little need</seg><seg type="columnLine">for heavy manual labor, a premium was placed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the possession of knowledge and education, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire populace benefitted greatly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The increase of scientific knowledge led to an age</seg><seg type="columnLine">of invention, and this conspired to bring about the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">centration of population in the great cities and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandonment of the farms and smaller communities.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Necessity called for the provision of synthetic substi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tutes for farm products, and these were forthcoming.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The breeding and raising of livestock became almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible on account of the turning of the youth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country to the cities. Synthetic substitutes for meat</seg><seg type="columnLine">were forthcoming. With the increase in knowledge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the requirements of the human body and the knowledge</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the important part played by the various vitamins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was a simple matter, for vitamins can be produced</seg><seg type="columnLine">synthetically as you know from your own work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Proper combinations of the required vitamins produced</seg><seg type="columnLine">in palatable form have been our daily sustenance for</seg><seg type="columnLine">two centuries now, and statistics show that our race</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, until after the great war, stronger and healthier</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ever before in its history.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aline corrugated her brow in growing perplexity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If conditions were so ideal for generations and gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erations under the new order of things, why have they</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed so radically since the great war ?" she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is another matter," he replied. "As long as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men at the head of the eleven essential corpora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions were good men and had as their first concern the</seg><seg type="columnLine">good of mankind in general and of their countrymen</seg><seg type="columnLine">in particular, all was well. But the soft living of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the purple gradually altered their viewpoints. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly degenerated, both mentally and morally. Brains</seg><seg type="columnLine">were easy to purchase, too easy in fact. Trusted lieu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenants took over the more arduous duties and left</seg><seg type="columnLine">their masters to lives of ease and indulgence. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">these lieutenants were placed in positions of power and</seg><seg type="columnLine">authority, though their every vital policy was dictated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the master mind. And, with the degeneration of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">master minds, the policies became less and less favor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to the wearers of the gray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then came the great war. The nations of Europe</seg><seg type="columnLine">became embroiled in a conflict the like of which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never been conceived in the minds of the most pessimis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic of the calamity howlers. Their orders for muni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, chemicals, supplies, poured into our country and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their riches followed in payment. The master minds</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovered from their lethargy. Vast profits were to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">made from the misfortunes which had come to Europe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The labors of the workers in gray increased apace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">China and Japan became involved. The colonies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Great Britain were depopulated to feed the maw of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster--super-scientific war--as were the colonies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other great powers. The wealth of the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States doubled, trebled. Three billions of our fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">men had perished and still our people did not interfere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Having become a self-contained nation and entirely in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dependent of imports of commodities, it was not neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary to protect ourselves in foreign countries. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire world was at war--nations were brutally exter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minating each other by scientific means--whole armies</seg><seg type="columnLine">were wiped out at a single blast of electronic energy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally, when the combatants were exhausted and al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most defenseless, we stepped in with an army of twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">million. It was difficult to determine just which side</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were on, but we put an end to the great war--to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of the world, almost. A second army of twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">million followed and the job was completed. Our loss</seg><seg type="columnLine">in man power totaled fifteen millions. Our loss in riches</seg><seg type="columnLine">was enormous--on paper.

Jerome Carter</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a young man, but he had inherited from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">father and uncles the control of the corporate wealth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of three families, and this total represented more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">two-thirds the wealth of the nation. This man, Jerome</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carter, hated the gray multitude. He possessed great</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of will, and soon obtained complete mastery over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other ten greatest magnates of the newly formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">United North America. Within ten years he was vir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tual dictator of the new Republic, and he had taken the</seg><seg type="columnLine">last vestige of independence from the wearers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray. By his control of the President and of Congress,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he caused the enactment of legislation which took edu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation entirely from the lower levels of our cities.

That is why</seg><seg type="columnLine">we traffic surreptitiously in books in our lower levels,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that is why the red police have been built up into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great organization fostered by the minions of Jerome</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As a parallel to the complete subsidy of the govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and the degradation of the multitude in gray,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jerome Carter has kept Europe and Asia and the colo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nies of the former great powers of those continents</seg><seg type="columnLine">from recovering from the effects of the great war.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With their future mortgaged to his puppets, they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">never reach economic independence, since their labor is</seg><seg type="columnLine">all expended in wresting from the battle-scarred ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">the minerals and chemicals which constitute almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">their sole source of wealth and which is the sole me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dium they have in which to pay their debts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Terrible, terrible," exclaimed Aline, whose eyes had</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained wonder-wide during the long recital. ."And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the change is to be accomplished by you and Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barton ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mostly by Philip," he replied, "and, I imagine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mostly from this island."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A cheerful hail from the direction of the Inquisitor</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached their ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Breakfast, folks!" came the cheery voice of Mona</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm hungry," smiled Aline.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Me too," said Philip, lifting her gaily to her feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ensuing foot-race brought them up, flushed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">panting, at the entrance to the vessel.

The excitable valet now rushed to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell cord, and, at his nervous but vigorous pulling on</seg><seg type="columnLine">its tasseled end, the clangor of the alarm was heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">pealing through the adjoining rooms that were not vis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible in the screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THIS is as good as a show," laughed Kirk as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">motley crowd of servants rushed into the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some were attired in the familiar gray with the narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripes of purple indicating their positions. Others</seg><seg type="columnLine">were scantily dressed and of disheveled appearance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All were greatly excited at sight of their master in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">unnatural position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Jennis," spoke one of the braver of the men as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he pressed a finger on the pulse of his master.

Get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doctor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ensuing confusion proved entertaining in the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treme, and the laughter of the two unsuspected wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nesses soon brought several members of the Inquisitor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">party to the laboratory. The coming of meal time had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought most of them back to the vessel, and the cool-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of its interior was a welcome relief from the swel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering and unaccustomed heat of the outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A secretary in purple had now arrived on the scene</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he quickly took charge of the situation. His first</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio vision call was for DeWolf's physicians and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">second for Jerome Carter. At the appearance of Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter's visage in the imaged disk of the distant radiovision</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument, one of Kirk's followers growled out an</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression of rage and hate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hush," said Philip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE officious and acid-tongued secretary was hus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tling the servants from the room, and the witnesses</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched in silence as he closed the door and tip-toed</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the side of the rigid figure. Observing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">array of disordered papers, he picked one of the blanks</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the desk and scanned its contents. He whistled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in surprise and hastily gathered together the remaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers and stuffed them into a compartment of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk. The physicians soon arrived and their mystifica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion over the condition of the patient brought smiles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chuckles from the watchers in the laboratory of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inquisitor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A consultation ensued, and when Carter arrived and</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned the state of affairs he grew purple with rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You confounded medical men!" he stormed. "Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">what use is your knowledge, I'd like to know ? Here is</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of our greatest men, a victim of some sort of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack, and you can't even diagnose the case.

"It</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be necessary to watch his every move for a time."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adjustments of the apparatus kept him in view</seg><seg type="columnLine">throughout the speedy journey to his headquarters office</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his private pneumatic tube car, which proved ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremely difficult for Barton to keep in focus. Carter</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered his own office in high dudgeon and rang for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretary at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Call an immediate meeting of the council," he thun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered.

"Nothing done whatso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever. We'll have the rats from below stirring up trou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble in no time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paced the floor impatiently as, one by one, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of the council were notified. By the time the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first arrivals began to appear, he was in a towering rage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he herded them into the nearby council chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">like so much cattle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen," he roared when all had assembled, "my</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders of last night to DeWolf were not carried out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we are in no better, quite probably in worse condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion than yesterday."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "DeWolf refused?" asked one of the members hope-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Refuse? He wouldn't dare!" shouted Carter. "No.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was overcome by some sort of a stroke and is still</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconscious. But our indulgence in sympathy for him</seg><seg type="columnLine">will do us no good. Another move must be planned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A HEATED discussion followed, and the listeners</seg><seg type="columnLine">on board the Inquisitor were horrified at some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blood-curdling suggestions offered by those present</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the meeting. These men appeared to be entirely de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">void of conscience where the gray-clad multitude was</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned. They spoke of wholesale slaughter of mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions of their less fortunate fellow men as callously as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would have spoken of the destruction of vermin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it was evident that the dominance of Jerome Car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter was responsible. The others were of innately softer</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature, but were transformed into the beasts they ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to be by sheer force of his brutal will.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they finally decided on a nation-wide round-up</seg><seg type="columnLine">of millions of the workers by the red police, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders to shoot to kill, Philip came to the conclusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was time for drastic action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Folks," he said, "this decision means civil war back</seg><seg type="columnLine">home.

With the appearance of the dim red</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot in the center of the table in that distant council</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber, Jerome Carter stopped short in his final tirade</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gazed unbelievingly at what he saw. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinking brilliance of the sphere materialized before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">startled eyes of the group, there were cries of surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fear. Carter jerked himself to his feet and tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to draw back from the table, but it was too late. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready had the powerful influence of the ghostly image</seg><seg type="columnLine">asserted itself, and his eyes widened in terror as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye-balls twitched and rolled in rhythm with the flick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erings of the unearthly, weaving light. When he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">his companions stiffening to immobility under the bane-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful influence, he struggled against it with all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength of his mighty will. By sheer force of that will</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had controlled the destinies of a great continent</seg><seg type="columnLine">for many a year, he edged an inch or two from the table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beads of perspiration rolled from his forehead and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cords of his neck stood forth like taut steel cables. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment it seemed that he would triumph, and Philip</seg><seg type="columnLine">increased the power. With a shuddering groan Carter</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave up the battle, and his body, stiffened like a statue</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he stood on his feet, toppled to the floor with a crash</seg><seg type="columnLine">that brought the secretaries from an adjoining room to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door with a rush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's that," said Philip, touching a button that</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused the view of the startled assistants to fade from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screen.

What have you done?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By means of an invention of mine, they have all</seg><seg type="columnLine">been cast into a coma from which it will be impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to revive them without my intervention. But they will</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain unharmed as long as they are kept supplied with</seg><seg type="columnLine">food and drink. The doctors know how to accomplish</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, so there will be no danger whatever. It had to be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">done when I detected them in a nefarious plot to spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">riot and bloodshed through the lower levels."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How long will you keep them in this state?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Until I am assured of the success or failure of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment I am now making, the success of which will</seg><seg type="columnLine">change the entire condition now existing in our coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try. I can tell you no more now. Meanwhile we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave Carter and his lieutenants asleep, and allow the</seg><seg type="columnLine">public to conjecture as it pleases."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good work, Philip," approved the President. "Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mona well?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never better, Dad. I'll let her speak with you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of the folks later."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They took their farewells, and the four men resumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their work in the laboratory, with many a chuckle at</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of the mystification of the great medical men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of the excitement of the news announcers and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzlement of the general public.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">An Unexpected Blow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RANDALL HAINES was an exceedingly clever</seg><seg type="columnLine">Secret Service officer, and his alert brain was</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused to unusual activity by the news of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange and unprecedented illness which had attacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jerome Carter and his associates. He turned the prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lem over and over in his mind, and, for some unac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countable reason, could not keep his thoughts from as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sociating Philip Barton with the bizarre occurrence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Philip Barton was dead. He had, with his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, seen the Inquisitor plunge beneath the tossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves of the Atlantic. Barton's vessel had not reap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared, and the locating later of the packing case which</seg><seg type="columnLine">floated to the surface seemed certain proof.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But was it? Philip Barton was infernally clever, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasoned, and it was just possible that by some means</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had staged a fake accident and in some manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">escaped. President Haven did not seem to be taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loss of his daughter as much to heart as might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected, though the family had taken to mourning and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rarely seen in public.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Try as he might, he could not rid his mind of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicion that, somehow, somewhere, Philip Barton</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still in the land of the living, and that by the use</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some secret invention of his, he had accomplished the</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible and caused the striking down of Jerome</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carter and his council. If this were the case, it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear-cut job for the Secret Service, and Randall Haines</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed no authority to proceed against Barton at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own discretion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without consulting any of his men, he made a secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip to the executive mansion. He was passed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">guards without question, since they were men of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own force, and soon found a hiding place behind heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">drapes in Haven's own dining-room. Patiently he</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited through the long period when the servants were</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged in the setting of the table for the evening meal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were to be no guests, he deduced from the num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of places set, and he gloated over the fact, for this</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured him that Haven would talk freely with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">family.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the President entered the room with Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haven on his arm, Haines scrutinized their features</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully from his hiding place. The calm dignity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haven's face gave him no clue, nor did the quiet re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve of the first lady of the land. But when the young-</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARTON'S ISLAND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">409</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">est daughter entered, she was playfully jesting with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brother, Ross junior, and his suspicions were imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately aroused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first course having been served, the President</seg><seg type="columnLine">addressed his butler, who stood conveniently close to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his high-backed chair. "Parker," he said, "you may</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the room until I ring. We have private affairs to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discuss."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haines hugged himself in anticipation as the butler</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, and, at the first words of the President, he gloated</seg><seg type="columnLine">inwardly at the confirmation of his suspicions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Philip talked with me today," was his quiet state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He did?" replied Mrs. Haven joyfully. "Are they</seg><seg type="columnLine">all right?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. And he is going to talk with us later and let</seg><seg type="columnLine">us speak with Mona through this marvelous invention</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his that requires neither transmitter nor receiver at</seg><seg type="columnLine">our end of the ether circuit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Frances and her brother jabbered excited comments</seg><seg type="columnLine">until it was necessary for their father to reprove them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Please allow me to continue," he said. "It will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">of much interest to all of you to know that Philip is</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible for the strange illness of Carter and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">associates. But you must not speak of this to anyone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How on earth did he do it, father?" asked the son.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have not the slightest idea," was the response, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">we may learn more from him this evening."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RANDALL HAINES had heard more than enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he withdrew from his position, cautiously</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeding through the darkness of the adjoining sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, until he reached the passage which connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the main entrance to the apartments. He encoun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered none of the servants and was passed from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance by one of his own men, to whom he gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders of silence and a warning that he would return</seg><seg type="columnLine">within an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With all possible speed he hurried to the storerooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the department, where he searched rapidly for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument he had not used for years, a portable direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion finder. He had some little difficulty in locating it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but finally emerged triumphant with a small black box</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his arm. It was a short trip back to the execu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive living apartments, but the public car in the pneu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic tube seemed abnormally slow. When he greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the operative at the entrance, it lacked just five minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hour he had mentioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sensing that something of importance was afoot, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">operative had kept tabs on the movements of the Presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent and his family, and he advised his superior that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were in the drawing-room. He further assisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him by pointing out a circuitous route to a small room,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which Haines could observe and listen with com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This proved to be an alcove separated from the draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing-room by portieres similar to those behind which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had secreted himself at dinner time. It was dimly il-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminated by a small amount of light that filtered be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the drapes from the larger room and it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of but a minute to set up the instrument he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought and to get it in operating position. Then he sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly by, listening to the desultory conversation of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Havens and awaiting his chance of checking up on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All unsuspecting Haines' espionage, the Haven</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">family discussed the matter in detail, even mentioning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that Philip and Mona were on an island in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantic Ocean. Of course, they themselves had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge of its location, but the direction finder would</seg><seg type="columnLine">solve that. They spoke of the presence of Kirk Paul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son and his companions with the exiles, who had sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posedly been lost ac sea. Haines congratulated himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">more and more on his astuteness and on the coup he</seg><seg type="columnLine">now saw he could make. His thoughts of the rewards</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would be his when Jerome Carter recovered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned of his invaluable services proved so alluring</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he lost himself in contemplation of the honor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth that would come to him thereby. So engrossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was he in his own day dreams, that he lost much of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation in the next room, and he was startled from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his reverie by the sudden realization that Philip Bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton's voice had joined those of the President's family.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, yes, Dad," were the first words that impressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, "Mona is right here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hello, folks," then came the voice of the eldest</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Randall Haines was forced to admire the inventive</seg><seg type="columnLine">genius of the man who had made this perfect two-way</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation possible through the ether with apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">functioning at only one end of the circuit. But he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not delay in getting his direction finder in operation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he soon had seven readings that checked within a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small fraction of a degree with each other. This work</seg><seg type="columnLine">completed, he listened to the remainder of the conver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation, but it was entirely of a personal nature, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned nothing more of value. He made his way out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same way he had entered and was soon on his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his own offices, where he planned to spend the night</seg><seg type="columnLine">in preparation for an expedition against Barton.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His first move on reaching his office was to get out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large chart and to plot thereon the course indicated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the readings of his direction finder. To his surprise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this missed the coasts of both South America and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Africa, extending into the Antarctic in a southeasterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction, missing all charted islands on its way, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearest to the line being Ascension and St. Helena</seg><seg type="columnLine">islands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is peculiar," he said to himself. They dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinctly said that Barton was on some distant island. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must ask the advice of Paul Ott. He is an authority</seg><seg type="columnLine">on geography."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He soon had his friend on the radio and asked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to visit him at once in his office. This request being-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acceded to, he loafed in his chair, puffing vigorously at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his old black pipe, and turning over in his mind a plan</seg><seg type="columnLine">to set forth in the morning to locate and arrest Barton</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his party.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Paul Ott arrived, the two men bent over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chart, and the newcomer followed with his finger the</seg><seg type="columnLine">penciled line that Haines had traced on it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why," said his friend, when his finger reached a</seg><seg type="columnLine">point almost directly south of Ascension Island, "if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are looking for an island on this course, there is one</seg><seg type="columnLine">just about here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it is uncharted," objected Haines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I know it is. It is unnamed, too. But, in the year</seg><seg type="columnLine">2172, a pilot on one of the Cape Town-to-Pernambuco</seg><seg type="columnLine">air liners observed a seething in the ocean below his</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel at this point and slowed down to investigate. An</seg><seg type="columnLine">island of considerable size had been pushed above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface by subterranean volcanic action, and the inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">410</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nal fires were being extinguished by the inpouring of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ocean. The spectacle proved to be so stupendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">and awe-inspiring that his vessel was delayed two hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">by requests of the passengers, who wanted to remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">to watch this exhibition of nature's creative handi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But would this island be habitable now?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Undoubtedly," replied his friend. "It was visited</seg><seg type="columnLine">by explorers several times before the great war and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">reported as having cooled off. However, the war pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vented further visits, and there have been no later ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I know of on account of the conditions that have</seg><seg type="columnLine">since existed in world relations. But by this time it</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be covered with vegetation and, though its cli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate is likely to be quite hot, it should not be a bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">place for adventurous humans to find a place of</seg><seg type="columnLine">refuge."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eureka!" cried Randall Haines. "The very place</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a man of Barton's caliber would choose. He, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all men, has probably visited this island before, and I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">wager my next month's credit that we shall find him</seg><seg type="columnLine">there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*********</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT daybreak the following day a sleek, speedy</seg><seg type="columnLine">patrol ship of the Secret Service took the air, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it were Randall Haines and twenty picked men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the service. Being a captain and having great discre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionary powers, he was enabled to set forth on this ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedition without consulting his superiors, and was thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to keep his mission an entire secret. And his ela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion at the opportunity of obtaining a new feather for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cap was unbounded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hour after hour the helmsman kept to the course</seg><seg type="columnLine">prescribed by Haines and, after six hours of travel at</seg><seg type="columnLine">high altitude, the patrol ship neared the island on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barton and his little group had taken refuge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here we are," exulted Haines as he made out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny speck on the surface of the ocean which marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the position of the unnamed island. "That's Barton's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Island below."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the name was to attach itself permanently to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small body of land and was to become famous in</seg><seg type="columnLine">history.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The patrol vessel slowly circled about, dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually from its great altitude until within a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet of the shiny bulk of the Inquisitor. Randall</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haines could scarcely contain himself with joy at sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the yacht, and he instructed his pilot to make as</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick a landing as possible. His ship was thus brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a sudden, somewhat jarring stop on the surface of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocky plateau only a few hundred feet from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inquisitor. He was the first to step from his vessel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his men followed in haste with their weapons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready and prepared for any emergency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was no sign of life from Barton's vessel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Haines and his men advanced cautiously toward its</seg><seg type="columnLine">open door. When they were within fifty feet of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance there was a shout from behind, and Haines</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheeled in his tracks to observe a party of about ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and women, two of them in purple, the rest in</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray. This party was advancing from the direction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crater and its members were unarmed as far as</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Halt!" shouted Haines, menacing the leader with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand weapon, which was capable of firing either</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">explosive bullets or the expanding flexible binders that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were used for capturing a victim and rendering him</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless without serious injury.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom Easton advanced a step and Haines recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">him at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Easton," he ordered, "remain where you stand. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrest you all in the name of. the law. Tell your com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions to throw down any weapons they may have."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We have none," replied Tom haughtily, "and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">law of United North America does not reach to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">island."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes it does, Easton," said Haines. "I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken formal possession of it in the name of our Gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment. This island is unclaimed by other powers."</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the corner of his eye Tom Easton observed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirk Paulson watched the proceedings from the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Inquisitor for a moment, then withdrew hastily</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the interior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, Haines," he said quietly, "we surrender."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's Barton?" asked his captor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Somewhere about the island," answered Tom eva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sively. "We surrender, but don't think for a minute that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll aid you in locating and capturing our leader."</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of the girls in gray started sobbing and Jack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sterns stepped to her side to comfort her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep your places now," ordered Haines. Then to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his men: "Bind them, boys."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His men advanced on the group and, despite some</seg><seg type="columnLine">little struggling on the part of the men, soon had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire party bound hand and foot and seated on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard rocks. Tom Easton, suspecting that Jack Sterns</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about to let loose on their captors with some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strongest words in his vocabulary, hissed in his ear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to convey to him the knowledge that those</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the Inquisitor were aware of the state of affairs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The news somehow passed throughout the group, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of the captives remained quiet, giving the appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of submitting with humility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*********</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN the laboratory of the Inquisitor were the remain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing members of the Barton party, Philip and Kirk</seg><seg type="columnLine">having been at work on the mysterious experiment on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which so much depended. Aline and Mona had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">assisting also, though their help consisted mostly of</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing sprightly comments, which in nowise bothered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the workers. When Kirk returned from his visit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entrance door and advised them of the coming of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the patrol ship and the capture of the other members of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their party, there was consternation for a moment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then Philip burst forth:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Randall Haines!" he exclaimed. "Confound him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his spying. He has located us with a direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">finder as sure as you are alive. But we'll fix him!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He rushed to the projectoscope and replaced on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform the crystal sphere which had been removed</seg><seg type="columnLine">during some of their experiments. The apparatus was</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon in operation and, at the screen of the detectoscope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philip rapidly manipulated the controls until he had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of the immediate outside. Randall Haines and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his entire party had turned toward the Inquisitor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were advancing in close formation to its entrance. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a moment too soon the image of the sphere materialized</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the very doorstep of the vessel, and Haines drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in alarm as his eyes were smitten by its dazzling</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors, twinkling with vivid brilliancy even in the bright</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunlight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARTON'S ISLAND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">411</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What devilment is this?" ejaculated the captain of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Secret Service squad in alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Philip increased the power rapidly and, in a few sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onds, his enemies were stretched lifeless on the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A great cheer was raised by the prisoners, and Mona</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Aline hugged each other in their glee. Philip and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kirk rushed to the outside, followed by the two women.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If was the work of but a few minutes to release the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captives, and then Philip turned his attention to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifeless forms of their enemies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Some fine material for our experiments," he com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented, "especially Haines. Let us carry them inside."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The twenty men who had accompanied Haines on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip to the island were carried to beds in various state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms of the Inquisitor and there left to remain in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupor until Philip chose to release them. But Randall</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haines was carried to the laboratory and his body was</seg><seg type="columnLine">straightened to a prone position on the operating table.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Philip," said Mona, "you're not going to hurt him ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No indeed, dear," replied her spouse. "If my ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periment works, I am going to make a good citizen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. If it does not, he will not be harmed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A small replica of the projectoscope tower that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been erected alongside the Inquisitor was wheeled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the operating table and its short tube was</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung around on the trunnions until the blunt end was</seg><seg type="columnLine">directed toward the back of Haines' head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The apparatus on which they had been working was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily looked over and, at a nod of approval from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philip, Kirk connected a pair of cables from the jumble</seg><seg type="columnLine">of instruments on the long table to the end of the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectoscope tube opposite the subject. A small motor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">generator hummed merrily beneath the table at a touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a switch, and the row of vacuum tubes along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall lighted with their purple glow. A series of black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">and-white keys like those of a piano were arranged be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the condensers and inductances that were massed</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the lighted tubes, and Philip ran his fingers ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perimentally along these. In swift alternation the vac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uum tubes responded with flashes of increased bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liancy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Okay, Kirk," he said, and Kirk pulled the switch</seg><seg type="columnLine">that set the air of the entire room vibrating with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">high frequency waves emitted from that harmless-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearing tube that was trained on the recumbent</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure of Randall Haines. An aura surrounded the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the subject, a hazy purplish light that hid his shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">of curly black hair in a weird mist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a cross-section chart of a human brain on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall near the instrument and many notations had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been made opposite various sections of the pictured</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray matter. Philip scanned this chart closely as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran his fingers over the piano-like keys. The vibrating</seg><seg type="columnLine">air of the laboratory changed its rate continuously with</seg><seg type="columnLine">throbbing pulsations that followed the movements of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philip's careful fingers. All those in the room watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">in breathless wonder as Philip seemed like one inspired.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he ceased his movements and turned to the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject with a thoughtful look in his eyes. Glancing once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more at the chart, he pulled the switch and, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">resulting slowing down of the motor-generator, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete silence fell in the laboratory. The cessation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throbbing pulsations, which had set the ear-drums</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the watchers singing, left a queer echoing silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">that left them all mute. The still figure on the operat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing table remained as rigid as before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All finished," said Philip solemnly. "Now we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaken him and learn whether we were successful or</seg><seg type="columnLine">not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">         A Successful Operation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PHILIP placed a stethoscope on Haines' breast</seg><seg type="columnLine">and listened intently for a moment, then smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">his satisfaction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Heart perfectly normal," he sai&lt;fy</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But what do you hope has been accomplished in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment?" asked Jack Sterns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The remainder of the group hung on Philip's words</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jack," he said, "and I might as well tell the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, now that I think I have been successful, it is my</seg><seg type="columnLine">belief that we have just altered the brain of Randall</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haines in those portions controlling his sense of values</seg><seg type="columnLine">of right and wrong, his conscience, and his morals. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been known for centuries that, in a person of crimi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nal tendencies, there is an abnormality of the brain. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">has thus been customary to perform surgical operations</seg><seg type="columnLine">on these diseased brains and thereby restore the crimi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nal to normality and transform him into a useful citi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zen. But these operations have always been performed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by actually cutting into, certain portions of the brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">and removing irritating objects, abscesses and the like,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in no cases have they been performed on other than</seg><seg type="columnLine">actual criminals or insane persons. My invention,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I shall call the psycho-convertor, is intended to</seg><seg type="columnLine">perform such operations bloodlessly and painlessly by</seg><seg type="columnLine">subjecting the involved portions of the brain to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">action of high frequency electrical vibrations of a heal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and vitalizing nature. These rays penetrate like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the X-ray and, by setting the brain cells in rapid oscilla-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, can produce complete changes of their structure</seg><seg type="columnLine">and functions. If we are successful, we shall find that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Randall Haines is an entirely different person when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">returns to consciousness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wonderful! Astounding! Revolutionary!" were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the comments that greeted this announcement, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire party gathered closely about the operating table</seg><seg type="columnLine">to observe the next move to be made by the great in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stand back a bit, folks," warned Philip. "If this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing is not a success, you may come to personal harm</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he awakens. And it is a very simple matter to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring him around."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The group drew back a few feet and Philip wheeled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the side of the operating table a small stand on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was mounted a small glass bulb with several pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jections to which wires were attached in much the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner as on an X-ray tube. This was adjusted so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surface of the cathode presented an angle of forty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five degrees to the head of the patient, and when Philip</seg><seg type="columnLine">set its energizer working, there was a slight crackling</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound from the vicinity of the tube, but no visible rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">emanated from it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RANDALL HAINES stirred slightly, then opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">one eye at a time and looked dazedly at the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling overhead. Suddenly he sat erect with a quick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquiring glance about the room. He peered into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of his erstwhile enemy, Philip Barton, and his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wreathed in a friendly smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Barton," he said, "I have been entirely wrong in</seg><seg type="columnLine">412</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">making this trip to capture you. In fact, I have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong for years in my feeling toward you. If you can</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgive me, I wish you would give me your hand."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Gladly," said Philip, extending his hand and grip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping that of Haines in a friendly squeeze. "How do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you feel, old man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great!" replied Haines, springing from the table to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor and surveying the astounded group. "Never</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt better in my life, Barton. But what on earth have</seg><seg type="columnLine">you done to me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Philip smiled enigmatically. "I'm sorry, old man; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was necessary to hypnotize you and your followers in</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-defense," he said. "But I am glad you are taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in this manner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haines looked puzzled for a moment. "Perfectly all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right," he said. "You did the only thing you could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">humanely. You should have handled us far more</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly. But I can't understand whatever possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to persecute you all these years and to embark on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this foolhardy expedition. Why--why--I must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been crazy. And Carter--Jerome Carter--how could I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have adhered to him for so long? At last I have come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my senses, and I swear I shall make things up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Philip glanced in the direction of his friends with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinctly warning look. They understood that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to say nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Randall Haines laughed aloud. "Then this is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same thing you did to Carter and his council?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," grinned Philip, "and I'll awaken them all in</seg><seg type="columnLine">good time. Meanwhile we should awaken your com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions. Can you guarantee their friendliness to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">followers?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Absolutely," said Haines. "They will obey my</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders implicitly, and I'll confess my error and call</seg><seg type="columnLine">them off at once."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haines' men were brought singly to the operating</seg><seg type="columnLine">table and individually subjected to the action of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">resuscitation tube. In the case of each man a few words</seg><seg type="columnLine">were spoken in private by Haines and instructions given</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarding their future conduct toward Barton and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">party. When the last man was restored to normal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their leader gave them a talk concerning the action that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been taken by Barton against Carter and the mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers of his council. Philip and his friend exchanged</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering glances at the evidence of so complete a</seg><seg type="columnLine">change in the attitude of Randall Haines. He had actu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally become a champion of the cause of the gray-clad</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitude and held forth in much the manner of one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own number at home, with the exception that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke even more boldly. And his change of heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the dictator was a revelation. He swore that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would devote every effort toward assisting in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rehabilitation of the Republic of United North America</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a true republic and in the overthrow of the dictator-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship of Carter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he had finished, his men expressed their</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement in no uncertain terms, but agreed that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was much in what he had said, and that they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">support any action that promised success, since they be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved that his words were frank statements of truth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That some of them were thinkers was evident from</seg><seg type="columnLine">comments they made, but it was equally evident that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they shared the general lackadaisical viewpoint of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearers of the purple and were, on general principles,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">content to let things remain as they were, provided they</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves continued in their present positions of favor</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the power behind the administration. It was, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, clear to all that they were cognizant of the injus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tice of existing conditioi^ and would prove friendly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wearers of the gray, provided the power of Carter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his council was in some manner overcome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The entire proceedings were a revelation to all of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inquisitor's party, and more especially to Kirk's fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowers, who had been brought up with the idea that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearers of the purpl? were their implacable hereditary</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*********</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN the Secret Service squad left the Inquisi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor to explore the island, some of them walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm and arm with members of Barton's party, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not long before extremely friendly relations were estab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lished. Philip called Haines aside and asked him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to the laboratory and there discuss with Kirk</seg><seg type="columnLine">and himself further action to be taken with regard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the elimination of the dictatorship. Haines agreed en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thusiastically and followed Philip to the laboratory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the three made themselves comfortable, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philip expanded on his immediate plans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Haines," said Philip, "it has given me more pleasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">than I have known for many a year, to find you so com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely in sympathy-with our ideas for the alleviation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions in the lower levels of the great cities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">United North America. And, if you will align your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self with us, it will be of great advantage to the cause."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I most assuredly will, Philip," said Randall Haines</seg><seg type="columnLine">sincerely. "I don't know what it is, but there was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about that hypnotic stunt of yours that has altered</seg><seg type="columnLine">my outlook on life entirely. I feel like a new man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more at peace with my conscience than at any time since</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was a boy. What are your plans ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are really quite simple, Randall," said Philip.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The eleven men who are still in the hypnotic state</seg><seg type="columnLine">back in our country must, of course, be returned to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness. My one unalterable decision in this entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter was that no bloodshed would be countenanced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is a revolution, but there are to be no fatalities.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now I'll just ask you one question: What is your idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the outcome of the thing if, by some miracle, Jerome</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carter should experience a change of heart such as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one you have just gone through?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If he did not lose his forceful personality and tre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mendous will," replied Randall Haines, "I am confident</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the entire course of events would be altered. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe he would bend every effort toward the undoing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all harm that has been accomplished by his actions</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the past, and that he would restore the people to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">rightful heritage of true liberty and freedom and sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port the government in all things, to the end of benefit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing all in the country and favoring none. It would be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous change, but it is inconceivable."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not impossible, Randall," stated Philip. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">have heard of, perhaps you have even witnessed, opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions on the brains of criminals which have removed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from them forever the criminal tendencies and restored</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them normal, well-balanced organs, thus transform-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing these criminals into useful citizens. I have recently</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfected a means of performing such operations by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">use of high-frequency vibrations that act on the proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain centers and completely alter the functioning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the particular portions affected. These vibrations can</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARTON'S ISLAND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">413</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">be employed for all brain operations and do not necessi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tate cutting into the cranial cavity. I propose to return</seg><seg type="columnLine">to New York and to use my apparatus on Carter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Haines opened his eyes wide. "Is there no danger to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the patient in such a procedure ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None whatever," Philip replied. "In fact, the health</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the patient should be improved. And it is my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that if Carter is transformed into a straight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking individual, it will be unnecessary to experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment with his associates. What do you think?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think you are absolutely right, Philip. He can</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep them all in line without the slightest trouble. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">a matter of fact, I feel sure that several members of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">council will welcome the change."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is my idea also," said Philip, "and I am anx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ious to return immediately and go ahead with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can it not be done from here by means of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching and penetrating rays of the detectoscope?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked Kirk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It probably could," said Philip, "but I am afraid to</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance it in so important a case. We will experiment</seg><seg type="columnLine">later along those lines, but not on human beings until</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is absolute certainty of success. The human brain</seg><seg type="columnLine">is an exceedingly delicate organ, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It beats me, Philip," interjected Haines admiringly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"how you are able to accomplish such unheard-of things</seg><seg type="columnLine">one after another in quick succession. And now that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am in your laboratory, I am very curious. For one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, I should like to know how on earth you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been able to converse with your friends and relatives</seg><seg type="columnLine">at home and how you put Carter and his gang to sleep</seg><seg type="columnLine">from this far-off point."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PHILIP laughed and consulted his watch. "I'll tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">you what we'll do, Randall," he said. "It's quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">early in the day here, but it is mid-afternoon now in</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York. We'll start for home at once, so as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrive there in the early evening. You remain on board</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Inquisitor and allow the pilot to return the patrol</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel to its own berth. On the journey I'll demon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strate my latest inventions; those that have permitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to accomplish the things you have mentioned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What do you say ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nothing would please me better," said Haines, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes shining in anticipation like a boy's. '"The sooner</seg><seg type="columnLine">the better."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a go," said Philip, starting at once for the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors, where he set up a call for all members of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">party to return to the vessel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They hurried in from all directions and, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">help of Randall Haines and his squad, it was a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">job to dismantle the projectoscope tower and stow its</seg><seg type="columnLine">sections away in the compartments of the Inquisitor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Haines gave his men their orders and they returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the patrol ship, which was soon ready for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">return trip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Philip checked up on his own party and found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all were present with the exception of Kirk and Aline.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Kirk, Kirk!" he called.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Coming!" came an answering voice from the rim of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crater, and the sheepishly smiling face of the tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man in gray came into view as he tugged at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aline's hand and assisted her to the level surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plateau.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I went to find Aline," he explained as they ap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">proached the grinning group at the entrance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Inquisitor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So I see," laughed Philip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aline spoke up brightly and unabashed. "Kirk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have just become engaged," she announced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great stuff, Aline," said Pl^p, grasping her hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turning to the embarrassed Kirk.

Each was</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined to be known as the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">American seat of learning. For years the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rich men of each metropolis had competed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with each other in the endowments that they gave to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their favorite university. Famous educators from all</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts of the world had been induced, by magnificent</seg><seg type="columnLine">salaries, to come to one or the other of the two univer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sities. In fact, the cream of modern intelligence was</seg><seg type="columnLine">centered around these two schools. Had the two fac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ulties suddenly died, it would have been an absolute</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossibility to replace them by other such teachers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And not only educators were lecturing at these col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leges. Men of renown in every walk of life were giv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing courses in their specialties, and these special courses</seg><seg type="columnLine">were considered as a very great factor towards the nec-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">acted to similar stimuli. This opens vistas of possibilities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for what might not be possible when this apparatus is per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fected and progressive experiments have been made? In this</seg><seg type="columnLine">story by Dr. Keller, who is not only a physician, but has a</seg><seg type="columnLine">record of thirteen years of psychiatric practice behind him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">also, we are allowed an absorbing glimpse into a vision of</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible future achievements. We have often wondered how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the individual's accumulated knowledge might be used.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">essary culture of the young students. Novelists, actors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">poets, economists, politicians, explorers, all were ea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerly sought, the two schools bidding against each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the right to claim them as members of their respec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive faculties.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tremendous funds available at each city made</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible contracts with these men, lasting throughout</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lifetime. Their intellectual efforts were literally</seg><seg type="columnLine">sold, completely and permanently, till the day of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">death, and even after their death their salaries were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue as long as any dependents survived them. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">many years this effort of each city university to secure</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the very best intellects in the world continued; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to an end only when every noted educator, scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tist, or expert in literature had a permanent contract</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the one school or the other. The conflict ceased</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a while because of lack of material to fight over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">414</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Revolt of the Pedestrians,'' etc., etc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Kternal Professors</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">               By David H. Keller, M.D.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the lull came, it is only the truth to say, look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the schools from an unbiased viewpoint, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two faculties were rather evenly matched. Each had</seg><seg type="columnLine">over two hundred supermen, who daily lectured to large</seg><seg type="columnLine">classes of enthusiastic students. Each city claimed its</seg><seg type="columnLine">college as the greatest in the world, and the rivalry</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been beneficial and mutually inspiring had</seg><seg type="columnLine">it not been for an unfortunate enthusiasm on the part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some of the New Yorkers, which resulted in the seri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous injury and final death of several of the most bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liant of the Chicago professors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The friendly contest at once degenerated into a bitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">internecine warfare. The University of New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressed its regret at the unfortunate happening, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Chicago University scorned the apologies. All re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lations between the two schools ceased, and the contest</seg><seg type="columnLine">to secure the highest enrollment was more determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ever. It was now not a question of lowering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuition rate, but of actually subsidizing students to leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">one city and seek their education at the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This condition lasted for a year. The feeling was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense, but it was hoped, by the cooler minds, that ulti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mately the bitterness would disappear. Then, like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden dawn in the tropics, a catastrophe struck the</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York faculty. For a while the cause was as mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terious as it was damaging to the future hopes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eastern university. Within a few weeks practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">every member of the teaching force of the New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">university developed the preliminary symptoms of ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lignant cancer. So uniform was this occurrence, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">simultaneous was it in its development, that only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">conclusion could be reached by the medical men of New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York who were in charge of the secret investigation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were sure that, in some way, the entire faculty</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been inoculated with the deadly germs. Then one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the doctors remembered that a month before, practi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally every member of the faculty had been present at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a banquet given in honor of the president of the uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versity. It must have been that the unsuspecting diners</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been fed some unknown germ then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was truly an unknown type of cancer cell, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">resulting disease was also absolutely new to medical</seg><seg type="columnLine">science. The trouble started in the feet and, while it</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not at once disable the victim, there was every indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cation that it would prove fatal within a few months.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though it seemed to resemble, in some details, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant celled sarcoma, it had certain characteristics that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were different, certain peculiarities that made it par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticularly hopeless to the New York scientists. It was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a threatening danger that spelled doom to the future</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes of the wonderful university. Unless something</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be done, unless this deadly danger was success-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully fought by every form of ultra-scientific medicine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and surgery, then not only would these two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">men die, but with them would die the greatness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metropolitan seat of learning. This faculty could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be replaced, and Chicago would at once leap to the fore</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the most important seat of learning in the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The work of patient years would be set at naught, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts of a generation would be obliterated in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">months.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professors told of their fate and faced the inevi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">table with the calmness that might be expected of phi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">losophers and scientists. Feeling confident that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no souls, they viewed with disdain the certain dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution of the bodies which housed the nerve cells,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, when functioning, enabled them to think. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that if the most celebrated surgeons and physicians</seg><seg type="columnLine">in New York said that they were doomed, it was useless</seg><seg type="columnLine">for them to worry. Their dependents were provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, their memory was certain to be preserved in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sacred archives of the college library. They, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">made education a vital force in New York, now needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no other monument. In a few weeks the summer vaca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion would begin, and they all felt that they would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to finish their lectures. During the summer vaca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion they could dictate their memoirs and prepare to die</seg><seg type="columnLine">like gentlemen. The only thing they had to worry about</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the fact that they were not sure as to what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dying of, or what part, if any, the University of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago played in the tragic happening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A mantle of silence was spread over the entire mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. No man who could not be trusted was allowed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">partake of the secret. The faculty had decided that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would die without giving Chicago the satisfaction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of knowing that they were dying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">COINCIDENT with this tragedy, a remarkable visi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor came to America. He was none other than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Chenenko of Leningrad. For many years</seg><seg type="columnLine">this biologist and vivisectionist had been working in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory, allowing the world to remain in ignorance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his efforts. His obscurity was not a deliberate con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cealment on his part, but was simply due to the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been so intensely interested in his lifework.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now he had reached the point at which it was not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary for him to have more help; he also needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">far greater financial assistance than he possibly could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">415</seg><seg type="columnLine">416</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">secure in Russia. He had come from Russia to Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ica because America, especially New York City, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought by all the world to be the great center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">unused wealth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thanks to his very creditable letters of introduction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was at once granted an interview with the President</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the New Y'ork university. That gentleman was glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">to spend some time with the celebrated visitor from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Russia, in spite of the fact that he was very busy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pre-commencement work, in addition to being</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly worried over the calamity that had befallen his</seg><seg type="columnLine">co-workers. Chenenko lost no time in giving his rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons for leaving his native land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Honored sir," he began, "I need money--lots of</seg><seg type="columnLine">money--and many learned scientists for my students.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I need a large place to work in, with very expensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus. If you give me all this, I shall be glad to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay here the rest of my life in your so remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">university. Otherwise I am compelled to go to the far-</seg><seg type="columnLine">west city of Chicago."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will not have to go to Chicago!" replied Presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent Jacob Hubler in a very decided and emphatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner. "Tell me what line of work you are doing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the variety of research, and I will do everything in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">power to assist you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In answer, the Russian went into the most minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">details, describing the work of his lifetime. At the end,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Hubler was dazed, but convinced. At least,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was willing to give the biologist his opportunity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeed or fail. Success, he knew, would be an eternal</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumph for New York over the entire intellectual</seg><seg type="columnLine">world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All that summer Professor Chenenko and a group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greatest surgeons in the East worked with feverish</seg><seg type="columnLine">haste. Enormous laboratories were hastily constructed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Conference after conference was held. Meantime pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor after professor left, apparently for the summer</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> September finally came. The University of New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York opened, as usual, to a greater number of students</seg><seg type="columnLine">than had ever before matriculated. Classes were at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once started. The professors, capped and gowned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all seated in their respective classrooms, lecturing</seg><seg type="columnLine">more brilliantly than ever. Junior professors circulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the university, assisting with the scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, holding quizzes and helping backward pupils.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was every evidence that this would be the great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est year in the educational history of New York. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">statisticians pointed with pride to the fact that the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rollment in the Eastern city was three thousand more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than in Chicago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*********</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A SMALL group of men gathered in a Chicago</seg><seg type="columnLine">hotel bedroom. The room had been secretly se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lected on purpose for this meeting. A multi-millionaire</seg><seg type="columnLine">and two scientists were present. The captain of indus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">try looked, and was, thoroughly "hard-boiled." With-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out mincing words, he began:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen, when I spend a million dollars, I expect</seg><seg type="columnLine">results. All that I can see that has happened in the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight months is this. Instead of New York having one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand more pupils than Chicago, as in former years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she has three thousand more. All the professors are</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, more keenly intellectual than ever; there is a spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of success throughout the entire New York faculty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they are boasting that they have Chicago on the run</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at last. Meanwhile, you two men have my million dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars. What about it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something-went wrong," replied one of the men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">''You know that we performed that experiment on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen dogs. Then we tried it on those three men, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every case the sarcoma killed in three months. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that every New York professor, including Presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent Hubler, was thoroughly infected on the night of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the banquet. Everyone ate heartily of the sweetbread</seg><seg type="columnLine">patties that evening, and we had enough sarcoma cells</seg><seg type="columnLine">in them to kill a thousand men. And we know this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of those men actually developed sarcoma ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lignanta. Our detectives assured us of that. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">these two hundred men disappeared as soon as college</seg><seg type="columnLine">was over in June and when the fall term opened, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of them was absent from his lecture room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something happened. It is unreasonable to suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all of them escaped infection. It is more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely that most of them developed this sarcoma. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiments show that once the infection occurs, it is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopeless case. The tumor travels upward from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet till it kills."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The millionaire frowned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Meantime not a word from them to indicate that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they suspect foul play?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not a word. Everything is as fine as can be. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">f&amp;ct, they have even gone so far as to offer the Chicago</seg><seg type="columnLine">University fifty post-graduate courses free of charge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is a crowning insult. As if Chicago could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnish its own post-graduate courses!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then all I get for my million is failure?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is not our fault," answered the third man, shrug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging his shoulders. "We did our best. They were just</seg><seg type="columnLine">too clever for us. Probably they discovered a curative</seg><seg type="columnLine">serum."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you told me there was no cure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We do not know of any."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And there the matter rested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rivalry between the two universities went on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in some way, for some intangible reason, the New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York university gradually assumed the lead in educa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional matters. Within ten years many of the profes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sors at the Chicago university began to show the signs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of old age. Their mentality was no longer capable of</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbing, valuating and lecturing on the new facts</seg><seg type="columnLine">constantly being discovered. The new generation</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed strangely lacking in educational initiative, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">compared with the older men. It was a peculiar cir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumstance, however, that the advance of old age did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to affect the faculty of the Eastern city. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">men grew more brilliant than ever. Neither did age</seg><seg type="columnLine">wither nor did time effect decay; the faculty seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live on in perpetual vigor, constantly increasing in bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liancy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain of industry from Chicago was defeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not depressed. He was more determined than ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">to place his beloved university ahead of the Eastern</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat of learning. Accustomed to solve difficult ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions in the business world, he was eager to attack the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown problems in this inter-city rivalry. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one point that he could not solve:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">WHY DID THE PROFESSORS OF CHICAGO</seg><seg type="columnLine">GROW OLD WHILE THE NEW YORK PRO-</seg><seg type="columnLine">FESSORS REMAINED YOUNG?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That question kept the capitalist in a state of neu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotic insomnia. He consulted every noted physician</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ETERNAL PROFESSORS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">417</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and scientist in the Mississippi Valley. Not one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them was able to give him a sensible or reasonable an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer. So, in despair, he determined to investigate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter himself. He called into his service the head of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a world-famous detective bureau and told him to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">just what the difference was in the lives of the two sets</seg><seg type="columnLine">of teachers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took only a short month to secure a report. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed that the New York men lived in seclusion in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the university buildings. All of them, including the</seg><seg type="columnLine">president, were curiously separated from their fami-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lies. They took no exercise; they seemed to save in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every way their physical strength. They lectured in</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, even tones. Always they were seated and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">made no gestures. The students were never allowed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go near them or visit them. All special work was done</seg><seg type="columnLine">by lesser members of the faculty. These old members</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the faculty had, for ten years, refused invitations to</seg><seg type="columnLine">all banquets, had never taken any part in politics, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were absolutely unavailable for public speaking. Evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently, they were leading abnormal lives, which, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">very anti-social, still enabled them to perform their col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">legiate duties in a very efficient manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The most interesting part of the report was their</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner of study. It was discovered that reading stands</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been constructed which held the books at a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venient distance from the eyes. When one of the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessors wished to read, an assistant placed a book on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this stand and slowly turned the pages. It appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the readers never lifted a hand to personally turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a new leaf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL this information simply gave the Chicago mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">&gt;â  lionaire more bills to pay and more inexplicable</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts to think over. To do him full justice, it must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that he approached the problem in a systematic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">logical manner. These New York men were retaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">their youth and mental vigor while the Chicago men</seg><seg type="columnLine">were growing old. The financier ascertained a variety</seg><seg type="columnLine">of facts about the Eastern men. The great, outstand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ones were that they refused absolutely to take any</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical exercise or to indulge in any social activity</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart from the classroom, and it even appeared that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given up family life, remaining in seclusion in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">university. With this difference to explain, the rich</seg><seg type="columnLine">man from the West called in the aid of the most noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">authority on geriatrics, or the diseases of old age.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a most peculiar circumstance, Mr. Bowlers,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed Dr. Caruth. "Following the receipt of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter, I went to New York and, as far as I could, with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out arousing comment and criticism, I looked over those</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. I heard some of them lecture. They seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be mentally alert and in the best of health, but I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw men that were so nearly motionless. They change</seg><seg type="columnLine">their facial expression while talking, they move their</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyeballs and wink, but beyond that, they are immobile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just like statues. There is certainly something very</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar about it--but I can assure you of one thing;</seg><seg type="columnLine">those men have a surprising mentality for their age,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they look much younger than they really are. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never thought that complete muscular inertia was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneficial thing; in fact, I have always advised my old</seg><seg type="columnLine">people to move around and take exercise. Perhaps I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wrong. The surprising point is the ability of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">university to induce two hundred men of such brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental prowess to lead lives of such complete isolation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">If they are doing this out of devotion to the university,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is the most wonderful example of group sacrifice for</seg><seg type="columnLine">education that I have ever heard of."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The situation was indeed a peculiar one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Put yourself in their place, Dr. Caruth," said Peter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bowlers. "Would you lead that kind of a life unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">you were forced to?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I certainly would not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you suppose the^ are being coerced ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly not all of them--not two hundred intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gent men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then, why are they doing it ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then the private secretary brought in a radio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gram from New York. Bowlers opened it impatiently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he swore as he exclaimed:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you make of this, Dr. Caruth? This is</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the head of my detective agency. He says that</seg><seg type="columnLine">those New York men are acting the way they are be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause they cannot do anything else. He believes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">something is wrong with their bodies. Has positive</seg><seg type="columnLine">proof that their hands are made out of something like</seg><seg type="columnLine">wax."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fairy tales f"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe so.

Come with me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't leave my patients; wish I could."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just as soon as one of the fastest planes in the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">could carry him, Peter Bowlers went to New York and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at once closeted with the detective who had sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the radiogram.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is all true, Mr. Bowlers," the detective said ear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nestly. "We believe that those professors are there</seg><seg type="columnLine">because they cannot move. They are closely guarded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but our student-detectives, wearing very strong eye-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses, have been working on the problem from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">viewpoint. Most of the professors wear gloves all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, but those who are without gloves have hands that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to be made out of something like wax; and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have bodies, those bodies are very insensitive. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were able, in a few cases, to stick pins into them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was absolutely no reaction. Those men just sit</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, twenty-four hours a day, as far as we can tell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We established an observation point in an overhead</seg><seg type="columnLine">garret, and we have had men at the peep-hole for over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred hours steady, and the professor under ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">servation has never moved."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peter Bowlers took the detective by the shoulder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook him roughly as he whispered:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen to me, man! I am worth over two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">million. You solve this mystery, if it takes the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount to pay your bribes or any other expenses. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out what is wrong with those men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can spend anything?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Anything. The sky is the limit, and I am going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay right here till you deliver the goods."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peter Bowlers did just the thing that he threatened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do. He stayed in New York for over two weeks, eat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his heart out with desperate longing to solve the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem. Then, like an explosion, everything became</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We should have suspected it before," said the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tective. "The reason those men don't move is because</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are unable to. They just can't.

"Expect me to believe that 2</seg><seg type="columnLine">Draw your pay and quit!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it is true."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Impossible!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Absolutely true. I saw it with my own eyes. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads! That is all they have been for ten years. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a Russian come over and amputate their heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their bodies or their bodies from their heads,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whichever way would be correct; either way sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar to me. It seems those professors had some</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar form of cancer, and this Russian saved their</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives by cutting off their infected bodies. Odd? I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">say so. Then he kept the heads alive by pumping</seg><seg type="columnLine">something like blood into the arteries of their necks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pumping, or sucking, it out of their veins. Do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand? Made an artificial circulation of blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">through their heads; kept them alive and working. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pumps air through their larynx and they are able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk and give lectures. I even found that they had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">celebrated voice culturist give them special training in</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking with the new source of air.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "O course, this Russian was the brains back of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire programme. I felt that if we could secure his</seg><seg type="columnLine">private papers, we might learn something. I found a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man that could read Russian handwriting, and then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old scientist received a wire to come to Boston to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sult about a case. Of course, the patient was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our operators. Just as soon as the Russian left the city,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we got into his office, and, locking the door, went</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his papers. We found just what we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for, a private diary, giving in detail everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had done since his arrival in America. It seems that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was forced to come to America on account of lack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">funds to carry on his work. So he went to see Presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent Hubler of New York University. Here is the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">our Russian interpreter translated that part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">record:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   At last I have come to the place where I can ac-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> complish my long hoped for ambition. I now have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> friends and unlimited sources of money. More</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> money than I ever thought existed. My poverty is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> at an end. What a fine man President Hubler is!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told him I was interested in the transplantation of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> organs; that in the future the learned men who de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> veloped kidney disease would have their damaged</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> kidneys taken out and healthy organs put in. I told</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> him that only three essentials were necessary: first,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to remove the organ before actual death occurred;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> second, to keep the organ alive till we were ready to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> use it; and third, to successfully unite it with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> new body. Then I paid full honor to my dear</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> teacher, Professor Brjuckenenko, who taught me the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> cardinal points in this work. I explained that as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> early as 1929 this wonderful biologist and surgeon</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> had cut a dog's head off and had kept that head alive</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> for as long as three hours by the establishment of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> artificial circulation. That was many years ago, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> it was necessary to explain the great advance we had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> made since that time. How well I remember the ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> citement that followed Brjuckenenko's announce-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ment! George Bernard Shaw had a lengthy inter-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> view published in the Tageblatte. Shaw thought that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> it might be the means of indefinitely prolonging the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> usefulness of great men of affairs. He suggested that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> when a noted man developed a condition, like cancer,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> his head should be amputated at once and his in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> telligence be preserved for the benefit of future</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> generations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    President Hubler was greatly interested in this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He asked if I had improved my master's technique.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How strange that he thought I had worked for all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> these years without progress! I brought in my dog,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grecco, in his little coffin-like box, my wonderful</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grecco, the dog who had lived without a body for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ten years, thanks to my remarkable artificial circu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> lation and synthetic blood. I had Grecco bark and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> show pleasure when I scratched his head. The presi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> dent asked me if I could do that with a man. How</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> strange that this head of a great university has no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> imagination. If it can be done with a dog, why not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> with a man? I said, "Yes. Give me the man, and I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> will do it." He asked me if I could do it with two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> hundred men. I said, "Yes, if I have ample money</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and trained assistants." Then he told me that all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the faculty were going to die of sarcoma, and asked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> if I would take the responsibility of operating on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> them. What a wonderful thing! It will make me</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> famous forever! To save two hundred learned pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> fessors to posterity! I am to begin as soon as gradu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ation is over. In the meantime, I will at once start</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> building my apparatus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The conversation with President Hubler brought</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> out many interesting points. Fortunately, in every</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> part of the discussion I was able to satisfy him of my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ability. Especially were we interested in the effect</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> on the intelligence of these men we expected to de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> capitate. Would they retain their mental poise, in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> crease their educational ability as years passed? Or</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> would they grow old, decrepit and senile ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    We also had to discuss the matter of their talk-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ing. Wrould they be able to lecture? What change</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> would appear in their voice? I was sure that the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> supply of air could be so accurately measured and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> controlled that they would be able to talk as perfectly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> as ever. In my operations I would be sure to con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> serve the nerve that controlled the movements of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> laryngeal cords.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   How fortunate it was that I had perfected the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> manufacture of synthetic blood! What a wonderful</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> fluid that was! A fluid that performed every vital</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> function of human blood, and yet, which could be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> scientifically and accurately manufactured outside of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the body, and which could be perfectly Realised of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> all impurities every time it made one circulation of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the head. That is what is keeping Grecco so young.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I am sure that our bodyless professors will not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> grow old. I do not know how long they will live,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> but I am sure, if they are carefully guarded against</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> infections and if machinery is, oh, so constantly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> watched, that they will live on for many years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How does that sound to you, Mr. Bowlers ? Do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">still think that I am drunk? Here is a later entry</seg><seg type="columnLine">which tells how the experiment was carried on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    July, 10th.--I am busy teaching my technique to a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> dozen of the most expert surgeons that I have ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE ETERNAL PROFESSORS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">419</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> seen.

We must work</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> rapidly, for all of the two hundred heads must be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ready to lecture by Sept. 20th. Besides, the sooner</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> we free the heads from the bodies infected with sar-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> coma, the more sure we will be of their going on with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> their useful work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bowlers jumped out of his chair as he shouted:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That explains everything!

You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are probably right, but it is so absurd that no one will</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe us; so we might as well keep quiet. You bribe</seg><seg type="columnLine">your men to secrecy and keep on working. I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">come back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PETER BOWLERS went back to Chicago and lo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated the man who had performed the sarcanoma</seg><seg type="columnLine">inoculations for him eleven years ago. This man, Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Albert Johnson, was a remarkable scientist and a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">unprincipled man otherwise. He was always willing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do anything, provided there was enough money in it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had scattered cholera bacteria all over Northern</seg><seg type="columnLine">India for the Russian Government, and had no scruples</seg><seg type="columnLine">in endeavoring to kill the entire New York faculty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was more than surprised to see Bowlers. The last</seg><seg type="columnLine">interview that he had had with that man was not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very pleasant one. The rich man lost no time in telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reason for his visit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You remember that sarcoma experiment, Johnson?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well, Mr. Bowlers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I gave you a million for doing it and at the time I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that in some way you had double-crossed me.

Within a few weeks over half of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their professors died of apoplexy, and many of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who escaped death were so paralyzed that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to lecture. The death rate was alarming. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">true that the aged Chicago professors were also passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, but not at such a rapid pace. The New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">savants who remained alive were irritable, forgetful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had periods of alternating laughter and tears, swore at</seg><seg type="columnLine">their classes, began to sleep when they should have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">lecturing. Necessity forced the employment of many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the younger assistants as full professors. A large</seg><seg type="columnLine">per cent of the pupils, disgusted with the educational</seg><seg type="columnLine">facilities, left for other colleges.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day, near the time of graduation, the president of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago University received a message from the presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent of the New York college to come East for an inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">view. The message was brought in such a way, that, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of the natural pride of the man from Chicago, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was impossible for him to refuse. He therefore took</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first passenger plane East, accompanied by. the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mittee who had brought the invitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The meeting was held in the private study of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">president of New York University. Jacob Hubler</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked more dignified than ever as he sat motionless</seg><seg type="columnLine">except for the restless movement of his eagle eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the meeting, the presidents of a dozen of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">colleges of the land were present. These colleges, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller than the two giant schools, still were colleges</seg><seg type="columnLine">with remarkable histories and excellent faculties. Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Chenenko was there, old, yet remarkably alert,</seg><seg type="columnLine">both mentally and physically. Dr. Albert Johnson was</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, decidedly worried and closely guarded by two</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain-clothes men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The study contained nine windows. In each was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">420</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stained glass, with the picture of one of the nine muses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through the colored glass the rays of afternoon sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, sprinkling the oaken floor with splotches of vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored beauty. Silence covered the gathered men like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sullen sunset after a tempest. The fact that no one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except Jacob Hubler, knew the real scope of the meet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, filled all with anticipatory excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">â¢	"Gentlemen," that worthy began. "You are invited</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to listen to one of the most amazing stories that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it has ever been the fortune of a group of educators</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hear. As you well know, for many years, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been a sharp and unpleasant rivalry between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">universities of New York and Chicago. This rivalry</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused intense feeling at the annual football games, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally, in a fight after a game, several of the Chicago</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were killed. I need not say this was an occurrence</seg><seg type="columnLine">that pained us all greatly, and we tried in every way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to atone for it, but in vain. The feeling between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two colleges was now one of hatred of the worst kind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Peter Bowlers, the multi-millionaire, was the leader in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this song of hate. He paid a scientist one million dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars to infect the entire faculty of New York with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new and deadly poison, a form of cancer, a malignant</seg><seg type="columnLine">sarcoma, which would kill in several months. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">who did this, who so prostituted his profession,,Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Albert Johnson, is with us today.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As a result of his activity, the entire faculty, includ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing myself, developed this sarcoma malignanta. We real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized that we were fatally infected. We also believed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though we fought against the idea, that, in some way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Chicago University was behind our trouble. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">then Professor Chenenko came to us from Russia. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposed the amputation of the entire body of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sarcoma victim and the keeping of the head alive by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of artificial circulation and synthetic blood. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperation, we all submitted to this operation, and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next eleven years our heads taught and lived, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">our bodies molded away in the burial place that we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared for them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks to the power of the synthetic blood, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived, even though we were but a small fraction of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">former selves. The part that lived was the intellectual</seg><seg type="columnLine">part, while the part cut off was simply so much useless</seg><seg type="columnLine">baggage. The men in Chicago began to age and die, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">we seemed to have developed into ETERNAL PRO-</seg><seg type="columnLine">FESSORS. The efforts of the paranoiac, Bowlers, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the criminal biologist, Johnson, did not succeed. New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York continued to lead in educational fields.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will not believe this till you actually see me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This body under my head is simply a dummy. Later</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Professor Chenenko will show you the exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism that has kept my head alive all these years,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the manner in which I have been supplied with air</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that I have been able to talk and lecture to my classes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bowlers was furious, and became more paranoiac</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ever. He finally engaged detectives, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out the real condition. Then he again sought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the help of Dr. Albert Johnson. He offered him a mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion if he put my faculty out of commission. Johnson</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to work on the problem. He knew that the fluid</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced through our brains was a synthetic blood. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">disguise, he visited our workroom and finally became</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquainted with one of our best technicians. The un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunate man was in debt, his wife was ill and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed money. Johnson bribed him, and as a result,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was able to place an enormous quantity of adrenalin in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a new lot of synthetic blood, which they had found.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That blood was used the next day. Throughout</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brains of our best men, in fact, through 199 of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">professors, this serum, heavily charged with adrenalin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">circulated. In order for you to realize the result, I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain to you the effect of this substance. In large</seg><seg type="columnLine">amounts it causes small spots of decay, necrosis in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arteries of the normal body. These areas of necrosis</seg><seg type="columnLine">either break, causing hemorrhage, or they calcify, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulting in arterio sclerosis, or hardening of the walls of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arteries. Within a short time, many of our best</seg><seg type="columnLine">men died of apoplexy, and those who lived developed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mental symptoms of arterio sclerosis so rapidly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they became useless as teachers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fortunately or not, I escaped. Ever since my oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation, Professor^henenko has trusted no one to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">my synthetic blood except himself. As soon as he per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed autopsies on some of our dead friends, he sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected the work of an enemy and an examination of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">serum showed what had been done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "However, we should never have fully known the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth had not Peter Bowlers been seriously injured.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Realizing that he was fatally hurt, he felt that he coul&lt;f</seg><seg type="columnLine">not die with this load of sin on his conscience. He made</seg><seg type="columnLine">a complete confession and signed it a few hours before</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. It is so fantastic, so impossible, that if it were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not corroborated by the actual facts, we would not be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve it. As a result of this confession, we arrested Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Albert Johnson and will charge him with over one hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred and thirty murders. Have you anything to say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Johnson?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But that man, realizing that there was no hope, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed several drops of a deadly poison on his tongue.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For this reason, he neither tried to defend himself, nor I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was he ever punished for his crime. After the excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment caused by his death had passed over, President</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jacob Hubler resumed the thread of his talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thus, we come to the end of the two great facul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties, one of which died of old age and the other through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hatred of an insane man. Back of all of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble have been jealousy and hatred, two of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest curses known to mankind. Working in har-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mony with each other, we might have done much,</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have inspired a younger generation and grace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully made way for their advancement to fill our places.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That will have to be done now. I asked the presidents '</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our sister colleges to be present, because I wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to realize what unwise and unchecked competition</seg><seg type="columnLine">would result in. Such emotions should have no place</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the intellectual life, and are certainly out of place</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the curriculum of a university. I want you all to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live at peace, to be generous with each other. Each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you has a definite share in the work of educating our</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth. Perform that work in loving kindness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And, now, I have a peculiar statement to make to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. My family is all dead. For years I have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired of this stationary life. While my colleagues</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived, we would be moved near each other and secure</seg><seg type="columnLine">happiness from talking over old times, but most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them are dead, and those who are living are so crippled</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it is sad to see them. I am taking advantage of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">article of the agreement made years ago. We thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we might form a faculty of Eternal Professors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I am the only one left who is able to retain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">express his intellectual processes. I gave orders this</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning to Professor Chenenko that all the pumps be</seg><seg type="columnLine">BARTON'S ISLAND</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">421</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped.

Hidden by a screen on the platform sat Jerome</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carter. At Kirk Paulson's side was the little figure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aline Sarov. The applause from the central and west-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern meeting places came through the loud speakers</seg><seg type="columnLine">with volume equal to that of the local hall, and it re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired as much effort to silence the distant crowds as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it took to quiet those in New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Friends," spoke Philip when quiet was obtained, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have great news for you. There is now in preparation</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bill that will be introduced in Congress within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next few days. This bill will provide for the cancella-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the war debts of the foreign powers, and will</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus permit of their rehabilitation. That is but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning. We have all hesitated in the past to admit</seg><seg type="columnLine">that our great nation has been under the absolute dic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tatorship of Jerome Carter, though we have known and</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized it for years. And I am here to tell you of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the radical change of heart of this great man. He has</seg><seg type="columnLine">this nigjjt agreed to increase the monthly credit of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers by twenty-five per cent. This is to take effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once, and a further increase will follow as quickly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrangements can be made. All corporation presidents</seg><seg type="columnLine">have already agreed and the matter is definitely settled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Further reforms are to follow with all possible speed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The powers of the red police are to be curtailed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their numbers reduced by seventy per cent.

All class</seg><seg type="columnLine">legislation is to be repealed. The President has agreed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use his influence in conjunction with Carter's.

But with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Phil it was different.

Every morning his nurse</seg><seg type="columnLine">would give him an orange-colored trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent capsule. He was warned not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">chew it like candy, but to swallow it right down with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drink of water which she had ready for him. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">recollection dated back to a period when he was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween three and four years old.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first nurse he remembered had worn puff sleeves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some years later, at the age of eight, Austin had come</seg><seg type="columnLine">across a fashion plate in an old magazine. All the</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures wore puff sleeves. He had wondered mildly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to whom these ladies fed orange-colored capsules before</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Being an inquisitive child he had also wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">about certain other things. Why, for instance, was he</seg><seg type="columnLine">not permitted to go to school with other children?</seg><seg type="columnLine">The big handsome schoolhouse with its Doric columns</seg><seg type="columnLine">had always fascinated him. When he rode past it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his tutor, and Culp, the liveried chauffeur slowed up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car at the school crossing, Austin would peer through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass at the words, "Knowledge is Power" which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were chiseled in gold letters above the door. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the army of shouting children at play, an</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost uncontrollable impulse to fling the door of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car open and to run out and join the shouting mob</seg><seg type="columnLine">would sweep over him. He wanted to yell with them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be yelled at by them and above all he wanted to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">let in on his share of the power which was advertised</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the golden letters above the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At such moments he vaguely felt that somehow or</seg><seg type="columnLine">other life had cheated him, that there was something</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacking in his existence which neither Culp, the chauf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feur, Sims the butler, Mr. Henry, the tutor, or his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother could supply. He also felt that a sort of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiracy to cheat him of something, he hardly knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">what, was going on between these people and old Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goldwin, who came down on the first of every month</seg><seg type="columnLine">and looked over and left a fresh supply of orange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored capsules with his mother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was on one of these monthly visits when Austin</seg><seg type="columnLine">was eighteen years old that he overheard a discussion</seg><seg type="columnLine">of himself between her and the doctor. He had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant to be eavesdropping. He was coming down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft-carpeted stairway when he heard the voices of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother and the physician in the living room. Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goldwin said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The boy is entering young manhood with every nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal manifestation. You need not worry. He is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect specimen of manhood. His physical and mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">status is decidedly above par."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Austin heard his mother reply:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But suppose he wishes to marry some day--and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day must inevitably come?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I see no reason why he shouldn't," the doctor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Austin tiptoed back upstairs to his room. He pon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered deeply upon what he had overheard. He won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered what they had meant. If there was anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong with him he wanted to know it. He decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak to his mother about it that night after Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goldwin had gone, but abandoned the idea when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered that in doing so he would indict himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">for eavesdropping. The physician's words, "He's a</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect specimen of manhood," kept ringing in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears. What did Doctor Goldwin mean? And why</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldn't he be a perfect specimen?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He crossed to the window and stood looking out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the Long Island Sound. In the cove at the foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the garden his sloop lay moored. His mother had</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought it for him two years before, and on fine days</seg><seg type="columnLine">he and Mr. Henley cruised about the Sound in it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beyond the wide, sun-hot expanse of the Sound the</seg><seg type="columnLine">low cliffs of the Connecticut shore lay traced faintly</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the late afternoon mist. He wondered what manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of people lived there. He felt suddenly a strong desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go and see--to bolt from the odious restraint of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">daily routine of lessons, exercises, and walks and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape the spying eyes of Sims, Culp, Mr. Henley and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mother.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Turning, he walked to the cheval mirror at the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room. He looked himself over critically. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">judge himself only by comparison with the few people</seg><seg type="columnLine">with whom he came in daily contact. He knew that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was taller than Mr. Henley, the tutor, almost as tall as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Culp, the chauffeur, and that he carried himself nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as straight as Sims, the butler; certainly with more ease.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew that his blue eyes were much clearer than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Culp's and that his light hair was of much finer quality.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wondered if these were signs of perfect manhood.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had always rather admired the chauffeur's wiry hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the way Culp wore his cap pulled forward over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his shaggy eyebrows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE had thought about this episode for weeks. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was burning to know about himself, but he knew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">456</seg><seg type="columnLine">424</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that it seemed to be, as Phil claimed it was, just "dead,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far as vibration or its ability to combine with other</seg><seg type="columnLine">elements was concerned. This strange metal was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of Phil's many discoveries, and I describe it only</seg><seg type="columnLine">because it was used in his two-dimension experiments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Philip Tulane was undoubtedly endowed with one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greatest scientific brains that I ever knew. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made a name for himself in either chemistry or</seg><seg type="columnLine">physics if he had been willing to accept some of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">flattering offers from various universities. But he pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferred to remain an instructor in mathematics at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bennett. And I am sure that Theda was the cause o</seg><seg type="columnLine">his preference.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Theda Derioux was as good in her field as Phil was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his. She was interested in hypnotism and psychic</seg><seg type="columnLine">phenomena. Not only had she studied and read widely</seg><seg type="columnLine">along these lines, but she was born with strange medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">umistic and hypnotic powers. Furthermore, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gifted with the power of premonition. I don't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">much about such matters, but Theda was a puzzle even</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the psychologists. Whether it was due to a highly</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed intuitional sense, or whether it was the "up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rush of the subliminal" or some other power not yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood, I do not know, but Theda did marvelous</seg><seg type="columnLine">things in telepathy and mind control without--she de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clared--knowing how she did them. Outside of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious powers, Theda was a typical specimen of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vivacious, charming American girlhood. She got her</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather unusual name from her German-French an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cestry. She was a perfect Titian blonde and not at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the type usually associated with the so-called occult</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciences.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I MUST confess that I was very much in love with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Theda. But what chance had I, a bald bachelor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty-five? I don't mind admitting my love for Theda</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this late date, but at the time I kept it well concealed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nobody could doubt that she and Philip Tulane were</seg><seg type="columnLine">made for each other. They were not what you would</seg><seg type="columnLine">call twin souls but rather complementary personalities</seg><seg type="columnLine">--she with her psychic powers and he with his great</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Theda's father, old Dr. Derioux, head of the Psy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chology Department, was a native Frenchman, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the most original characters on the campus. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew his complexes and behaviourisms, and he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried on a lot of valuable investigations in spiritualis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tic fields, with the aid of his daughter's peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers. But, like his daughter, he managed to retain his</seg><seg type="columnLine">charming personality, in spite of his great learning, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside of his work hours he was so full of inconsisten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cies and unique sense of humor, that he was irresistible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I doubt if Phil knew the first principles of courting</seg><seg type="columnLine">a girl, assuming that he had such intentions. He did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not seem to want to be alone with Theda, so he and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">got into the habit of calling at the Derioux home at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">one evening a week. The four of us had enough com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon individual interests to make our weekly sessions</seg><seg type="columnLine">very enjoyable. We discussed all the sciences and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">religion and the destiny of man and such things. True,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the discussions of religion and metaphysics were rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the form of a debate with Theda and the Doctor on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side and Phil and me, both rank materialists at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, on the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Very clearly I remember the night when the idea of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">segregating the dimensions came up for discussion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The conversation had drifted around to the fourth di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mension, a favorite theme with us, and each had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">different opinion. As usual, the Doctor, much to Phil's</seg><seg type="columnLine">annoyance, upheld the superiority of his own science</seg><seg type="columnLine">over what he called the material sciences.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The fourt' dimension," declared Dr. Derioux, "is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not found in ze limited sciences of mat'ematics and</seg><seg type="columnLine">physics. Dey must be content to deal wit' t'ree, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">ze fourt' comes in my own realm of metaphysics. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter have lengt', breadt', and t'ickness. Nossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">functions in ze fourt' except ze subconscious mind. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will explain further if you weesh." r</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You need not take the trouble o;i my account,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather testily spoke up Tulane. "I am very well content</seg><seg type="columnLine">with three. I think it is rather foolish to seek for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth until we know something more about the three</seg><seg type="columnLine">than we can now conceive of."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think so too," agreed Theda. "Everything else</seg><seg type="columnLine">goes in threes. Why not dimensions? As for me, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't believe in the existence of but three on this Earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And have you ever thought of the expression of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Spiritualists, "the higher plane" where we are sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to exist after death? Isn't it possible that un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowingly they have expressed the real truth about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next state of existence? What I mean is that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next existence is really a plane existence, an existence</seg><seg type="columnLine">in two dimensions. I can believe that with one dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion dropped, we might continue to exist without any</seg><seg type="columnLine">real mass. We would be like the actors on a moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture screen except that we would retain our con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness. We would be free from all the physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">discomforts that go along with a three dimensional ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A very nice play on words, ma cherie," the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor replied in an indulgent manner, "but perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">absurd from eizer ze viewpoint of physics or philoso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phy. I have heard ze claim zat a moving picture or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow on ze floor were true examples of a plane. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">zat is false. Ze objects on ze screen or ze shadow are</seg><seg type="columnLine">non-existent in reality and our impression of them is</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply formed by the different intensities of light which</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking ze retina of ze eye stimulate ze nerve endings</seg><seg type="columnLine">so zat dey transmit a message to ze brain which forms</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mental image which says: "Moving picture of John</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barrymore making love," or "shadow on ze floor."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"That is very good metaphysics," smilingly replied</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tulane, but it leads directly to the theory of the ideal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ists, who claim that nothing exists outside of the mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am not quite ready to agree that all matter is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creation of the imagination. For the sake of Thorn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dyke and me, who are mere materialists, let us please</seg><seg type="columnLine">confine our discussion of dimensions to the mathemati-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal or physical viewpoint."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In zat way," objected the Doctor, "you will hav ze</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage of ze argument. But you are my guests; I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will agree to ze terms."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think Theda deserves more credit than you give</seg><seg type="columnLine">her for her 'play on words.' " Tulane went on. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that investigations of the possibilities of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensions hold more promise than of four. For ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample the oft discussed possibility of travel through</seg><seg type="columnLine">space or into a closed box by means of a little jump in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction of the fourth dimension. I have investi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gated most of the theories of the fourth dimension and</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DIMENSION SEGREGATOR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">425</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have come to the conclusion that, if it exists at all, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be defined by the word position; length, breadth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thickness--and position being all the necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">qualifications for existence. And that being the case,</seg><seg type="columnLine">four dimensional objects are in a sense stationary."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I WAS a firm believer in the Einstein theories and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to remind Tulane that position was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">relative. But I sensed that he had something else on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind, so I did not interrupt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now if I wanted to traverse great distances of space</seg><seg type="columnLine">or get inside of a closed box without raising the lid,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued Tulane, "rather than seek to use an extra di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mension I would discard one of the three that I am now</seg><seg type="columnLine">encumbered with."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But den you would be nossing," exclaimed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps so," agreed Phil, "but assuming that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed the means of dropping one of my dimensions</seg><seg type="columnLine">and becoming a creature having length and breadth but</seg><seg type="columnLine">no thickness, I could pass through any known substance</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one exception without meeting with any resistance</seg><seg type="columnLine">so long as the movement was confined to my own plane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Furthermore, not having any mass, I would not be in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluenced by gravity or friction. Once given a start I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could travel to Venus without applying any additional</seg><seg type="columnLine">power on the way. I could penetrate to the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth and find out what it is like. Ah, the possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bilities of a two dimensional object are almost unlimited.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why seek for four?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why indeed?" snorted the Doctor. "You might as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well seek for four as for two. As long as you confine</seg><seg type="columnLine">your thoughts to physical matter and leave out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">psychic side, you will have to be content wit' t'ree--no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more--no less. But you have aroused my curiosity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You mention a substance that not even your all-power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful plane could penetrate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tulane was aroused by the old man's sarcasm and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">replied with some spirit:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wish to amend my statement. There are two sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances that are impenetrable by any known means.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One is the l^rain of a psychologist, and the other is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heretofore useless substance that Thorndyke has in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted on calling tulanium."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The situation between the physicist and the psycholo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gist was becoming rather critical. But Theda saved the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day by saying:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You two old fossils cut out the sarcasm and explain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Phil, what you mean by 'heretofore useless'? You seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to insinuate that you have found a use for tulanium.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I have a feeling that it has something to do with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme of yours for getting into the two dimensional</seg><seg type="columnLine">state so that you can go sailing off to Venus or down</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the center of the earth like traveling on a magic</seg><seg type="columnLine">carpet. If that is so, I want passage reserved for me on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very first trip."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your intuition is almost true," said Tulane. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't have a scheme exactly; only part of one. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">really working on a lead that I accidentally came upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">while experimenting with X-rays and infra-red and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultra-violet rays. If you three will promise not to betray</seg><seg type="columnLine">my secret, I will keep you posted on the progress of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">invention of a 'Dimension Segregator.' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Theda was enthusiastic. I was interested. The old</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor was skeptical. But we all promised to keep the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">secret, and Phil continued to explain his scheme for</seg><seg type="columnLine">projecting himself into the two-dimensional existence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in case he succeeded in perfecting his Segregator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I can perfect this ray that I am working on, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will enable me to segregate one of the dimensions from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other two. Two of the dimensions can be projected</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a plane surface, leaving the third behind. Then, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">means of a little shove, this projection can be slid off--</seg><seg type="columnLine">let us call it a screen--edgewise. Tulanium will, I believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the substance to give the shove. As it is an abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lute solid, it will probably be impenetrable, even by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">object having no thickness. Once on its way, this true</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, having no gravity pull and meeting with no re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sistance, will continue on in a straight line through</seg><seg type="columnLine">eteriiisy unless means can be found for guiding it back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My invention is still in the embryonic stage, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, but later I hope I will be able to project myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a tour of exploration into regions as yet not visited</seg><seg type="columnLine">by man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But Phil," objected Theda, "how will you ever get</seg><seg type="columnLine">back if nothing can stop your outward journey but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrier of tulanium?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't worry about that.

Not even then, unless I can feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasonably assured of a safe return."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hour was growing late. So we disbanded for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night after Theda had been promised a hand in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building and operating of the Dimension Segregator.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Doctor was still skeptical. And so was I, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had great faith in Phil's powers to invent strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING the next few weeks Phil spent all his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spare time in the development of his mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray.

And he wanted me to help in the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of this machine. He explained that what he wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a simple housing for the ray tube, light-proof on</seg><seg type="columnLine">all sides, except for the opening through which the ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be shot. There must be lenses to concentrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rays on the desired spot and an electrical connection</seg><seg type="columnLine">for regulating the light necessary for the functioning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ray--there must be focusing arrangements, etc.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was to be on the order of a moving picture projector,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it would be of no use without knowledge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret of the segregating ray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This secret remained with Phil. I only knew what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gathered from chance remarks of his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a combination of rays from radium and light</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays of a higher frequency than ultra-violet rays that</seg><seg type="columnLine">are separated from the spectrum by means of prisms</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the tube," he said. "It resembles in some respects</seg><seg type="columnLine">the X-ray. But it has other properties. The radium</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays tend to disintegrate matter. But the other rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">modify this tendency so that instead of being disin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tegrated, an object in the field of the combined rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply has its dimensions separated or segregated with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out in any way suffering permanent disintegration."</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was all as clear as mud to me. Perhaps some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who reads this will know enough about such mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters to enable him to discover the secret of the segre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gating ray.</seg><seg type="columnLine">426</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I built the housing for him, and we took it into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark room for the installation of the ray and the finish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing touches. Tulane assured me that if a particle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light reached the tube, "the dimensions would be shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of everything that the rays came in contact with."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had made it in the dark, and we assembled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparatus in the dark, working by touch alone. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence of the radium made this a ticklish operation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We finally got the machine completed, however, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">set it up in a long room over Phil's laboratory. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed at one end of the room with the screen at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other, and in between was placed a platform on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects to be projected were to be placed. The screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">was made of a dense alloy of Phil's manufacture. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been compressed and polished until it was, I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieve, the nearest approach to a true plane surface that</seg><seg type="columnLine">has ever been achieved. Of course, if examined under</seg><seg type="columnLine">a powerful microscope, it would have shown irregu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larities of surface. Tulane was doubtful about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen, but later it proved its ability to serve as a plane</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface even though it was not strictly one. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">about seven feet square.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The platform and the focus of the ray had to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">adjusted so that the field of the beam barely cleared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the platform and covered almost the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the screen. At the first demonstration,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I witnessed, I found out why this was. Phil</seg><seg type="columnLine">later confessed to me that he slyly tested out the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone, so as not to risk the chance of being ridiculed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Dr. Derioux in case it proved to be a failure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AT the first public demonstration, Theda, the Doctor,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">â¢	Tulane, and I were present. We experimented</seg><seg type="columnLine">with inanimate objects only this time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tulane operated the projector and explained as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeded:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will now place this tin can on the platform, turn</seg><seg type="columnLine">the current on, and push forward the lever releasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Â£he energy of the ray tube. You perceive the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jection of the can on the screen while the can itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">has completely vanished. What has really happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">is that the peculiar energy from the segregating rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">has separated two of the dimensions from the third.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These two are stopped by the screen while the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">remains on the platform."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Humph!" snorted the Doctor, "dere is nothing on</seg><seg type="columnLine">ze platform."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just a minute, Doctor," calmly replied Tulane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The mere fact that there is no light received on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">retina of your eye, which creates an impression on your</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain, which says: 'tin can on the platform/ does not</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessarily mean that there is nothing there. I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove to you that there is something there; in fact, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater part of the tin can remains with the single</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will now reverse the lever which releases the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect of the ray on the tin can. You see, the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensions have returned."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was indeed true. The can was removed, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one and several at a time, other objects were put</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the same process.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what is ze benefit of all zis?" demanded the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor. "I do not believe it is a t'ing but some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">T'eda's sleight-of-hand or a simple exhibition of hyp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">notism."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Ignoring the skepticism of Dr. Derioux, Phil con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The most valuable discovery I have made so far is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the answer to the question I have been asking myself:</seg><seg type="columnLine">What happens to the weight of the three dimensional</seg><seg type="columnLine">objects when the dimensions are separated ? I reasoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a two dimensional object could have no weight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being without thickness. And I also reasoned that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">one-dimensional object could have no weight. Multiply</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing by nothing and you get nothing. Then where</seg><seg type="columnLine">does the weight come from? I was wrong about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">one-dimensional object being without weight. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that the weight--the mass--the property of</seg><seg type="columnLine">being affected by the pull of*gi-avity, is inseparably</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound up with one of the dimensions. Which one I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't know, for up to the present time no means has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been known of distinguishing between length, breadth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thickness, except the arbitrary custom of calling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the longest dimension the 'length,' the next longest, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'breadth,' and the shortest, the 'thickness.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What I do know is that the dimension that remains</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind when the other two are projected, retains the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attraction for other matter which is responsible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pull of gravity. This dimension which is linked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with mass I shall hereafter call the third, and I hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my future experiments to determine which proper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties are linked up with the other two. I shall then give</seg><seg type="columnLine">them distinguishing names."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A cube of wood was then undergoing projection.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You can learn for yourselves that the weight of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">cube of wood remains on the platform, even though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is invisible. Not only that, you can actually feel the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third dimension with your hands."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TULANE pulled the lever into "neutral." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">image remained on the screen. The block was</seg><seg type="columnLine">still invisible. But the power of the rays was</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevented from any further projection of objects</seg><seg type="columnLine">which came into their field. One by one we felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the third dimension of the block and even lifted it be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween our hands. It appeared to retain the normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight. It was a strange experience. You could pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">your hand through the spot where the cube had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in. a vertical direction or: from side to side and en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter nothing. But when you brought your hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">together in the direction of the projection, when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were about as far apart as the thickness of the cube,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would come to a stop. And by pressing your</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands against the cube and lifting, you could actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">raise the block or rather the third dimension of it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel the weight!! It is not much wonder that people</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought me insane when I related these experiences.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet, it was actual fact.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We all moved away from the platform, and Phil</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled the lever into "reverse." And we got another</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise. Instead of the cube, we now saw a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar form. It would have to be called a cube, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was not a right angle in it. It looked like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt of a lunatic to form a cube. Even Phil showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a look of blank amazement. Then he laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now you see some of the possibilities of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine," he said turning to Dr. Derioux, "I shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce an entirely new set of geometrical figures, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps develop a new school of futurist sculpture by</seg><seg type="columnLine">subjecting old-style statuary to this process."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DIMENSION SEGREGATOR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">427</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what in the world happened ?" asked Theda.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will let you figure that out for yourself," enigmat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ically replied Phil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I guessed what had happened but I don't believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Theda or the Doctor did. Phil placed the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">geometrical form on a shelf and placed a little plaster</seg><seg type="columnLine">bust of Shakespeare on the platform and turned on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray. Dr. Derioux must have had a curiosity to feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "third dimension of Shakespeare." He made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">move toward the platform and reached toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">position of the invisible bust. Tulane hastily jerked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the switch into neutral, just as the hand of Dr. Derioux</seg><seg type="columnLine">had entered the field of the ray. The image of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand appeared on the screen beside that of the bust, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">one extreme edge of the screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Doctor looked silly and hastily put his arm be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind his back. But Theda made him withdraw. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely enough his hand seemed neatly severed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrist. There was no blood, and he declared he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">no pain. Theda and I were filled with consternation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I thought Phil's bit of wit was quite out of order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another possibility of my machine," he said, "pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less surgery without anaesthetics."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was evidently perfectly confident of his ability</seg><seg type="columnLine">to restore the hand, but at the next turn of events he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the most disconcerted person in the group. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">this very instant the Midnight Express passed on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">track not a hundred yards from the building. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole room shook with the vibration and we saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">projection of Dr. Derioux's hand tremble slightly on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screen and slowly float off the edge and disappear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh!" wailed Theda, "it's gone out into space, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it will keep right on through eternity unless it meets</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with a barrier of tulanium somewhere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Which is quite improbable," calmly remarked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Phil was speechless. Absent-mindedly he appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give the third dimension of the Shakespeare cast a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little twist and then pulled the lever re-aggregating the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensions. What appeared was indeed a wildly fu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turistic-looking piece of sculpture. Still apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">much disturbed, Phil placed it on the shelf and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">found his voice to declare:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The wandering away of the two dimensions of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand was due to my carelessness in not surrounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screen with a rim of tulanium, as I intended to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">before performing any experiments. It will be neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary for me to project myself into the two-dimensional</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence in order to restore your hand. To-morrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">night I shall make the attempt, if it costs me my life."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Nonsense," shouted the Doctor. "You will do</seg><seg type="columnLine">nossing of the sort. I have enjoy ze seance very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed. I t'ink T'eda and I had better be going as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is late." Evidently he still thought he was the victim</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some sleight-of-hand trick performed by Theda and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tulane.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I REMAINED with Phil after the others had left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was evidently much disturbed about the Doctor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I haven't the slightest idea of how to proceed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get it back," he told me. "It was simply criminal negli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gence on my part to have delayed surrounding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen with tulanium. I intended to do that before I</seg><seg type="columnLine">projected any objects of value whose return to the three-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensional state was imperative.

I have made a guess that sensitiveness</seg><seg type="columnLine">to outside stimulations is attached to one of the dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions, and that consciousness and the ability to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">are associated with the other. I believe that I will re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain full possession of my powers of observation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But even if you do," I argued, "what you see will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">only a sort of cross section of what you pass through</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of very doubtful value to science."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," he admitted, "I don't know exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">what will happen. But I have hopes that I will at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">be receptive to the light rays that are perpendicular to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my plane.

But finding that his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not return with the dawn next morning, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become alarmed and had gone to the hospital and called</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the head surgeon, a friend of his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I desire you to examine my hand," he said, "it</seg><seg type="columnLine">feels rather peculiar.

Thorndyke, please</seg><seg type="columnLine">remove the third dimension of the guinea pig and place</seg><seg type="columnLine">it on the shelf with the other specimens."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had no sooner obeyed his command than the image</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the guinea pig came drifting back upon the screen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tulane hastily jerked the lexer into reverse and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two dimensions of the guirifa pig came back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform, but being unable to find the third where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been left, had to be content to remain in the flat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You may think I am a liar--but this is one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracles performed by the Segregator for which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence is preserved. When Tulane pulled the reverse</seg><seg type="columnLine">lever, there appeared on the platform what looked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tissue paper cut-out picture of a guinea pig standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">upright. I attempted to pick it up edgewise between</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hands but it passed right through both hands--</seg><seg type="columnLine">proving one of Phil's theories that a two-dimensional</seg><seg type="columnLine">object could penetrate any known substance without</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistance. I succeeded in picking it up by pressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">both hands firmly together against its sides, but still it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a tendency to slide between my hands. Moving it</seg><seg type="columnLine">about was as hard as trying to carry around a drop of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercury on a slab of glass. But I finally managed it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and next day Phil and I mounted it on a slab of alu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minum and surrounded it with an outline of tulanium.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He presented it to me, and it is still in existence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT to return to the experiments. Several more</seg><seg type="columnLine">guinea pigs and rabbits were projected, but as</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of them returned to the screen after being slid off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we concluded that the return of the first one was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere accident.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tulane turned to the Doctor and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dr. Derioux, I regret to have to confess that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">'material science' of physics is unable to solve the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem of controlling the movements of two dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional objects. I shall, therefore, have to invade your</seg><seg type="columnLine">field and try psychic control.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Theda, if you will prepare the subject, we will see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what can be done."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Theda placed one of the remaining rabbits on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform, and after stroking it gently and talking to it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a soothing tone, drew back and said she believed it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was under her control. Tulane pushed the lever and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the projection of the rabbit appeared on the screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, Theda, see what you can do in motivating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rabbit," he whispered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Theda seemed to concentrate on the rabbit. She did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have to speak to her subjects. She used purely</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental control. The rabbit circled the screen. It did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not just slide around. It hopped!! It came to a stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment and then went hopping rapidly off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen. Presently it returned in the same way. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make sure, Theda sent it off and on a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">times and also made it stand on its hind legs and wiggle</seg><seg type="columnLine">its ears. She then announced that she was satisfied</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">i</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DIMENSION SEGREGATOR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">429</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with her control, and when the reverse lever was pulled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rabbit was again on the platform, apparently asleep.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Theda clapped her hands, and he jumped down of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own accord and went hopping off to the corner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, apparently none the worse for his experience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fine work, Theda," exclaimed Phil. "I think it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be perfectly safe to venture into the two-dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional existence under your control.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the way, Dr. Derioux, you might ask the rabbit</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he saw anything of your hand while he was gone."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Derioux ignored Phil's inanity. He was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">highly elated over the fact that hypnotism had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary for the traversing of two-dimensional space</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he could afford a little :ndulgence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now," said Phil, "shall Gyp and I toss a coin to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is to have the privilege of the next trip? Theda,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will leave it up to you. If you think Gyp is too;</seg><seg type="columnLine">valuable to risk, I will excuse him and go myself."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Theda looked hurt and replied very seriously:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gyp at least has sense enough to know how much</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is appreciated. If I was not sure I could bring him</seg><seg type="columnLine">back I would let you go. But I want him to have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience, so he'll be next."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Phil turned very red under Theda's thrust, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">assumed a nonchalant air and requested Theda to pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pare the subject. Gyp was easily hypnotized and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made to perform his tricks on the screen and go off</seg><seg type="columnLine">and return several times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to lift his third dimension," requested Theda,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and see if it weighs as much as it ought to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So the lever was put in neutral, and Theda, evidently</seg><seg type="columnLine">with effort, raised the third dimension of Gyp and</seg><seg type="columnLine">declared that he was fully as heavy as ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tulane reversed the power, and Dr. Derioux gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">one glance at the platform and gasped:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mon Dieu! Tulane, what have you done to T'eda's</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog? He looks like he might have picked up another</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimension while he was gone!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE DID look that way for a fact, for instead of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal fox-terrier on the platform, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strange object that had but slight resemblance to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog--and yet it was recognizable as such. It resembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than anything else an "Impression of a Dog" as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might be given by one of the extreme cubist artists,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose works I have often wondered at. Tulane was</seg><seg type="columnLine">amused, but Theda was filled with consternation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Poor little Gyp!" she cried. "He is ruined. Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Phil, what can we do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think," declared Phil, "that he is quite an improve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. However, if you don't like him, I dare say that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you could sell him to a 'zoo' for a fortune, as a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">species of animal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But noticing that Theda was on the point of tears, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastened to reassure her:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't be alarmed. You shall have your dog back</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as he was before. Thorndyke, will you please</seg><seg type="columnLine">manipulate the lever while I revolve the platform?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I projected the dog on the screen again, and this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was the distorted image that appeared. Phil revolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the platform a few degrees and the normal Gyp was</seg><seg type="columnLine">again on the screen. But unable to resist the tempta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to have some fun, he continued to revolve the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform. The screen image became more and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">distorted until a ninety degree revolution had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">made. At that point the image disappeared momen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarily to reappear at once. It became less distorted as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the revolution continued, until the platform had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned 180 degrees. At that point the image appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal, and I pulled the reverse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gyp was again on the platform. Theda joyfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang on him, frightening him out of his spell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snatching him up in her arms, she began fondling him</seg><seg type="columnLine">and examining him to see if he was all right. Being</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied, she turned to Phil and said :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now aren't you glad that I let Gyp go instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">you? How would you like to be twisted all out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape as he was?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I would be only too glad to undergo the experience</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I could be rewarded on my restoration with as much</seg><seg type="columnLine">affection as you are bestowing on Gyp."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Theda's turn to blush now. She looked con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused and said to Tulane: /</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop being silly and tell us what made him look so</seg><seg type="columnLine">funny the first time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of explaining, Phil suggested that Theda</seg><seg type="columnLine">examine the dog's feet and eyes. Theda's two blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbs opened wide with amazement as she hastily gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gyp another inspection and saw that it was now his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left foot that was black instead of his right, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown and green eyes had reversed positions!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tulane explained what had happened as follows:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The same thing happened to Gyp that happened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cube in the first demonstration. When Theda</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up his third dimension, she set it back down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a different angle from its original position. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we brought his dimensions together again, one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them was at an odd angle to the other two, producing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bizarre futurist looking animal that we saw. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was necessary to restore the normal angle of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensions was to project him again and revolve the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . for instead of a normal fox-terrier on the platform,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a strange object that had but slight resem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blance to a dog.</seg><seg type="columnLine">430</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">third dimension to its original position. But for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sake of experiment I continued to revolve the platform</seg><seg type="columnLine">producing the peculiar kaleidoscopic effect you wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nessed on the screen. You noticed that at the 90 degree</seg><seg type="columnLine">point the image disappeared. That phenomenon needs</seg><seg type="columnLine">further investigation. I only know that two of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensions coincided at that point. Some very inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esting possibilities to that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The maximum distortion was reached when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third dimension was at a 45 degree angle to the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">two, while, when it was completely reversed, there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no distortion. You can see that Gyp is exactly as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was before, except that his right and left sides are</seg><seg type="columnLine">transposed like the image in a mirror. I don't think it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will cause him any inconvenience unless it makes him</seg><seg type="columnLine">left-handed or makes him see things reversed--mirror</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision I believe the psychologists call it. However, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Theda wishes it, I can easily remedy that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," Theda decided. "I think it will be fun to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">him this way for a while. If it causes him any incon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venience we can re-reverse him later."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, so much for that," said Tulane. "The ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periments so far have been only the preliminaries to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most interesting and valuable phase of dimension</seg><seg type="columnLine">segregation--the investigation of hitherto unexplored</seg><seg type="columnLine">regions. I am now ready to make the venture in</seg><seg type="columnLine">person."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mon Dieu!" exclaimed the Doctor, glancing at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch, "it is 1:30 A. M. We must postpone ze grande</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventure until anuzzer occasion."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But," objected Phil, "I am anxious to return the</seg><seg type="columnLine">missing dimension of your hand if it can possibly be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dere is no hurry about zat," affirmed the Doctor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I have been able to get along very nicely without it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have disprove ze t'eory zat a Frenchman would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">dumb if deprived of ze use of his hands."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We said good night, but for me there was little rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night. In my dreams hideous creatures appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their dimensions all tangled up, and I chased</seg><seg type="columnLine">elusive guinea pigs-in-the-flat who slipped through my</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers and passed at will through my body. And when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day finally came it was some time before my mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">was able to discriminate between what I had really seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night before and what had been part of my night-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mares.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	* *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE all needed a rest after the great nervous strain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the two previous nights, so we unanimously</seg><seg type="columnLine">agreed to postpone the great adventure until Saturday</seg><seg type="columnLine">night following.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On that night we met promptly at 8 o'clock, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tulane took charge of the program and proceeded as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if lecturing to one of his classes:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There are," he said, "many interesting possibilities</seg><seg type="columnLine">of investigation with our segregating ray without the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessity of projecting myself into two-dimensional</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence. For instance, by simply repeating the oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation, we can reduce an object to one dimension and</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out the properties of the first, second, and third.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And by going another step we can even do away with</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimension altogether. Of course, that is as yet incon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceivable. By another method of procedure, we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to establish the existence or non-existence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">famous 'fourth dimension.' A new science of solid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">geometry can be based on the forms produced by alter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the angle of incidence of the dimensions, just as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">did with Gyp, with Shakespeare and with the wooden</seg><seg type="columnLine">cube. There are many other fields of investigation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But that can come later. I am growing impatient to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be off on the 'grande adventure,' and if Theda is ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cast a spell on me and use her 'personal magnetism'</seg><seg type="columnLine">to guide me and bring me back again, I will mount the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have not the slightest doubt of my safe return, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">realizing the value to science of my chance discovery,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the segregating ray, I have carefully written down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">formulae and directions for its manufacture. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">also written down some of my theories as well as a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete report of what we have accomplished. I intend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put the papers in a safer place later, but at present they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are in the upper left-hand drawer of my office desk.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thorndyke, I will give you the key. You will also find</seg><seg type="columnLine">a properly executed document transferring to you three</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal shares in the ownership of the invention and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">profits that may result from its exploitation in case of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my demise in either the three- or the two-dimensional</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then to Theda he said: "All right, hypnotizer, do</seg><seg type="columnLine">your act."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she was evidently much affected by Phil's direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions about what was to be done in case of his failure</seg><seg type="columnLine">to return, and she absolutely refused to have anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do with projection. Phil argued and pleaded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally declared his intention of making the venture</seg><seg type="columnLine">without psychic control. Then she grew more alarmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ever and stated simply:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am going with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old Doctor snorted and fumed. "Nonsense!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Impractical, absurd, ridiculous!" he shouted. "How in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ze world can you use hypnotic power to guide Phil</seg><seg type="columnLine">while you are yourself in ze two dimension? Explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">me zat if you can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Theda smiled calmly and said: "I don't know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know it. But I do know that I can guide Phil much</seg><seg type="columnLine">better if I go along than if I remain behind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nevaire have I seen such a child!" complained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor. "You are ze despair of my existence. Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind is incapable of being psycho-analyzed. When-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever you say you know wit'out knowing how you know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have learned from long experience to submit to your</seg><seg type="columnLine">inanities. I will say no more. I t'ink perhaps you be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">long more in ze two dimension dan in de t'ree." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man calmed down and his voice took on a pathetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">note of tenderness as he continued: "But T'eda, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">must employ ze extremity of caution. Your old fazzer</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not live if anyzing happened to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE were tears in Theda's eyes as she assured</seg><seg type="columnLine">her fond father that he need have no fears. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt strangely sick at heart at the all too plain evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Theda would rather spend eternity in the two-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensional state with Tulane than risk being perma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nently separated from him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Theda hynotized Phil and appeared to go into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">partial trance herself. I manipulated the levers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they disappeared. Their projections still in the hyp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">notic state appeared on the screen and presently ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared to awake and arise. Waving goodby they</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped off the screen. From the time they left until</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DIMENSION SEGREGATOR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">431</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">their return Dr. Derioux remained in a state of mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">agitation. They soon reappeared on the screen but</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gone again before I could reverse the power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The minutes grew into hours, and I felt ready for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental collapse under the strain of watching the screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">and listening to Dr. Derioux's ravings. He was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">a maniac before the image of Theda and Phil appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">again on the screen and assumed a stationary position.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I jerked the lever, and there they were back on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platform, apparently fast asleep. Theda came out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trance without assistance and awoke Phil by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentle pat. Without waiting to be questioned, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">began at once, with eyes shining, to relate her ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periences.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, it was wonderful!" she declared. "I am more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ever convinced that the higher plane of existence</seg><seg type="columnLine">after this earthly life is in a two-dimensional world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can't explain how it feels. But I seemed to be wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering around like a disembodied spirit without weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">or any feeling of solidity. I had no trouble in guiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">Phil and myself. I simply willed to be at a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, and lo and behold, I was there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But where did you go? And what did you see?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">interrupted to inquire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, where did we go? And what did we see?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">answered Phil, evidently in a very ill humor. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">went to that platform, and we saw nothing. You three</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright ones must think I am a greater simpleton than</seg><seg type="columnLine">I really am, not to be able to figure out that all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened was that Theda put me to sleep and kept me</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep while you three planned out your little comedy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Theda, I did not think you were capable of practicing</seg><seg type="columnLine">such deception for the mere sake of preventing me from</seg><seg type="columnLine">risking the very slight chance of not being able to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn. But if you will not allow me to make the trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">into two-dimensional existence under your control, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will get some other assistants and go on my own hook."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Theda was nonplussed, and her enthusiasm over her</seg><seg type="columnLine">recent experience died a sudden death. But for only</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant. With a soft laugh she declared:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is I who am the simpleton. Why of course your</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious mind would retain no memory of the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">periences you went through while in the hypnotic con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dition. The only way you can find out what you saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">is for me to hypnotize you again and make your sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious mind dictate while some one writes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A lot of good it will do me," retorted Phil, "to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">some one else tell me what I saw and experienced. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't do anyone any good to enter the two-dimension</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence, except for the purpose of making technical</seg><seg type="columnLine">observations of a scientific nature with his conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, don't be disheartened," pleaded Theda. "Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps it will be possible to control your movements while</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are in a semi-hypnotized condition so that you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to remember what you see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Phil was only partially convinced that he had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been duped, and hg was in rather bad humor when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted for the night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next afternoon Theda actually did hypnotize Phil</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she made him tell all he had seen and felt while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in the two-dimensional state. Dr. Derioux copied</seg><seg type="columnLine">it all down, and it was filed with the other papers in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper left-hand drawer of Phil's desk. Unfortunately</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was not present at the time and never had an oppor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity of seeing the paper. All I ever learned about</seg><seg type="columnLine">what actually took place in the two-dimensional world</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gathered from the few remarks that Theda made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE fourth demonstration was a brilliant success,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although it was a nerve-racking experience for me</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Doctor. Theda partially hypnotized Phil and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that he could be controlled and still have a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect memory of what happened to him. She insisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">on going with him again. So in their trance-like state</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were projected and left the screens In about ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes they reappeared on the screen, and Theda held</seg><seg type="columnLine">what appeared to be a human hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah!" exclaimed the Doctor, "ze prodigal has re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned. It is my long lost hand which now is found.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pull ze reverse lever, Meestaire T'orndyke, zat it may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be restored so dat I can fall upon his neck and embrace</seg><seg type="columnLine">heem."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was about to comply, but on second thought realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had better think what should be done in this case.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a brain-twister. If Theda and Phil would with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw from the screen and leavS the hand, I might seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Doctor on the platform and bring back his hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But suppose the third dimension of his hand was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the same position as it had been at the time of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">accidental projection. Then his hand would be like</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gyp--distorted. In that case I could project the Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and orientate the platform. But in getting his hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to normal, all the rest of his body would become</seg><seg type="columnLine">distorted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I explained the problem to Dr. Derioux, and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">much argument we were about to give it up. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest marvel of all the marvelous events took place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Theda and Phil on the screen were apparently laughing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at our dilemma. I was much annoyed and was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bring them back to solve the problem for us. Phil</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to read my mind and held up a restraining hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and began to engage in a sort of pantomime for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">benefit. He pointed to Dr. Derioux and to the plat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form. The Doctor mounted the platform, taking care</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get on the extreme edge so as not to disturb the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensions of Theda and Phil. I was about to project</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, when Phil shook his head and pointed to Theda.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, would you believe it, Theda, in her two-dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sional form, looked directly at the Doctor with a pecu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liar look of concentration in her eyes, and he promptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">became unconscious. She actually hypnotized him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two-dimensional world. This proved that full</seg><seg type="columnLine">powers of mind were retained and contact kept with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-dimensional world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shot him on the screen, and then had the pleasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of seeing a pretty little screen play. The Doctor stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">at attention while Theda very formally approached with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand. He extended his wrist, and Theda attached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand, testing it to see if it fitted. She then kissed</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on both cheeks. The Doctor saluted with the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stored hand, and Phil approached and gave it a vigor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous shake. They then seemed ready to be brought back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I pulled the lever and brought them back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">roused them out of their trances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Derioux was delighted and jumped around feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of his hand and making gestures with it, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peating over and over that he must go and show it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the surgeon. And when I asked how it felt to be pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected, he replied:</seg><seg type="columnLine">432</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I felt nossing. I simply went to sleep, and when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">awoke, my hand which was lost had returned. Ah! let</seg><seg type="columnLine">us kill ze fatted calf and have feasting and rejoicing!</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I was about to forget. Mr. Tulane, where did you</seg><seg type="columnLine">find heem--ze hand?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, it hadn't wandered far," drily replied Phil. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found it on the upper plane, trying, by means of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">French language of gestures, to explain to a class of</seg><seg type="columnLine">two-dimensional sophomores the difference between</seg><seg type="columnLine">ego-ism and egotism."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, indeed?" retorted the Doctor. "I have no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">zat ze mind of my sophomore class of psychology is of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ze two dimension, what you call ze two-by-four. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">as for ze mat'ematician and ze physicist--his mind is</seg><seg type="columnLine">in ze one dimension. It have no breadth, no length. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is only in thickness of ze skull dat it is a grand success."</seg><seg type="columnLine">After we had laughed at the Doctor's wit, Phil and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Theda declared their intention of making another trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of discovery. Phil had been able to observe for him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self this time, and had made some revolutionary dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coveries concerning the composition of the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. He declared that he retained all sensory powers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even acquired the ability to see into the dark in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terior of solid objects. And he also was able to remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he saw and felt. Transportation from place to</seg><seg type="columnLine">place and the passing of time were almost instantaneous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently, because they had been through the Earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and back in a few minutes. He even asserted that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could bring back objects, which of course would be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two-dimensional form like the guinea pig. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross-sections, though they could not be chemically</seg><seg type="columnLine">analyzed, would be of value to science. As to where</seg><seg type="columnLine">and how he had recovered the Doctor's hand he refused</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say any more at present. He said that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to traverse the distance to Venus and probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigate that alleged upper plane of Theda's. So he</seg><seg type="columnLine">insisted upon being projected immediately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We went through the usual procedure, and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">off. Dr. Derioux and I settled down to wait.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The minutes passed rapidly while we conjectured</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the mysterious return of the hand. But the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to drag as Theda and Tulane did not reappear on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screen. The Doctor became worried and looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his watch every five minutes. It was the most miserable</seg><seg type="columnLine">night I ever spent. My companion went to sleep in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair about one A. M., and the dawn was breaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I awoke with a start from a little nap to see Theda</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Phil beckoning from the screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they were brought back and the Doctor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">awakened, he flew into a veritable rage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "T'eda, whatever am I do do wit' you? You will yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause my destruction. I ain disgrace! I am mortify!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here you calmly return at daybreak after being out all</seg><seg type="columnLine">night wiz a man who is not your husband. It is un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conventional, it is scandalous! What would your</seg><seg type="columnLine">mammon say if she were alive?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Father, don't be silly," Theda reasoned with the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. "These things don't count in the two-dimensional</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. Everything is beautiful and pure, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical side of our natures is left behind. Love is on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a higher plane than it is in this world. And besides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Phil and I have been united in the two-dimensional</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, and if you wish it, for the sake of propriety, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be married in the three-dimensional world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have been united in the two dimension? Mag-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> nificent ! And I suppose the ceremony was performed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one of those Unitarian ministers who deny the t'ree</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensions of God? Yes? Well, it is ze only cere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mony zat will be performed unless you proceed in ze</seg><seg type="columnLine">American manner, without ze consent of ze parent." ;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dr. Derioux, I take this opportunity to request the</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor of your daughter's hand in marriage," Phil inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted very formally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am surprise, I am amaze. I can not. She is my</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one. Mr. Tulane, it is a great honor. But I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">think. I am ze old fool! Ah, I have it. It is ze grande</seg><seg type="columnLine">romance. Ze old man lose his right hand--he offer a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great reward for its return. Ze young Knight come</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of ze West. He sail out into ze unknown. At ze</seg><seg type="columnLine">risk of his life he recovers ze hand and by his magic</seg><seg type="columnLine">power restores it to ze t'ree dimension.

He say: 'My son, as a reward</seg><seg type="columnLine">for your brave deed I will give you ze hand of my only</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter.' It is done; you have my consent."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And my congratulations," I interposed. Â® And thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">happily ended the fourth demonstration. Theda and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Phil were quietly married that afternoon, and seriously</seg><seg type="columnLine">declared their intention of spending their honeymoon in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two-dimensional world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">+ * *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER losing a whole night's sleep and witnessing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-	a marriage on top of that, we were all rather un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strung. But Theda and Phil just wouldn't be denied</seg><seg type="columnLine">one little trip into the two-dimensional world. So the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next and final demonstration of the Segregator took</seg><seg type="columnLine">place on the very next night, April 22nd, a date made</seg><seg type="columnLine">memorable by the occurrence of the Great Bennett</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earthquake and fire disaster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We won't be gone long," Phil promised. "We are</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking of settling as pioneers in the new world we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have discovered, and we just want to pick out a spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">for building the floor plan of our two-by-four cabin."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Bettaire make it larger," laughed the Doctor, "so as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have room for ze little one-by-one or perhaps two-by-</seg><seg type="columnLine">two Phils and T'edas that are sure to arrive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Theda very solemnly remarked: "Phil, I don't think</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had better go to-night. I am having one of my pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monitions. I seem to have the feeling that something</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible is going to happen to-night. I feel as if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">projection machine is going to be destroyed or some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing like that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope you are wrong," said Phil. "But anyhow, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything is going to happen, I will feel safer in the two-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensional state than in the three. Won't you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A strange look came into Theda's eyes, and I firmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe that she knew at the time that she and Phil</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never return to our world if they were projected</seg><seg type="columnLine">into two-dimensional existence. But she made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">choice. She merely said: "I am not afraid. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">will go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were projected, and lingering on the screen</seg><seg type="columnLine">only long enough to wave farewell, were off on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange honeymoon, while Doctor and I tried to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves comfortable. They had been gone scarce ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes when the windows began to rattle and the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tremble slightly under our feet. Gyp, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">present, growled uneasily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What train passes at dis hour?" nervously inquired</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Doctor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE DIMENSION SEGREGATOR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">433</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced out of the window and replied: "There is</seg><seg type="columnLine">no train. It must be a slight earth tremor."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us hope dat it will be slight," said the Doctor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I fear zat T'eda's premonition was correct. Her pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">monitions always are correct."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The second shock came, stronger than the first. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">screen shook, and the platform slid a slight distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the floor. The tremor died away, to be followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the third--this time quite severe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mon Dien!" fairly shouted the Doctor. "What will</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen if ze machine is demolished and T'eda away out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in ze two dimension wit' no way of getting back. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have forbidden dis mad adventure to-night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">T'eda's premonitions never fail."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this moment Theda appeared on the screen alone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were tears in her eyes, and she was bidding us</seg><seg type="columnLine">farewell. Dr. Derioux hastily pulled the reverse lever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the platform had been disturbed, and the Theda</seg><seg type="columnLine">that appeared, though recognizable and still beautiful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was dimensionally altered and distorted. Dr. Derioux</seg><seg type="columnLine">pushed forward the lever and yelled out:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rotate ze platform!! Rotate ze platform to ze</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper degree. Dere is no time to waste! !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The earth trembling had ceased, and I took my time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoping that Phil would reappear. I had just got</seg><seg type="columnLine">Theda's image back to normal on the screen, when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">glided off to her husband, waving us a last farewell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then came the severest shock. Dr. Derioux was hurled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor, and the lights went off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All is lost," wailed the Doctor. But I hoped that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not true. The shock was weakening, and I hoped</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I could get a light and some storage batteries to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attach to the machine. I started feeling my way along.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had reached the hall when the floor seemed to rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">about three feet and I felt myself falling through space.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had been thrown bodily down the stairway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stunned and bruised, I tried to collect my thoughts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had a vague idea that there was some purpose that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had started to carry out. Oh, yes--the storage bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teries. But no, it was too late for that now. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine was probably a hopeless wreck. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">some other thought deep in my subliminal mind that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was struggling for consciousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The smell of smoke brought me to my senses. Fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">had broken out in the building. What was it that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must do? Oh, yes, the upper-left-hand drawer of Phil's</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk. I must make a desperate effort to reach it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">save the papers before everything was lost. I dragged</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself along, and must have reached the outside of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk, when some falling object hit me on the head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Consciousness left me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	* *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I AWOKE with a throbbing pain in my head. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">my first thought was for the papers. I made an</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to crawl on toward the upper-left-hand drawer</seg><seg type="columnLine">but was restrained by the strong arms of a Red-cross</seg><seg type="columnLine">nurse who held me on the cot and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must lie still. Don't worry about the papers."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I settled back and tried to connect things. I saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was in what appeared to be an emergency hospital.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I remembered the earthquake and fire, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized where I was and why I was there. Seeing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surgeon approaching, I rose up and asked him what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">become of Dr. Derioux. He replied:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I regret to say that he perished in the fire that de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed most of the University buildings after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthquake."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And Theda and Phil--are they still in the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimension ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, they were lost, too." He looked at me queerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned to the nurse and said: "Better keep the</seg><seg type="columnLine">patient quiet. He seems to be delirious still."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the fever had gone and I was allowed to talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much as I pleased, I found that there had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">severe earthquake that had demolished most of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">University buildings. The shock, I learned, was for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed by a fire which had totally destroyed, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other buildings, Phil's laboratory office and the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">where our demonstrations had been carried on. About</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred lives were lost at Bennettsville, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night watchman had betrayed the fact that Dr. Derioux</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his daughter and Phil were in the laboratory build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and had not come out. This same watchman had</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered me lying unconscious ju^ outside the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had been attracted by the furious barking of Gyp</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had followed me out and refused to leave my side</seg><seg type="columnLine">in spite of the rising heat from the burning building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old Doctor gone--Phil and Theda too! But</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow I felt that, though their third dimension had</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtless been destroyed, still their other two must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">together and safe and happy. And the papers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">formula and records were all burnt, and the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">was destroyed. It was up to me alone to acquaint the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world of the wonders that Phil had performed and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">seek to have the secret of the ray rediscovered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I searched the ruins, but found nothing but a hope-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less wreck of the projecting machine, the warped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">melted screen with the rim of tulanium still intact--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the queer transformed bust of Shakespeare blackened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and broken in two. Otherwise it was unharmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told my story to many. But they only laughed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me or listened in an indulgent manner, that plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed that they thought me mentally unbalanced. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhibited the flat guinea pig and called attention to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">transposed eyes and feet of Gyp. But I convinced no</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. The tales I told them were too marvelous to seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">feasible. I tried to get the surgeon to tell what he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Dr. Derioux's hand, but he refused to discuss</seg><seg type="columnLine">the matter. My friend, Dr. Fitzpatrick, the psycho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">analyst, was the only one who listened seriously to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete story. He admitted that he was at a loss to</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain certain things, especially Gyp's eyes. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost convinced me that I had been hypnotized by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Theda and was made to see things that did not exist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was either that," he declared, "or the surgeon</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the physicians are right in thinking that the blow on</seg><seg type="columnLine">your head caused you to be afflicted with a peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">obsession. It may be only temporary, but if I were</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, I would refrain from discussing the subject of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimension segregation, because you are only convincing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world that you have had hallucinations and you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">injuring your reputation for levelheadedness."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could not have been deceived. No, the demonstra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions were real. But, like Galileo, I had to renounce</seg><seg type="columnLine">my theories at the beck of an unbelieving world in order</seg><seg type="columnLine">to save myself.

His success was due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to none of those freaks of fortune by</seg><seg type="columnLine">which lesser men occasionally stumble upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unexpected treasure. For Dr. Kramm was not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those who blunder by inspiration; he was one who</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked with the mathematical evenness and the certi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude of a chronometer. Hence he foresaw his astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing discovery years before he actually attained it. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire life, in fact, had been devoted to the consumma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of that one goal; first as a student in college, later</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a lecturer on the theory of vaccines and inocula-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, and finally as director of the bacteriological labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory of Henry Elkins University, Dr. Kramm had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voted his spare hours to a single object, to which he had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                 How triumphantly he must have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                 observed the freshly created cells</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                 become suddenly mobile. And how</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                 gratifying when Kramm's animal-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                 cule was seen to split, leaving two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                 complete animalcules in its place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Wand</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Creation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">clung with the dauntless tenacity of an oyster adhering</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to its native rock. In the face of discouragement, of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ridicule, of financial loss, of wasted hours too numer-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ous to count, Dr. Kramm had persisted; until finally, in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his sixty-fourth year, his efforts were crowned with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that triumph which dinned on the ears of the world</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like a thunderclap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet his goal was not one which had never been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sought before. It had been coveted by many an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestigator of less perseverance and less talent than Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kramm possessed; and some of these had apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">progressed a slight distance along the difficult road, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the end all had thrown up their hands in defeat. Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kramm had been seeking, in a word, to solve that most</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult of all problems--the enigma of life. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been striving to bridge the gulf between inert matter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">435</seg><seg type="columnLine">436</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and organic tissue; to convert dead clay into mobile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentient substance. Nor was he content with the half-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way measures of his predecessors. He did not aim to</seg><seg type="columnLine">create a chemical cell with the mere superficial sem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blance of life; he would have scorned to stop, as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain contemporary had done, with fertilizing the egg</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a rudimentary organism by electrical means. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose was as uncompromising as his methods were</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorough-going; and his lifelong principles were those</seg><seg type="columnLine">to which he himself gave expression on that epoch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">making occasion when he placed his discovery before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I realized from the first the difficulties of my task,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he declared, in that learned document which must re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">main for all time a scientific classic. "I knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boundless complexity of protoplasm, and the tremen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dous gulf between dead matter and even the simplest</seg><seg type="columnLine">living things. To create protoplasm might in itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been a Herculean task; but I did not allow my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ambition to pause at this point. I desired to create</seg><seg type="columnLine">protoplasm with all the essential functions of life. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">what are the essential functions of life? They are</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply stated, and are only three in number: respira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, assimilation, and reproduction. To these may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">added a fourth, which, however, is less essential: the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of locomotion. If I could succeed in creating</seg><seg type="columnLine">an organism--a one-celled organism--with only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first three of these four qualities, I should have ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complished man's age-old dream to give life to pulse-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less clay. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It will be needless to recount the various steps by</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Dr. Kramm brought this dream to fulfillment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is well known how, as the fruit of years of labor, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced the gelatine known unromantically as "sea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glue" from the distilled essence of a certain marine</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant; and how this gelatine, when mixed with certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydrocarbons and then subjected to electrical rays in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner that Dr. Kramm has explained at great length,</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be divided into microscopic particles, each of which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though but an amorphous mass of jelly, displays the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nucleus and the characteristic appearance of one-celled</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals! This fact has been abundantly described;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but what is not so generally realized is that, at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">point, there came a delay of ten years in Dr. Kramm's</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiments. For the cells, though they had the aspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">of living things, lacked all three essentials of life. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not absorb oxygen! They could not assimilate</seg><seg type="columnLine">food! They could not reproduce themselves! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">while a faint quivering was observed in them at times,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicating a latent power of locomotion, the result was</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely to perplex and tantalize their creator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT it was not long before the sure instinct of</seg><seg type="columnLine">genius informed him what was lacking. "I recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized," he writes, "that it was as if I had created a</seg><seg type="columnLine">human body, but had provided neither nutriment for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to absorb nor oxygen for it to breathe." In other</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, the cells were potentially, if not actually, alive;</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that they required was a propitious environment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But how give them such an environment? That was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a problem which, as the scientist himself states, "turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last hair gray" upon his head, and "planted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rutted lines of age" upon his cheeks and brow. Tb</seg><seg type="columnLine">square the circle or to learn the secret of perpetual</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion seemed as easy as to find the proper life-condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions for those infinitesimal cells; Dr. Kramm immured</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">himself like a hermit, experimenting until his friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspected him of incipient lunacy; he tried preparation</seg><seg type="columnLine">after preparation, from stagnant water to complicated</seg><seg type="columnLine">protoplasmic brews, but never with any results not</seg><seg type="columnLine">calculated to make him wring his hands in agony. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did have certain partial successes, it is true--successes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, though they would have made lesser men jubilant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were only enough to prod Dr. Kramm to further ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forts. Under certain circumstances, he could cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">the minute cells to move through water with a slow, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parently voluntary motion; under certain other condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, he could induce them to open and to absorb mi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nute digestible particles; and at the same time he sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected, but did not definitely know, that they could con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sume oxygen. Yet he found no means of making them</seg><seg type="columnLine">reproduce, and no means of preventing them from dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solving and dying after a few hours. Was the arti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficial creation of life after all as futile as the carving</seg><seg type="columnLine">of statues out of snow?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dr. Kramm does not make it quite clear what it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ultir^tely gave him his saving idea. Perhaps it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that all things, except one, had been tried and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found wanting; perhaps it was that he arrived at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution by an elaborate process of reasoning too diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cult for the unscientific mind to follow. At all events,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the important fact is that, after ten years of fruitless</seg><seg type="columnLine">experimentation, Dr. Kramm wrested victory from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very teeth of defeat. And the agency of victory was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something that, had he only suspected it, he might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">employed from the beginning. It was something with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out which he, no less than the organism of his creation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not have survived. It was the very blood within</seg><seg type="columnLine">him! For, after all else had failed, Dr. Kramm found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the one-celled creature throve upon blood!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With what feelings of amazement and exultation the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientist must have watched his first blood-culture</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the microscope! How triumphantly he must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have observed the freshly created cells become suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobile, move about furiously with every evidence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, and fling themselves upon the red corpuscles! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">what a fascinating spectacle as these new-born motes</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbed the corpuscles, absorbed also the white cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">puscles that came forth to oppose them, and proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves to be fighting particles of no mean ability!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And how gratifying when, after expanding as a result</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the feasts of blood-cells, the nucleus of each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kramm's animalcules was seen to split, leaving two</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete animalcules in its place! At last Kramm had</seg><seg type="columnLine">achieved the seemingly impossible! He had created</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new, self-perpetuating species!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even amid the joy of triumph, he did not leap</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ill-formed conclusions. The caution of years of</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow investigation was still with him; again and again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the utmost patience and care, he repeated and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tested his experiment before presuming to give the</seg><seg type="columnLine">results to the world. But in the end there could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt. The "blood-mite"--as his discovery was</seg><seg type="columnLine">popularly called--could not only be produced at will,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but would invariably move, breathe, consume nourish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and reproduce in a culture of blood!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE world-wide clamor, upon the announcement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these facts, is now a matter of history. It is re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered how enthusiastically Kramm's statements</seg><seg type="columnLine">were received, how eager and how heated were the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussions in every cultured circle, and how generally the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WAND OF CREATION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">437</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dawn of a new scientific era was foretold. Neverthe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, mingled with the tumult of acclaim, the voices of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the skeptical began to make themselves heard, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">many an unbeliever protested that Kramm's alleged</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery was impossible, and that the doctor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">either deluded or a charlatan. Hence numerous parties</seg><seg type="columnLine">of investigation--welcomed by no one more than by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kramm himself--began to visit the bacteriological</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratories of Henry Elkins University; and letters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of confirmation, signed by some of the most eminent</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists of America and Europe, commenced to ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pear in medical journals and even in the daily papers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissipating the last doubt as to the authenticity of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery. . . . Yet it was one of the investigating</seg><seg type="columnLine">parties which, by a freak of ill fortune, was indirectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible for the unexpected aftermath of Dr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kramm's discovery, and resulted in converting one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the supreme scientific achievements of the age into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest curse that had ever afflicted the human race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The exact facts, of course, remain clouded in doubt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since at the time the error occurred it was not observed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and consequently we have to depend on memoriÂ® and</seg><seg type="columnLine">surmises for our information. Yet Dr. Kramm stoutly</seg><seg type="columnLine">maintains that there can be but one explanation. In a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengthy treatise, which covers the subject exhaustively,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he contends that the seed of disaster must have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">sown on the occasion of the visit of the delegation from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the University of Bristol. . . . The summer of 1949,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as every one will recall, was a particularly hot one, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heat was especially burdensome on that August</seg><seg type="columnLine">day when the Bristol savants made their call; hence</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is not surprising that one of them, not observing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning that Kramm had plastered on the laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls, presumed to open a window without the for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mality of asking permission. And this trivial deed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible as it may appear, was to be the forerunner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of world-wide catastrophe. In their preoccupation</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Kramm's demonstrations, none of the professors</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first observed the open window, and Kramm him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self did not notice it until, to his astonishment, a large-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sized fly settled on one of the blood-cultures, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was probably the most inviting morsel in the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Naturally, the doctor was annoyed; but he himself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with characteristic frankness, admits that he was little</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than annoyed; he had as yet no anticipation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terrible fruit of evil that lay in store. And so he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did what any other normal human being would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done in the circumstances; he chased the insect away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, while the creature went spiraling and circling out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the open, he slammed the window with a bang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and requested his visitors to leave it down thenceforth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And straightway he proceeded to forget the incident.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was several weeks before the thought of it recurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him; and when remembrance did come, it was under</seg><seg type="columnLine">sadly altered circumstances. For, in the interval,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange things had been happening in the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The beginning occurred when one of Kramm's</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighbors--a man who had always prided himself on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the strength of his physique and on his immunity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">disease--was taken mysteriously ill. The malady was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a type that four physicians, in puzzled consultation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unanimously failed to identify; it was as if the victim</seg><seg type="columnLine">had suffered from a severe hemorrhage or sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">pernicious anaemia; for, while hale and healthy one</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, he had become weak as an infant on the next, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">displayed the pallor and the lassitude of one who had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sustained a serious loss of blood. And yet there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently nothing to explain this transformation. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">vital organ seemed to be affected; there was a slight</seg><seg type="columnLine">fever, but its source could not be traced; it was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if the sufferer were fading out of life. And when, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the third day, the sick man sank into a sleep from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not awaken, the physicians were as far as ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">from diagnosing the case. Nor were they greatly</seg><seg type="columnLine">helped by a post mortem, which showed no organic</seg><seg type="columnLine">impairment, although it did reveal an astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing paucity of blood corpuscles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAD this been the only case of its kind, it might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been recorded as a medical curiosity, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">would otherwise have been forgotten. But it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely the first of a long series. A second and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">more sinister manifestation occurred when the wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sick man, as well as three of the attending</seg><seg type="columnLine">physicians, fell ill with precisely the same symptoms--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, after three days, quietly expired. Simultaneously</seg><seg type="columnLine">one or two of the neighbors took to their beds as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly drained of their last atom of strength; while</seg><seg type="columnLine">in another quarter of the town, eleven cases of a similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">outbreak were reported to the Board of Health. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time matters were coming to be recognized as</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious, particularly since all but two of the first fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">victims succumbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What was not recognized, however, was that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble was so far in its infancy. As yet the enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fought only a few preliminary skirmishes; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">having won the initial engagements, it was to launch a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic attack. In a hundred places simultaneously</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mysterious death appeared. In every part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, and in the outlying country districts, the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to fall ill and die for no apparent reason; while</seg><seg type="columnLine">several cases were reported in a town a hundred miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. Always the symptoms were the same; ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haustion, a sudden failure of strength, followed in most</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases by speedy decease; and always the cause of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">illness remained hidden. It was as if the populace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized by some dark visitation of Providence, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken by an unseen hand, while man after man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was plucked as a ripe apple is plucked by the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible fingers of the wind. And by the time the malady</seg><seg type="columnLine">had spread across an entire state, and five thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">persons had been afflicted and more than forty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred had perished, a wild, superstitious terror be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan to possess the land. No invading army, among</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the ravaging swarms that history has known, ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused quite the consternation of that unknown pesti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lence; men suddenly became panic-stricken, insane;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doors of business houses were closed; farm-lands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wharves, and mines lay idle, offices and factories were</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted; men immured themselves within their homes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking to shut out a foe that none the less slyly, insidi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously intruded; or else they took flight, but did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know where to flee; while, in their mad rush from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smitten districts, they seemed only to lend wings to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror. Wherever they went, the disease was certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">to appear; within two weeks, it had covered the length</seg><seg type="columnLine">and breadth of the country! More than one hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand cases had been reported in the forty-eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">states; and the fatalties--which, in that period of</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror and confusion, could not be computed exactly--</seg><seg type="columnLine">were said to number more than ninety thousand!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even amid the bewilderment and dismay of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">438</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible days, scientists were busy ascertaining the cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the plague. Many a valiant young investigator, bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">over his microscope at a risk only too clearly realized,</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt the feebleness and languor of the disease overtak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him, and offered up his life as a sacrifice. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">many a theorist, hovering aloof from the scene of</seg><seg type="columnLine">disaster, evolved hypotheses to account for the awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitation--hypotheses which in only one particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">were recognized as sound: the malady showed every</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of being contagious, for those that came into</seg><seg type="columnLine">contact with the victims were themselves likely to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">afflicted, while the disease spread from an observable</seg><seg type="columnLine">focus precisely in the manner of a bacterial infection.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here at least was a clue to work from--and it is unfor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunate that, amid the nation-wide chaos of the first at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack, no researcher had the persistence and skill to</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow the hint to its logical conclusion. Not until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scourge had gained universal headway, and the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitants of Europe, Asia and Africa no less than of</seg><seg type="columnLine">America were perishing by the thousands, did any man</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the discovery that was to point the way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elimination of the pest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING all this time, of course, no one thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Dr. Kramm's creation in connection with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">epidemic. Dr. Kramm and his creation alike, in fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had both passed from the public mind--until, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenness of a fresh disaster, they were recalled. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an obscure young physician who, working in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory of one of the smaller medical colleges, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">the revealing observation. Peering under a high-power</seg><seg type="columnLine">microscope at a particle of blood from a victim of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"fainting sickness"--as the disease had come to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">called--he observed a number of transparent, formless</seg><seg type="columnLine">motes, which made their way slowly through the blood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream, and which, coming into contact with the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">corpuscles, flung themselves destructively upon those</seg><seg type="columnLine">essential cells. Here, manifestly, was the cause of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"fainting sickness!" Here was a microbe new to</seg><seg type="columnLine">science! Yet the manner of its action was evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough: it was a sort of carnivorous monster that</seg><seg type="columnLine">preyed upon the blood cells; and, having entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circulatory system, it would multiply with great rapid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity and destroy corpuscles by the wholesale, until not</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough were left to sustain life. Only in the excep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional case was the resistance of the body sufficient to</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcome this potent germ.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But whence came the germ ? How did it happen that</seg><seg type="columnLine">so formidable and unique a species had escaped all</seg><seg type="columnLine">previous observation? At first the investigator found</seg><seg type="columnLine">these questions impossible to answer; having no first-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand acquaintance with Dr. Kramm's discovery, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no means of identifying the new-found mote. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his colleagues, however, had been a member of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">party invited to Kramm's laboratory, and could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">fail to recognize the amorphous moving particles that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had constituted the triumph of Kramm's lifetime!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And thus, almost in a flash, the dismal truth came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be understood: Dr. Kramm, in solving the secret of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, had at the same time lent aid to the emissaries of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death. The cell which he had created so laboriously</seg><seg type="columnLine">had turned out to be a disease germ of unexampled</seg><seg type="columnLine">virulence!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the announcement of this fact, important as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, for a while promised to be barren of practical</seg><seg type="columnLine">results. It was one thing to have ascertained the cause</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the "fainting sickness"; it was quite another thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to determine how to conquer that cause. With set</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth, and haggard, anxious faces, physicians all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world gave themselves to the problem; they experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented with toxins and anti-toxins, with fumes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaccines and chemicals of a thousand kinds; they tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">radium, and X-rays, and electricity, and glandular</seg><seg type="columnLine">treatments; they battled to find some opposing, harm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less bacteria; they flung down their lives in seeking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">means to prevent the spread of the disease-bearer. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">all to no avail! They did not even know how the sick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness was communicated--and their efforts only served</seg><seg type="columnLine">to emphasize their despair. All the while, like some</seg><seg type="columnLine">malevolent spirit, the disease was spreading; all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">while it was snatching victims right and left from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cringing, praying, demoralized, shuddering ranks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mankind; whole tribes were being -nnihilated, whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">districts emptied of human life; there was scarcely a</seg><seg type="columnLine">community, throughout the wide reach of the civilized</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, that had not been made desolate; there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely a town or hamlet that had not known the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tears of mothers, the moans of bereaved wives and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">orphaned children, the sighs of the afflicted and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying, and the lamentations of the long funeral pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessions. After three months, the human race had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been decimated, and still the pestilence, with long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">octopus-like tentacles, was reaching out blindly, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vouring, and devouring, and devouring. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was by ironic justice that the man innocently</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsible for the disaster should have been the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">largely instrumental in checking it. Dr. Kramm, over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">whelmed at the knowledge that his intended gift to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mankind had turned out to be a curse, had been giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhaustively of his days and nights in the attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">discover some remedy. And, from the beginning, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked on original lines. How, he asked himself, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "blood-mite" come to be scattered abroad ? He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done his best to keep all the cultures safely within his</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory; and it was inconceivable that his visitors</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have borne any of the cells away, since none had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come into direct contact with the cultures. What, then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the explanation ? In a startling flash of revelation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dr. Kramm recalled the incident of the open window</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of the fly settling on the blood-culture. Was it</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible that the insect had carried away some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">animalcules on its foot-pads, and that they had multi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied until they gave birth to world-wide pestilence?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knowing how rapidly all one-celled. organisms multi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply; knowing, also, how efficient flies may be as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">agents of disease, Dr. Kramm was not one to scoff at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this notion; instead, he set out immediately to test its</seg><seg type="columnLine">validity. He found that a fly, which he encouraged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to settle on a culture of the "blood-mite," did indeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear away the cells by the thousands; he found, more-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, upon examining hundreds of flies caught at ran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dom, that in three cases out of four, the creatures were</seg><seg type="columnLine">carriers of the dread disease. Furthermore, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessarily hurried investigations did not reveal any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other insect carriers of the disease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was therefore apparent to Kramm that the flies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while themselves immune to attack, had been the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seminators of the epidemic. Laden with germs gathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">from contact with the saliva, the excrement, or even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin of the victims, they had settled upon food, as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">result of which the germs had been transferred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found means of access to the human system. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE WAND OF CREATION</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">439</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">all simple enough, and quite in accordance with find-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings in regard to other and less vicious diseases; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same time, the remedy was obvious. Guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">against flies! Shun them as if they were venomous</seg><seg type="columnLine">serpents! Eat no food with which they came into con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tact ! War upon them as upon man-eating tigers! This</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning, flashed from end to end of the world upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kramm's urgent request, was translated into every</seg><seg type="columnLine">language, was posted in every town and village of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, was dinned and dinned into the ears of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people by medical advisers and lay speakers alike. For,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only if these orders were followed, was there any hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">of saving mankind. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Time has justified Dr. Kramm. The two years since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the outbreak of the plague have witnessed its almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">total suppression. Once men began to guard against</seg><seg type="columnLine">flies; once they began to shield themselves in terror and</seg><seg type="columnLine">loathing from the little winged menace, the "fainting</seg><seg type="columnLine">sickness" commenced to wane. For a while, to be sure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">new cases by the thousands continued to appear; but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not long before the numbers had diminished ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preciably, and the "blood-mite," denied means of access</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the human system, began to return to that oblivion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whence it had issued. But the toll it took was suffi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ciently severe. It will never be known positively how</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">many lives were snuffed out, but conservative estimates</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">place the loss at two hundred millions--a more deadly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">toll than that of any war ever waged!--while even to-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">day, in some outlying district when caution is relaxed,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">an occasional stray case of the disease is reported. But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it is believed that even such rare cases will eventually</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be averted, and that the "blood-mite" will soon be no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more than an interesting scientific remembrance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  None the less, a certain rumor now current cannot be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">disregarded. It is said that the governments of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">world, harboring secret cultures of the germ, are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">planning to use it as an instrument of aggression in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the next war--and to scatter it by a new-found means</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">much more effective than that presented by the fly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">One trusts, however, that such reports are mere fabri-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cations; it would be too ironic if Dr. Kramm, in his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">successful search for the secret of life, should have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">placed in the hands of his fellow men the means of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">driving human life from the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">END.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">What Do You Know?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"D EADERS of Amazing Stories have frequently commented upon the fact that there is more actual knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be gained through reading its pages than from many a textbook.

Walking briskly I left the confines of the tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">New Jersey village, and plunged into the dense woods</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hedged in my shack.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was already night, and I hurried, for I had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city man's fear of the dark. I met no one, though once</seg><seg type="columnLine">or twice I had the sensation that the woods were full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spying men. Once through the trees I saw the gleam</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what appeared to be the eyes of a cat, or a wolf,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I laughed that off, realizing it could be no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than two fireflies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I hurried on my way whistling. Then my furtive eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the gleam of glass. Ah, thought I, a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighbor! I resolved that I would pay him a visit the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next day. The shack was reached at last, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands trembling with joyful excitement, I pushed open</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door. I lit the oil lamp, filling it from a tin I kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">for that purpose. The night was warm and I needed no</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire. I busied myself in making the place habitable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was about five minutes later that I discovered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">theft, and the jewel. I had always kept an old suit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing hanging on a nail against an emergency, such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a wetting, for instance, although I always brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">an extra suit of khaki with me.

What could anyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">have wanted with that suit? Then I saw the jewel!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There, on a small shelf, where I usually kept my</seg><seg type="columnLine">toothbrush, hairbrush, razor, et cetera, quite close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rack on which I had hung the old suit, was the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect ruby I have ever seen. At least I thought it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a ruby. It flashed and glowed like a thing alive.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For several moments I stood there, too enraptured to</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch it. I knew immediately that the jewel had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">left in lieu of payment for the old suit! But what sort</seg><seg type="columnLine">of person would do such a thing? To whom could that</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit have been worth a ruby? A thief, an escaped con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vict? No. A thief or an escaped convict would hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">have considered payment at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went to sleep with that ruby under my pillow. And</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">440</seg><seg type="columnLine">tf We both started to our feet, and were unprepared for what followed. We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly plunging toward the ceiling as easily as a feather. By putting out a hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the ceiling we pushed ourselves downward to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for the first time the door and windows were locked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The next morning I was up early with a tingle in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood. Just outside my window I could hear the song</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stream as it bubbled and swirled among its rocks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pools. Dressing, I stopped only for a cup of coffee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All morning I fished, completely oblivious of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery. It was not until after three o'clock in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon, when I finally went to the shack for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">food, that I recalled the ruby. That jolt knocked all</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit out of me. I lost every desire to resume my sport.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sat brooding over the jewel. It was too strange. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">recalled the curses that some notorious jewels had cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">over their possessors. This might be such a gem. Or</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, what if the thief had not intentionally left it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">should return?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hurriedly I left the hut. I needed air, but the stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its trout did not lure me. The gleam of glass that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I had seen the night before, appeared again. The owner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that glass might know something about this mystery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anyway, I needed to talk to someone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half running, I quickly came to the spot where I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpsed the glass. There was no mistaking it; right</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was the converging of two paths. At first I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing; the trees and vegetation hid it, until looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward, I saw the gleam again. I thought it was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof of a greenhouse. Wondering who in the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">would build such a structure in this part of the country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I walked toward it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Strange Visitor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE country was clearing, and I came to the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a large natural open glade, where I stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">short. Astonishment halted me in my tracks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There in the center, or rather almost taking up the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">442</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tire clearing from one side to the other, reposed a giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">construction. It was cylindrical in section, and of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same general design as a torpedo, except that it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">two conical ends. It was fully a thousand feet long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps fifty feet in diameter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not stop to conjecture about the whys and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherefores of this strange thing. After my first sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise I walked up to examine it. It was glossy white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seemed to have a glass-like finish, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">opaque. I discovered later that it was constructed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass, but I would not have believed it then. I walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">all around trying to fathom its secret, its purpose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was not a single opening anywhere. It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have been made of some highly polished stone, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">picking up a sharp pebble, I tried to scratch the smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface. I pressed with all my might, but the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface withstood me. I could make no mark upon it</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the stone's tip was blunted. It was then that I per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived that the thing was of a clear transparent material,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the whiteness behind it might be a blind drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">over it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since a stone could not scratch it, I tried the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the diamond in my finger ring. It made not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest impression. Determined to discover some way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of breaking it, I backed away several yards, and picking</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a stone, hurled it with all my strength. The stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounced off like a rubber ball.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For all of an hour I dallied around the cylinder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to discover what it might be, or its purpose in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that spot. Half a dozen times I encircled it, running</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hands over it as low as possible and as high as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could reach, endeavoring to find some weak place on</seg><seg type="columnLine">its wide expanse. With much difficulty, for I was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">as slender then as I was once, nor as spry, I climbed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top of a young tree to see what lay atop. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing but a smooth, unbroken surface. My curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">osity was now very much aroused, but I could find no</seg><seg type="columnLine">plausible explanation. At last I decided to inquire about</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in the village.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the chagrin of a baffled man I picked up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather large rock, as I turned to go, and flung it with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">my strength against the thing, exactly as a peeved boy</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have done. I was startled to hear a deep hollow</seg><seg type="columnLine">boom. At least the thing was hollow. But the stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">left no blemish. In disgust I headed for the village.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then I was frightened by the most inhuman shriek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was beginning to get dark. It was that time of</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening when the dusk is settling and nothing seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">real in the half light. This is particularly true of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods. It came bearing down upon me, a thing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">white, that in the twilight appeared to tower over me</seg><seg type="columnLine">many feet. A ghost! I had no time to think. I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was clothed in flowing draperies that streamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind it. And in those flying things I saw a face--</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it could be called that. It seemed more like a mask</seg><seg type="columnLine">of many colors and distorted features. I saw all this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it descended upon me, screaming. And in the grow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing darkness I saw a pair of eyes that gleamed like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of a cat!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It closed down upon me--flesh and blood, strong and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiry! I could get no hold on it. Something fell on</seg><seg type="columnLine">my unprotected head, and there came a painful black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. I recall a hazy awareness of other beings and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being borne off toward the white cylinder, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the walls!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I regained my senses I was comfortably spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">out upon a wide soft couch. A blinding light filled my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, and I quickly closed them again. I lay there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering what had happened to me. Then like a flood</seg><seg type="columnLine">the memory of it all returned! The stolen suit, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange ruby, the white cylinder, the attack--it all came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I opened my eyes again; this time the light did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">bother me. I saw that I was in a room--the strangest</seg><seg type="columnLine">room I had ever seen. Close at hand, just below my</seg><seg type="columnLine">couch, lay a pool filled with water, that lapped gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the sides. Strange flowers, of forms and colors I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had never seen before, grew in pots around the pool.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The flooring was of tiles, and the ceiling was of glass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A light seemed to flow from the entire surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling, and lit the room with a diffused glow that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like sunlight. The walls of the chamber held my at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were of mosaic tiling, depicting a pretty piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of scenery. It was as if I were lying in a valley sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded on all sides by low tree-covered hills with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit of sky above. On one wall was a meandering river</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a pretty waterfall, and above it was the sun, only</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was shown as being relatively about as large as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">apple and half covered by clouds. Another wall showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a city of tiny white houses built on a terraced hill. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other walls carried out the hill scene. It was above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city that there was one bit of incongruity that spoiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire landscape. It appeared like a second sun, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost three times as large as a sun should be, and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">color was a pinkish lavender, that contrasted strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the greens, browns, blues, and whites of the scene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After looking about me, I sat up, and was immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately overcome with a dizziness and a shoulder that</seg><seg type="columnLine">pained. I now looked wildly about for a doorway, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing seemed to break the continuity of the tiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls. I tried to get to my feet. Finally I succeeded in</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing up. I swayed and reeled, fell into a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">faint a second time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN I regained consciousness I was back on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">couch. A man was bending over me. Beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">him I saw that a section of the wall had opened, sliding</seg><seg type="columnLine">into grooves on either side the opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do not attempt to rise," I heard him say, "your</seg><seg type="columnLine">collar bone has been fractured, so you must move about</seg><seg type="columnLine">as little as possible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I think I cursed; for the blood rushed to my head.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A pretty predicament I was in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The speaker continued. "I regret exceedingly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have been put to this discomfort, sir; my servant</seg><seg type="columnLine">was over-zealous in performing his duty!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "His duty!" I exploded. "Do you think it was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty to attack an innocent ..." here I fumbled for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Meddler?" supplied my host.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I bristled at that and was about to say something</seg><seg type="columnLine">caustic, but the surprise I experienced on looking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my host--or captor--made me forget my anger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a large fellow, standing a good six inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">over six feet, with a body perfectly proportioned. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of the statue I had seen in the Vatican of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apollo Belvedere. His feet were small and his hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">were almost as fine as a woman's. His clothing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut to show the body to advantage, fitting the legs as</seg><seg type="columnLine">OUT OF THE VOID</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">443</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly as a glove, with a smock cut close to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulders and low at the neck, and girdled tightly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still it was not his form that struck me so forcibly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was his skin! Picture a statue of fine well-polished</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver--silver generations old--radiating an inner lustre.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man was truly a silver man. Face, arms, hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even hair, fine as silk falling to his shoulders, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">silvery. Only the inner flush that glowed under the skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave proof of red blood behind that strange complexion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And he had lavender eyes!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was speechless! My eyes strayed about the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, to the man's stranger garments, and back to those</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar eyes. At last my tongue came free. "My</seg><seg type="columnLine">God!" I cried, "What kind of man are you?" A</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred questions raced through my mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We come," said the strange man, "from a most</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant planet, of which you on Earth are not aware, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet quite on the edge of your Solar system. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have no name for it but Abrui, which translated means</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Home.' However, we are concerned chiefly about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the present, and must consider this untoward situation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His words left me oddly chilly. A cold sweat broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">all over me. I could not think, but somewhere some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was repeating over and over again, "Men from</seg><seg type="columnLine">another planet, men from another planet!" I closed my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes to arrange my thoughts once more. I knew that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not dreaming, and that this was reality. There was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pain in my shoulder. I turned once more to the man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I don't understand? How did you come here?</seg><seg type="columnLine">How?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw him shrug his shoulders slightly, and I realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">he considered me a nincompoop. He answered, "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">are aboard an interplanetary vehicle. We call it the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yodvcrl, which in your language means 'The Ship of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Void.' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How is it then you speak my language?" I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That, my friend, is because I am not the first to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have traveled through space. He who went before was</seg><seg type="columnLine">from this, your native planet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tried to comprehend what he had said, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult. Having been penned in by a routine of busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness all my life, it was difficult for me to conceive such</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibilities or to follow such a train of thought as this</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's words had opened up for me! I saw he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for me to continue questioning him. "And now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you are here, what are your intentions ?" I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what a reception New York City would give this</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. Lindbergh and Dr. Eckener (who had but re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cently crossed the Atlantic from Germany in a dirigible)</seg><seg type="columnLine">would find their noses out of joint.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Secret Mission</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE was smiling at my question, and I had a feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that he had read my thoughts. "My mission</seg><seg type="columnLine">here is a secret one. I am concerned with noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of this world except one man, to whom I bear a</seg><seg type="columnLine">message. We arrived on this planet two nights since,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I hope that by to-morrow night we may be in posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to make our departure, that is, after we have re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned you safely to this spot." He sighed, but not I.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wanted to know what he meant by his last words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You, sir," he explained, "are luckily the only tres-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">passer who has had the misfortune to discover our retreat</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. We landed at night and slipped into this quiet</seg><seg type="columnLine">glade without discovery. On reaching your planet we</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked out a spot near one of your large cities. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed some equipment as well as a map, by which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">might find our destination. Fortune led us to New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York which we found by means of its great lights.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thence we traveled this far. I went foraging and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered the old suit in the cabin, which I take to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours, and I hoped that its owner would not return be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore we were on our way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When you came to find us it meant but one thing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wre had to capture you before you carried your story</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the village and brought intruders here. Hence you</seg><seg type="columnLine">find yourself within our vehicle. And though we re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gret it, we must act so as to insure the keeping of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret during our stay on Earth. You may rest assured,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, that you will be returned to this spot safe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">well."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced ruefully at my shoulder. "It will be six</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks before that can heal."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On the contrary. We have with us a salve which</seg><seg type="columnLine">has a healing power that your medical men would, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt, consider miraculous. Your collar bone will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely well within a week's time. Allow me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bandage it again and rub it with this salve."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he worked on my shoulder with his cooling un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guent, another man entered the chamber. He was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first, silvery and handsome, but somewhat younger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His knowledge of English was not equal to that of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">older man, nor did I take to him as readily as I had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his companion. He addressed my host as Sa Dak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the younger fellow answered to the name of Tor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, as I began to notice Sa Dak more particularly,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw that his face was one of power, while in the eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an expression that bespoke some great sorrow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no way to determine his age from his fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, and one could not see gray hairs among the silver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I judged him as a man in his prime, probably in the late</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirties or early forties. The other had no fine marks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of character in his youthful face, and his lavender eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressed no emotions. He seemed to me to be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than twenty-five years old.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After rubbing my shoulder well, Sa Dak asked if</seg><seg type="columnLine">it still pained. There was only the discomfort of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight bandage and an ache that was no more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight toothache. I admitted as much, and felt better</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the prospect of my imprisonment. Suddenly I</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered that I had told my wife I would stay away</seg><seg type="columnLine">several days, and she should not expect me until I</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed up. Somehow it never entered my mind to</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt Sa Dak's word, and I was looking forward with</seg><seg type="columnLine">childish curiosity to this strange adventure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then another creature entered the room. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was bearing a tray on which there were three glasses</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with liquid, and several dishes filled with food.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The servant was somewhat smaller than his master,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as finely built, and had an extremely intelligent</seg><seg type="columnLine">face; but his skin was different. Whereas his masters</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked silvery, he looked golden! Hair, skin, and lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">were like virgin gold polished, and glistening with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood flowing under the skin. And his eyes were red!</seg><seg type="columnLine">As red as vermilion, and they looked quite natural in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that golden face!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My host, on perceiving his entrance, said, "Ah, here .</seg><seg type="columnLine">444</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">is the culprit!" and rapidly he spoke to the fellow in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange tongue. The servant cringed, his tray trembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he looked in my direction. He managed to distribute</seg><seg type="columnLine">his burden among us and waited nearby while we ate</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drank. What the liquid was I did not know; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">food was also strange but was vegetable-like and very</seg><seg type="columnLine">delectable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After taking the dishes, the servant waited patiently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just beyond my couch, with fear in his strange eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His master paid him no attention, but continued speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When you appeared in our vicinity, we knew im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mediately that it would be necessary to make you our</seg><seg type="columnLine">captive. My companion and I enjoyed watching your</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to discover what we were, and when you started</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with the thought in your mind of making in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiries, and possibly to arouse the authorities, we sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">this poor fellow out to capture you. It was his over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zealousness in the duty of capturing you that caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to wound you. Hence he is now at your mercy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Punish him as you will." And with a movement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arm he brought the trembling slave into our circle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was greatly embarrassed. Had my captors sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested earlier, that I punish my tormentor, I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">gladly have taken an eye for an eye, giving him the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had given me, but the situation had taken a</seg><seg type="columnLine">different turn. I, who had thought these interplanetary</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitors the intruders, was convinced that I was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intruder. I managed somehow to smile, though I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling like a bully who was beaten by a smaller fellow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I waved the slave away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are to be complimented upon possessing a ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vant who performs his duties so fully," I said, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled smugly to myself as I thought what a good ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample of my countrymen I was setting myself up as,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in so magnanimously forgiving the man who had in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jured me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The silver man turned to the golden one and spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their soft language. The slave looked at me with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd eyes, and in the manner in which all mankind ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">presses gratitude, he threw himself at my feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking my hand in his, he kissed it. More embarrassed</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ever, I looked to Sa Dak for relief. He spoke and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slave slowly backed out of the room. It is needless</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say that during the rest of the time I spent on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yodverl he followed me about like a faithful dog, ful-</seg><seg type="columnLine">filling my desires before I had time to express them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was now quite dark outside and Sa Dak observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that within a short time we should be moving. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather inquisitive as to where our destination lay, but at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a motion from Sa Dak the other followed him and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">both hurried away through the doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Curiosity Uppermost Again</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CAUTIOUSLY I rose to my feet. This time I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew no dizziness, and I found that my shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der pained not at all. Walking to the door I</seg><seg type="columnLine">peered through and saw that a small chamber lay be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond. At its far side was a second doorway, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">surmised that the two silver men had proceeded through</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to their pilot room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced about the room. It was furnished very</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply, with furniture made from a strange light metal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a broad desk in the center, sitting on a square</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rug of gray, woven from some rough material like</seg><seg type="columnLine">camel's hair. Several chairs were set about, three-</seg><seg type="columnLine">legged chairs with seat and back built to conform to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lines of the body. All about the room were set</seg><seg type="columnLine">square cases three feet in height. I surmised that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained books, although the shelves were concealed</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind metal. I noted that the walls of the room were</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the ceiling and the light came from all sides. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing to relieve the whiteness of the glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The desk held my attention. On it was a tall slender</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">metal vase with one of those strange exotic flowers that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I had seen growing in the other room. Beside the vase</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were several strange oblong boxes of metal about ten</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">inches in length and only one inch in width. Curious,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I picked one up. On one side was a small metal tab</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which I immediately pulled. One side of the box drew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out and to it were attached about two dozen thin sheets</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of metal, each one as thin as a sheet of writing paper,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and on them was a strange form of writing. The letters</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were oddly shaped, and on examining them closely, I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">found that instead of having been printed or written,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they had been photographed on the sheet. I took this to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be a book.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Besides the several "books" which were on the desk,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was a square box of metal. Of course, I had no right to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be prying, but I was curious. I wanted to know all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there was to know about these people. It would be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">something to remember all my days. So without any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scruples I opened the box and let a cry of wonder es-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cape me; for there on the same sort of metal sheets was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">'a manuscript, written not in Abruian, but in English!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          To Professor Ezra Rollins</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Data Concerning the Results Gathered on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the Arrival of the Rollins Rocket Upon an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unknown Planet Called by Its Peoples</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Abrui."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With Greetings and Best Wishes to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Dana Gleason</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I looked no further, I closed the box, my mind now</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in a whirl. Dana Gleason, Dana Gleason. Where</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had I heard that name? Then it came to me. Years</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ago, when I was no more than a boy, I had heard</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the story of Dana Gleason, one of the wealthiest men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the world, of fine aristocratic stock, dating back to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the early settlement of the country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Dana Gleason had been one of the young society men</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whose very name brought envy to youthful hearts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tales of his exploits, his polo ponies, his yachts, his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">globe-trotting, were read avidly by the curious public.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">His marriage into another house of equal rank and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fortune appeared on the front pages of the newspapers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then for two years, at which time his baby was born,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dana Gleason was completely forgotten. Almost im-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mediately upon the arrival of the baby, both father and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">child disappeared completely. Later it was discovered</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that the father had spirited the baby away on his yacht.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Several weeks later there came a sensational story when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">young Mrs. Gleason was killed at a railroad crossing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in an automobile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  For months no more news was to be had, but an in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">quisitive reporter learned that the father had planned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">OUT OF THE VOID</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">445</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with the aid of nurses and tutors, to bring up his boy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">with a hatred of women. Five years later the last</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">woman left the yacht, but she had been paid not to give</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">interviews. Next we heard of'the yacht (which was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">almost as large as a small steamship) from various</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">corners of the world--from the north, east, west, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">south. Dana Gleason, Jr., was having the finest edu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cation that man could acquire. The greatest teachers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from every nation were taken aboard the yacht, and one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heard of the famous men of the day being invited for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cruises. The yacht was said to have a swimming pool, a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gymnasium, a chemical laboratory, and an astronomical</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">observatory. It carried its own wireless, and motion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pictures of historical events were screened especially</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for the benefit of the heir. The accounts of his life</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aboard the yacht read like fairy stories.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The child grew up, and his father and he were heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">of in every conceivable place on the globe. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">exploring the arctic regions, they had their fingers in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some political pie in Latin America. They were skiing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Biarritz; they were shooting tigers in India, lions in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Africa. They were at the Kentucky Derby; they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking in the night-life of New York. They were with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an archaeologist on the Nile; they were studying condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions in Manchuria. They were presented at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Russian Court; they were abducted by Arabs. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had attempted to climb Mount Everest. But why</seg><seg type="columnLine">should I write all this? You, too, have read these ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">counts and reveled in them and envied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> You, too, can recall when the Gleasons joined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">British forces to fight Germany. And you read the</seg><seg type="columnLine">account of Gleason Senior's death in the third year</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the War, and of the record the son made in the Air</seg><seg type="columnLine">Force. And that was the last you ever heard! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of Gleason was forgotten with the rising of new</seg><seg type="columnLine">stars of front-page brilliancy. What happened to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">son after the leadership of the father was gone ? Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">this manuscript perhaps the answer? Had Dana</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gleason, Jr., accomplished the last possible thing left</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him to do ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned again to the sheets of metal lying before me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as I started to read further, suddenly the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">about me began to fade, and I was in darkness! In</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder I looked about. Overhead, as through a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick glass, I could see the stars, and close at hand I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could make out the shapes of trees in the darkness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then as I gazed in wonder, I saw that we were rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the trees. Soon they were far below, and I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see nothing but the twinkling stars in the distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no pulsation, or vibration to suggest</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors; it was only a gentle rising and a feeling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">being suspended in space. Then through the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room I saw something that startled me. Two</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowing orbs had appeared in the doorway. It was my</seg><seg type="columnLine">host. He spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In traveling through the atmosphere of a planet, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut off our lights. Our light does not travel far; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is why we allowed it to shine in the clearing, but it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to be seen from below. I trust its absence does</seg><seg type="columnLine">not inconvenience you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I made some inane remark that passed. I enjoyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching our progress. I added that I regretted I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have the power to see in the dark as he had.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dana Gleason could never become quite accustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the fact that we on Abrui could see in the dark as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">well as in daylight," he observed, and I realized that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that I had found the manuscript.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," he continued, "we are on the way to deliver</seg><seg type="columnLine">that report to Professor Rollins who invented the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">interplanetary vehicle. We are bound for Africa.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Come, join us in the pilot room."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Looking Over the Works</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I FOLLOWED him into the nose of the machine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here the pilot, Tor, sat at some controls. All about</seg><seg type="columnLine">us was clear glass; below we could see the woods</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were leaving. A small light glowed here, a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">round globe that contained a light in its center, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I could see no connecting wires fastened to it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A shade trained its light down upon a map of the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hemispheres, so that the light could be perceived no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where else. I could see faintly two vertical rods rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">from floor to ceiling, upon which were various levers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and meters, and with these the young man was working.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the map was drawn a line from the point which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had left, down through the center of the Atlantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean, along the equator to Africa. At a point approxi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mately three hundred miles above Johannesburg and</seg><seg type="columnLine">about one hundred miles in from the coast-line, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">destination was marked by a small cross.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A chair was given me and I sat down where I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good view of everything around us. Below we saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lights of scattered communities, but these quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwindled to single lights of squatters and fishermen</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the Jersey salt marshes. Then the dunes slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">by and the rough waters of the Atlantic billowed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How long do you judge this trip will take?" I ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned the youth at the controls. Sa Dak had left us</seg><seg type="columnLine">for several minutes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not more than three ro, which equals about four and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half of your Earthly hours," he declared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was incredulous, but the estimate proved almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">correct, for we were there in exactly four hours! What</seg><seg type="columnLine">would Lindbergh say to that?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sa Dak returned from an examination of the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors. These engines were located in the far end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. All I gathered from the details that he gave me</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that the power of these motors was derived from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that element very rare on Earth--radium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fifteen minutes or so passed. We saw a ship with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its lights all aglow steaming on to New York. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pretty sight. I wondered what its passengers would</seg><seg type="columnLine">say if they could see us. My host suggested that I lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">down for a while, for my shoulder was still sore and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it best for me to rest as much as possible. He,</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, led me back to my couch so that I should not</seg><seg type="columnLine">stumble in the darkness. I was tired and the bone was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to ache 'from weariness. The golden servant</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon appeared, with a glass of liquid that was strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">refreshing. After I had sipped it, the stranger in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sisted that he must dress my shoulder. He rubbed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">salve in with his cool deft fingers, then with a salaam</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was gone, and I fell asleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two hours later I awoke and returned to the pilot</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. The two men were still at the controls. Water</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay below us. We saw another ship bound, we sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed, for Capetown. We quickly passed it by. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">another half hour the servant appeared again with food,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of cooked fruit. I might note here that all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">446</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dishes with which we had been served, including those</seg><seg type="columnLine">containing liquids, which later I have called glasses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were really of metal, like almost everything else the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abruians used.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last we saw the shore line of Africa, and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">skirting it for some distance we turned inland and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide unvarying veld, with its low hills, and occasional</seg><seg type="columnLine">groves of tropical trees, was below us. The moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">had risen very late and now it was shedding its silvery</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow upon everything. The skin of the two strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">men caught its light and reflected it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lights now shone out in two or three directions; here</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lone camp fire of some traveler or hunter; there the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house lights of an isolated farmhouse. Then we came</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly to a halt, hung suspended for several minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air, and like a rocket we shot down toward a</seg><seg type="columnLine">group of three lights that were shining from a low</seg><seg type="columnLine">bungalow and its accompanying outhouses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was now one o'clock in the morning and the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay still. Quietly, for all its bulk, the Yodverl made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing, sinking down on the smooth grass several</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards from the darkened house. The bungalow</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not completely dark, for lights shone from two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its windows. A single light burned in the Negroes'</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters beyond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have arrived," stated my host. "It is rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">late to be calling, but I believe we will be welcome."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, turning to his companion, he made a remark in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own tongue and disappeared through the doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was some voyage," I remarked to the youth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled. "It was necessary for us to travel at so</seg><seg type="columnLine">low a speed," he said, quietly putting me in my place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Out in space we travel many times faster than this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had noted from the start that this fellow spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">English with more difficulty than did Sa Dak. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an English that had been learned book-wise and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spoke haltingly as he carefully picked each word.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sa Dak's mastery of the language was different. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect ease he used our idioms and slang expressions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and never seemed at a loss for a word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sa Dak reappeared shortly. He had changed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing and was dressed in a suit of white linen. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly clothing could not hide the beauty of his superb</seg><seg type="columnLine">body with its easy natural grace. Instead it made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">look taller, more massive, and more outstanding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The suit I took from your cabin was too small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfortunately," he said, "but it had to do until I reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">a store where they could fit me properly. This is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only suit they had that fitted me without alteration."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I wondered how he had managed to walk around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the streets of New York without attracting a crowd,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but then New York was accustomed to all sorts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange people on its streets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," remarked the man, "I did cause a stir. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, I had painted my skin to a semblance of white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the first pawnshop I came to, I sold several jewels</seg><seg type="columnLine">to obtain money with which I purchased a pair of dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses to hide my eyes. But my size continued to at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tract attention, and several people made remarks about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the circus in town." He laughed at the memory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could not quite accustom myself to the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this man could read my thoughts. From the first I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that he had been aware of what passed through</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind. It was unnecessary for me to as much as ask</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a question; he answered before I voiced my question.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even now he was explaining:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Reading another's mind is merely a science, my good</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir. Your world is coming to it. The difficulty in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">world is in keeping the other fellow from reading your</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. My friend here," and he pointed to Tor, "as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as my servant, have no trouble in reading what</seg><seg type="columnLine">passes through your brain. I have had much pleasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">in learning your reactions to us, but let me explain that</seg><seg type="columnLine">human nature is much the same the Universe over, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">any man of Abrui would react exactly as you have done</seg><seg type="columnLine">under similar conditions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His words made me rather uncomfortable, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">look in the smiling lavender eyes comforted me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Old Scientist</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">4	' A ND now, sir," he went on, "would you care</seg><seg type="columnLine">/â A to accompany me on my little visit? I feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">â *- that I owe you some recompense for detaining</seg><seg type="columnLine">you as my prisoner. Perhaps you will be interested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is to come. The person we are visiting is Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Ezra Rollins, a scientist that should hold the</seg><seg type="columnLine">highest place amongst your great men, but he prefers</seg><seg type="columnLine">to end his days in this deserted spot. Shall we go?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gladly accompanied him, my broken bone now com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely forgotten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My idea of how we had entered this craft was that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come in through its glass walls. My kindly host</seg><seg type="columnLine">now pressed a small lever that was fitted on his desk</seg><seg type="columnLine">top. To my surprise a doorway opened where there</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been naught visible but a blank wall. The door</seg><seg type="columnLine">was simply a large square section which slid outward</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now rested on the grass outside. "There are forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">layers of glass here," explained Sa Dak. "Our glass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlike earthly glass, is almost unbreakable, yet I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not like to take a chance on the possibility of a crack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hence the thickness, made up of plates set in layers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one over the other to several of your feet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No wonder I could not throw a stone through it," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He grinned. "You gave us quite a bit of merriment</seg><seg type="columnLine">in your attempts."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We walked over to the compound of the bungalow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dogs were howling from their kennels, but none came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stay our progress to the front door. A cool night</seg><seg type="columnLine">breeze was stirring. Somewhere off in the distance we</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a lion roar. Sa Dak knocked on the house door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We heard the shuffle of feet. "What is it?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">a querulous old voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One who comes with a message."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then kindly come in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door was opened and I followed the silver man</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a cosy little room, a much-lived-in room. A lighted</seg><seg type="columnLine">lamp was on the table; the Professor had been reading.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was a little old man with the high smooth forehead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the savant, but his eyes were burned-out lights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a late hour to be calling, sir," said Sa Dak. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw your light and concluded you were awake."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old man shrugged his shoulders. "I can not</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep. I can only wait."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For a message?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The old eyes brightened, then saddened again. "A</seg><seg type="columnLine">message that can never come.

For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time he seemed to note the strange appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his nocturnal guest. "Did you, too, come from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars ?" he questioned almost fearfully.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Abruian shook his head.

He picked him up as easily as if he were a child</seg><seg type="columnLine">and laid him tenderly on a divan close at hand. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were aware of a slender girlish form that had en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the room and rushed to the old man. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you done? What have you done?" she moaned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You have killed my uncle!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He has only fainted. His heart is weak, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">erred in not speaking more carefully. Water, please!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">His calm voice reassured her and she hurried for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass of water; but the Professor was already recov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering. Tears commenced to flow down his cheeks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The other hastened to speak. "I am sorry, sir. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">broached my subject poorly. Dana Gleason and Richard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorr live, but the planet they reached was a more dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tant one than the planet you call Mars.

Ah . . . the message . . . you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The manuscript was brought forth. Quickly Rollins</seg><seg type="columnLine">was scanning the pages. "Ah, Dana's handwriting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thank God, they are safe!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fumbled for his glasses and putting them on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose, began to read. The girl with the glass of water</seg><seg type="columnLine">still in her hand stood beyond the table. She was hold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her dressing gown at her throat. I saw then that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was not so young as I at first imagined. Obviously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had already passed her twenties; the bloom of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth was gone, given without thought of self to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">service of the old scientist. She was Elsie Rollins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">niece of the professor. It is to her I owe the story of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that had gone before this date. When years had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed, she came to me in New York to help me in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">work, and so together we compiled this record, giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts and descriptions as we remembered them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Ezra Rollins had been a world famous</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure not so many years before. When he let it be</seg><seg type="columnLine">known that he was working on a vehicle that could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">carry a man to the moon; or better still, to our sister</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet, Mars, he had been ridiculed until, in disgust,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he left the college where he had held the scientific re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">search chair, and had come to Africa to work un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">molested by reporters, who had interviewed him only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to laugh at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With him had come his several disciples who believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">fervently in his theory. A mechanical engineer and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">world renowned astronomer had joined him in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreat, and for almost twenty years they had worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">together over the plans, until at last the gigantic rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were to shoot to Mars was ready. All that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was needed was the man who would undertake the</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey. It required a man of great daring and cour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age, a man who would be willing to sacrifice everything,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even his life, in the hazardous feat. It needed a young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, a man of learning, an extraordinary man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For two years Rollins had roamed through the cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for his subject, as he may be called, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last he found him, a youth whose life's training seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have fitted him for this very deed. Dana Gleason,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jr., had finished in the War with great honor, but now</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was at loose ends, bereaved of his father, with no</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend, and a family of which he knew no member. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dotoe everything that man could do on the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth, and he had become undeniably bored with life</seg><seg type="columnLine">thereon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gleason did not jump at the chance to go to Mars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At first he thought the scientist was crazy. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized that he was in an extremely sane state of mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that all plans had been developed, and that the rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">was there and ready, he agreed to consider the sugges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion ; and he considered it as soberly as such a proposi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion could be considered. He accepted the Professor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">invitation. He waited only long enough to make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">will and straighten up all his earthly affairs; thence-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth he was in Rollins' keeping.</seg><seg type="columnLine">448</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Getting Ready for the Trip</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT WAS seven months before the rocket was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot into Space, for then Mars would be in per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect conjunction with Earth for the experiment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In that time Rollins taught the brave youngster of</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-six years all he would have to know on landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the red planet. Once there, he was to set to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">to build a gigantic radio, a replica of the one which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">stored in the attic of the Rollins bungalow, and broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast his find to Earth. Then if he discovered intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gent beings on the planet, which was a probability, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, with their aid, to get himself shot back to Earth!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Rollins described Dana Gleason as being a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender young chap about five feet seven inches in</seg><seg type="columnLine">height, with dark chestnut hair, brown eyes that were</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost black and a fair complexion, regular features</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were almost girlish except for a masculinity de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped by the full life of a globe-trotter. He was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet person, little given to talking, with a throaty but</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-trained voice. Only in anger would he become elo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quent, and then his tones were rich, though not very</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep. He seemed rather temperamental, given to moods</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were affected by the elements--rain made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreamy; storms excited him, bringing color to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks; but the sun left him a quiet and serious person.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he spoke of his proposed journey in the rocket his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes sparkled and glowed. On horseback he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">roam for hours on the veld, and though he enjoyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chase he seldom bagged any game. He was witty</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a somewhat satirical turn to his humor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spent much of his time reading the heavy volumes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Professor gave him, and he had a lively in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest in the mechanics of the rocket. He made friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">readily with the workers and scientists, asking ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, learning facts. His thirst for knowledge of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">things was extraordinary. He would go on long walks</seg><seg type="columnLine">with one of his new friends, or sit relating to them</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of his own experiences, though he was never one</seg><seg type="columnLine">to brag. And he never spoke of his wealth. His bear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with servants was such that he was greatly beloved</seg><seg type="columnLine">by them. However, he never made any overtures of</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendship to Elsie Rollins, preferring rather the society</seg><seg type="columnLine">of men. He showed that he appreciated the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl had set him on a pedestal and admired him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his attitude to her was one of consideration, but during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seven months of his sojourn on the veld, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">never one of his intimates. He had great respect for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Rollins and they became as true friends as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disparity in age would permit. He had one friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">to whom he appeared to be drawn on sight. That one</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Richard Dorr.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Richard Dorr was practically the only neighbor that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Rollinses had, aside from the inhabitants of the few</seg><seg type="columnLine">native villages here and there. He was by profession</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mining engineer, and somewhere in the hills was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold mine, but on his word it was a poor sort, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not seem to spend much time there. With him had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come the rumor of an affaire de coeur that had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone well, and one could wonder, having seen him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how any woman could give him up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was tall above the average, broad of shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and graceful of limb, strong and powerful, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of a viking. His blue eyes were accustomed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking over great distances. His hair was the color</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of old copper and crinkled and shone in the sun. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin had been tanned nearly to the shade of his hair,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that he looked almost as if he had been cast out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of reddish metal. He was a great humanitarian, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was known that he was doing a lot to help the natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Africa find themselves. All the servants within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Rollins' compound adored him. Out in the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might have become a great leader of men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first he paid little attention to young Gleason. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed him no more than he noticed the other men</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him. He and Professor Rollins were staunch</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends and could sit for hours discussing the rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">around which the latter's life revolved. Dorr had given</seg><seg type="columnLine">many valuable suggestions for it, and had been at</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to help during the casting of parts that could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be obtained in any market. He had known and</seg><seg type="columnLine">played with Elsie since she came to the veld at the age</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ten when both her father and mother died. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen the friendship grow up between Gleason</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Dorr, and noted the many hours they were to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many evenings were spent in the little sitting room of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bungalow, with the three men reading and talking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the girl sat in her corner mending and embroi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering. Secretly she was initialing all of Gleason's hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kerchiefs and shirts. Often the four sat down to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">game of bridge. One night she surprised an expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion she could not fathom on the face of Dorr as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat studying the absorbed face of Dana Gleason sit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting there reading one of the Professor's heavy tomes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was an expression that she could not interpret and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it puzzled her for many a day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Dorr's visits became less and less frequent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">days passed before they would hear the beat of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">horse's hoofs across the veld. His absences were</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted. Once a time intervened and a boy was sent to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn if he were sick. He returned with the answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was merely busy. And when he came, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an evident surliness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The time drew near for the departure. One evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rollins faced Gleason. "In just six days, my boy, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall go!" he told him, and Rollins' eyes shone brightly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no change of expression on the youth's face;</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was only a new glitter in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A messenger was dispatched to Dorr to apprise him</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fact. He came that night, and a quiet evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">was spent. Not until he was ready to leave did he</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak directly to Gleason. The Professor had gone into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kitchen for a glass of water; Miss Rollins was</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated in the shadows, unnoticed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you are going through with this?" Dorr had</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly demanded of Gleason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other looked up in surprise. Then he straight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened and got to his feet. "And what reason have you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to believe that I should not?" he asked coldly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I had, or rather thought I had a reason, Dana</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gleason, but I see now that I was wrong." And</seg><seg type="columnLine">without another word he had gone out of the door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rollins returned surprised that he had gone without</seg><seg type="columnLine">a word of farewell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This is an opportune cfioment to speak of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehicle that was to carry the youth on his way. Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rollins has described it to me and tried to make me</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand the principle by which it worked. As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">OUT OF</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE VOID</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">449</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">said before, I am a layman and have little knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of machinery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Great Invention</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE machine was a great cylindrical thing eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet long and about fifty feet in diam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eter. Its walls were very thick and its nose was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pierced through with great springs. It was of smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel and the only things to break its surface were four</seg><seg type="columnLine">great windows, many inches in thickness, set in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">girdle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within was a space hermetically sealed, in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the living-rooms for the traveler. These were</seg><seg type="columnLine">slung on springs which were set in slides in such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner as to keep the chambers within on an even keel</seg><seg type="columnLine">no matter how the shell might twist and turn. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">living quarters a passage led to the great windows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where small cells were provided for the observer. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">living room was no larger than an ordinary chamber,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen feet by ten, and only seven feet high. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason for the low ceiling was that once outside of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth's power, there would be no gravity, and the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mate of the room would find himself without weight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps floating about the room. By pushing against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ceiling he could draw and push himself about. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same reason rails were set around the room at con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">venient heights, and the floor, walls, and ceiling were</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily padded. Chairs, table, and cupboards were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened to the floor, and a low padded seat the width</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a bed ran around the entire chamber. Here the voy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ager would sleep. Pillows and coverlets were stored</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cupboards beneath the seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond the living room was a small kitchen wherein</seg><seg type="columnLine">was installed an electric stove, an iceless refrigerator,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cupboard for dishes, and a small sink. Food, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrated form, and water were provided to last</seg><seg type="columnLine">for almost a year's time. There was also a goodly</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply of fresh foods. The rocket carried its own</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamo with sufficient battery to keep it running for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several months. For the purification of the air, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same device that is used in submarines, which renews</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air by absorbing the carbon dioxide by soda-lime,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and purifying the air chemically was used. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were also tanks of fresh oxygen provided and by open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a valve this could be let into the room. Oxygen</seg><seg type="columnLine">masks and portable cylinders were also stored, to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">used if the traveler found he could not breath the air</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Because of his lack of technical knowledge, the writer has failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to explain the fundamental processes by which the rocket, when once</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the atmosphere of Earth, could hold and increase its speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it flew through Space._</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First, one must take into consideration Newton's Third Law of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Motion, i.e., "to every action there is an equal and opposite re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">action"; that to push anything forward there must be a backward</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion, just as a man in walking pushes with one foot backwards as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he propels his body forward. In Professor Rollins' rocket, this push</seg><seg type="columnLine">is given by means of a "kick" from an explosive powder. This pow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der is confined in a strong steel chamber capable of resisting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ressure of the explosion, and the gases thereof are ejected through, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">riven out of the base of the cartridge through an expanding nozzle, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nozzle that resembles that of a steam turbine, and is designed to give the</seg><seg type="columnLine">highest possible velocity to the gas. In this manner a great rate of speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be obtained, each explosion adding acceleration to the speeding body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the "shooting" of each cartridge of powder the chamber is</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown^ off, so that those kept are full ones. This gives the rocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">less weight, and consequently greater velocity. So with each ejection</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gas the speed of the rocket has a twofold increase; and though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine can start at a comparatively slow rate, the nearer it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">19 its destination the faster it is traveling. On sighting its destina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion the traveler will then shut off all power, so that the rocket will</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrive in the atmosphere of the planet traveling only on the acquired</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentum, and an easy landing can be made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  On the rocket, weight, as it may be termed, would be greatly in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased by the rapid acceleration at the start, but this was all cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culated in advance and allowed for; the acceleration would also be</seg><seg type="columnLine">under perfect control, being maintained by means of a time-clock at</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as great a degree as the passenger could stand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the alien planet. Adjoining the living quarters was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bathroom with all its necessary fixtures; the medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cine chest was stored with innumerable tubes of tooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">paste, powders, soaps, et cetera, together with medicines</seg><seg type="columnLine">for first aid. Nothing, Miss Rollins said, was missing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Below was stored a small dismounted airplane to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">put together for use in an emergency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The machinery that was to keep the rocket moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">was set in the stern. Once released, powder was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot off automatically, causing explosions which fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nished its source of power.*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hour came. For the two preceding days the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, laboratory, and compound seethed with activity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and last minute preparations were made. Everyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too excited to think, but Elsie Rollins continued to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder why Richard Dorr had not made his appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance since the night he had spoken to Gleason so</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The rocket had been slung long since on the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">catapult that would shoot it off, and there was much</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing of the ladder and last inspection. Only news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper reporters were missing. Then there was supper,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when all the mechanics, helpers, engineers, and scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tists gathered together for the last time to pay homage</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the valiant youth who was putting his life into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">care of the God of the Void. Toasts were drunk to suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cess, to the Professor, to one and all. It was a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet meal, though the Professor was in high spirits</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there was a slight flush on the cheek of Dana</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gleason.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The meal came to an end and Gleason retired to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping room to gather his last personal effects. Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rollins had seen to it that his linen, his socks, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">handkerchiefs were all ready. He was aTso taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">several suits of khaki. The last thing he did before</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the bungalow was to stuff his pockets full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">chocolate and cigarets, though several large cases were</seg><seg type="columnLine">stored in the rocket. A number of cases of whiskey</seg><seg type="columnLine">for stimulant and medicinal purposes were also pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was just about time to start. The rocket was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be shot at exactly twenty-two and a half minutes after</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight o'clock. How long the trip would take was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain. Professor Rollins judged it would take about</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven weeks. Of course, he had experimented with</seg><seg type="columnLine">miniature rockets in a vacuum, but how fast the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket would travel was conjectural.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were the farewells, the last bits of advice were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being given, the last round of handshaking was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">on. Gleason leaned over and kissed Elsie Rollins'</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheek gently and then he was climbing the ladder with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Professor, who had one more word to say. And so</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dana Gleason, Jr., disappeared from the sight of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the aerial vehicle. Rollins went in but reappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a few minutes and started his way down the ladder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came the unexpected. All were too engrossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the leave-taking to hear the beat of horses' hoofs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and none was aware of Richard Dorr's arrival, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had his hands on the ladder. In his hurry and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citement, he almost threw Rollins off his balance. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready Gleason wa? drawing to the great door, fitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its socket like the breach-block of a cannon, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dorr slipped within.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For another minute the door stood open, then slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ponderously it closed--just at the moment that</seg><seg type="columnLine">450</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor Rollins placed his hand on the release lever.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is doubtful whether, in the high tension of that mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, he realized that a second passenger was on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to Mars!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a deafening explosion, the force of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent large pieces of machinery flying through the air,</seg><seg type="columnLine">killing two mechanics, wounding several others, and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">but killing the Professor. He was knocked unconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">and did not recover for many minutes, so that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not an eyewitness to that awful departure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PROFESSOR ROLLINS now looked up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his study of the manuscript the silver man had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him. His face was screwed up into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grimace such as a child would make, his mouth trem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling. "But . . . but this contains nothing but facts</seg><seg type="columnLine">about this unknown planet," he muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," said Sa Dak, "Dana Gleason has made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthy survey of the planet. I find it complete."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is all right for the universities, but that isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I want, man. I want Dana's own story. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened? What happened?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other smiled gently. "That is all there is, sir."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tears came to the eyes of the old man. "And I want</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. I want facts. I must know just what occurred,</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything that took place, the story, the story. . . ." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked up helplessly. "You say they are well and</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy. How did they find this happiness and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentment ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "It is a long story, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know it then ?

Will you accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany me to my machine, sir, or shall I bring it here?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We will go with you, only let's hurry!" cried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man in his excitement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you, Miss Rollins ?" inquired Sa Dak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She nodded, then remembering that she was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed for outdoors, asked that we wait a moment. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned very soon, with a light coat on. We went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Yodverl, whose glass surface was aglow with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">inner lights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My host and the Professor walked ahead. Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rollins and I followed. Sa Dak was trying to direct</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eye of the scientist to the construction of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehicle modeled after the Professor's invention, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man paid no attention; he was intent on hearing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story. I told Miss Rollins something of my abduction,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she told me a little more of what had preceded that</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounding departure. Soon we entered the vehicle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tor was there to greet us. Sa Dak explained why</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were there, and then he turned to us. "Now," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "if you will accompany me through the vehicle</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can demonstrate to you some of the devices which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dana Gleason and Richard Dorr found in use on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abrui. That will make the telling of the story easier</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The House of a "Neighbor"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I WAS beginning to feel a little weak on account of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my shoulder, but, forcing it from my mind, I fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed the little party. We went into the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which I first found myself. "This," said our host,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"is called the 'atol' or main living room of the Abruian</seg><seg type="columnLine">home. Here is where the family gather to eat their</seg><seg type="columnLine">meals and discuss the day's events. Here they greet</seg><seg type="columnLine">their friends, here they start the day with their morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">swim. The lowliest home possesses its swimming pool,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its potted flowers, its scenic walls. The scene you see</seg><seg type="columnLine">depicted here is typical of Abruin scenery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In arranging the rooms in my rocket, I have tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reproduce exactly my home in Abrui," he continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he led us to the next room, which proved to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small reproduction of the first room, with a smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">pool, and fewer flowers. There were four small door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways, two in either wall, leading to bedrooms. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene on the walls was that of a garden. A group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">two or three women were seated on low stone benches</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the shade of some low trees, and a short distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, two men were practicing some knife play, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding a short dagger in either hand with which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempted to break through the other's guard. On an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other wall several children were seated in a circle, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the markers of some strange game in their hands. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden slave-girl stood near by with a silver baby in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms. A game of tag, played by youths of about fif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teen or sixteen, was in progress among some shrub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beries. Another slave was working in a flower bed. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a happy life-like scene and the reproductions of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people of Abrui were very fine. I noticed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">costume worn by the women was exactly like that worn</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Tor, while the children wore suits of the same style,</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat abbreviated. One of the women wore a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long flowing cape that fastened to the shoulder and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached to the ground. The colors used were of every</seg><seg type="columnLine">shade and hue and some were unknown to us. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">light that shone over everything was rosy and seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come from the overlarge pinkish globe that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen painted in the Atol, and had objected to. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in truth the second sun of Abrui!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This room," said Sa Dak, "is called the *cof\ and is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inner room of the house. Here is one of the bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms," and he brushed aside the curtains of one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the small doorways, revealing a small cell-like chamber</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnished simply with a wide couch, a chair, a chest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawers, and a long mirror. "In these rooms the family</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep, but this chamber is sacred to the women of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house. Here they come when not disposed to mingle</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their friends, and only the family are allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance. Here the mistress of the house carries on</seg><seg type="columnLine">her affairs and directs the welfare of her house."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next room we were informed was the kitchen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though at first glance it was no more than a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber with the walls of opaque glass. However, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">touching a small lever close to the doorway, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">transformed. The glass covering opened out, reveal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing shelf after shelf containing various dishes. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">one side was a glass-enclosed refrigerator and we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the array of food placed within. All around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room projected a piece of smooth glass about two feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the room. This could be utilized for the table. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw neither stove nor any other means for cooking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were enlightened, however. Removing a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">dish made of glass from one of the shelves, our host</seg><seg type="columnLine">took from the refrigerator (which I call by that name,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although there was no visible means for the preserva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of food) a strange vegetable about the size of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grapefruit. This he dropped into the glass dish he held</seg><seg type="columnLine">OUT OF THE VOID</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">451</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in his hand. Immediately before our eyes a change</seg><seg type="columnLine">took place. The food began to cook! We saw it soften,</seg><seg type="columnLine">its juices run, and a delicious odor filled the room. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than five minutes the vegetable was entirely cooked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taking three small metal plates from another cupboard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our host then served the vegetable on the plates, cut-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting it with a knife of glass. Tor went for three</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoon-like articles that had tiny prongs on their tips</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat like our ice-cream forks at home. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">vegetable was quite good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TAKING another glass dish, the man poured into it</seg><seg type="columnLine">some milk from a metal container and dropping into</seg><seg type="columnLine">it several small pellets, he stirred it well, while we</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the process that was taking place. The milk</seg><seg type="columnLine">had begun to freeze! When we ate it we found it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat like ice cream, flavored with something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">tasted like sweetened cinnamon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We all marveled over these utensils, and our host</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on to explain that the "cooking dishes" were</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated with a solution derived from radium, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused the food placed within to cook immediately. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the same for the "freezing dishes." Only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside of the dishes were treated, so that it was pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible to hold them in one's hand while the change was</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking place. The inside of the "refrigerator" had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been treated in a similar way, but to a less degree than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dishes, so that foods could be kept indefinitely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">still be edible. Haw my wife, who is quite a cook,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have envied such cooking methods!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall now show you our 'stable,' " went on Sa</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dak, and led us to a small chamber. Like the others,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was scrupulously clean. A low manger was arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one wall, and there were four of the prettiest little</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures I have ever seen. They were somewhat</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller than our cows, standing no more than three</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet high, and looked somewhat like deer, with soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">liquid eyes and faces that were dog-like. One was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">"bull" while two had the large, developed udders of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cow. The fourth creature was no more than a calf.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These are called muti. The little one there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">born since leaving Abrui!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The little creatures had looked up at our entrance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in their eyes was an expression of intelligence</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is never seen in the eyes of earthly cattle. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">master made some soft sounds in his throat, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was response from the bull, who made a like sound. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minute or two they continued and it almost seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if they were actually talking. "Yes," went on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, "we have discovered the language of our beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and make it a practice to converse with them!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We showed our astonishment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And why not?" he continued. "Why should ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mals lie denied the right of speech? Naturally, their</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligence is not equal to the thinking mind of man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it is far better that they understand what is ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected of them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How can you kill them then? It seems horrible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to think of eating their flesh," observed Elsie</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rollins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man smiled. "We do not eat their flesh, Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rollins! That is, civilized man does not. We know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fruits and vegetables are quite as strength-giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">as meat. No, our muti are raised only for the milk</seg><seg type="columnLine">they give. And when that supply is gone the animal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">is simply done away with in a manner that gives no</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain. They know this, and understand that we treat</seg><seg type="columnLine">them no differently than we treat ourselves!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean that when age comes you kill the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is not that the better way? The aged are only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">burden to themselves as well as to others. Their value</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the state is nil. Only we do not kill! We go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep. We have discovered a ray that destroys animal</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, dissolving the compounds that make up our bodies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This ray turned upon us does away with the body com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pletely, the chemical compounds returning to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">former state. There is no pain, no suffering. Only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">last sweet sleep."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the soul?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Goes to its appointed place. Of that we do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretend to know anything."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could not but think how pleasant such an end would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be. No suffering, no funeral, no grave, no tomb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I would like to die that way," sighed the Professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw that Elsie Rollins was trying to break the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spell that these thoughts had wrapped about us. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">host was quick to see this, and he now suggested that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we return to the Atol where we could comfortably dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuss life on Abrui.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will notice," he said, "that the ceilings of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms we have passed through are all of glass. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">so on Abrui. Every house is but one floor in height.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The light from the two suns of the planet shines upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">these roofs, giving daylight to the rooms. Again we</seg><seg type="columnLine">use radium, which being a phosphorescent element,</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes into itself the sunlight thus distributed, responds</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it, and at night redispenses it, so that at all times we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have an even glow of light. We find that people living</seg><seg type="columnLine">under this light are greatly benefited. Disease is there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore completely done away with. It took many years</seg><seg type="columnLine">to discover this use of radium, for radium in its raw</seg><seg type="columnLine">state, as you must know, does bodily harm to anyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">exposed to it. We also have the means of shutting</seg><seg type="columnLine">this light off at will."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had now returned to the "living room." The</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden slave appeared, and was arranging several</seg><seg type="columnLine">couches into a small circle, and we were invited to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">our places there. Tor, the youth, had thrown himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor on a pile of cushions, while our host drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">up a chair that was standing near. My shoulder pained</seg><seg type="columnLine">again and I appreciated the relief of repose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a word from his master the slave left the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shortly returned, carrying a small black leather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound book. Miss Rollins exclaimed: "The diary of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dana Gleason!" It was handed to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps you will read a few of its entries for us;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they may prove of interest," said Sa Dak. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">already skimming the pages.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why here," she said, "is the date on which Uncle</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ezra first approached Dana with the proposition of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking the trip to Mars!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Read it," said the Professor. Since entering the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yodverl, Rollins seemed a different man. He had got-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten a new interest. He seemed younger and brighter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was happy, perhaps for the first time since that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fateful night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young woman acquiesced and commenced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">read in a clear voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">452	AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In the great fall of the rocket, both of them marveled at the	v\\\\l I/)////,,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">majesty of the breaking up.

He left me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my mind in a whirl. Shall I take this one chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a million ? Can I do it ? Would Dad have done it ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had the Professor only known me for what I am, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never have come to me, but haven't I proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself equal to any man?

Miss Rollins looked up in wonder. Her face had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone white as she read and a low groan from the Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor showed that he understood. "Dana Gleason, a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">woman!" The three of us exclaimed in one breath and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to our host.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled somewhat sadly and there was sorrow in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes.

I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine what had made him think such a thing, know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing me as he did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The day had passed and at last I was ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave, forgetting Dorr entirely in my concern for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket. After a few more words and a warm hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">clasp the Professor backed out, and I was ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">swing the great door that would seal me within, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly Richard Dorr appeared at the aperture. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise I cried out for him to go back, for only a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes would elapse before I should be hurled on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Instead of obeying, he came toward me. 'For</seg><seg type="columnLine">God's sake,' I cried, 'go, the minutes are precious.' He</seg><seg type="columnLine">still came on with a smile on his face. Then he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand on the door and made ready to push it to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">'What are you doing?' I demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'I am going with you!' he said quietly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must have lost my head then, for I was command-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him to leave, even while I was fastening the bolts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pulling and adjusting the levers into place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'What ? Would you have me killed by the moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery?' he questioned and there was a twinkle in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I could say nothing, and then all conversation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut short. Rollins had pulled the lever, without taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">into consideration the fact that his friend was within.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The shock of the explosion was terrific and we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">both thrown off our feet. I had been thrown to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor in a corner and a great pressure seemed pushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon me, so that I felt I should be crushed. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was almost impossible to take a breath, so tightly were</seg><seg type="columnLine">my lungs compressed, and my ribs seemed strained to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a breaking point--then a darkness swept over me. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was several minutes before I came to, feeling bruised</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sore in all my body. Painfully I tried to sit up. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had known that something of this sort would happen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused by the great shock of shooting the rocket, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had not been prepared for anything as bad as this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T OOKING about I saw Dorr quite close to me. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 vwas coming out of his stupor. I managed to sit up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he did likewise. Later he admitted that he had be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved all the oxygen in the chamber had been forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">out leaving us without air to breathe. Everything was</seg><seg type="columnLine">working smoothly, however.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As we left earth we had both slipped to the rear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chamber as Earth's gravity tried to retain its hold</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">upon us. That, too, passedand we knew that strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of having practically no weight. We both started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our feet, and were unprepared for what followed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were suddenly plunging toward the ceiling as</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily as feathers. By putting out a hand against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling we pushed ourselves downward to the floor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so gained our feet. Grasping one of the hand-rails</seg><seg type="columnLine">we managed to keep there. Then by planting our feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly and using a swaying motion we were able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk upright. I could foresee funny experiences to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Well,' I observed quite superfluously, 'we are on</seg><seg type="columnLine">our way, out of Earth's orbit.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dorr shrugged his broad shoulders, and going into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bathroom, returned with a bottle of iodine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly painted a slight scratch on his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'How did you fare ?' he questioned, holding out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Impatiently I brushed it aside. 'Now, tell me why</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you come?' I demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'And if my reason does not suit, will you open</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door and ask me to step "out"?' he queried with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I could not help but laugh at such an idea, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited for my answer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Oh, I merely figured that two heads'll be better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than one, Dana Gleason,' he answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'And the true reason ?

I did not then, nor do I now, approve of you</seg><seg type="columnLine">or anyone else making this hazardous trip. One can die</seg><seg type="columnLine">much more easily at home. However, that is neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">here nor there.

We hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of the timed explosions that are now taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">place according to schedule, shooting us onward across</seg><seg type="columnLine">space. I examined the various meters that showed our</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate of velocity and our mileage.

We crept down</seg><seg type="columnLine">JL the short passage and faced the windows. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">first we could see nothing. We were in an inky black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, for since there is nothing to reflect the rays of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, they travel onward to more distant bodies. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">far off we began to distinguish the things we call stars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their brilliancy was almost blinding, for here there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is nothing to affect their rays. Overhead the milky</seg><seg type="columnLine">way glistened, and we saw the light of more stars than</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had ever seen upon Earth. Directly behind us lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sun, a great flaming ball that was blinding. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">little to the left, appearing as large though not as</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright as old Sol, was Mother Earth. Near her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovered the good old moon, now only a darker blot</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the dark side of the planet. In several direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, above and below, we could see the brilliant stars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They did not twinkle, but looked clearly back at us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After about an hour of this we returned to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters and I proceeded to take Dorr on a tour of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spection of our quarters. Then finding we were hungry</seg><seg type="columnLine">we sought food. There were enough fresh foods to last</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps three weeks--if the refrigeration held out. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a quantity of perishable foods that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold without refrigeration for awhile. We dined on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">young fried broiler that I knew thoughtful little Elsie</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rollins had prepared for me. I found a number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">jars of jam just as thoughtfully placed there for me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What wonder would be reflected in her brown eyes if</seg><seg type="columnLine">she knew that the 'hero' she has been worshiping all</seg><seg type="columnLine">these months was of her own sex. Had I been of dif-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent stuff I would have confided in her all my hopes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and desires, my joys and disappointments, but I am not</seg><seg type="columnLine">womanish or mannish enough either, to indulge in such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pastime. Never having had a confidant, I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know how to confide. Only this little book knows</seg><seg type="columnLine">me for what I am. How the devotees of the daily</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers would revel if they could read this volume! How</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously they used to seek 'copy' from Dad and me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I only trust that Mars knows nothing of yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">journalism."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So ended that entry. The next was made three</seg><seg type="columnLine">days later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Seventy-two hours have passed. I can't count by</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, for day and night are all one to us. Even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our lookout there is no change in that darkness about</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. We eat, sleep, and awake by the clock. Several</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteorites passed a few hours ago--great masses fall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, ever falling. Do they ever reach 'bottom' ? In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">look-out I feel as if I were trespassing upon the domain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the One who controls this great illimitable sameness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dick and I share alike in all the chores aboard our</seg><seg type="columnLine">'ship.'

Of dish-washing we make a great ado, jealously</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempting to prove our individual superiority in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">feat. We are both reading the heavy books with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Professor Rollins so thoroughly stocked the cup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boards--books that teach us even more about what we</seg><seg type="columnLine">are to expect on Mars. When the hour grows late and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are weary, the pillows and coverlets are brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their places. We lie down after first removing our</seg><seg type="columnLine">boots and loosing our belts and collars. We sleep thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully clothed, for as Dick says, 'One can never tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">what pranks the Void might play upon us, and we want</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least to be dressed and ready.' Then, smoking our</seg><seg type="columnLine">last cigarets, we toss a coin to see who is to turn out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the light. We leave only a small light burning in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaded reading lamp for an emergency.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How thankful I am that Richard Dorr elected to</seg><seg type="columnLine">join me. How drear the hours would have been alone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And it is surprising how much fun can be had in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight quarters. How surprised our friends, with whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have gained reputations for being staid and serious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be. Yet it is through the means of play that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget the vastness outside and the meagerness of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to live!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Our instruments show that we are now traveling at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rate of fifty thousand miles per hour!

Sitting down with a paper and pencil</seg><seg type="columnLine">I calculated that we should average sixty thousand miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">per hour throughout the entire trip of thirty-four mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion miles, which is the present distance of Mars from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Earth. It will, therefore, take us exactly twenty-three</seg><seg type="columnLine">days thirteen hours and a fraction to reach the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet. Professor Rollins had computed that it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">take us at least thirty-five days, but of course he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not able to judge just how swiftly the rocket could</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next entry was made ten days later.</seg><seg type="columnLine">OUT OF THE VOID</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">455</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">IN approximately nine days more we shall land</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Mars, if we do land.

During his mother's absence in</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York one rainy day, and while' Mr. Henley was</seg><seg type="columnLine">writing some letters in his room, Austin stole down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sloop unobserved by the rest of the household, cast</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat loose, hoisted the sail, and stood out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open Sound in a brisk north-wester with his eyes on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distant Connecticut shore line. He was a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">sailor, and he had learned to handle the little craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the skill of a veteran, so the increasing of wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not disturb him. He merely took a reef in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mainsail and went on. He had no definite idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he was going. He merely felt the immediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">need of the open, of wind and rain sweeping down</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him from illimitable spaces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not long before he noticed that more clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gathering in the north. He wondered if a storm</seg><seg type="columnLine">was coming up and in the same breath hoped that</seg><seg type="columnLine">one was. He felt elated at the thought, curiously light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and free from restraint. Tiller in hand he watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">the green seas come tumbling along the rail as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sloop heeled to the pressure of her sails. She clove the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crested seas, shaking the spume and smother from</seg><seg type="columnLine">her bows at each leap. Spindrift lashed his face.

An hour later, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacking about double-reefed in the teeth of the gale, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was forced to give her sheet and run off free.

His elation at his new-found</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberty left no room for fear. For the first time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his life he was going about the business of living inde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendently.

He slept in one of its bunks nearly all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way back to Gloucester while the sloop was towed</seg><seg type="columnLine">astern. He was completely exhausted. The exhilara-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was gone. His body seemed in the grip of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrous apathy from which he was unable to rouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself. Even after being drenched with sleep he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a curious disinclination to stir.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The authorities at Gloucester communicated with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother at once.

He had expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scolding but none came.

She</seg><seg type="columnLine">took his face between her small soft hands and searched</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes with a sort of breathless intentness that puzzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. He tried to respond to her caresses, but they left</seg><seg type="columnLine">him cold and apathetic. He was conscious even of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slight feeling of nausea at her demonstrativeness. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at Mr. Henley for an explanation of this ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traordinary phenomenon, but the tutor averted his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if loath to meet his questioning eyes. Drowsiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">overtook him at last. He sank back in the cushioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat and slept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN he opened his eyes the next morning he</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that he was in bed in his own room. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay for a long time trying to review the happenings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last ten days but his brain refused to respond to</seg><seg type="columnLine">any orderly survey. He felt no desire for anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">except to lie prone, but he did not get any feeling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest or relaxation from the thought of remaining in</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed. He glanced about the chamber. He had a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentary illusion of being in a strange room. Even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most familiar object seemed remote and unreal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was conscious of being thirsty, but it took him</seg><seg type="columnLine">several minutes to make up his mind to arise and search</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a glass in the bathroom. As he passed the cheval</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror on his way back to bed he caught sight of him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self therein and paused, blinking at the image he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">there: a sallow face with lacklustre eyeballs set deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">in narrowed slits. He ran his fingers through his hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if by this motion to brush away the vision that con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fronted him in the mirror and noted that his hair felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously dry and brittle to the touch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood staring at himself for some moments, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">crept back to bed. He didn't understand what had</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened and his mind was too tired to grapple with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the problem. When the nurse brought him his capsule</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen minutes later he swallowed it and said nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During his convalescence he tried to screw up cour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age to get out of bed and look at himself in the mirror,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when he finally did get the courage to do so at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the second week, he saw there a well set-up</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth with clear blue eyes, soft wavy hair and a healthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruddy skin. He decided that he had dreamed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">other image.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he was twenty-two years old his mother died.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The day before she had been well and happy. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">had motored to Montauk Point and had lunched at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a wayside inn. Upon returning she had complained of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slight headache and had retired early. The following</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, Elaine the maid had gone into her room to</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaken her and had found her lying dead upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canopied bed with her white head thrown back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">her small hands clutching the silken covers. She had</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely stirred. Death had been instantaneous and</seg><seg type="columnLine">except for the tightly-closed hands, there was no evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence of pain or struggle. Her heart had simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Austin was left in a daze by the unexpectedness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it; and the confusion of the household robbed of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">governing hand, added to his misery. He stayed beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GRIM INHERITANCE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">459</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">her until Doctor Goldwin arrived and ordered him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the room. Even then he could hardly tear him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self away. He gave the still form on the bed one last</seg><seg type="columnLine">look and stumbled downstairs after old Sims, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">outdoors and down to the sloop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sailed on the Sound that afternoon, his mind a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blank. When he returned he found that they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken her away. Her room had been made up. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandered about its crypt-like emptiness and touched</seg><seg type="columnLine">her things one by one. On the dressing table there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a small silver casket containing a few long strands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of white hair. She had told him laughingly one day</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was saving them toward a switch for old</seg><seg type="columnLine">age. He touched the strands lightly with the tips of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fingers, now. They seemed still a part of her living,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragile self.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He opened the door of the clothes closet. Doll-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">dresses hung there in orderly rows and a dozen pairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of tiny Cinderella slippers stood against the wall. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm eager personality seemed to be expressed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">every pair, to be lingering in every last fold of each</seg><seg type="columnLine">dainty garment. He wanted to gather them up in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, and take them to some secluded spot and cry</seg><seg type="columnLine">over them, but he couldn't cry. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A week after the funeral there was a meeting in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the library between several men. With the exception</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Dr. Goldwin all were strangers to Austin. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">will was read by a heavy-faced man with a porcine</seg><seg type="columnLine">brow and a flattened skull about which a fringe of</seg><seg type="columnLine">coarse iron gray hair rode like a misplaced halo.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Austin listened, abstractedly. He gathered from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stilted, legal phraseology that he was the only heir;</seg><seg type="columnLine">later that the heavy-faced man whose name was Stod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dard, and who seemed to be a distant relative of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead father, had succeeded in getting himself appointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the court as administrator. In the discussion that</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed the reading of the will, Austin discovered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mother had lived far beyond her income for years</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the estate was heavily incumbered. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stoddard informed all present in somewhat pompous</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone that he would do his best to save what was left</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Crane fortune.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Austin looked at the speaker and said nothing. Fi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nance was a closed book to him, and an instinctive dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust of the man kept him silent. After much arguing</seg><seg type="columnLine">pro and con it was decided that the servants were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be discharged, the heavily mortgaged house offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">for sale and that Austin was to live with the Stoddards</seg><seg type="columnLine">in New York until other arrangements could be made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE men gathered up their legal documents and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief cases and left. Doctor Goldwin alone re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained. When the sound of their motor had died</seg><seg type="columnLine">away in the distance the physician stopped pacing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm going to tell you something, my boy--something</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ought to have been told you long before this."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Austin felt a shock pass through his body as his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">met the serious, kindly ones of the old physician bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him searchingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes?" he replied, breathlessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have wondered often about certain things--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">refer particularly to the medicine?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Austin nodded. He gripped the arms of his chair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was on the brink of a momentous discovery. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">realization of it made him inarticulate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am going to tell you what I consider necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you to know," the physician went on; "against my</seg><seg type="columnLine">advice your mother kept it from you. I tried to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">her see her error and to make her realize the danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">she exposed you to by keeping you in ignorance of cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain things but she wouldn't listen. Women are that</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Sentimental and unwilling to face the truths of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life." He paused and glanced at the white face staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at him from the depths of the cushioned chair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's nothing to be frightened at, lad," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"pull yourself together and listen to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am listening," Austin replied with an effort to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep his voice steady.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know what a CRETIN is?" the physician</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Austin shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am not going to go into obscure medical termi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nology that would only confuse you: A cretin is a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">or a woman in whom, from some pathological defect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cause or origin of which is as yet unknown, a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain gland functions improperly or not at all. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">administering extracts of such a gland taken from</seg><seg type="columnLine">animals, the missing ingredients can be supplied arti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficially and with the identical results attained in nature's</seg><seg type="columnLine">most wonderful laboratory, the human body."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You were born a cretin.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are being constantly watched and supplied with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">missing ingredients which keeps them normal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">healthy. It is only when deprived of these through</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignorance or by not being themselves informed about</seg><seg type="columnLine">their affliction, that the tragedy of retrogression occurs."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What d'you mean?" Austin asked, breathlessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I mean that they will return to the cretinous state</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the supply of glandular extract is cut off or with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">held.

Hitherto the world had revolved about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him; now he found himself suddenly in the role of</seg><seg type="columnLine">satellite. From the position of prince royal with every</seg><seg type="columnLine">whim or wish anticipated and gratified, he had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended at once to the level of commoner. At home</seg><seg type="columnLine">someone had always stood between himself and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">realities of life. In the Stoddard mansion on upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fifth Avenue, no one seemed to care what he did, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">when or how he did it. The most ordinary things</seg><seg type="columnLine">which every man does for himself as a matter of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the daily prosecution of existence, presented them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves as problems to Austin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first he was confused and unhappy but gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">his untrained mind began to adjust itself to the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner of things. Little by little his dormant faculties</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to react to the new influences and responsibili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties. Each experience was a draft upon his resources</seg><seg type="columnLine">that must be honored at once. It became a game, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinating sport, with his soul and integrity as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stakes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was quick to learn. He did not know that within</seg><seg type="columnLine">the human brain lies the knowledge of all things, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that only by contact with problems this knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes forth. He merely knew that he must learn or</seg><seg type="columnLine">perish. He was confronted with problems which boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ten had assimilated before their milk teeth were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone. His twenty-two year old mind bridged the chasm</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an instant. There was nothing to unlearn. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain sensitized to receive whatever might come its</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, was like a virgin phonograph record awaiting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">recording needle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Stoddard household puzzled him. His dislike</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the man Stoddard was deep-rooted and it increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">as time went on. He had never encountered a human</seg><seg type="columnLine">of predatory habits before. There was no precedent</seg><seg type="columnLine">to guide him. His distrust was instinctive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a Mrs. Stoddard, a florid coarse woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">as heavy as her husband, with prominent china-blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes and a great pile of over-bright yellow hair which</seg><seg type="columnLine">in spite of its elaborate dressing, always seemed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">imminent danger of tumbling about her ears. Austin</seg><seg type="columnLine">encountered her rarely except at mealtimes. She ig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nored him utterly. For both circumstances he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thankful. When she ate, her tiered chin reminded him</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the pouch of a pelican. She seemed to divide her</seg><seg type="columnLine">time equally between her suite of rooms in the east</seg><seg type="columnLine">wing of the big house and her showy automobile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Stoddards were childless but there was another</seg><seg type="columnLine">member of the household whose exact status Austin</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unable to determine. Her name was Ann Barrett</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she seemed to occupy the position of a servant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was displayed as a poor relation only at mealtimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">or when company was present for the sake of appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ances. She also was a distant relative of Mr. Stoddard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had become indigent it seemed shortly after join-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the household. She was a quiet, self-effacing crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, who rarely spoke except when addressed, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">whose brown eyes Austin caught now and then regard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing him with a sort of repressed warning across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table, or when he encountered her in the dim, cavernous</seg><seg type="columnLine">hallways. He had the curious feeling that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever on the point of telling him something, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she was not sure whether she ought to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Altogether it was a strange household. A person</seg><seg type="columnLine">of experience would have been warned, but in Austin's</seg><seg type="columnLine">limited contact with life he had not yet encountered</seg><seg type="columnLine">knavery. He felt merely a sense of restlessness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">depression that was accentuated by the tomb-like air</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the big house. Even the servants were aloof and</seg><seg type="columnLine">impersonal, not like old tender-hearted Sims and</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly, garrulous Culp. The only person he felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything in common with was the girl Ann. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to account for this feeling, but there were times</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he wanted to take her aside and tell her about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother. At such times he wondered if her hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft and cool like his mother's.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once a month he called at Doctor Goldwin's offices</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a fresh supply of his medicine. He always looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward to these visits. They talked about his mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the old place on the North Shore o.f Long Island</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the doctor informed him was being subdivided</seg><seg type="columnLine">into suburban lots by the Stoddard Development Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany. On one of these visits, Austin asked the phy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sician if Stoddard knew of his affliction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No one knows about it except yourself and me," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">physician replied. "You mustn't think of it in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terms of an affliction. If anything, you're a grade above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the average, both physically and mentally. There's no</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason why you shouldn't live a long and useful life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What you need is an interest. Get that and forget the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other and you'll be happy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went to his desk and opened a drawer from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took a slip of paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is the prescription for your medicine," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "I meant to give it to you last time you were here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I forgot. You will find the address of the labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory that prepares it on the reverse side. Don't lose</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. In the event of my death, they'll supply it to you</seg><seg type="columnLine">direct."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Austin gripped the arms of his chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you're not going to die--soon," he said in sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den panic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The physician smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope not. But one never knows." He paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">and regarded his frightened young visitor sternly. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">must stop depending upon others, Son. Go out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mix with people. Make friends. Go into some sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">business, or learn a trade or a profession. Get away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from yourself. Learn to love work, and to--love," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">added.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I--I will," Austin replied, as he folded up the slip</seg><seg type="columnLine">of paper and put it in his pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR days he thought about his talk with Doctor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goldwin. At home on Long Island his mother had</seg><seg type="columnLine">set aside a small plot of ground for him for a garden.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had loved this little spot. On summer mornings</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would awaken while it was still dark and lie waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatiently for the sun to rise, and then bolt his break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast and hurry down to see how much his plants had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown during the night. He had felt an immense re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponsibility for their welfare. When a Spring gale</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GRIM INHERITANCE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">461</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">broke one of his young trees he had wept over it for</seg><seg type="columnLine">days. A month later new shoots had appeared below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the break and the wound was healed over with rosin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">On all sides he saw the constant feverish effort of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">loving things to create, to perpetuate themselves against</seg><seg type="columnLine">great odds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Learn to love work and to--love," Doctor Goldwin</seg><seg type="columnLine">had said. It was odd that, with this sentence running</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his mind, Austin should think of Ann Barrett.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When he met her in the halls, he felt the impulse to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gather her in his arms. Somehow, she seemed to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">within her small, compact body the joy of creating, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise of perpetuation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt vaguely ashamed of himself. He was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">finitely better equipped for battle than the poor broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The months that followed were busy ones for him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His talk with the physician awakened in him a desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to know all about himself and the world into which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been so suddenly projected. He spent his days</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandering about the city, observing what men had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">while his mind had been asleep. He spent his nights</seg><seg type="columnLine">in reading and study. His ability to assimilate was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as great as his thirst for knowledge. He saw, noted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mentally digested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had been with the Stoddards a little over a year</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the first inkling of disaster came to him. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">monthly allowance was cut off. Stoddard explained to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in the library one evening a week or so later that</seg><seg type="columnLine">due to unfortunate conditions over which he had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">control, the remnants of the Crane fortune had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean that I have no money at all?" Austin</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stoddard replied that because of his mother's mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">management such was the case, but added magnani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mously that Austin was welcome to the hospitality of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his roof until he could find something to do. Austin</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced at the mottled face of his distant relative. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's small furtive eyes seemed to flit about the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if in an effort to evade his own. The young man</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered if the documents which he had signed now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then at Stoddard's request, during the past year</seg><seg type="columnLine">had anything to do with the loss of the money.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went upstairs without a word. He had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough of poverty in his wanderings about town to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make him thoughtful. Beggars had stopped him now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then with hands outstretched for alms, depressing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking, slinking creatures in soiled garments into</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose trembling palms he had dropped coins. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of what might become of him, if there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no money for his monthly supply of medicine, made his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fcrain reel. He clutched the bannister for support.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At a turn in the dark hall he was confronted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, Ann. Her finger was raised to her lips in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">admonitory gesture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was listening," she whispered. "I heard what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">told you in the library. Oh, why didn't I warn you</seg><seg type="columnLine">long ago? He stole my money and now he has stolen</seg><seg type="columnLine">yours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Austin searched her face in the gloom. His mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">ivvas so full of his own problems that the significance</seg><seg type="columnLine">jof what she told him did not impress him at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He stole your money?" he reiterated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, yes. The court made him my guardian after</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">my father's death ten years ago. I'm doing the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a servant here while they live in luxury on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">money."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Austin drew a deep breath. His distrust of Stod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dard flamed into suspicion, then certitude, in an instant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He looked down at the small face upturned to his in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness. Pity for her made him forget his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">problems. She seemed so small, so abandoned. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not know how it happened but somehow their lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">met, and at that moment life with its infinite possibili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties was opened to him. He kissed not only her lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">but her eyes and her hair, and when he finally released</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, frightened at his own vehemence, she did not run</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. They stood looking at one another as if a</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracle, which their senses could not credit, had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">performed before their eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, at a sudden slamming of a door behind them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl turned and fled down the hall in the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Mrs. Stoddard's suite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dinner was being served when Austin entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dining room that evening. Neither Stoddard nor his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife as much as glanced at him when he took his</seg><seg type="columnLine">accustomed seat opposite Ann, but he caught a quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">interchange of looks between them as he unfolded his</seg><seg type="columnLine">napkin. The girl raised her eyes to his for a moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then dropped them again, hurriedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ate mechanically and with no thought upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">food. Stoddard's conversation with his wife was mono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">syllabic as usual, and he consumed his food with noisy</seg><seg type="columnLine">indelicacy. His smooth, flat skull gleamed dully in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the soft light. His heavy face had the peculiar mottled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flabby aspect of a toad's belly, and the toad-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect was further accentuated by the short neck upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">which his head was thrust forward, slightly in advance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rest of his body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He never seemed more repulsive to Austin than</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this moment. The young man felt a sudden impulse</seg><seg type="columnLine">to arise and denounce him and to sink his fingers into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bovine neck. The only thing that deterred him was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warning glance from the brown eyes at the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the table. They seemed to say:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not yet! Bide your time. Plan; think!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He slept not at all that night. His brain was seething</seg><seg type="columnLine">with vague plans and half-formed ideas. He had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">definite notion of what he intended to do. He only</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that the girl's kisses still burned on his lips.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For her sake he must find a way to bring Stoddard</seg><seg type="columnLine">to account.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Crane Secures Employment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was with this thing in mind that he approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stoddard the following day with the request that</seg><seg type="columnLine">since he was now penniless, he might take him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his office to learn the real estate business. Stod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dard regarded him in heavy-lidded silence before reply-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, then said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll give you a try-out. But mind you, no foolish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. You've been pampered all your life. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">pamper my employees. I'll give you a note to Kraft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office manager. Report for work to-morrow."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Austin found Kraft a medium-sized, very blond man</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a bulging forehead, prominent glassy blue eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a nervous, jerky manner. He was known among</seg><seg type="columnLine">his business associates as a booster. He was always</seg><seg type="columnLine">"on his toes" about something, even if that something</seg><seg type="columnLine">462</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was merely an order for new typewriter ribbons. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressed himself in detonations; his simplest remarks</seg><seg type="columnLine">were minor explosions. He prided himself upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brisk and business-like manner; he was merely a gatling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun firing an unceasing barrage at some spot, the range</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which was uncertain, but which he hoped to hit by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the simple law of averages. It never seemed to occur</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him that by purchasing a range-finder he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have saved himself a lot of ammunition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He put Austin to work as a file clerk, not because</seg><seg type="columnLine">he needed one, but because Stoddard had told him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">create this position. The files of the Stoddard Devel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">opment and Realty Company were like all concerns of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this kind: a simple record of sales made and of property</seg><seg type="columnLine">listed for sale. They were consulted only upon enquiry</seg><seg type="columnLine">from some customer answering an advertisement or</seg><seg type="columnLine">to compute Mr. Stoddard's very large income tax. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stoddard Company were specialists in their line, "Real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors of the Better Kind," was Mr. Kraft's slogan. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">handled nothing but large business properties and</seg><seg type="columnLine">development projects running into six or seven figures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Austin's clerkship consisted merely of half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">trips a day to pull a card from the files and bring it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Mr. Kraft's or Mr. Stoddard's desk. The balance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his time was taken up in running errands about</seg><seg type="columnLine">town. These errands were many and varied, such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking documents to the Recorder's Office, making de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posits at the bank, carrying papers to and from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">title companies, delivering leases, serving vacating no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tices, putting up rental placards on vacant properties</seg><seg type="columnLine">and "For Sale" signs on empty plots.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He began to get some insight into how modern busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness was conducted. He learned, observed, and paid</seg><seg type="columnLine">close attention. He knew that he was holding his posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion at the Stoddard firm on sufferance only, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stoddard was watching for a slip as an excuse to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge him, so he executed his commissions with dili-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gence and attention to the minutest detail. His time</seg><seg type="columnLine">was limited. Sooner or later the axe would fall. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched every move of the firm. Nothing escape4 him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew that an outright monetary reprisal wiS out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the question. The firm's business was done almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely by checks, and the limited amount of cash in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the office safe was not worth his while.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He found that Stoddard did a good deal of trading</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his own account in high grade bonds and stocks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Also that the firm was not always overscrupulous how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the offerers of them had come by them, as long as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were negotiable or bearer certificates and the price was</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. In one instance he had been sent to the bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cash a large cheque. The money, some four thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars had been given to a hard-looking individual who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been in long and earnest conversation with Stod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dard in his private office, and, who left behind him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bundle of securities identical with those mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the headlines of a morning paper as having been</seg><seg type="columnLine">stolen in the robbery of a bonding house a few days</seg><seg type="columnLine">previously. Stoddard had put the bonds away in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe at once and later had removed them to his safe</seg><seg type="columnLine">deposit box at the bank. This fact gave Austin food</seg><seg type="columnLine">for thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Certain plans had begun to form in his mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They became crystallized almost at once, when one</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon Doctor Goldwin summoned him to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've some good news for you," the old physician</seg><seg type="columnLine">told him, "Doctor Swartz from Vienna will be here in</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York this summer. His gland operations are</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing short of surgical miracles. I haven't said</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything to you about him before, because I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to raise false hopes in you, but after watching</seg><seg type="columnLine">his work for the past four or five years, I'm convinced</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if you have the courage to submit to his knife,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll be permanently cured. His fee is ten thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars. I guess you can manage that sum. I'll have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a talk with Mr. Stoddard about advancing you the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Austin held his breath. The plan which he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked out would be frustrated if Stoddard found out</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his affliction. He considered momentarily the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisdom of confiding in Doctor Goldwin about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting off of his allowance, but decided against it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His plans required that he play a lone hand. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibilities which the physician's announcement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Doctor Swartz' visit held for him, sent the blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounding to his temples. His future, Ann, life as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal human being, the father of children--Ann's</seg><seg type="columnLine">children. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll see Stoddard, myself," he said, "please don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mention my--affliction to him. I'll get the money from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on some pretext or other. Promise me that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't say anything to him about it," he insisted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">earnestly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As you wish," Doctor Goldwin replied. He smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">indulgently at what he thought was a display of sen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitiveness. "This is May. Doctor Swartz will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">here early in August. I want you to be ready for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll be ready for him," Austin said, "I'll have ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand dollars in your hands by the first of August."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well. You must rest during the month of</seg><seg type="columnLine">July in preparation for the operation. Get Stoddard</seg><seg type="columnLine">to let you take your vacation early."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will," Austin replied. "Don't forget your prom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ise. Stoddard must not know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've given you my word, my boy," the old physi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cian said as he escorted him to the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once outside, Austin realized that he had committed</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself definitely to an obligation that would take all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sagacity to live up to, but the discovery that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">permanent cure was possible made all other things</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible. He could go to Ann with clean hands. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had had any misgivings about the success of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan, they were now swept aside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no time to lose in putting the scheme in</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation. His time was more limited than ever now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A certain amount of cash was necessary. This he se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cured from the pawning of his mother's jewels. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt a stab of remorse at parting with them for even</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few months, but he had to have money. With the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeds he went to the fishing village on Long Island</seg><seg type="columnLine">near his old home and left instructions with the boat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man there with whom he had left his sloop in charge</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the past year, to overhaul the boat thoroughly for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long cruise that summer. 'This and the stocking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat with provisions took half of his limited capital.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He visited his old home while he was negotiating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the repairs on the boat. The fine old grounds had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been subdivided into building plots, and rows of small</seg><seg type="columnLine">cottages all alike as peas, shut off the view of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GRIM INHERITANCE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">463</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Sound from the once wooded slopes. Knowing what</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did of business now, he marveled at his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">credulity in signing the papers which Stoddard had</seg><seg type="columnLine">submitted to him from time to time, and to which he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Austin, had put his signature without as much as glanc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at them. He saw how completely his utter ignor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of business had delivered him into Stoddard's</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. The man would hardly have been human to</seg><seg type="columnLine">resist the temptation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Austin shed a tear or two for the fate of the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">home, then set his face resolutely toward the future.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE weeks that followed were busy ones for him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As he worked during the day, only his evenings</seg><seg type="columnLine">were available for his preparations. At a store in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bowery district he purchased an entire new outfit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheap flashy clothes, a tie that only a race track tout</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have dared to wear, a soft Fedora hat with</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly colored band, and a pair of light tan button</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes that shrieked to heaven. He also purchased a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pair of dark eye glasses of the variety known collo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quially as "rubber-tired."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These things he carried to the sloop in a suitcase and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stowed away in the small cabin. When the repairs on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boat had been consummated, he sailed the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft into the East River one Sunday past Hell-gate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and moored it in the angle of one of the piers at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot of Eighty-sixth Street near the ferry dock. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stoddard house was in the Eighties, just off Fifth</seg><seg type="columnLine">Avenue, a run of less than ten minutes on the Eighty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixth Street crosstown bus from where the yawl was</seg><seg type="columnLine">moored.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His last move was to purchase a five hundred dollar</seg><seg type="columnLine">bond of a certain public utilities corporation with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remainder of his money. The bond was one of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">standard securities in which widows invest their life</seg><seg type="columnLine">insurance money and which are as negotiable and</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost as safe as United States Treasury notes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was early in June when all his preparations were</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfected. He went over everything in detail. Every</seg><seg type="columnLine">step he meant to take was planned out. The audacity</seg><seg type="columnLine">and boldness of the plan augured well for its success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the evening of the fifth of June he approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stoddard with the request that his summer vacation</seg><seg type="columnLine">begin that following Saturday. The alacrity with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Stoddard granted the request amused him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not needed at the Stoddard Development and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Realty Company and knew that he was kept on merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">because Stoddard was just a little bit afraid of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I would like to run down to Bermuda in the yawl.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I may be gone two months or so, if you have no objec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion," Austin told him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stoddard's heavy lips parted in a wolfish smile. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered how he could turn this circumstance to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own account when Austin returned, by letting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man out on the plea that business was not what</seg><seg type="columnLine">it ought to be. At any rate it gave him an excellent</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening to dispense with his "protege's services."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take as long as you like," he replied with a mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nanimous wave of his pudgy hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank you, Sir," said Austin, gravely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had a long talk with Ann that evening in a se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded corner of Central Park, where he had asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to meet him. He told her many things, some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which stirred her to wonder and filled her dark eyes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with tenderness and others that made her fearful for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He waved her fears aside. They clung to each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the dusk of the warm spring evening. When they</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted she said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">/ "Even if you do not raise the money for the opera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, we can work together and save until we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough. Nothing matters except that I love you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There are others to think of," he replied, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">kissed her tenderly and fiercely in the same breath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"For their sake I've got to win."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The following Saturday he packed up a few neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary things and departed for his yawl moored at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot of Eighty-sixth Street. His mind became filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sort of subtle intoxication as he began to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">his plan into operation. He had no intention of going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Bermuda for a month or so. He simply stayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard the well-provisioned and comfortable little craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">and proceeded to deprive himself of his medicine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With the memory in his mind of the image he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen in the cheval mirror of his room, when his mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Doctor Goldwin had! brought him back from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gloucester, the procedure took every ounce of will</seg><seg type="columnLine">power he possessed. The inforced inactivity of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">month which was necessary to accomplish sufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">retrogression to make him unrecognizable, would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">appalled a less determined man. The result would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made a heart, less stout than his, fail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                                        t</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Strange Visitor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was on a very hot afternoon in the first days of</seg><seg type="columnLine">July that Stoddard, perspiring in his shirt sleeves</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his office received a bulky special delivery let-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. He ran his stubby forefinger under the flap of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the envelope, wondering mildly what its contents might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be. When a five hundred dollar negotiable bond of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain well-known public utilities corporation dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his hand, his pale blue eyes lighted with sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest and the interest was heightened by the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tents of the typed letter which accompanied it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. J.

He turned the certificate</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, examined it closely and held it up to the light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was undoubtedly genuine. It carried six and one-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarter per cent, interest and was worth, he knew, fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hundred cents on the dollar. He considered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter ponderously. Two hundred thousand dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">worth of these bonds at a xliscount of thirty-three per</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent, would have netted him sixty-six thousand dollars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very nice profit; but Stoddard was not a man to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied with a nice profit in a deal that contained the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elements of a "clean-up." He knew that men who of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered bonds of this kind at a knock down price were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a position to dictate, so he came back at Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">464</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Joseph Scanlon, General Delivery, New York, with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer of thirty-three cents on the dollar instead of thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">three per cent, discount.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Scanlon's answer was a typewritten howl of pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">test.

As a postscript he added,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he'd bring two pals along to watch outside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, and that if Mr. Stoddard knew what was good</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him he wouldn't try any rough stuff, or he, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scanlon, would make it his business to put a lily in his,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Stoddard's, hand forthwith.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Stoddard smiled grimly at this horticultural post-</seg><seg type="columnLine">script.

He was quite satisfied with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">profit of one hundred thousand dollars and a whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did, however, take the precaution of having the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money to pay for the bonds delivered to his residence</seg><seg type="columnLine">by an armored delivery car company, and immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">transferred it to his wall safe in the library.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At eleven o'clock that evening, the agreed time, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">door bell rang. He answered it himself. The man</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom he let into the darkened hall wore a soft felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">hat with a brightly colored band, pulled down over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes, dark tortoise-shell eyeglasses, a blue double-</seg><seg type="columnLine">breasted suit with broad stripes, and a pair of light tan</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoes. Under his arm he carried a bundle done up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">common brown wrapping paper. Mr. Stoddard's swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance of scrutiny noted the ominous bulge of the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand pocket of the striped jacket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Joseph Scanlon, I assume?" he asked, pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">antly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man nodded. He stood for a moment peering</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the darkened hall in a listening attitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come into the library," Stoddard said, leading the</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. "We're all alone," he added, reassuringly. "My</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife is out and the servants have gone to bed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE man followed him slowly without a word. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked with the peculiar shuffling gait of advanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">age. Seated opposite in the better-lighted library, Stod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dard got his first good look at him. He was a singu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larly depressing-looking man. The skin of his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was of a waxy pallor, seemed to hang in folds</seg><seg type="columnLine">that apparently could not be smoothed out. It gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a peculiar wizened look in spite of the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was quite evidently a young man. Although well</seg><seg type="columnLine">above middle height he gave the appearance somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of being shrunken and his movements and speech were</seg><seg type="columnLine">abnormally deliberate. He sat staring at Stoddard</seg><seg type="columnLine">through his darkened eyeglasses, his lower lip droop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing askew in an uncanny half imbecile way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's see the bonds," he said, finally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's see the jack," the other replied forcing out</seg><seg type="columnLine">each word slowly in a hoarse voice as if the mere act of</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking was an effort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stoddard pointed to the wall-safe. "It's in there."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He held out his hands for the brown paper package.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man made no movement. He said merely. "Let's--</seg><seg type="columnLine">see--it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stoddard made a motion of impatience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I play square," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man reached for his hat, as if to leave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," Stoddard grumbled, "I'll show it to you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">He went to the safe and opened it, then flipped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bundle of bills in the light of the table lamp, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">laying them down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man's wizened hand holding the brown paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">package moved forward slowly. He pushed the parcel</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the table to Stoddard, then put the hand into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulging right hand pocket of his jacket and leaned back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stoddard tore the brown paper off the parcel.

He raised his head with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an angry snarl but the snarl turned to amazement</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he found himself looking into the bore of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic pistol which at the distance of the six feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">that separated him from his visitor, looked to his bulging</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes like the end of a section of drain pipe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pass--me--the--jack," the man said in his slow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">emotionless voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Stoddard's lower jaw dropped wide. His pudgy</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand moved to the bundle of currency, then came</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with a quick cat-like movement, as if it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned. He took a step backward and slumped into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chair and sat staring at his visitor with the beads</seg><seg type="columnLine">of perspiration streaming down his mottled face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man arose slowly, reached for the money and</seg><seg type="columnLine">put it into his pocket.

When Stoddard heard the front door close</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him he arose halfway in his seat, but fear made</seg><seg type="columnLine">him drop back. He knew that men of Joseph Scan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lon's type would stop at nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He sat staring at the bundle of newspapers on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">(Continued on page 470)</seg><seg type="columnLine">I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">S am QRAFITY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Graves' * S^ULLIFIER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By George Frederick Stratton</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">JUDGING from all the talk about conquering gravitation and space flying,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it would seem that nullifying gravity would be of only one advantage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">That is not so.

"His</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife answered. Graves went to Chicago on last night's</seg><seg type="columnLine">train and won't be back for a week or ten days. But she</seg><seg type="columnLine">says that if we go out she can show us the 'controller/</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she calls it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "H-mp!" grunted the engineer, thoughtfully. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder if he's got Chicago parties on the string. I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">him I felt sure that you'd look into it without much de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay, and he didn't express any impatience at all. Said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">he thought Denver parties were the logical men to capi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">talize the thing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There he's right!" exclaimed Lundholm. "All the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same, I don't like this trip to Chicago. If the thing is</seg><seg type="columnLine">genuine--if he can really control gravitation--even in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small degree, it will be the biggest thing the world has</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever seen. Mind cannot conceive its limits! And( east-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern capital is grabbing every good thing here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hidreth nodded slowly. "Say, it gets me the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. I didn't sleep two hours last night--thinking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it every moment! Almost the last thing I saw before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I left Graves yesterday was 'way across the plains a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long train of loaded coal cars being started on the track,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the exhaust reports came only about ten a minute.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graves said, indifferently. 'If I went over there with</seg><seg type="columnLine">this controller box and connected to that string of cars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an insulated coupling to the locomotive, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">start them all as easily as if it were only one light</seg><seg type="columnLine">caboose!' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, slamming his fist on the table, he added: "And</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would, Lundholm, if gravity can be eliminated or</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlled!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The President nodded gravely. Then in a low but</seg><seg type="columnLine">intense tone he murmured: "It's no more wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">and perhaps as possible as sending a hundred thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">horsepower over a wire no bigger than this pencil! Let's</seg><seg type="columnLine">go, Hidreth!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the President's 12-cylinder car, they covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the 30 miles from Denver to the Ophongo Canyon in</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than an hour. As they ran slowly up the sage-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brush trail from the highway to Graves' bungalow, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inventor's wife, daintily dressed, swung her little figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the porch hammock and murmured to herself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">smilingly: "Here comes the big fellow, Mr. George</seg><seg type="columnLine">M. Lundholm, multimillionaire, President of six or</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight great companies and on the directorate of a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. Gee! I wonder if I can behave properly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">will I be up against the cold, glassy stare?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She glided down the steps as the car stopped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a radiant smile said: "I'm not going to wait for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an introduction, gentlemen, because there's no one here</seg><seg type="columnLine">to introduce me. Welcome to our glorious city, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest," waving her pretty arm towards the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains, the snow-tipped peaks glittering in the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lundholm bowed courteously: "I believe I scowled</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little, Mrs. Graves, when I heard that your husband</seg><seg type="columnLine">was away; but now I'm intensely glad. I suppose if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been here we should have gone right on to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canyon and then missed seeing you !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's very nice, Mr. Lundholm. All the same, I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorry Sam isn't here. He had to go to Chicago to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">some valve or gasket or something for a speed gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernor he's making for the gravity plant. It's about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half mile up there. Shall we ride over?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She called to a tall man in overalls who placed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small but heavy box in her own car which was parked</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, and started towards the mountains, while she en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the President's car. A few minutes over a rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail of sage-brush and huge boulders brought them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foot of the stupendous cliffs at the canyon mouth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a sharp turn at the base ran them close to the huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">flywheel on the power shaft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Edna sprang from the car and tossed a kiss at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two strings of barrels hanging from the curious struc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, twelve hundred feet up that appalling precipice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">SAM GRAVES' GRAVITY NULLIFIER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">467</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"That's the way I feel!" she laughed. "That's the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alization of Sammy's dream, and it's wonderful, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lundholm; sure wonderful!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He nodded gravely; a little spasm of indignation</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweeping over him that he, a great capitalist, involved in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the biggest industries of the West, should be compelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to listen to the "gush" of a bit of a woman like this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she fluttered over to a small wooden building,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight by ten feet in size, close to the driving pulley of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gravity plant, followed by the mechanic, who un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked the door and threw open a shutter across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">front of the building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is our control department," she smiled, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">this," pointing to the box which the mechanic had placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the floor, "is the nullifier--Sam calls it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With amazing deftness she connected a wire from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the electric light service wire to the one end of the box;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then connected the other end to a plain switchboard on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall. There were two circular switch levers. Above</seg><seg type="columnLine">one was a rough inscription: "Ascending"; over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other was "descending."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Grasping one lever, Edna replied: "I'll start it, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lundholm. You see, all the barrels now have their</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal weights and of course there's no movement until</seg><seg type="columnLine">we cut out some weight from the ascending side. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">look!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shifted the lever and the entire outfit of barrels</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to move slowly, quickly gaining speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I dare not nullify any more," she explained, "or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed would get beyond control."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two men watched intently the now rapidly mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing lines and the whirling flywheel. A rude but power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful lever brake was pressing on that great wheel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being controlled by the mechanic. For a few min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes they all silently watched the movement. Once or</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice Edna threw back her switch until the line almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped. Then she threw in the nullifier again and</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeded up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The control's good," she exclaimed excitedly. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything was belted on, we could instantly nullify all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gravity from that ascending line and get all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">power possible from the descending line. Do you un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derstand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perfectly," replied Lundholm. "It's quite simple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except one thing; the nullifier. That is an unseen</seg><seg type="columnLine">miracle!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Seems so to me," she responded. "But then, I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a scientist. I haven't the faintest idea how that</seg><seg type="columnLine">current is changed in that box to do such marvelous</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. I've seen the mechanism and the windings, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course--could assemble it all myself, I think, if neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary; but why or how it acts that way is beyond me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And to tell the truth, Mr. Lundholm, it's beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sammy--my husband. He doesn't know any more</seg><seg type="columnLine">about that part of it than you or I."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How was it possible then for him to design or in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent the machine--the nullifier, Mrs. Graves?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How was it possible for Marconi to devise wire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less?" she retorted with a bewitching smile, "or for</seg><seg type="columnLine">other big scientific men to send millions of horsepower</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a tiny wire ? They don't even know yet what</seg><seg type="columnLine">the juice is, do they?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lundholm nodded gravely. "That is about so, Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She added earnestly: "They have found that current</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would rush itself over a wire, but they've never found</seg><seg type="columnLine">out how."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to show you something else," she smiled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You don't know now, for sure, that the gravity is really</seg><seg type="columnLine">eliminated from some of those barrels. There may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">some fake, don't you think? I'll show you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She rapidly disconnected the nullifier and ordered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanic to carry it over to the President's big car, fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing it herself with a small coil of wire. The mechanic</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascended the electric light pole and connected one end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that wire while she quickly connected the other end</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the nullifier and the nullifier to the rear of the car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't fear for your car, Mr. Lundholm. We've</seg><seg type="columnLine">tested it with our own a score of times!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pulling on a big rubber glove she grasped the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of that car and lifted it as high as her sparkling</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. "It doesn't weigh a pound, you see. Try it</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He did so and the keen estimating look which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had worn before and which was not without a touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hard suspicion, disappeared. In its place came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glare of utter amazement as he lifted the end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great car as high as his head, without an effort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He relinquished it to Hidreth; strode over to Edna</seg><seg type="columnLine">and held out his hand. "I'm thoroughly convinced, Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Graves. Thoroughly! That test is absolutely con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusive."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She disconnected the nullifier again and the man took</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to her car. The two engineers had strolled over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foot of the barrel outfit, silently gazing at it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a crude arrangement," she said as she joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. "Those barrels were the handiest weight carriers</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could get and the sand was lying all around us. Sam</seg><seg type="columnLine">is making an automatic speed governor; that's what he's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone to Chicago for--to get some parts. Say, let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you how he built that supporting platform way up</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. The man who helped will tell the same story.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see, there was no way to get even a pack mule</seg><seg type="columnLine">up there. The men cut out a trail and scrambled up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with what tools they needed, but those beams weigh</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly two tons apiece. The men just rigged a wooden</seg><seg type="columnLine">derrick with a light hoisting rope and then Sam nullified</seg><seg type="columnLine">those beams and one man pulled them up as easily as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they had been made of cork. It was the same with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big wheels and the cables! Savvy ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I savvy, all right!" murmured the President.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the short run back to the bungalow Lundholm</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked: "Mrs. Graves, do those men who helped, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that mechanic who's with us, know anything about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nullifier ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No more than you do, Mr. Lundholm. No one but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam and myself has ever had one little look into that</seg><seg type="columnLine">box."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's good!" he muttered. Then after a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause: "As soon as your husband gets back, telephone</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, if you please, and we'll arrange for a conference.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This matter will, I think, have to be very carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">handled."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, Mr. Lundholm. We'll be ready."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And your husband has applied for a patent, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course? Perhaps you have a copy of the specifications</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drawings. If so, we'd like to have a chance to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">them over. It would save time, of course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He hasn't applied for a patent, sir. He made out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the specifications and drawings, but I persuaded him not</seg><seg type="columnLine">468</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to go so far yet. I think I showed him that it was far</seg><seg type="columnLine">wiser to keep the process secret--at present, at least."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You! You advised him that!" The President dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">played almost as much amazement as when he lifted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own car with one hand. Then a grim smile came over</seg><seg type="columnLine">his face. "I thought a woman--most women--never</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely kept a secret."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She tossed her little head and pouted. "Perhaps that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is so, Mr. Lundholm, but I've had some office-training</seg><seg type="columnLine">with men--real men, the Cartwright Cattle Company--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I've learned what it means, sometimes, to keep a</seg><seg type="columnLine">secret."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The puzzled look came back into his eyes and he lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hat courteously and drove away with his engineer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while Edna sought out a box of chocolates, snuggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the hammock again and opened a well-worn note-</seg><seg type="columnLine">book, murmuring joyfully: "Let us see what I've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">about Mr. George Lundholm."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SHE fingered over the leaves until she found the clip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping she sought. It was from a Denver daily and</seg><seg type="columnLine">read:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In a recent interview with George M. Lundholm, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">millionaire president of several great industries in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intermountain region, he said: 'Never since I started</seg><seg type="columnLine">on my career have I been in anything in which I had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">secured complete control. When I cannot secure that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">let the whole matter severely alone!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She laughed roguishly. "That means that he won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">play unless he has a perfectly good hand! And Bret</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harte says: "Life ain't th' holdin' of a good hand, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">th' playin' of a poor hand well/ M-mp! I think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sammy and I are going to see some life pronto!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A week later she was telling her husband of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">President's visit. She finished with: "So you see, Sam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ivel, that Lundholm won't come in unless he has full</seg><seg type="columnLine">control--he thinks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What of that?" retorted Sam. "If he buys outright,</seg><seg type="columnLine">let him have all the control he wants. That's his busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness! Sell him for a million dollars if he'll give it. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">not, make it a quarter million or a half."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A million dollars!" she gasped. "Only one little</seg><seg type="columnLine">million for a new power of world-wide application ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It's all we want, Edna. I've got other things on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind that'll bring in more."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just like an inventor!" she laughed, a little bitterly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No business instincts at all. Almost unlimited wealth</seg><seg type="columnLine">in your grasp and you're sidetracking yourself to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">other inventions!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, my girl, you can't get even that million without</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving control with it. But capital won't come in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Her eyes flashed and she said eagerly: "You say I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can't do it! Do you mean that you'll leave it to me ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sure do! You can play the hand if you like. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">not afraid of your losing all, and I don't want to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">bothered with it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That goes, Sammy! Just don't trump my aces and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll see that the score builds up to a respectable size.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm not playing on a little million dollar limit. Watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She presented herself, a few days later, at President</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lundholm's office and was received courteously, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an evident expression of doubt and surprise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hasn't Mr. Graves returned yet?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes! But he's very busy on that automatic gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernor, Mr. Lundholm, and he doesn't want to waste time</seg><seg type="columnLine">on business details, he said, so he sent me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly there came a suspicion to the President's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind and a fierce scowl swept over his face as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it possible that the "damned fool sent his wife</seg><seg type="columnLine">here to vamp me; to squeeze a few thousand more out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of me with pretty smiles and childish talk. Hell!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, flashing as quickly as a movie picture change,</seg><seg type="columnLine">came another thought: "It's their ignorance of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleam of the real value of the thing. The fool's sending</seg><seg type="columnLine">her into town to sell it--to sell this prodigious value--</seg><seg type="columnLine">just the same as he sends her in to buy a pound of tea</seg><seg type="columnLine">and box of crackers. They're pikers and acting like</seg><seg type="columnLine">pikers and they're surely my meat!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope you're not disappointed, Mr. Lundholm,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she murmured as she noted the black cloud over him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sam is an inventor. He knows and cares little for</seg><seg type="columnLine">business. He always leaves such things to me. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure that I can tell you plainly what we propose."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt jubilant. This was going to be much easier</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he had expected. "All right, Mrs. Graves. I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose you've brought the drawings and specifications</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She shook her head and smiled. "No, sir. We de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided that we would not reveal the secret until a real</seg><seg type="columnLine">company was formed and we were paid what we think</seg><seg type="columnLine">right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord! Mrs. Graves. Can it be possible that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you expect me to waste my time in organizing a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany and looking up capital for something I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely nothing about?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You've seen what it will do, Mr. Lundholm."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Capital hasn't seen it!" he retorted, grimly. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of fool would I look to ask men to put up perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">two or three hundred thousand to exploit some machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">that's locked up in a box and which I don't know is</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal or er--legerdemain? Ridiculous! We may as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well end this interview right now, Mrs. Graves. I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pretty busy man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She smiled bewitchingly. "You're also a man of big</seg><seg type="columnLine">reputation, Mr. Lundholm, and too good a sport to</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw up your hand without seeing a little further into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the game!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps she hit him right.

"What's the ante, Mrs. Graves ?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Not even a white chip, sir, until you see those papers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and drawings. Here's our proposition. You form a</seg><seg type="columnLine">company with ten million dollars capital and pay us six</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions in stock for the patents.

The magazine was called</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amazing Stories. We all joined in and laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him. Intending to have more fun, I picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the magazine and examined the cover. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled. The picture was not in keeping with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">name of the magazine. Merely out of curiosity I</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the magazine and saw the first illustration.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It astounded me with its wealth of scientific detail!</seg><seg type="columnLine">My eye quickly jumped to the title of the story.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Comet Doom," I mused. "Scientific maga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zine?" I said aloud. Then eagerly I turned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pages until I came to the second illustration. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe I yelled aloud, because it was also scien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tific! A magazine dealing with the subjects I</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved! I turned the pages eagerly, scanning each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the illustrations with ever increasing interest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I began reading one of the stories, and uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciously began walking home, reading, when sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly a loud harsh voice with a foreign accent rent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the still evening air.

This apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned man (i. e. the professor) states that if a</seg><seg type="columnLine">body were released from the earth's gravitation, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would fly off at a tangent to the revolving earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is very true. However, Mr. Wates must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have considered that the earth would stop revolving</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he said that the body would fly along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's surface and straight into space, because, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">a condition like the one stated were possible, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be found that the body would rise vertically</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the earth's surface, or at least would seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do so to any person in it, because the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">would revolve on its axis as swiftly as the space</seg><seg type="columnLine">car would fly off, therefore the car would not go</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster than the earth from the nullification of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's attraction, as Mr. Wates would have us</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe. In fact, the car might even seem to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly backwards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The author's mistake arises from the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he places himself, not on the earth but outside of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, standing still in relation to space, as we might</seg><seg type="columnLine">infer from the illustration of the revolving wheel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and electro-magnet. Am I not right?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another story that I wish to criticize while I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">at it, is "Four Dimensional Surgery." At one</seg><seg type="columnLine">point in the story the characters are supposed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been pulled into the fourth dimension by</seg><seg type="columnLine">some "four dimensional forceps." In this dimen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion they are supposed to be able to put their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands into their bodies without feeling it, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were not there. It is then that one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">characters snatches some gall stones within him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self and extracts them, apparently forgetting that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are as much in the fourth dimension as him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, and he can no more touch them than his body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his hand would therefore pass through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accuracy is what distinguishes Jules Verne and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wells from these others and I would therefore</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciate more of these two authors' works.

So a</seg><seg type="columnLine">car or object, whose gravitation was nullified,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would certainly fly off under the effect of centri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fugal force at a tangent to the earth.

What I wish you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would do is to reprint A.

Also some stories written</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for the same magazine by Austin Hall, Ralph</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Farley and Homer E. Flint.

The correct name is "The Vanishing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Professor" and its author is Fred Mclssac. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">read the story when it appeared and can safely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">say any scientifiction reader would enjoy it thor-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">oughly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I'm for reprints, but I do not mean the ones</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that were written so long ago that their forecasts</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had already come true. I am also in favor of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">your reprinting "The Blind Spot," even though</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I've already read it. And, Editor, if you are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">undecided as to whether or not to print it, you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">should hurry along with your decision, for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">readers of the magazine in which it originally</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">appeared are voting whether they should have it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">reprinted or not.

Does it warrant the taking up of half of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">those "precious" pages for which we have to wait</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a full month? To make things worse, only half</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of it is past. The story can be found in any library</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and while it is a good story and I must say I did</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not read the book, but read it in "Our magazine,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I still maintain it has absolutely no place under</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the heading of scientifiction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Here is another "brickbat." I wish the authors</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would not write some of the stories in that "jerky"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fashion. It looks as though they're either pressed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for space or else lack words. What I mean is that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the story seems to be uncompleted or else only an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">outline of the story is given. I especially refer to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the "Moon Strollers" of the May issue, since it is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the freshest in my memory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Now about pictures. I read a lot about pro and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">con, and have nothing to say as to whether you</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">should have more of them, but couldn't they be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">just a little less explanatory? It often happens</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that I take a good look at a picture and can tell</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">just what the story is about. That takes the zest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">out of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Now you will again hear something you've often</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heard before. Can't you change the title of your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">magazine? I will tell you why.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I attend college. During lunch time the fellows</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">get together and often discuss things that would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">make a good basis for your authors. Once I hap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pened to mention Amazing Stories and all the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fellows at once suggested ghost stories, love stories,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">etc., for me. They, while I know all of them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would enjoy Amazing Stories, never looked into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one, as though it was just another of the trashy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">category.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Now my argument is this: If you would put</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into, say six issues, a large noticeable announce-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ment that you will change the name, you positively</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will not lose any of your steady readers. Now let</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">us say it will cost you something to effect this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">change. I feel certain that the increased number</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of readers, those that are interested in science, will</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in a very short time reimburse your possible loss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">You certainly cannot lose any old readers by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">changing the name. Again I repeat that many</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">people who would be overjoyed to read your maga-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">zine don't do it, because they do not recognize its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">value.

I read the April number</seg><seg type="columnLine">yesterday in one sitting! The "Revolt of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atoms" was superb, an excellent lesson in chem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istry. The motto of Amazing Stories ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be ''Learn while you are entertained."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While reading "Into the Green Prism," I dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered several inconsistencies which I call to</seg><seg type="columnLine">your attention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1.	The author says the microscopic Manabis are</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the size of an atom. Then he says the grains</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sand would appear as mountains to them. If a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grain of sand were magnified to the size of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon, the atoms of SiOa might then be visible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 2.	Another statement makes the molecules of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water appear as great clouds to the tiny Manabis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the professors see the Manabi village wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the rain. Can the author explain how a</seg><seg type="columnLine">molecule of II20 can be split up so that a fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">spray of water would result ? This is incredible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 3.	Let us again take the author's statement that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Manabi village could be situated between two</seg><seg type="columnLine">grains of sand as between great cliffs. Would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tread of a full-sized man's foot displace several</seg><seg type="columnLine">grains of sand, at the least, and thus bring destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to the tiny inhabitants?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 4.	Once more, Mr. Verrill says that each mole-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cule of water would appear as a dark, large,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud. Now, if a molecule at that height would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be of such great size, the atoms and the electrons</seg><seg type="columnLine">composing it would be visible. The electrons</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be the size of tennis balls revolving hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of feet from the nucleus. Would the rays of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">be too dense to enter between these? I agree with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one reader who writes that "Out of the Sub-Uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse" was the best story you've ever published.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It certainly was grand. Dr. Menzel's articles on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Einstein's Theories in Science and Invention</seg><seg type="columnLine">are most vivid and have given, me more enlighten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment on the subject than any book I have ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">read on it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I disagree with readers who want the name or</seg><seg type="columnLine">type of cover changed.

There are some stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I do not like, but the majority of them are ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cellent. Such stories as "The World of the Giant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Ants," for instance, do not appeal to me. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thought Amazing Stories was based on facts. If</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they are, then why print such stories as these?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I also like good interplanetary stories, but I think</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when too many are published in one edition, it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tends to destroy the interest one has in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">magazine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   In one story, an author tells us, that in travel-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing through space, a person in a space-flyer has</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">no weight to speak of. In another story, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">author tells us that a person in a space-flyer can</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">walk around as though he or she were on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">earth. Now which is truthful?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I believe that after passing out of the atmosphere</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the earth, a body has no weight whatsoever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">If that is true, how is it possible to attain any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">speed desired? It is so, that the less weight, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more speed, but with less safety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Another thing, if all the instruments that have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">been produced in the last ten years are as they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have been claimed to be, why has there not been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">started a projectile such as explained in "Four</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Dimensional Transit?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I read the story of "The Master of the World."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In it, it explained how an airplane could be turned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into a speedboat, a submarine or into an auto, at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">will. If that is true, which I think it is, why has</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it not been done?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                Harmon H.

Sometimes we feel as if it has taken all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">these years to give us a complete "feel" of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">public taste in such material as we use, and we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">believe that the result will be to give a better</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">magazine always. Amazing Stories may be said</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to be based on facts largely, but its stories are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">based on other things also. They are based on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">possibilities of the future and in order to give the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">romantic touch, our authors indulge in what may</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be called quite wild predictions of what is to come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Your views about weight are inaccurate. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere of the earth has no connection with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weight, except as it acts to buoy up the body, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">if the body is that of a human being the buoyant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">effect is very little. In case of a mass of lead, it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would be still less proportionately. Weight is due</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the gravitational attraction of the earth for the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">object and of the object for the earth. A space</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">traveler would ultimately reach a zone of no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weight or of practically none. There is no rela-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tion between weight and speed, if the body con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tinues to be propelled. A very heavy projectile,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">other things being equal, will go further than a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">light one, because proportionately there is less air</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">resistance. If you do not understand the points</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we are making, do not hesitate to write again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Various efforts have been made in the direction</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of constructing an automobile which would cross a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">river, acting as a boat, but we never heard of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">anybody attempting to give it the third function of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">being a submarine. So do not look for cold facts</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">only, in Amazing Stories; look for inspiration</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and possibilities of future times, and realize that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the wildest predictions in many cases may be true</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">views of the future.--Editor.)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE FLOATING SEA-PORTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Editor, Amazing Stories:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I have just finished reading the "Discussions"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">department and was rather amused at the many</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">varied ideas for bettering "Our magazine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It has been my thought, if you were to try and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">please every one, why not take inventory of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">likes and dislikes of each individual and make a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">magazine for that person alone.
