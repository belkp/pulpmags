                    <ab rend="p">A few years ago a new and unknown gem stone was accidentally created by <persName role="scientist">M.
                            Verneuil</persName>, the world-famous scientist. His asso-ciates examined the new gem and declared the secret of making
                        diamonds had been discovered. Scientists and jewelers pro-nounced the stone a diamond! Verneuil alone was undeceived. The new
                        gem, he says, flashes like a diamond, and will last forever, but the composition is not identical. This new diamond-like gem
                        stone was given a new name--Lachnite.</ab>
                    <ab rend="p">Already, over 300,000 Americans wear Lachnites in place of diamonds. The cost being small, they have saved probably
                        over $150,000,000.00. Wherever you go you see Lachnites, though you may not know it!</ab>

                    <ab rend="p">This chart shows the astounding similarity between Lach-nites and diamonds. They flash with equal brilliance and
                        withstand the same heat and acid tests. No wonder men cannot distinguish them even when they are placed side by side. Note on
                        the chart how common "imitation diamonds" fail to withstand the diamond tests. Buy genuine Lachnites, sold in America only by

                    <ab>SIR CHEVILLE is found dead at the foot of a precipice from which he was apparently hurled. Etherton, a manufacturer, who owed
                        Cheville money, and Mrs. Stanbury, his sister-in-law, who opposed his approaching marriage to a governess because it
                        threatened her son's inheritance, were seen near the scene of the crime by Pike, Etherton's secretary, who tries to use his
                        information to force Letty, Etherton's daughter, to marry him. She is secretly engaged to Marston Stanbury, Cheville's heir,
                        and scorns the clerk's advances. Two documents bearing on the motive of the murder are missing, one from the dead baronet's
                        pocket, is the plan of Etherton's valuable invention, and the other is a will executed on the day of Sir Cheville's death in
                        which he bequeathes 100,000 pounds to his fiancee and the rest of his estate to Marston. Marston's growing suspicion of Birch,
                        Sir Cheville's lawyer and a former lover of the governess, is strengthened by the re-port of a moor ranger who saw the couple
                        many times late at night on the moor, and on the night of the murder in particular. Pike overhears this conversation and
                        pretending to have been an eye witness, demands 5,000 pounds of Birch for his silence. Birch, frightened, complies, but Pike
                        who plans to hasten to America is seen entering a steamship office and is detained by the police who suspect him. He pretends
                        to make a full confession, which implicates Birch. Meanwhile, the lost will is found in Sir Cheville's locker. The police go
                        after Birch, who is found with the governess. She frankly confesses they were lovers and had met on the night of the murder
                        for a last good-bye. She further tells of leaving her lover and on her homeward way of passing two men, wearing black masks,
                        coming from the direction of the precipice!</ab>

                    <ab>In a dirty, forlorn shack by the river edge they found the mutilated body of Genevieve Martin. Her pretty face was swollen and

                        crime? No one had seen the girl and her assailant enter the cottage. No one had seen the murderer depart. How could he be
                        brought to justice ? Crimes like this have been solved--are being solved every day--by Finger Print Experts. Every day we read
