When</seg><seg type="columnLine">George is able to move again, we shall have to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">for another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">June 15th.--Took George to a mannequin show</seg><seg type="columnLine">to-day in the woods, and saw some perfectly love-</seg><seg type="columnLine">FOLLIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ly gowns.
