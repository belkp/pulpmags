Coblentj</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was in the spring of 1918 that the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States submarine X-lll was launched upon its</seg><seg type="columnLine">adventurous career. The German commerce raid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers had now reached the height of their effective-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness; almost daily they were taking their toll of</seg><seg type="columnLine">luckless seamen and provision-laden steamers; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States government, in alarm that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">never officially admitted, had resolved upon des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate measures. The re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sult was the X-lll. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">first of a fleet of undersea</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft, this vessel was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed upon lines never</seg><seg type="columnLine">before attempted. Not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">was it exceedingly long</seg><seg type="columnLine">(being about two hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet from stem to stern),</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was excessively nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row, and a man had to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">short indeed to stand up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right within it on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">single deck without coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">into contact with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arching ceiling. The ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fact, was nothing more</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor less than a long pipe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like tube of reinforced</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel, able to cleave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water at tremendous speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ram and destroy any</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy by ramming it with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its beak-like prow. But this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only its slightest point</seg><seg type="columnLine">of novelty. At both ends</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at several points along</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sides it was equipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with water-piercing</seg><seg type="columnLine">searchlights of a power</seg><seg type="columnLine">never before known (the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creation of Walter Tam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock, the Kansas inventor</seg><seg type="columnLine">who lost his life in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">war); and it was provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a series of air-tight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and water-proof compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments, any one of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be pierced without</seg><seg type="columnLine">seriously injuring the ves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sel as a whole. Hence the</seg><seg type="columnLine">X-lll was generally known</seg><seg type="columnLine">as unsinkable, and upon it</seg><seg type="columnLine">the American officials fas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tened their hopes of abat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the nuisance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy "U-boat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sinking of this "unsinkable" vessel is now of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course a matter of history. Close observers of naval</seg><seg type="columnLine">events will recall how, in May, 1918, the newspapers</seg><seg type="columnLine">reported the disappearance of another United States</seg><seg type="columnLine">submarine. All that was known with certainty was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the ship had been commissioned to the danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">zone; that it had failed to return to its base at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">expected time, and that the passing days brought no</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">news of it; that wireless messages and searching expedi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tions alike proved unavailing, and that it was two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">months before the only clue as to its fate was found.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then it was that a British destroyer, on scout duty in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the North Sea, picked up a drifting life preserver bear-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing the imprint "X-lll." For strategic reasons, this</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fact was not divulged until much later, and for strategic</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                         reasons it was not made</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                         known that the missing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                         submarine was of a new</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                         and previously untried</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                         type; but the mystery oÂ£</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                         the X-lll's disappearance</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                         weighed heavily upon the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                         minds of naval officials,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                         and secretly they resolved</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                         upon immediate and ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                         haustive investigation.

Perhaps the new inventions</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not yet been perfected, or perhaps, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the haste of wartime, adequate tests had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been made; at any rate, the vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed mechanical troubles after her first half</seg><seg type="columnLine">day at sea. To begin with, the rudder and steer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing apparatus proved unmanageable; then, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours spent in malting repairs, the engines showed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendency to balk under the tremendous speed we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered to maintain; and finally, when we had about</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved the engine problem, we had the misfortune to</seg><seg type="columnLine">collide with a half-submerged derelict, while running</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the surface, and one of our water-tight compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments sprang a leak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Immediately following the accident, we had risen</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the surface, for the break was about on a level</seg><seg type="columnLine">with our waterline, and the compartment could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely flooded so long as we did not submerge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet Captain Gavison warned us not to waste a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and the men worked with desperate speed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">repair the damage, for we knew that we were in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">zone of the German U-boat, and that any delay might</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove perilous, if not fatal. Unfortunately, the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">was unusually calm and the day was blue and clear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that even our low-lying hulk could be sighted many</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles across the waters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I do not know precisely at what position we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">then stationed, except that it was somewhere in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eastern Atlantic, and at a point where, according to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the warnings of our Secret Service, a concentration of</seg><seg type="columnLine">German submarines was to be expected. At any other</seg><seg type="columnLine">time we would have welcomed the opportunity to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to grips with the foe; but now, in our disabled condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, we kept a lookout with grave misgivings, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">silently prayed that the damage might be repaired</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the enemy slunk into view. Yet it was slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">work to man the pumps and at the same time to weld</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strip of metal across the jagged gap in our side;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hours passed while we stood there working thigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep in water, our heads bent low, for there was but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">two or three feet of breathing space beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curved iron ceiling. Suppressed growls and curses</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from our lips each time a sudden surge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters interfered with the welding. Meanwhile all</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in confusion; the men worked with the feverish</seg><seg type="columnLine">inefficiency of terror, scarcely heeding the orders of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers; the chief contents of the compartment float-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed about almost unnoted. I distinctly remember that</seg><seg type="columnLine">several articles, including a life preserver which one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the recruits had unfastened in his fright, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">washed overboard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still, we did make some progress, and after four or</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hours, and just as the blood-red sun was sinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">low in the west, we found our task nearing comple-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. A few more minutes, and the welding would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplished; a few more minutes, and darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be upon us, leaving, us free from fear of at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tack for the next eight or ten hours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was just when we felt safest that the real danger</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented itself. A swift trail of white shot across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waters far to westward, and, advancing at full</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, vanished in a long, frothy furrow just in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">wake. "A German U-boat! A U-boat two points off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the port bow!" frantically cried the watch; and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambled from the flooded compartment as the Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain gave the order "Submerge!" Now we heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid churning of our engines as we went plunging</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the blackness beneath the sea; now we made</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to launch a torpedo of our own as our peri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scope showed us the disappearing tip of an enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">submarine; now we were hurled into an exciting chase</seg><seg type="columnLine">as our prodigiously powerful searchlights illumined</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole leagues of the water, even revealing the dark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cigar-shaped hulk of the foe. Had we not been im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peded by the dead weight of a compartment full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, we would unquestionably have overtaken the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy, rammed it and ended its career; even as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, we seemed to be gaining upon it, and we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes of shooting up unseen and bullet-like from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark, and with tremendous impact smiting it in two.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not even the unexpected appearance of a second sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marine altered our plans. Handicapped as we were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would show our superiority to both the enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was at this point that mechanical troubles</seg><seg type="columnLine">again betrayed us. Overworked by our excessive burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of speed, our engines (which were of the super-electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">type recently invented by Cogswell) gave signs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowing up and stopping; and so dangerously over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heated were they, that our Captain had to halt our</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel abruptly, almost within striking distance of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foe. Our position became extremely precarious, for at</seg><seg type="columnLine">any moment the German searchlights might spy us</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, and a few undersea bombs might send us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As our own equipment had purposely been made as</seg><seg type="columnLine">light as possible, we were provided with no explosive</seg><seg type="columnLine">shells other than torpedoes: hence we were compelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rise to the surface in order to attack. This, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized, was a hazardous expedient, since both the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemy vessels were already in a position to answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">our bombardment, volley for volley. But trusting to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gathering darkness and to our aggressive tactics</seg><seg type="columnLine">to win us the advantage, we unhesitatingly rose to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the level, and, with as little delay as possible, dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged a torpedo toward the dim-low-lying form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whether that projectile reached its goal, none of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us will ever be able to say. From the sudden, furious</seg><seg type="columnLine">eruption of spray in the direction of the enemy craft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am inclined to believe that this was among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">U-boats later reported missing; yet, the torpedo may</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">295</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">merely have struck some floating object and so have</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost its prey. Whatever the results, we were unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to observe with certainty, for at the same moment a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming streak shot toward us across the dark waters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the next instant we went sprawling about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck as a dull thudding crash came to our ears and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vessel shook and wavered as though in an earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quake's grip. Half dazed from the shock, we gath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered ourselves together and rose uncertainly to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, staring at one another in dull consternation. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same moment one of the seamen burst wildly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the cabin, despair and terror in his maddened</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. "The central compartment!" he cried. "The cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tral compartment. It's flooded, all flooded!" And as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if to prove his words, we felt ourselves sinking, sink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing slowly, though we had not been ordered to sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merge; the darkness of the twilight skies quickly gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the darkness beneath the ocean.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was some minutes. before we quite realized what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was happening. Accustomed as we were to under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea traveling, we did not at first understand that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an adventure quite out of the ordinary. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the waters had lost their first pale translucency</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had become utterly black and opaque, we did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize our terrible predicament. Only after our ves-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sel began listing violently, and we felt the deck slop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at an angle of forty-five degrees, did we recognize</seg><seg type="columnLine">the full horror of our position. Although we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see not one inch beyond the thick glass portholes, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had an indefinable sense that we were sinking, sink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down, down, down through vague and unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">abysses; and the stark and helpless terror on the as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembled faces gave proof that the others shared my</seg><seg type="columnLine">feelings. Not a word did we utter. Indeed, speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not have been easy, for a low, continuous roar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was in our ears, a hoarse, muffled roaring re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minding me of the murmuring in a sea-shell. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time, a strange depression overwhelmed my</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses; it seemed as though the atmosphere had sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly become thick and heavy, too heavy for breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; it seemed as though an unnatural weight had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been piled upon me, threatening to crush and stifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Yet I did notice that the vessel quivered vio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lently and lunged upward every few seconds, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">furious effort to right itself and rise to the surface.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did fancy that I heard the buzzing of the engines</seg><seg type="columnLine">at times, an intermittent buzzing that was most dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quieting; and I found myself, like the others, hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the brass railings to steady myself when the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaved and shuddered, or to keep my footing when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we slanted downward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps five minutes passed when the door leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward was thrust open, and Captain Gavison climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">precariously into the room. All eyes were bent upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in silent inquiry; but his grim, stoically firm</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenance was far from reassuring. It was apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had something to say, and that he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">care to say it; and several anxious moments elapsed</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he stood glowering upon us, evidently unde-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided whether to give his message words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Yet even at this crisis he could not forget discipline.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His first words brought us no information, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">first action was to station us about the room in</seg><seg type="columnLine">orderly fashion, assigning each to some specific duty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will not keep the facts from you," he declared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with slow, deliberate accentuation, when finally we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all in position. "Three of our compartments are</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooded. The other compartments seem to be holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">out as yet, but the great mass of water in our hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">is bearing us rapidly downward, and the engines seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to neutralize the effect. At the last reading,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">we were nine hundred and twenty-seven feet below</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea level."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great God! What are we to do about it?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped, in biting terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suggestions are in order," stated the Captain, la-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But no suggestion was forthcoming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course, we are in no immediate danger . . ."</seg><seg type="columnLine">he resumed. But he might have spared his words.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Most of us had had sufficient experience of undersea</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel to know that the danger was real enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barring the remote contingency that the engines would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be brought back into efficient working order, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were only two possibilities. On the one hand, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">might reach the bottom of the sea, and, stranded there,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would perish of starvation or slow suffocation. Or, An</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second place, we might continue drifting down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward until the tremendous pressure of the water, prov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing too strong even for the stout steel envelope of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our vessel, would bend and crush it like an egg-shell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although we could no longer guide our course, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic searchlights were at once brought into play,</seg><seg type="columnLine">piercing the water with brilliant yellow streamers. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might have been searchlights in a tomb, for they</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed us nothing except the minute wavy dark shapes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that occasionally drifted in and out of our line of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision. There was something ghastly, I thought, about</seg><seg type="columnLine">that light, that intense unearthly sallow light, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">glided slowly in long curves and spirals about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick enveloping darkness. And the very penetrating</seg><seg type="columnLine">power of the rays served only to accentuate the horror.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the illumination ended in nothingness; nothing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness seemed to stretch above us, beneath us, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">all sides of us; we were enfolded in it as in a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">mantle; it seemed to be stretching out long arms to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fetter us, to gather us up, to strangle us slyly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SLOWLY, with agonizing slowness, the moments crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">by; slowly we continued sinking, down, down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, ever down and down, with movement gradual</seg><seg type="columnLine">and constantly diminishing, yet never ceasing. Never</seg><seg type="columnLine">before in history, we told ourselves, had living men</seg><seg type="columnLine">been plunged so far beneath the ocean.

Some were long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">snaky monsters, with thin heads set with rows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spike-like teeth, and tiny eyes that gleamed evilly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the uncanny light; some were lithe sea dragons, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolfish mouths and sabre-like bony appendages pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jecting from low foreheads; some were many-colored,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rainbow-hued or streaked with black and golden, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">red and azure, or yellow and white; some had chame-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leon eyes that flashed first green and then blue, ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cording to the play of the light about them; many</seg><seg type="columnLine">were flitting to and fro, circling and spiralling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubling back and forth at incredible speed; and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few, unacquainted with the ways of submarines)</seg><seg type="columnLine">collided full-tilt with the thick glass of our portholes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as our depth gradually increased, our finny</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitors began to give way to others stranger still.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When we were twenty-two hundred feet below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface, the searchlights were no longer necessary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reveal the denizens of the deep, for the inhabitants of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those unthinkable regions carried their own lamps!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And how they amazed us and startled us!--how, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">296</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">our shuddering ncrve-racking terror, they appeared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us as ghosts or avenging fiends, or struck our over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked imaginations as approaching foes or rescuers!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly, out of the deathly blackness, a spurt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">green light appeared, swiftly widening until it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unearthly searchlight--and, from a narrow focus</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flame, two huge burning green eyes would shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth, darting cold malice at us through the glass port,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the yellow electric light would seem tinged with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an emerald reflection. Or else a tiny flattened disk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">softly phosphorescent throughout and marked on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface by two bright beady eyes, would come float-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in our direction like a pale apparition; or, again, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long dark rod, brilliantly white like a living flash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, would dart curving and gleaming toward us</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the remote gloomy depths. But more terrifying</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any of these were the nameless monsters with in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible bodies and lidless, fiery yellow eyes of the size</seg><seg type="columnLine">of baseballs,--eyes that stared in at us, and stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stared, as though all the concentrated horror of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the universe were glaring upon us, seeking to ferret</seg><seg type="columnLine">us out and mark us for its victims.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And still we were sinking, unceasingly sinking, till</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last faint hope had died in the heart of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanguine, and in despair and with half-mumbled phrases</seg><seg type="columnLine">we' admitted that there could be no rescue for us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When we were twenty-five hundred feet below the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, the fury of expectation had given place to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blank and settled despondency; when the distance was</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-eight hundred feet, each was striving in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own way to prepare himself for the fate which all felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be but a question of hours. In our panic-stricken</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror, we had all long ago forgotten the positions as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed us by the Captain; and the Captain himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not appear to notice where we were. Young Raw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, the newest of the recruits, had gone down on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees, and with tears in his eyes was murmuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">half audible prayers; Matthew Stangale, one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oldest and most hardened of the seamen, was pacing</seg><seg type="columnLine">restlessly back and forth, back and forth, in the nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row compartment, clenching his fists furiously and</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttering to himself; Daniel Howlett, veteran of many</seg><seg type="columnLine">campaigns, contented himself with a suppressed growl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and profanity, and his curses were echoed by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions; Frank Ripley, a college gridiron hero,</seg><seg type="columnLine">enlisted for the war, buried himself in a corner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room, his face covered by his hands, the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture of dejection, though every once in a while,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wistfully and half-furtively, he would let his gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel to a little photograph he guarded close to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bosom. And as for Captain Gavison, on whom we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fastened our last fading hope of escape--he merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood near the porthole with arms clenched behind his</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and thin lips tightly compressed, peering out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black waters as though he read there some secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden from the obtuse gaze of his followers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE were below the three thousand foot level when</seg><seg type="columnLine">fresh cause for anxiety appeared. "The holy</seg><seg type="columnLine">saints have mercy on us!" suddenly exclaimed James</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stranahan, one of the common seamen, as he crossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself piously. And pointing in awe-stricken amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment through one of the glass spy-holes which led</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the deck, down through the bottom of the ship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he called attention to a dim shimmering luminescence</seg><seg type="columnLine">far below. Excitedly we crowded about him, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumbling over one another in our eagerness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror, but for a moment we could see nothing. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly, as we stood straining our eyes to fathom the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness, we became aware of a vague filmy, wide-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread sheet of light twinkling faintly beneath us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and remote as the stars of an inverted Milky Way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sheet of light beneath us, at the bottom of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea! In incredulous astonishment, we turned to one</seg><seg type="columnLine">another, scarcely able to believe our senses, our horror</seg><seg type="columnLine">written plainly in our gaping eyes! And in silence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with fear-blanched faces, half of the company</seg><seg type="columnLine">made the sign of the cross.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure it's a ghost, a deep-sea ghost!" ventured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">superstitious Stranahan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's where the sea serpents have their home!" put</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Stangale, with an abortive attempt to be jocular.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There's ten million of them down there, with devil's</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes of fire!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe it's the Evil One himself!" suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stranahan, not content with a single guess. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">if it's the very throne-room of Hell, and them are</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flames of Old Nick!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These words did not seem to reassure the rest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crew. Several were trembling visibly, and several</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued to cross themselves in silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile the Captain had ordered the search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights turned downward, and in long loops and curves</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cutting light swept the darkness beneath. But not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing was visible, except for a few flapping fishy</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms; and our lanterns served only to conceal the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious luminescence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet, when the searchlights were again directed up-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, that luminescence became more distinct and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to stretch to infinite distances on all sides. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was still incalculably remote, and still filled us with</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm and foreboding. Whatever it was (and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not help feeling that it was evil), we knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was a thing beyond the reach of all human expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rience; whatever it was, it was a monstrous thing, pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibly malevolent and terrible, and not inconceivably</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghostly and supernatural.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as we continued to sink, I began to doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether any of us should live to solve the mystery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The air in our overcrowded compartments was becom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing oppressively heavy and vitiated; we were like men</seg><seg type="columnLine">locked in sealed vaults, and there was no possibility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">renewing our exhausted oxygen supply. Already I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to feel drowsy from the lack of air; my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head was aching dully and I had almost ceased to</seg><seg type="columnLine">care where we went or what befell us. Today, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I look back upon the racking events of those terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours, I feel sure that I was not far from delirium;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when I recall how some of my comrades reclined</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunkenly on the floor, with half-hysterical mumblings</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wailings, I am certain that there were but few of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, who retained our right senses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is, indeed, a blank space in my memory con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerning what occurred at about this time; I may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen off into a doze or sodden slumber lasting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes or even for hours. I can only say that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a recollection of coming abruptly to myself, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a state of coma; and, with a sudden jolt of</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding, I realized where I was, and observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a shock that half a dozen of my comrades were</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered together in a little group, pointing down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward with excited exclamations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Staggering to my feet, I joined them, and in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment shared in their agitation. The lights beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">us were now far lighter--they no longer formed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vague shimmering screen, but were concentrated bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liantly in a score of golden globes of the apparent size</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sun. "Could it be that the ocean too has its</seg><seg type="columnLine">suns?" I asked myself, as when one asks dazed ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions in a dream. And looking at those spectral lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">that wavered and gleamed through the pale translucent</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters, I felt that this was surely but a nightmare</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which I should soon awaken. Fantastic fish,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with triangular glowing red heads and searchlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">297</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes projected on slender tubes, darted before our win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows in innumerable schools; but these seemed almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar now by comparison with those eerie golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights below; and it was upon the golden illumination</seg><seg type="columnLine">that my gaze was riveted as we settled slowly down</seg><seg type="columnLine">and down. Soon it became apparent that the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">central globes were not the only source of the radi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance, for smaller points of light gradually became vis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ible, some of them moving, actually moving as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">borne by living hands!--and even the spaces between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lights seemed to wear an increasing golden luster!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet with the golden was mingled a singular tinge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">green, a green that seemed scarcely of the waters;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">irrepressible Stranahan, pointing downward and for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting the aspect of the bulkheads and deck. "There's,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a city under the sea!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A city under the sea!" we echoed, in stupefied</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement. And from one corner of the room came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a burst of hysterical laughter, which wavered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke and then died out, sounding uncannily like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiend's derision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I tell you, there is a city under the sea!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">insisted Stranahan, noting the incredulous stares witH</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we regarded him. "The Lord strike me dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I didn't see its streets and houses!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though none of us doubted but that the Lord</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Our scnrchiights made us the center of attraction tor myriads ol scaly things; wholo schools and squadrons of fishes were gathering moth-liko</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the vivid illumination thrown out by our vessel . . . flitting to and fro, circling and spiralling and doubling back and forth at incredible speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and the mysterious depths were no longer black, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">olive-hued, as though the light came filtering to us</seg><seg type="columnLine">through some solid dark-green medium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  But a more imminent peril was to distract our at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention from the weird lights. For some minutes I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been vaguely aware of something peculiar in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aspect of our compartment; yet, in my stupefied condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, I had not been able to determine just what was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong. But full realization came to me when Strana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">han, pointing upward, wide-eyed with horror, sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly exclaimed, "Heaven preserve us, look at the ceil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">â ing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  We all looked. The ceiling was bulging inches down-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, as though the terrific pressure of the waters</seg><seg type="columnLine">were already bursting the tough steel envelope of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">X-lll. And at the same time we observed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck we stood on, was bulging upward, and that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulkheads were being twisted and distorted like iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">rails warped by an earthquake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT now came the greatest surprise of all. "By</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the saints and little devils!" burst forth the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would indeed do as Stranahan suggested, we inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preted his remarks as mere delirious ravings, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued to stare at him in petrified silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see, there she is!" persisted the seaman, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointing downward regardless of our disbelief. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossing himself piously, he continued, in awed tones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"May the Virgin have pity on us, if that don't look</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a church!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stranahan's last words had such a tone of convic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that, though our doubts were still strong, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not forebear to look. And, after a single glance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our scepticism gave place to dumbfounded amazement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For was this not a city staring up at us from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green-golden depths? Or at least the ruins of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a city? In outlines wavy because of the dense,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifting waters, and yet as definite of form as re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flections in a still pool, half a dozen great yellow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">white temples seemed to glimmer beneath the brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights, with massive columns, wide-reaching porticoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and colonnades, and gracefully curving arches and</seg><seg type="columnLine">domes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was this but a mirage? we asked ourselves. Or</seg><seg type="columnLine">298</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were these the remains of some submerged, ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">town? Never had we heard of mirages beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea--but if this were a dead city, then why these vivid</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights? And, certainly, no living city could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagined in these profound watery abysses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as we wondered, we seemed to note a gradual</seg><seg type="columnLine">change in our movement. We were no longer sinking;</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were drifting with slow motion, almost horizontally;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and just beneath us appeared to be an impenetrable</seg><seg type="columnLine">but transparent dense, greenish wall, a wall that--had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the idea not been too preposterous--we might almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">have imagined to be of glass. Beneath this wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleamed no lantern-bearing, fishy eyes, but the dazzling</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden orbs and the smaller scattered lights shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily with piercing radiance; and beneath us, at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance that may have been five hundred feet and</seg><seg type="columnLine">may have been a thousand, the vaults and domes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">columns of innumerable stone edifices shone palely and</seg><seg type="columnLine">With sallow luster. Surely, we thought, this was some</seg><seg type="columnLine">unheard-of Athens, doomed long ago by tidal wave</seg><seg type="columnLine">or volcano.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually, for some reason that we could not quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain, our horizontal motion seemed to be increas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; and, caught apparently by some rapid deep-sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">current, we drifted with appreciable velocity above</seg><seg type="columnLine">those dim realms of green and golden. Palace after</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnificent palace, many seemingly modelled by archi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tects of old Greece, went gliding by beneath us; count-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less statues, tall as the buildings, pointed up at us</seg><seg type="columnLine">&gt;vith hands that were uncannily life-like; wide avenue</seg><seg type="columnLine">after wide avenue flashed by, and one or two colossal</seg><seg type="columnLine">theatres of old Grecian design; but no living thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be seen, or, at least, so it seemed, for though</seg><seg type="columnLine">we strained our eyes, we could discern only shadows</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving in those uncertain depths, only shadows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">an occasional firefly light which zigzagged fitfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the buildings and which we took to be some</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange illuminated finny thing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly, for no apparent reason, fresh terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized us. Perhaps it was because we realized abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the full eerie horror of floating thus above a city of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dead; perhaps it was that the whole unspeakable</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghastliness of the adventure had again flashed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. Be that as it may, we began to shake and shiver</seg><seg type="columnLine">once moi-e as though in the grip of a mastering emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, or as though obsessed by forethought of approach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing disaster; and muttered prayers again were heard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more than one silent tear was shed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the time for tears and prayers was over. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">motion, gradually increasing for some minutes, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly accelerated as if by some gigantic prod; we</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed caught in some mighty movement of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters, some maelstrom that whirled us about and</seg><seg type="columnLine">buffeted us like a feather; a hoarse, continuous thunder</seg><seg type="columnLine">dinned in our ears, and we went shooting forward</seg><seg type="columnLine">with prodigious speed. Then came a violent jerk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we found ourselves tossed pellmell to all corners</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room; then another jerk, and we were flung</seg><seg type="columnLine">back again like dice shaken in a box; then still an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other jerk, more vehement than the others, and our</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrorized minds lost track of events as our vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunged and heaved, then veered and stood almost on</seg><seg type="columnLine">end, then began to spin round and round, like a swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">gyrating top . . . And in that whirling confusion our</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses reeled and grew blurred, and darkness came</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouding back, darkness and sleep and nothingness . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg><seg type="columnLine">Untraveled Depth's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HOW any of us chanced to survive is more than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can say. In the turbulence and vertigo of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">last blind roaring moment, I had vaguely felt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that we had reached the end of all things; hence it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost with surprise that I found myself hazily re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaining consciousness, and discovered that I could still</seg><seg type="columnLine">move my limbs and open my eyes. At first, indeed, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had the dim sense that I was dead and embarking upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Afterlife; and it was only the definite sensation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pain in my bruised arms and legs, and the definite</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of my comrades tumbled about in ungainly atti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tudes, which convinced me that I was still on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">better known side of the grave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, and I thought we went through the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">gates of Hell!" came a familiar voice; and Stranahan</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose unsteadily to his feet, lugubriously nursing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprained wrist. "By all the saints in heaven, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be a devilish lot! The devil himself didn't seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to get us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cheered by sound of a human voice, I followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stranahan's example, and slowly and painfully arose. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thankful to learn that, although badly battered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had suffered no broken bones; and as my comrades</seg><seg type="columnLine">one by one staggered up from the deck, I was glad to</seg><seg type="columnLine">observe that none were gravely injured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our vessel had assumed a horizontal position again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I felt that our surroundings were strangely altered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While a pale luminescence seemed to transfuse the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters on both sides and above us, yet below us the</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden lights were no longer visible, and everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed impenetrably black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, the Captain again ordered the search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights turned on--and this time with extraordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">results. Just beneath us, actually in contact with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottom of the X-lll, a flat, sandy reach of ground was</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible--certainly, the bottom of the sea! But this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact was the least remarkable of all. On both sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us, at distances possibly of two hundred yards, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high and geometrically regular embankment shot up</seg><seg type="columnLine">precipitously, ending in a yellow illuminated patch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water whose nature we could scarcely surmise. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">one thing apparent was that we were in a submarine</seg><seg type="columnLine">channel, a sort of river bed in the bottom of the sea.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This fact was made evident by a current which sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">us skimming along the soft sands although our en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gines had long since ceased to supply us with power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't understand it!" sighed Captain Gavison,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shaking his head dolefully. "I can't understand it at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all!

It was as large as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the largest known shark, but was shaped like no fish</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had ever seen, tapering to a slender, canoe-like point</seg><seg type="columnLine">at both ends; and, as it passed, the water seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">foam and bubble strangely in its wake.-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perdition take me, if it ain't a sea dragon!" ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured Stranahan, who had to have his say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stranahan, be silent!" snapped the Captain, in high</seg><seg type="columnLine">irritation. "You're always saying the wrong thing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wrong time!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir," admitted Stranahan, meekly, a grave ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression in his pale blue eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you want to make yourself useful, Stranahan,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued the Captain severely, although with less</seg><seg type="columnLine">asperity than before, "go forward, and find out how</seg><seg type="columnLine">far we are beneath sea level."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, aye, sir," agreed Stranahan, remembering to</seg><seg type="columnLine">salute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How far below were we at the last reading, sir?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I inquired of the Captain, after Stranahan had van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished through the small compartment door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">299</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thirty-seven hundred feet," returned the officer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruotly. "But we've sunk considerably since then."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was at this juncture that Stranahan reappeared in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doorway, a stare of blank, incredulous astonishment</seg><seg type="columnLine">pn h's lean, hardened face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" the Captain demanded. "How far below</seg><seg type="columnLine">are we now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stranahan mopped his brow as if to wipe off an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible perspiration. But he answered not a word.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stranahan," growled the exasperated officer, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what after the manner of a schoolma'am to an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruly pupil, "do you hear me? I'm asking to know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">far below we are now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, sir," drawled Stranahan, saluting mechanically,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"wouldn't I be telling you if I knew? But, saints in</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaven, sir, that machine must be bewitched! Else I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">peeing things!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Didn't you notice the reading?" bawled the Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sir," Stranahan replied, humbly. That's what</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trouble is, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then how far below are we?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stranahan hesitated as though he would rather not</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak. "Forty-four feet," he muttered, at length.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A murmur of suppressed excitement passed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">end to end of the room. "Forty-four feet!" yelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Captain. "You mean forty-four hundred!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sir," maintained Stranahan, quietly. "I mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty-four."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Captain's anger became uncontrollable. "Stran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahan, you must take me for a fool!" he shouted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is not the moment for practical jokes! At</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other time I'd have you thrown in the brig!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, sir-" Stranahan started to protest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's enough!" roared the officer, fairly shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fury. And, turning to one of the younger men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he commanded, "Ripley, see how far below water level</seg><seg type="columnLine">yve are!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, aye, sir," assented Ripley, and left the room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A moment later he returned with a sheepish grin</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, how far below are we?" demanded the Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Ripley, like Stranahan, seemed reluctant to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak. He coughed, gasped, stammered out an unin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligible syllable or two, cleared his throat, stood gap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at us stupidly while we looked on expectantly, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">finally blurted out, "Forty- forty-three feet, sir!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Forty-three feet!" bellowed the Captain. "Has the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole crew gone crazy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, without further ado, Gavison himself went</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunging toward the door, and disappeared in the for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward compartment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was several minutes before he returned. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he rejoined us, his face wore a look of undis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guised amazement. Furtively and almost shamefacedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he peered at us, like one who fancies he is losing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">\vits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, sir, how far below are we now?" I ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Captain cleared his throat, and hesitated per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptibly before replying. "I- I really don't know.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I can't understand- I can't understand it at all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">If the instruments aren't out of order, we're exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty-two feet below!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gasped stupidly; then suggested, "No doubt, sir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the instruments are out of order."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are not!" denied the Captain. "I've tested</seg><seg type="columnLine">them!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the Captain hesitated briefly; then abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he resumed, "Besides, as you know, there are two</seg><seg type="columnLine">instruments. They both record forty-two feet. Surely,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they can't both be wrong in exactly the same way."</seg><seg type="columnLine">There ensued a moment of silence, during which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared dully at one another, filled with mute question-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings we would not dare to put into words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how do you explain-" I at length started to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">inquire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't explain at all!" interrupted the officer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We're simply running counter to all natural laws!</seg><seg type="columnLine">According to all estimates, we should be nearly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile deep by now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the Captain stood stroking his chin in grave</seg><seg type="columnLine">perplexity. Then turning suddenly to us all, he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked, "I can't see how it can be true, boys; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we're only forty-two feet deep, then maybe the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines will have life enough in them to pull us out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At least, it's a chance worth taking."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half an hour later, after a few instructions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the assignment of the crew to duty, we had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure of hearing once more the churning and throb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing of the engines. At first it promised to be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">barren pleasure indeed, for the abused machinery</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped and sputtered as though determined upon a</seg><seg type="columnLine">permanent strike; but finally after many vain efforts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were greeted by the continuous buzzing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">motors. Then we found ourselves slowly moving, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">first scarcely faster than the current, but with grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually increasing velocity; and by degrees we felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deck taking on an upward slope as the nose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vessel was pointed toward the surface of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters. It was not an easy pull, for our three</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooded compartments were powerfully inclined to hold</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to the bottom; and in the beginning we made very</seg><seg type="columnLine">little progress; several times we felt our hull scrap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the ocean floor. Eventually, the engines, waxing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their full power, began to cleave the water at grati-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fying speed, and we found that we were moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">definitely, though slowly upward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, hope came to us then in a powerful wave,</seg><seg type="columnLine">accompanied by black flashes of despair, for what if</seg><seg type="columnLine">impassable thousands of feet of water still rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">above us? Impatiently we fastened our eyes on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure gauges, and impatiently watched the regis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered distance dwindle from forty feet to thirty-five,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from thirty-five to thirty, from thirty to twenty-five,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from twenty-five to twenty! And now, in a sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den wild burst of joy, we realized that probably we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were saved! A pale but unmistakable radiance was</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeping in through the glass ports, a radiance far</seg><seg type="columnLine">more distinct and reassuring than the eerie lumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nescence we had noticed before. Certainly, this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sunlight--and in a few moments we might bask</seg><seg type="columnLine">again in the warmth of day!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as we rose from twenty feet to fifteen, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">from fifteen to ten, our hopes found increasing fuel.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The light filtering in through the windows brightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a rate that was more than heartening--and through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clear waters, even without the aid of the search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights, we could distinguish a steep embankment, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps fifty or a hundred yards away. And just above</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, almost within grasping distance, we thought we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could notice the line where water met air!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But we had no intimation of the surprise that lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">in store for us. Today, as I look back upon those</seg><seg type="columnLine">events with clear perspective, it seems incredible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that we could actually have expected to escape at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once to the upper world. But hope had doubtless</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinded our eyes and suffering blunted our percep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, so that we could not understand that we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the beginning, rather than at the end of our ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SUDDENLY, with a furious lunge and an unwonted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">violent burst of speed, we found ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">300</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">launched upward toward the wavy, light-shot level that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was our goal; and now a blinding brilliance was upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, and for a moment we had to shade our eyes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shield them from the dazzling change. Then, when by</seg><seg type="columnLine">degrees we were able to glance again about us, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">found that we were on the surface of the waters, actu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally on the surface!--but where was this that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come up? and in what strange and unmapped con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinent? There was scarcely one of us that could sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">press a cry of astonishment--we were afloat, not upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ocean, as we had expected, but rather on a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rapidly flowing river--a river that washed no</seg><seg type="columnLine">shores, ever described by human tongue! Altogether,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was one of the weirdest and most magnificent lands</seg><seg type="columnLine">imaginable; on both sides of the stream spread a flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">plain, dotted with great sea shells and greenish bould-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, which in their turn were interspersed with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mossy brow vegetation and pale, graceful flowers</seg><seg type="columnLine">like waterlilies on solitary stalks. At measured in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tervals, as far as the eye could reach, were colossal</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone columns, enriched with pastel tintings of pink</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blue; and these shot upward hundreds of feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though supporting some titanic dome, ending, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">accountably, in a dark, green sky from which glared</seg><seg type="columnLine">several sun-like, golden orbs, which suffused the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene in a mellow, unearthly luster that was beautiful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet terrifying and ghostly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rubbing our eyes, like children still not half awake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we gazed at this fantastic, lovely spectacle. Not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word did we speak; we could not have found language</seg><seg type="columnLine">to voice our amazement. Only the Captain, out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole thirty-nine of us, retained some measure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-possession; and though, as he afterwards con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessed, he was so dazzled that he spoke and acted</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanically, he did retain the presence of mind to</seg><seg type="columnLine">order our vessel steered to shore and anchored.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It is still a marvel to me that we had the energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to carry out these commands. Somehow we brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the X-lll to land; and somehow, after several false</seg><seg type="columnLine">starts, we managed to moor the ship to a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulder in a sort of miniature bay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then Stranahan proved again that he possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">an original mind. Not only was he the first to force</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself out of the opening door of the submarine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he carried out a large American flag, which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">planted in the ground among the brown weeds be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the boulders, while with sedate and ceremonious</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestures, he proclaimed, "In the name of the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States of America, I take possession of this land!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the rest of us gave no heed to his words. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">were taking deep, refreshing breaths of the pure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean air, which came to us almost like a mercy from</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaven after the suffocating atmosphere of the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marine. And before we had had half the needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to revive our starving lungs, an astounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">phenomenon, as unexpected as the very discovery of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this spectral region, was to drive Stranahan from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts at the same time that it flooded our minds</seg><seg type="columnLine">with terror. For the golden lights above suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">flickered, gave out a fugitive spark or two, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">meteor swiftness went out. We found ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">mantled in a starless and impenetrable blackness, more</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious and dreadful than the loneliest watery</seg><seg type="columnLine">abysses from which we had just escaped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg><seg type="columnLine">On Unknown Shores</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NO sooner was the darkness complete than it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be populated with all manner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird and terrible things. The disappearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the light seemed to be the signal for the approach</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of a host of evil monsters. A chorus of hoarse, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly voices, loud as the bellowing of a bull, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded about us in a deep, continuous bass; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">throaty gruntings and savage snorts and howlings</seg><seg type="columnLine">echoed and droned as thougli they issued from ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand pairs of giant lungs. Dazed with horror,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we stared into the unbroken gloom like doomed men;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I had visions of colossal eyes smoldering from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness, and jaws that struck and tore, and gnash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing teeth that rent and shattered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But it was not a moment before our dumbfounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">inaction was over. Pellmell we flung ourselves toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the submarine, almost failing to find it in the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, and tumbling tumultuously over one another in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our haste to crowd through the narrow door. Several</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the men were shoved accidentally into the water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Stranahan came in dripping from an unexpected</seg><seg type="columnLine">swim; while the Captain walked with a slight limp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">newly acquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At length, however, we were all safely within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, and the doors were barred against the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known peril. Several of the men, still trembling with</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror, were eager to get under way directly; but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea the Captain emphatically vetoed, declaring that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the X-lll was no longer seaworthy. All that we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do now was to try to locate the danger with our search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights; and accordingly, we wasted no time before</seg><seg type="columnLine">switching on our powerful lanterns and revolving</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in slow circles that illumined by turns every</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch of the boulder-strewn, weedy plain. All in vain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Although the unearthly chorus could be heard even</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the closed doors and showed no sign of dimin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishing, our searchlights revealed nothing that we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not already seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some time we watched and waited--but nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened. And at length, turning to us all with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile, the Captain advised, "Well, boys, we've all had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pretty hard time of it. Suppose we just forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">about that racket out there and try to take a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were all glad enough to follow the Captain's</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestion. Several of the men were commissioned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take turns standing watch; and the rest of us were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not long in seeking much needed sleep. Within a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, the deep and regular breathing from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearby bunks informed me that my companions had</seg><seg type="columnLine">temporarily forgotten the day's adventures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For my own part, exhausted as I was, I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">so readily find relief. The events not only of the past</seg><seg type="columnLine">few hours, but of many months, came trooping before</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind in continuous blurred procession; I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">obsessed by my own imaginings, and from a dim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-consciousness, I would awaken time after time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a vivid re-experiencing of some almost forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">episode. And, strangely enough, my reveries were</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned mainly with a single phase of my life--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">phase I was now living. My youth and early man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood might almost not have existed, for all that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered of them now; but I did sharply recall</seg><seg type="columnLine">how, at the outbreak of war more than a year ago,/</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had decided abruptly upon the action that h&lt;ri</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged me into my present plig*rÂ£ Resigning my</seg><seg type="columnLine">position at Northeastern University, where I had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">serving as instructor in'tkssic Greek, I had enlisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the navy, and had promptly been sent to an offi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cers' training school, from which I had emerged as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ensign. Friends had commended me upon my pa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">triotism, yet it was not patriotism, but rather the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greed for adventure, that had motivated my decision;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now, as I looked back, it seemed ironic to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that my previous uneventful days had been so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">more pleasant than any of my adventures. There was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">301</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">however, one factor which had served to make those</seg><seg type="columnLine">days enjoyable, a factor without which even the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">active life would be barren indeed--and that factor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was one which could have no place in wartime. Fre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quently, as I tossed and struggled fitfully on my nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row bunk, there flashed before me out of the darkness</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue eyes and laughing face of one whom I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely recall without a pang; and I lived again with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Alma Huntley those sparkling days among the Ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mont hills, when she was to me all that life was, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I won her promise of devotion among the scented pines</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to the music of rippling waters . . . That day</seg><seg type="columnLine">was long past, yet how actually it came back to mind!</seg><seg type="columnLine">And how acutely memory brought back a later day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when her cheeks were moist and I held her in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute-long embrace, and mutual vows and soft mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">murings were exchanged, and then there came the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharpness of "Farewell!" and she was gone, lost amid</seg><seg type="columnLine">a blur of faces, and I marched sedately on while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world was blotted out in loneliness and grief . . . Oh,</seg><seg type="columnLine">why had I left her, plunging thus among these un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known horrors? . . . Fervently, as I lay there listen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the uncanny bellowings from the ghostly world</seg><seg type="columnLine">without, I longed to reach out my arms to her, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold her warmly, to speak to her, and to hear her</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak, if only one loved word. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even the most intense yearning may be blotted</seg><seg type="columnLine">out by sleep. And at last, after hours, I lost my</seg><seg type="columnLine">memories in unconsciousness--an intermittent uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness, broken by disturbed dreams and vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">images of death and disaster. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I OPENED my eyes to find a bright, golden light</seg><seg type="columnLine">pouring in through the unshuttered windows. Sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised, I leapt to my feet, and discovered that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great mysterious golden orbs were shining as before'</seg><seg type="columnLine">from far above, the boulder-strewn plain glimmered as</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly as at first, the massive columns were still fairy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like in their tints of pale pink and blue, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hideous bestial noises had unaccountably ceased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hastily I dressed and rejoined my companions. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found them gathered about in a little circle, earnestly</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking; and they welcomed me gladly into their dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cussion, the subject of which I at once surmised. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">what but our mysterious plight could now occupy our</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds and tongues? None of us, as yet, had more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the faintest inkling of where we were or what</seg><seg type="columnLine">had befallen us. That we were in some sort of cavern</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the sea was the belief of the Captain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">several of the men, but this region seemed so oddly</seg><seg type="columnLine">unlike a cavern that the explanation was not gener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally accepted; and the more superstitious were in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clined to hold that we had been bewitched into some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of supernatural, goblin realm. For my own part,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could hardly understand how we could be in a sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marine cavern without being completely flooded; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">much less could I understand how we could be in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">known land above seas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Obviously, the only likely source of information was</seg><seg type="columnLine">through exploration. And since it was not possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to conduct any explorations with the aid of the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abled X-lll, the Captain took the only other available</seg><seg type="columnLine">course--which was to order some of the men to set</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth into the Unknown on foot, determine the lay of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the land and return as soon as possible with whatever</seg><seg type="columnLine">tidings they might gather.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stangale and Howlett, being the most experienced</seg><seg type="columnLine">veterans, were selected to make the initial attempt. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few minutes, they set off cheerfully together,</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipped with firearms and a day's supply of food and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink, with instructions to return within twenty-four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours at the latest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twelve or fifteen hours went by while we waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatiently; the great golden orbs flashed out as mys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teriously as before, and for eight or ten hours we</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept; then, upon awakening, we found the lights still</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining as brightly as ever, and noted that it was time</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the return of our two scouts. We watched in</seg><seg type="columnLine">vain for their arrival. Not a moving thing greeted us</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the unchanging, bouldery plain; hours went by;</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited speculation gave way to more excited specu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lation, and wild rumor to still wilder rumor; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspense became tantalizing, and yet there was noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to do but wait. Had the men lost their way? or</seg><seg type="columnLine">had they met with some disastrous adventure? or had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the savage inhabitants of these wild realms seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">and imprisoned them? To these questions there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no answer, though many were the conjectures. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness had fallen upon us once again, and once</seg><seg type="columnLine">again we had slept and awakened to find the golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">light restored, we knew that it was time to set out in</seg><seg type="columnLine">search of the missing ones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time the Captain called for volunteers to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vade the Unknown, which, as he warned us, might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous beyond all expectations; and after half the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew had offered themselves for the adventure, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">choice fell upon Ripley and Stranahan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was with genuine regret that I watched these</seg><seg type="columnLine">two gallant seamen set forth amid the reeds by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river's brink, to disappear at length among the bould-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers and behind the great stone columns. Somehow, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I lost sight of them, I had a sense that we might not</seg><seg type="columnLine">see them again so soon. I was sad as though with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a forewarning of disaster; and, as I reflected upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pitfalls and dangers they might have to face, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">experienced more than one twinge of vicarious fear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Worst of all, my misgivings seemed to be justified</seg><seg type="columnLine">by time. Twelve hours passed, and the explorers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not returned; twenty-four hours, and there was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">no word from them, though they had been given ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicit orders to be back. With grim, set eyes, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain stood alone by the river bank, gazing sternly</seg><seg type="columnLine">into that wilderness which had already engulfed four</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his men; and the rest of the crew stood chattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearfully among themselves, declaring that this land</seg><seg type="columnLine">was "haunted," "spooky," and "thick with devils."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was curious to note how, in these weird, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known domains, outworn superstitions were being re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">born; how ready the men were to believe in goblins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragons, sea serpents, werewolves and all manner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fantastic monsters. Even the more enlightened of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed about to forget all that civilization had taught</seg><seg type="columnLine">us; and, in the failure of all that we had been ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">customed to cling to, we were clutching at a savage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrorizing faith in incredible and ghostly things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time that Stranahan and Ripley had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">absent forty-eight hours, the crew was in a state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatience verging upon madness. The fluttering of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a feather would have sent them scampering like fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened horses; the buzzing of a bee might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">the signal for spasms of dread. On one occasion, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, the chirping of some cricket-like insect did put</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a dozen of the men into a panic; and on another</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion three or four of them turned pale merely upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearing the swishing and flapping of a small fish in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was when the excitement was nearing its highest</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the Captain called once more for volunteers to</seg><seg type="columnLine">search for the missing men. But so deep-rooted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralyzing was the general alarm that only two of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered our names--young Phil Rawson and myself. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not know what strange wave of courage had sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly emboldened this timorous recruit while less cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low men held back. For my own part, I must admit</seg><seg type="columnLine">302</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that I volunteered from the mere desire to .escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">from ennui and the half-frenzied rabble of my com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rades. But, whatever our motives, we were promptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be launched into adventures that were not only to</seg><seg type="columnLine">test our hardihood, but to prove interesting beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything we could have imagined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Tour of Exploration</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RAWSON and I had been gone not half an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the aspect of the country began suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to change. It was as though we had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">some indistinguishable boundary, for the boulders were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly becoming less numerous, and at length disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared entirely, while at the same time the odd, mossy</seg><seg type="columnLine">vegetation became astonishingly rich and profuse. Or,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be precise, it gave place to a different vegetation</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely, an unearthly vegetation, almost too strange</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and undulations close to the river's brink. It was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">like one of those paths which nature occasionally plans,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or which are due to the tracks of wild beasts, for it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a regularity of design and an evenness of width that</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved it to be unmistakably the work of man. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">what man could have penetrated before us into these</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncanny sunless depths? At the mere thought that</seg><seg type="columnLine">others might have preceded us we involuntarily shud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered; we were half convinced that we were intruders</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a tomb closed ages ago. But despite this convic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, we kept a constant, half-terrified outlook for</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of human presence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not long before our vigilance was rewarded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abruptly the path before us widened, until it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the size of a broad highway; and above the dense</seg><seg type="columnLine">masses of vegetation, we beheld in astonishment the</seg><seg type="columnLine">looming marble pillars of a Grecian colonnade. To-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward this the road led in long and graceful curves;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was but a few minutes before we found our-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> _ --* _	--and from a narrow focus of flame, two huge burning green</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                   eyes would shoot forth, darting cold malice at us through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass port ... Or else a tiny flattened disk, softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">phosphorescent throughout and marked on one surfacc by two bright beady eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would come floating in our direction like a pale apparition . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for belief. At the risk of being accused of fabrica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, I must describe those incredible plants: the creep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers with long leaves of lace-like brown, which twined</seg><seg type="columnLine">in dainty wreaths and veils about the olive-green boles</seg><seg type="columnLine">of limbless trees, the bushes, shaped like starfishes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hue of dried grass, with diaphanous flowers</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a breath might have blown away; the cinnamon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown reeds that rose to double a man's height, end-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in a profusion of cucumber-shaped fruits; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar, abundant growth that looked at a distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a great earthen jar, but proved upon closer ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">amination to be the hollow container of a species of</seg><seg type="columnLine">milk-white down that grew in long and silken strands</seg><seg type="columnLine">like untended hair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So dense was the foliage that we would not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been able to force our way through it, and would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have dared to make the attempt, had it not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a sharply cut path which wound in leisurely curves</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">selves at the entrance of a covered walk or "stoa"</seg><seg type="columnLine">that brought back to me vivid memories of "the glory</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was Greece." On both sides of us the palely-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinted Ionic columns rose to a majestic height, daintily</seg><seg type="columnLine">ornamented at the base with the acanthus design, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">curving in symmetrical proportions that brought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind the perfection of the Parthenon; while the marble</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor on which we walked and the marble ceiling above</seg><seg type="columnLine">us were frescoed with figures that seemed drawn bodily</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the romance of the ancient world. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not wholly Greek. I knew these pictures of sportive</seg><seg type="columnLine">mermaids and lightning-hurling gods and dragon-slay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing heroes and misty caves of twilight and the throb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing lyre; but there was something suggestively Greek</seg><seg type="columnLine">about them all; and steeped as I was in the lore of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient Hellas, I had the singular feeling that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand of time had been turned backward two thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">years or more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">303</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This feeling was accentuated when, having followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the covered walk for a distance of several hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards, I observed that it led to a magnificent, many-</seg><seg type="columnLine">columned edifice which could pass for nothing if not</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a temple of the ancient gods. It was a structure</seg><seg type="columnLine">of solid marble, white marble artistically varied with</seg><seg type="columnLine">veilings of black; its pillars were massive as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trunks of the giant redwoods I had seen in the Cali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fornia forests years before, and like those redwoods,</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced an effect of solemnity and awe; but all was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so perfectly designed and proportioned that, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building occupied an area perhaps as large as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">average city block, it gave an effect less of magnitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">than of artistic completeness and beauty. No living</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing was visible about the precincts of this amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple, nor would I have expected any living thing in</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I had come subconsciously to regard as a realm</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dead; but I was overawed at thought of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">abandoned loveliness, and paused at some distance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard it reflectively, mentally asking whether it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">some still undiscovered survival from classical times or</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether I was but seeing a vision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A suppressed exclamation from young Rawson</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought me back to reality--or, at least, to the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">believable thing that passed for reality. In the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the swift-rolling river, the banks of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralleled the colonnade at a distance of a dozen paces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I observed a low-lying, gliding form, gracefully ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vated at both extremes, which at the first terrified</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse I took to be some fabulous monster, but which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I soon recognized as some sort of boat or canoe. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore I had had time for a half-composed glance at it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had gone speeding out of view; but in its fast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving frame, I thought I could distinguish half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen dusky bobbing shapes, and half a dozen pairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of oars that reached out rhythmically, and noiselessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">clove the dark waters. Later, when I had had time</seg><seg type="columnLine">for reflection, I was to recognize this strange craft as</seg><seg type="columnLine">akin to the shadowy apparition, the unknown sea mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster which had so terrified us in the submarine; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">at present I was overwhelmed by the knowledge that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this weird place was actually peopled, peopled by living</seg><seg type="columnLine">men whom at any moment we might meet face to</seg><seg type="columnLine">face!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE had scarcely recovered from this surprise when</seg><seg type="columnLine">an even greater surprise flashed upon us. Out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the windows of the temple, which we had believed long</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed to human sound, a strange, thin music began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to float, serenely beautiful and of elfin remoteness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">charm. . . . And while, entranced, we listened to those</seg><seg type="columnLine">magical strains, there came the fluttering of a butter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fly gown, and from the temple doors issued a shim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mering, dancing form, followed by a score of other</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing, shimmering forms--scarcely human, we be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved, so ethereal did they seem in the flashing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waving of arms, the swift rhythm of feet, and the play</seg><seg type="columnLine">and interplay of pale blue and gold and pink and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lavender and white from their flowing and multi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored robes. A singular iridescence seemed to over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread them, almost a halo such as may envisage a</seg><seg type="columnLine">goddess; and, gaping and enthralled, we gazed on them</seg><seg type="columnLine">as men might gaze on Venus were she to return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. Now down the long colonnade they started,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tripping toward us with birdlike gestures and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">airy unreality of perfect time and movement; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearful to disturb the vision by our gross presence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we hid ourselves behind the great stone columns, peep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out furtively as though they might vanish bubble-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like at our gaze. But, apparently absorbed in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">dance, they continued gracefully toward us, not glanc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to right or to left, and catching no hint of our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">intrusion--until, as the procession drew more near and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the charm of the music more compelling, I peered out</seg><seg type="columnLine">too incautiously from behind my marble bulwark, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">found myself staring full into the face of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravishingly beautiful woman I had ever beheld. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a quality about her face that seemed to mark it</seg><seg type="columnLine">as not of the earth, the Madonnas of old paintings</seg><seg type="columnLine">have something of that look; and the most perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">womanly bust that sculptor has ever conceived; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was also a vividness and an animation that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere painting or statue has ever shared, together with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an air of such innocence, such candor and kindliness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of soul that, had I been a believer in angels, I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have gone down straightway upon my knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But all this I beheld in the space between two heart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">beats. Even as the vision greeted me it vanished; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful clear eyes were distended with terror upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">their first contact with mine; there came a scream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fright, followed by a chorus of screams; then a scurry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of fast-retreating feet, and the bright, fairy-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">shapes had vanished; and the empty river flowed si-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lently past the empty colonnade and temple.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER V</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Mysterious City</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next few hours showed us a continuous amaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing panorama. The marble temple proved to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">but one of a series connected by long and grace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful colonnades; and in the central structures, the Ionic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Doric architecture were curiously mingled with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">type that seemed scarcely Grecian at all, since it ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted of all variety of arches and curves unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the builders of classical Hellas. Most remarkable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all, perhaps, were the gorgeously ornamented vases</seg><seg type="columnLine">--some of them six or eight feet in height--which</seg><seg type="columnLine">were of a style akin to those excavated from the ruins</seg><seg type="columnLine">of old Ilium. But what caught my eye even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">strikingly were the statues that occasionally appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">in niches along the marble galleries or in alcoves of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the temples--statues that would surely not have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">unworthy of a Praxiteles, since even Praxiteles could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have surpassed the symmetry of form and the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained reality of pose and expression with which</seg><seg type="columnLine">these unknown artists had depicted their wrestling</seg><seg type="columnLine">heroes and dancing fauns and stern-browed old men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and queenly maidens and gracious youths. For one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been nurtured on modern art, these busts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">marbles were as old paintings would be to him who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had known only sketches in black and white; there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was none of that snowy coldness or bronze severity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hue which are so common in sculpture today, but all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the statues had been skilfully tinted with the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plexion of life, and such was the verisimilitude, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">several times I started in surprise on beholding what</seg><seg type="columnLine">I took to be a living man but which proved to be only</seg><seg type="columnLine">an image of stone. I was interested, moreover, to note</seg><seg type="columnLine">that none of the sculptured features had that peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardness and selfish keenness so common among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men I had known, but that all seemed suffused with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a clear and tranquil spirituality; and every lyric im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulse within me was awakened when I observed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of the faces of the women that same unearthly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madonna look which had graced the butterfly-gowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing maiden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, of course, Rawson and I did not allow our</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure in the statuary to keep our minds from more</seg><seg type="columnLine">vital subjects. Above all, we maintained a constant</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookout for the inhabitants of these queer regions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for we could no longer suppress the suspicion that un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen furtive eyes were peeping out at us from behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">every pillar and wall. For my own part, I had more</seg><seg type="columnLine">304</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">than one qualm that I did not care to admit, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretly wished myself back on the X-lll; and as for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rawson--I found that youth afflicted with far too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much imagination for an adventurer, and repeatedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">begged him to keep his fantastic fears to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was no repressing the excitable young</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rawson. When he was not drawing pictures of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">serpents and wild beasts that probably infested the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickets beside the temples, he would be diverting me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the most grewsome ghost stories I had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard; and he went so far as to suggest that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing girls had been only airy apparitions, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brilliant golden lights above us had no more real-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity than a will-o'-the-wisp. Evidently he had been too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much nurtured on fiction of the blood-and-terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">variety, for only a devotee of the most hectic adven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture tales could have imagined, as he did, that our</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathway was beset with robbers' lairs, pirates' dens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Scorpions and crocodiles, head-hunting cannibals, siren</seg><seg type="columnLine">TO&gt;men luring us to destruction, and murderous des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peradoes of a thousand ilks and guilds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortunately for my peace of mind, I heard not</seg><seg type="columnLine">half of Rawson's ravings, for my interest in the way-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side architecture served as a distraction. For two</seg><seg type="columnLine">or three hours I was occupied with inspecting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gracefully connecting galleries of five or six temples;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, having passed the last of the group, I was ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorbed in my observations of a long, marble colonnade</seg><seg type="columnLine">which extended apparently for miles in a straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">line amid the gray and brown fantastic vegetation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now it was that I made the most startling</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery of the day. At intervals along the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the colonnade, which was of a red and yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosaic of baked and hardened clay, appeared deeply-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graven inscriptions which I paused eagerly to survey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At first I thought that they were in 110 known lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guage, but it was not long before I had detected a</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain resemblance between the characters and those</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ancient Greek. Profiting from my collegiate</seg><seg type="columnLine">study of that tongue, I puzzled over the words while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rawson stood by impatiently urging me to be off; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one by one I succeeded in identifying the letters with</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of the Greek alphabet! Not every one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">characters, it is true, could be recognized with assur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance, but enough of them were unmistakably Greek</seg><seg type="columnLine">to give me a clue to the whole; and at length I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself making a translation that might solve the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire mystery of this extraordinary land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT the process was a slow and plodding one, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not make the progress I had expected. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the letters were clear enough, the meaning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the words was not. Evidently this was not the Greek</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Plato or Thucidydes, in which I had been thoroughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">schooled; but rather it was a language that was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">classical Greek what Chaucer is to modern English.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still, I was not completely discouraged, for I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">manage to make out an occasional word, though not</seg><seg type="columnLine">at first enough to give meaning to any passage. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">in all, considering the limited time at my disposal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my efforts seemed futile; and I was about to yield to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rawson's importunities and give up this diverting</seg><seg type="columnLine">study for further exploration, when suddenly I made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">successful discovery. I must have come upon a passage</seg><seg type="columnLine">simpler than the rest, for unexpectedly half a sentence</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed upon me with clear-cut meaning at once so</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking and so enigmatical that I stopped short with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little cry of surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Placed here in the year Three Thousand of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Submergence," ran the words, which occurred in large</seg><seg type="columnLine">lettering at the base of a statue of a strong man</seg><seg type="columnLine">trampling down the ruins of what looked like a steel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">building. "Placed here . . ." at this point were sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral words that I could not make out--"in celebration</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Good Destruction."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In celebration of the Good Destruction!" I repeated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after translating the words aloud. "Sounds as if writ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten by a madman!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Maybe you didn't read it right," commented Raw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This suggestion, of course, I ignored. "Wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the Submergence can mean," I continued, medi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tatively. "That doesn't seem to make sense, either."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, it doesn't," Rawson admitted, with a thought-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful drawl. "Everything down here seems sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">topsy-turvy. Suppose we go on and see what else</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can find out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I nodded a hesitating assent, and we proceeded on</seg><seg type="columnLine">our way in silence. But, though we did not speak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">our thoughts were active indeed, for more than ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was convinced that somehow, unaccountably, we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">amid the remains of a Grecian or pre-Grecian country-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. Had Socrate3 or the radiant Phobus himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped out of the grave to greet me, I would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been surprised; and I more than half expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to catch a glimpse of Athena's robe from behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark shrubbery, or to see the winged feet of Hermes</seg><seg type="columnLine">or hear the clear notes of Pan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But neither Pan nor Hermes nor any of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">famed kindred presented themselves upon the scene.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And after walking at a good pace for more than an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour along the marble colonnade, I forgot those inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">esting individuals in contemplation of a scene that</seg><seg type="columnLine">left me gaping in greater astonishment than if I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">invaded a council of the high Olympian gods. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">some minutes a series of huge templed domes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">columns, dimly visible through rifts in the vegetation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had attracted my attention and aroused Rawson's mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">givings; but neither of us had had any intimation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sight that was to greet us when at length we</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to the end of the colonnade.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly we saw a clay road sloping down sharply</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath us, and found ourselves gazing out over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley more dazzling than we had ever before known</seg><seg type="columnLine">or imagined. Through its center flowed the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, with gentle loops and twinings; above us, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, reached the dark-green sky illumined with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the golden suns; and an innumerable multitude of</seg><seg type="columnLine">palely tinted columns, like the tree trunks of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossal forest, shot upward to that sky as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">to support it. But what were truly remarkable were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buildings that adorned the plain. On both sides</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the river they stretched, far to the distance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of sight, palaces of. white marble and of black</seg><seg type="columnLine">marble, of jade and of alabaster, some with an ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gant symmetry of Greek columns, some with a solidity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of masonry that seemed half Egyptian, some with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost Oriental profusion of spires and turrets, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">porticoes and balconies and arches and domes. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">all alike were reared in perfect taste, and with perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard to the style of their neighbors; all alike faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">on wide avenues, flowery lanes or lawny and statue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dotted parks; all appeared but parts of a single de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign which, when seen from above, was like some</seg><seg type="columnLine">consummate tapestry patterned by a master artist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Rawson and I stood staring at this matchless</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene, I suddenly recalled the steeples and towers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that city we had seen beneath us in the submarine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A strange similarity in the outlines of the buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressed itself upon me--then in a flash it came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that the two cities were one and the same! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that instant I shuddered, amazed and horrified at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the abrupt solution of the mystery ... It was as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain had suggested; we were indeed beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">305</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean, thousands of feet beneath the ocean, in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern inexplicably spared from the waters and</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunted by the ghosts and relics of some ancient and</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished race!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Temple of the Stars</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FAR from echoing the agitation I felt, Rawson</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed actually pleased at the turn of events. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">piqued his imagination to think that we should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far beneath the sea; and he conjured up all manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of alluring possibilities that testified more to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth than to his common sense. He suggested that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were the discoverers of a great and magnificent</seg><seg type="columnLine">empire which we should explore, conquer and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">annex to the United States; and he formed his plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">regardless of the probability that we should never see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States again, and almost as though there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were regular transportation facilities to the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. The sheer scientific difficulties--the apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossibility that a cavern free from water could exist</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the ocean, the even more striking impossi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility that human beings could inhabit such a cavern</seg><seg type="columnLine">--seemed to make little impression upon the illogical</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind of Rawson; and he was convinced that only by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rarest good fortune had we been entombed in these</seg><seg type="columnLine">fantastic and dream-like depths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So intense was his enthusiasm, that he urged me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">descend at once with him to the many-templed city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I did not willingly accede; I pointed out that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be wiser to hasten back to the submarine, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form Captain Gavison of what we had seen, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn here--if we returned at all--in greater numbers</seg><seg type="columnLine">than at present. Besides, as I reminded Rawson, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain had ordered us back within twenty-four hours;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, if we dallied, some mischance might delay us until</seg><seg type="columnLine">too late.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had Rawson but had a dim prevision of the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours ahead, he would certainly have accepted my</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestions. But, perversely enough, he seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost without his usual fears just when those fears</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have proved most useful. And since of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not allow myself to be outdone in bravery by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mere boy, I had to signify a grudging assent to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposal. I must confess, however, that my motives</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not unmixed, for pictures of the iridescent danc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing girl kept flitting before my mind and would give</seg><seg type="columnLine">me no peace; and I may have had hopes (I will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">say that I did) of meeting her again in this city of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fountains and palaces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But not a living creature could be seen stirring in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the avenues of that strange town as Rawson and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">began our slow descent. Once or twice we thought we</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the glimmer of a light or the flash of some mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing thing in the far distance, but we could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure; and the silence and the immobility gave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">general effect of a city of the dead. There was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing ghostly about that calm, still atmosphere, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that might have made me turn back in alarm</seg><seg type="columnLine">had it not been for the presence of Rawson; but there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was also something soothingly peaceful, a charmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet that brought to mind the fairy tales I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard in childhood, and in particular that enchanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">palace where the Sleeping Beauty had slumbered for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred years. Here, I thought, one might dream away</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred years or a thousand, and never know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time had passed at all; here, conceivably, the ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">world might lapse into the modern, and the modern</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the far future without apparent change.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My reveries were interrupted by our arrival at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gates of the city. We passed beneath a high arch</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">almost Roman in style, with marble base and facade</seg><seg type="columnLine">ornamented with strange blue sea-shells; then, proceed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing along a winding cement walk inlaid with mother-</seg><seg type="columnLine">of-pearl, we approached the most stately palace of all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In architecture, it was totally dissimilar to anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had ever before observed: although perhaps five</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet in length, it was as much like a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">statue as like a building; it had none of those features</seg><seg type="columnLine">common in edifices for the shelter of man and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">works, but seemed to have been erected exclusively as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a piece of art. Its form was that of a woman, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman reclining at full length, her breast to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, her head slightly elevated, propped medita-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tively upon her palm; and the structure as a whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been planned with such subtlety and skill, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">such consummate attention to every detail of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman's position, form and garments and to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beatific and yet lifelike expression of the face, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rawson and I could only pause in bewildered silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stare and stare as though this work had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">created through no human agency but by some super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">human master hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In that first spellbound moment, it did not occur</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us that there might be an entrance to the palace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But at length, where a lock of the woman's dark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sculptured hair fell across her breast, we noted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little doorway so skilfully concealed that it had orig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inally escaped our attention. Since the gate swung</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide upon the hinges, curiosity, of course, prompted</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to glance within--and with results that proved but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a further spur to curiosity. All that we could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a pale, golden glitter against a background of</seg><seg type="columnLine">black; but imagination supplied that which our physi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal sight could not reveal, and we had visions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorgeous halls and corridors which we longed to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAD our courage been sufficient, we would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered at once. The idea, in fact, came to both</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us simultaneously, but at first neither of us could</seg><seg type="columnLine">summon up the requisite boldness. There seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be something mysteriously, almost irresistibly, attrac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive about that twinkling darkness, something that held</seg><seg type="columnLine">us fascinated and forbade us to leave; and for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes we stood hesitating, and straining our eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet making no motion to invade the unknown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, when the suspense had become so protracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to be ridiculous, Rawson surprised me by exclaim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, suddenly, "I'm not afraid!" And at the same time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he slapped his sides energetically as though to prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself that he had no fears. "I'm going right</seg><seg type="columnLine">in!" he announced, with what I thought to be un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary loudness. And, feeling for his revolver with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hand that trembled perceptibly, Rawson strode reso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely into the building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was nothing for me to do but follow. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow, I could not help wishing that my friend had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been so rash; and, somehow, I foresaw that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">might not be able to leave this strange edifice so</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily as we had entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, once within, we forgot our misgivings in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">templation of the magnificent scene around us. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been in luxurious galleries before; I had seen the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most ornate salons of the Old World, and the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">lavishly bedecked of mosques and cathedrals; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">never had I viewed or imagined so utterly sublime a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall. Here was a new art of the interior decorator,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an art that seemed wholly without parallel in human</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience; I was scarcely conscious that I was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors, but rather felt myself to be in the open, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open at night, under the wide and glittering</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavens, with the light of innumerable stars above me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">306	AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and the dim cloudy arch of the Milky Way. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">the artist had produced his effect was more than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could say, but somehow, in his limited space, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">given the impression of vastness and distance, of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery and infinite silence of the starlight; and as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood there entranced, I could almost imagine that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was back again on earth, gazing out into the night-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ekies as I had gazed so often from the Vermont hills</seg><seg type="columnLine">iwith Alma Huntley. . . . And yet, perfectly patterned</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they were, these skies were not the skies I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known. As I stood there watching, I became aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">that certain of the constellations were slightly, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">indistinguishably out of position, the stars not quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their proper relations to one another--and why</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was, I could not attempt to say. But more strik-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was another alteration that had been wrought de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberately and with subtle artistry: above the stars, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the thin girdle of the Milky Way, were filmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">formations of light, which--perhaps it was only my</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination--gradually resolved themselves into tenu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous human figures. One, an exquisitely graceful</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, seemed to be playing upon some lyre-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument; another, a youth with head uplifted as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though in enraptured contemplation, impressed me as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spirit of all human aspiration; and still others, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">less consummately outlined, appeared to represent the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes and loves and immortal yearnings of man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But while I remained rooted there in ecstatic con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">templation, filled with wonder at the paradox of be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding the stars thousands of feet beneath the sea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there occurred one of those changes by which occa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sionally a beautiful dream becomes distorted into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightmare. Imagine the consternation of one who,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while gazing at the cloudless night-skies, finds black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness suddenly sweeping all about him--a blackness that</seg><seg type="columnLine">has quenched the stars as a storm might quench a</seg><seg type="columnLine">candle flame. Such consternation was ours, and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">greater horror, for without so much as a flicker of</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning, the lights of the seeming heavens flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, and darkness stretched above us and all about</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, a darkness so all-consuming that not even a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow remained. With half-suppressed cries of ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ror, Rawson and I turned to one another, each totally</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible in the blank night; and before we had had</seg><seg type="columnLine">time for coherent speech, there came a rattling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slamming from behind us, and we knew that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one possible exit had been closed and that we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoners in this unknown place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trapped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a moment we were like rats newly trapped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All trace of reason left us in our sudden furious</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror; we began to scurry blindly to and fro, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fro in the darkness, panic-stricken in our frenzy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escape. Where we were dashing we did not know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor whether we might not be rushing into greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">peril still; we collided more than once with the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen walls, stumbled over invisible objects on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, and went fumbling about in long loops and</seg><seg type="columnLine">circles--but all to no avail. The marvel is not that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we accomplished nothing, but that we did not break</seg><seg type="columnLine">our necks, for so utterly fear-maddened were we that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was minutes before we had any thought of ceasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">our mad perambulations and considering our predica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment calmly and rationally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If I can judge aright from my confused memories</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those terrible moments, it was the sound of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy body falling that shocked me back to my senses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The fall, which was thudding and resonant, was ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">companied by a suppressed oath, which seemed to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">issue from far to my rear, but which none the less</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded familiar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rawson!" I cried, stopping short, and forgetting</seg><seg type="columnLine">caution in my alarm. "Are you hurt?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I'm not hurt," came the drawled reply, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though from a tremendous distance. And then, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a groan, "No, I'm all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are you?" I yelled back. "How can I get</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rawson shouted directions, and I went groping to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward him. The process was by no means easy, for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was guided wholly by the senses of touch and hearing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more than once I came into painful contact with</seg><seg type="columnLine">some unforeseen obstacle. But after some minutes I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found myself grasping a solid, yielding mass which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized as the arm of my friend.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rawson was as glad as I of our reunion. Somehow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now that we were together again, we both felt much</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger and the unknown foe seemed less redoubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. Yet that foe seemed terrible enough as we sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">there on the floor conversing in whispers. Although</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had regained some slight composure, the falling</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a pin might have sent us off into convulsions; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">our imaginations were busy painting grotesque and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadowy horrors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What can it mean?" murmured Rawson, as he sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his hand upon my knee, as though to reassure</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself by the mere physical fact of my presence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What do you think it can mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I declined to venture any direct reply, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestions sufficiently dreadful were piling up in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Remember how Stranahan and the others were</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost," continued Rawson, solemnly, as if the explana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of their disappearance were now self-evident.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't see what that has to do with us," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">argued. And then, with a forced attempt at bravado,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't worry, Rawson. Chances are everything will</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn out all right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope so," conceded Rawson, in a tone indicating</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he rather wished things would turn out badly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, by way of fanning my courage, he entertained</seg><seg type="columnLine">me with the most ghastly stories he could imagine--</seg><seg type="columnLine">stories of men trapped in coal mines, men lost in</seg><seg type="columnLine">labyrinthine caves, men entombed in deep pits or im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mured in lightless dungeons. To all these tales I</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened with growing uneasiness, meanwhile racking</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind to remember a parallel to our own predica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. But I could think of nothing that even remotely</seg><seg type="columnLine">resembled it; and, having nothing to say, I answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rawson only in monosyllables.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps owing to the terseness of my replies--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps because of the terror of our plight--his loqua-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious mood soon deserted him. It was not long before</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had lapsed into silence; and it was minutes before</seg><seg type="columnLine">either of us spoke again. Meantime the darkness was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so intense, the silence so complete and the stillness so</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolute that I was persecuted with all manner of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fantastic fears. What unknown horrors were brew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in these serene depths? What grotesque or malevo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent or even murderous things? In my anxiety, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">peopled the gloom with monstrous shapes of a thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand varieties, with slimy, crawling serpents, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">lithe, crouching panthers, with great apes, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">brawny arms could strangle a man, and--worst of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">--with slinking, barbarous humans that crept up slyly</seg><seg type="columnLine">to seize and tab one in the dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By degrees my imaginings were becoming so grew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some that I could no longer endure them. And, mere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly to find relief from myself, I whispered, "Come,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rawson, it's senseless to sit here doing nothing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe we can find some exit, if only we look care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">307</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fully enough. What do you say? Shall we try anyhow?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I say it's a good idea," assented Rawson, rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautiously to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without a word I followed his example, and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next half hour we groped laboriously along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls, which we found to be of an ice-cold stone, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth as polished marble, absolutely perpendicular</seg><seg type="columnLine">and apparently without a flaw or break. Our move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments were slow and even agonizing, for the black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness was still unbroken, and in that hushed, mysteri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous place, the slightest sound would send sharp tremors</seg><seg type="columnLine">running down our spines. Even the grating of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own shoes against the floor seemed to take on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinister, uncanny meaning; the whispered tones of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own voices seemed unhallowed and ghostly; while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional rapping of our fists against the walls or</seg><seg type="columnLine">our clattering contact with some unseen obstacle sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the echoes ringing and reverberating with unearthly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollow notes until our overwrought nerves quivered</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the rustling of our clothing or at the sound of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our own breath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Possibly two or three times we encircled that great</seg><seg type="columnLine">hall--in the darkness it was impossible to tell where</seg><seg type="columnLine">our starting place had been--but we could find no</seg><seg type="columnLine">indication of any passageway or door. And at length,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhausted by the strain, we crouched on the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the wall and waited miserably for something to</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen. Almost anything that could have happened--</seg><seg type="columnLine">no matter how grim and terrible--would have been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief; but the quiet was undisturbed, while we sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense and alert, with fast-throbbing hearts, and eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">that searched and searched the gloom in vain. Neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us spoke now; and the garrulous Rawson seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrapped up in his own dismal thoughts. How long a</seg><seg type="columnLine">period passed thus I cannot say; my watch may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">recorded whole hours, but certainly my thoughts re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">corded whole years, for I have lived years that knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">less of suspense, uneasiness and dread.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at last, after endless waiting, relief came with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">disconcerting suddenness. As though by the turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an electric switch, a dazzlingly brilliant light flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">into view above us--a light that contrasted strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the stars of some hours before, and that shone</seg><seg type="columnLine">blindingly in a pale blue field like the sun in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloudless heavens. Then, while we stood shading our</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes from the glaring illumination, we observed just</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite us, the gate through which we had doubtless</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered. And with surprise we noted that it moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly upon its hinges; that slowly and as if by</seg><seg type="columnLine">magic it made clear the way of escape!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The place is enchanted!" muttered Rawson, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazed fascination. "Come, let's get out of here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when, overjoyed at our rescue, we started to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the gate, an unexpected obstacle intruded. Half</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen of the queerest beings we had ever seen came</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowding into our path--tall, butterfly-like creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">with faces almost waxen pale and long capes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">robes of pink and blue and lavender and yellow pastel</seg><seg type="columnLine">tints. All had long, flowing light red or golden hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">which reached at least to the shoulders; one, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">the oldest, wore an ample beard, but the majority</seg><seg type="columnLine">were smooth shaven; none had headgear of any type,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all were shod with sandals covered with green</seg><seg type="columnLine">moss, above which for several inches the unclothed</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs were visible. From the blank, amazed stares with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they greeted us, it was evident that our appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance was as much a surprise to them as theirs was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. But from a certain sternness and resolution which</seg><seg type="columnLine">invested their faces following the first speechless</seg><seg type="columnLine">astonishment, we concluded that they had probably seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">others of our kind, and were not disposed to treat</seg><seg type="columnLine">us leniently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We noted also that, though quivering with dread,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they kept the exit firmly blocked. And in the long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">staring silence that ensued, we felt in dismay that</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last we had met the masters of this strange land;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with sinking hearts we realized that our chances</seg><seg type="columnLine">of escape had vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wc all looked up. The ceiling was bulging inches downward, as though the terrific pressure of the waters were already bursting the tougb'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                                     steel envelope of the X-lll.</seg><seg type="columnLine">308</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIII</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sapphire and Amber</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT may have been no more than thirty seconds be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the silence was broken, though it felt like</seg><seg type="columnLine">many, many minutes. But at length one of the new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comers, turning to his companions, the while keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">his eyes still fastened upon us, began to speak in low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhythmic tones that were singularly musical and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasant. I could catch not one syllable of what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, though I strained my ears in the attempt; nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">could I understand any syllable of what his fellows</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke in reply, though their voices too were so soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sweet-sounding that they might have been in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toning poetry. Yet, in spite of the gentleness of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices, I could detect a certain excitement in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner; and, from their casual nods and gestures in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our direction, I was only too certain of the theme of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their discussion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After several minutes of whispered conversation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the strangers stepped toward us and raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice as if addressing us. As might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">foretold, I understood nothing of what he said; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as this was no doubt what he expected, he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">look surprised, but after a moment ceased speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">and motioned us to follow him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since there was manifestly nothing else to do, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">obeyed readily enough, and were glad indeed to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">ourselves stepping once more through the doorway and</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into the street, even though the half dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangers had grouped themselves on all sides of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a sort of bodyguard. We knew, in fact, that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were virtually prisoners, and yet were no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarmed, for no imprisonment could be worse than</seg><seg type="columnLine">that which we had already suffered. Also we had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">intuitive sense that we should not be badly treated;</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether out of consideration for our feelings or mere-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly because they were afraid of us, our attendants did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not attempt to lay hands on us or to coerce us in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Yet when they indicated by gestures the direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in which they desired us to walk, we had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of objecting, but obeyed as docilely as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were our acknowledged masters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a distance of possibly two or three miles they</seg><seg type="columnLine">led us with them through the city streets; and far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from brooding over our predicament (which was mani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">festly serious), we amused ourselves with observing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sights of the town. Dozens of the inhabitants</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come out to peer at us as we strode past; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though they kept at a cautious distance, we could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">them clearly enough: their slender, graceful forms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blond features, their amiable blue eyes and rippling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unbound hair, their loose-hanging, light-tinted robes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">variously colored from buff and lilac to azure and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale rose, gave them the appearance less of human</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings than of walking butterflies or flowers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even more interesting to us than these humans</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the architecture of the town. We were fasci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated, first of all, by the very pavement beneath us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was of baked clay worked into a multihued and</seg><seg type="columnLine">picturesque mosaic; we were still more fascinated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buildings, which on close observation proved to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">even more artistically designed than we had imagined,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for exquisite little statues abounded in niches between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the columns or under the domes and spires, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">superb frescoes decorated the ceilings of the number-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less colonnades and the outside walls of temples, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">curving walks wound gracefully between terraces</seg><seg type="columnLine">adorned with a lovely waxen flower or around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brink of the shimmering rainbowed fountains. I par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticularly noted the width of the avenues, in whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">spacious reaches and wide adjoining courts the bright-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">robed children laughed and played; and I was sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised to observe that the buildings, instead of being</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammed together in the modern box-like fashion, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">each separated from their neighbors by broad paved</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways or wide patches of vegetation, so that the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave an uncrowded and leisurely and yet skilfully pat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terned effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But magnificent as were the edifices in their garb</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sandstone or granite or many-hued marble, the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">extraordinary by far was that to which our guides</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultimately led us. It was not the size of the structure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that distinguished it, since the city boasted far larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings, and size in itself did not seem to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been an object with the builders; but the quality of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the masonry and the style of the workmanship had</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely no parallel in human experience. For the walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the interior circles of columns were not of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">material ever employed before, not of steel or of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone, of brick or of clay, or gold or of ebony; they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were of a translucent yellow hue, the hue of amber,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seemed to be composed, if not actually of amber,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least of glass tinted amber color. This, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was scarcely the most remarkable fact, for the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was likewise translucent, and shone with an entrancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue, the blue of sapphire; and sapphire seemed also</seg><seg type="columnLine">the substance of the fretted and vaulted ceiling, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which hung images of great birds with wide-spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">wings, giving a startling illusion of flight. Three suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessive circles of columns, each more massive than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last and all adorned at the base with bas-reliefs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange fishes and stranger sea plants, supported the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great arching expanse of the roof; and completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosed by the columns, on a steep and curving in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cline of the sapphire floor, were row after row of</seg><seg type="columnLine">amber seats grouped in a half circle about a flat open</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, and forming--so it seemed to me--a Grecian</seg><seg type="columnLine">theatre of unique design.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS Rawson and I accompanied our guides into this</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer building, we were so captivated by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">architecture and so enthralled by the silence and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird half-light of sapphire and amber that we did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not at first observe that other human beings had pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceded us into the place. It was long, indeed, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could recover from the awed sense of entering some</seg><seg type="columnLine">cathedral where all is reverential and unworldly; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was long before, turning our eyes upon the theatre</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its rows and rows of seats, we observed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">not all the chairs were vacant as we had at first</seg><seg type="columnLine">assumed. In the front tiers sat perhaps a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">light-gowned individuals whose sedate and earnest</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces proclaimed that they were convened for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemn purpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our arrival was greeted by a sudden murmuring of</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, musical voices, but by nothing more demonstra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive; and our presence was doubtless explained by our</seg><seg type="columnLine">attendants, who spoke a few words to the assembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">group, after which they took seats to one side and</seg><seg type="columnLine">motioned us to do likewise. We obeyed readily</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, but as I crossed the room to take my desig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated place, I received a sudden shock, an electrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock of pleasure, such as one experiences upon meet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a friend unexpectedly in a strange city. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foremost row, staring up at me with a most curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kindly air, sat that enchanting woman whom I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen dancing along the colonnades! As a sober</seg><seg type="columnLine">and practical man, and one already in love with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gracious Alma Huntley, I should no doubt have re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garded her with a wholly aloof and impersonal air;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I was sadly impressionable, alas! and was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">transfixed with joy at sight of those shining Madonna</seg><seg type="columnLine">features and clear magnetic, great blue eyes. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">309</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant, indeed, I actually stopped short in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracks, until, regaining my presence of mind, I hast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened toward my seat shamefaced at having so be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trayed myself. It was several minutes before I ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured again to glance toward the fair one, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was looking in an opposite direction; and, stare</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her as I might, she seemed totally oblivious of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am afraid that, in the ensuing hour, my thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were more on her than on proceedings in the theatre.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was aware, indeed, that some sort of debate was</seg><seg type="columnLine">in progress, a discussion in which most of the spec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tators took part and during which Rawson and I were</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than once pointed out with significant gestures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, since I could understand not one word of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was spoken, I let my imagination travel to the beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful unknown, and tried to fancy how it would feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be befriended by so fairy-like a creature. Even to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak a word with her, I thought, would be a delight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to hold a conversation with her would be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rarest of good fortune. Of course, her face might</seg><seg type="columnLine">belie her character, and she might be unintelligent</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she was beautiful; yet I was convinced that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rare soul shone out of the calm seductive depths</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her eyes, and was more than willing to believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she combined the wisdom of a Socrates with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">charms of an Aphrodite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So pleasantly was I occupied in contemplating this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinating being and her scarcely less fascinating fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows, that it seemed but a moment before the debate</seg><seg type="columnLine">was over and the assembled men and women rose from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their seats and began to depart. With a start I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang to my feet, suddenly realizing that the assem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blage had perhaps reached some critical decision re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garding me. And when four or five of the men ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached Rawson and myself and motioned us away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had the feeling of a captive being led back into im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisonment. The loveliest of all women had now been</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost to view amid the crowd, and I was sadder at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">disappearance than at thought of my personal suffer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings; but as I walked slowly out of that sapphire and</seg><seg type="columnLine">amber palace, gentle strains of music began to play</seg><seg type="columnLine">on unseen instruments, rippling delightedly as waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a calm sea; and gradually and insensibly I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">comforted, and somehow I was convinced that I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">see that glorious womanly apparition again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONCE more we were escorted through the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets, but this time had* only a few hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">yards to walk. After a minute or two we were led up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steps of a many-columned marble mansion, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a long hall whose stained glass windows cast a</seg><seg type="columnLine">subdued illumination upon a score of vivid paintings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were wondering what to do, when our guides mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned us to cushioned seats that seemed made of</seg><seg type="columnLine">woven seaweed; and after we had settled ourselves at</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease in the great sofa-like chairs, two of the men dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared momentarily and returned with a feast of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some singular substance reminding me of mushrooms</seg><seg type="columnLine">flavored with a sprinkling of honey. At first we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspicious and reluctant to eat; but the honest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">frankly puzzled faces of our hosts convinced us of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our folly; and we found the dish, while strange to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our palates, not only appetizing but invigorating after</seg><seg type="columnLine">our long fast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After we had eaten and the remains of the meal had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been borne away, we were treated to a still greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise. A man came stalking in laden with five or</seg><seg type="columnLine">six variously colored cloths, which I recognized as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">native costumes; and, having spread these out before</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, he motioned us to discard our own clothing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">take our choice of the local apparel. Our attendants</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">then politely withdrew, leaving us more perplexed</seg><seg type="columnLine">than ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was long before we could make up our minds</seg><seg type="columnLine">to array ourselves in the native garb. And while we</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood hesitating, casting occasional disdainful glances</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the colored garments before making the decision</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we knew we ultimately must make, our atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was distracted by the paintings that adorned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls. Alhough all were executed with the deft and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flawless hand of a master, they were in a sense dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent from any paintings I had ever seen before;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and what struck me in particular was not so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">their peculiar style of art, which combined a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">realism with an almost cosmic suggestiveness, as their</seg><seg type="columnLine">arresting and unparalleled subject-matter. Half of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them were of a marine type, and depicted ocean caves</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the giant squid or octopus wavered through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray depths, or gardens of the ocean floor where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">many-branching coral was the playground for shim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mering blue and yellow fishes; the other half, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most remarkable by far, portrayed scenes of ruin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction on a scale that might have staggered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most daring imagination. One of them, for example,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictured a city with slender skyscrapers not unlike</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of modern New York, but all the skyscrapers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were crumpled and toppling as though from some</seg><seg type="columnLine">titanic blast; another, which likewise represented a</seg><seg type="columnLine">many-spired city, showed the ocean rolling up in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossal wave and battering and washing away the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings as a rain storm may wash away a child's</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand castles; while a third, and by all odds the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghastly of the group, depicted a sea bottom strewn</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the wreckage of great stone edifices, in whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacant towers and windows and among whose shat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered courts the sword-fish and the eel sported and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slunk and the fanged shark pursued its prey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Strange!" I remarked to Rawson. "What peculiarly</seg><seg type="columnLine">morbid people is this that its artists should delight</seg><seg type="columnLine">in scenes of flood and ruin? Or is it that its painters</seg><seg type="columnLine">are striving to represent some actual disaster, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">overwhelming ancient catastrophe unheard of on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hoping to find an answer to these questions, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained my eyes over the inscriptions that marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">each picture--inscriptions in the near-Greek charac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters I had already tried to decipher. As before, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had at first no success in translation; but, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing else to do, I persevered; and once again I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended by construing two or three words--words that</seg><seg type="columnLine">left me only more deeply mystified. "After the Sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mergence," was the legend that explained the picture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ruined town at the sea bottom; and, noting</seg><seg type="columnLine">how closely this phrase resembled those I had pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viously interpreted, I was forced to conclude that "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Submergence" was indeed some definite historical event.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But when it had occurred or how was still a question</seg><seg type="columnLine">as unanswerable as though it had concerned the planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is possible that we will never be able to solve</seg><seg type="columnLine">the problem."

Like us, he and Ripley had reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city following an ambling excursion among the out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying colonnades and temples; but unlike us, they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">not been so unfortunate as to be trapped in one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buildings. In fact, they had suffered a different</seg><seg type="columnLine">misfortune entirely. Upon entering the city, they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been confronted by several of the natives; and, sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mising that these strange beings were hostilely dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed, the terrified Stranahan had whipped out his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver and fired toward the crowd. So far as was</seg><seg type="columnLine">known, no one had been injured, but all had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">badly frightened by the report; and for a while, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">two seamen had had the freedom of the town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were ultimately stopped, however, by a band</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of determined-looking natives. Though apparently un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed, and though they used no violence, these men</seg><seg type="columnLine">overpowered the intruders in some inexplicable way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not only were Stranahan and Ripley deprived of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">pistols, but they were rendered docile as children, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">were conducted, as we had been, to the place of amber</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sapphire, where a hundred pale-robed individuals</seg><seg type="columnLine">debated and passed on their fate. Next they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought to their present dwelling, where they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothed and fed, and where they were reunited with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stangale and Howlett, who had preceded them to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. They had now been living here for several days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and during that time had been treated with unexpected</seg><seg type="columnLine">civility and kindness and even allowed to roam at</seg><seg type="columnLine">will through the city; but whenever they had ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached the boundaries of the town, they had en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">countered a band of citizens who, by shouts and ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures and a mysterious but irresistible power of sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestion, had given them to understand that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to leave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stranahan was approaching the end of his recital,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was telling us how he had been compelled to wear</seg><seg type="columnLine">the native costume and how his meals had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought to him regularly twice each day, when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was interrupted by the entrance of several natives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been looking for us in the adjoining room</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seemed a little annoyed at our disappearance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unceremoniously they led us back to the other apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, where the half dozen robes were lying in wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us; and, perceiving from their gestures that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do well to don the native garb, I promptly ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rayed myself in a gown of pale lavender, while Raw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son exchanged his sailor's suit for a costume of</seg><seg type="columnLine">daintiest yellow. Both of us had difficulty in adjust-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the garments, which were fastened at the shoulder</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a fish-bone device resembling a safety-pin; and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had our hesitation about the sandals, which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped on at a stroke and yet were held firmly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">place by inconspicuous cords. But though we puzzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">over our new apparel for many minutes, Rawson</seg><seg type="columnLine">found in the end that he had his on inside out, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front of mine was where the rear should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been. Of course, we did not discover these mistakes</seg><seg type="columnLine">for ourselves. Our attendants, on returning to see us</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully attired, indicated the errors with smiles and</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppressed laughter; and with their aid, we managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to array ourselves almost like self-respecting natives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FORTUNATELY, we had little time just then to</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice how ridiculous we looked in our colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">gowns. As soon as the perplexing business of dress-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was settled, one of the men motioned me to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sofa in a corner of the room, where he took a seat</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside me as though for some important purpose; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second similarly led Rawson to an opposite corner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the other natives unceremoniously took their</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave. My particular attendant, who was a tall man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither young nor old, with classic features and keen</seg><seg type="columnLine">but kindly gray eyes peering from beneath a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">expanse of forehead, now began to go through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">series of apparently meaningless gestures, accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panied by no less meaningless words. First he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would tap his head while emitting a peculiar sound;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then he would tap his breast while emitting another</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar sound; then he would touch his arm, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knee, his foot, always slowly ariii carefully pronounc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one or two unintelligible syllables. In the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning, I was inclined to wonder whether he was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad, but this view was not furthered by the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery that Rawson's attendant was conducting a sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilar performance. It was doubtless only my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupidity that prevented me from grasping the truth</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">311</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">(Immediately. At length my companion drew a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">pad of paper from his pocket and began to write upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with an instrument resembling a fountain pen, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I understood clearly enough then that he was trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to teach me his language; so I gave him my undi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided attention, noting carefully each object he</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched and the corresponding sounds, and noted par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticularly the characters he jotted down upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly I saw light amid the darkness! Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though this was but my first lesson, I was making</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster progress than either of us could have anticipated</seg><seg type="columnLine">--my knowledge of ancient Greek was proving invalu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able! At the first glance, I observed the resemblance</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the letters my instructor was inditing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of the old Greek, even as I had noticed the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">semblance on the stone inscriptions; and it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">many minutes before I discovered that some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, although not to be recognized when pronounced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were written in a style closely similar to the Greek,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were obviously built upon Greek roots. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not true of all the words, but it was true of such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large percentage, that I had hopes of soon being</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to speak the language and so to solve the mystery</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this fantastic deep-sea people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After about two hours, my instructor rose from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat, shoved the pad of paper back into his pocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and indicated that our lessons were over for the day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he smiled upon me graciously, as though to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicate that I was a not unpromising pupil; and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke a word which I thought I recognized as "To-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow," after which he saluted me with a courteous</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave of the hand, and joining Rawson's instructor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">went ambling leisurely out of view.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was with a wry smile that Rawson rejoined me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Say, did you get anything out of it at all?" he in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired. "I just couldn't make head or tail of it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heavens, at this rate it would take me ten years to</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn my A, B, C's!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not confide that I had private reasons for</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling more optimistic than my friend. But, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had offered to help and was rejected, I was content</seg><seg type="columnLine">to let the conversation drift to other subjects.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rawson was now annoyingly given to useless lamen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tations. Hotly he deplored our plight; he declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he no longer saw anything romantic about it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and least of all perceived anything romantic about</seg><seg type="columnLine">being made to go to school again; and he reminded</seg><seg type="columnLine">me time after time of Captain Gavison and the crew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom we had last seen stranded in the wilderness</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the disabled X-lll, and who were no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaiting our return in hope that was fast giving way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to despair. Though I did not share in Rawson's dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like of our present quarters, and though I was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terred from leaving, not only by hopes of learning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">language but by thoughts of the nameless fair one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet I had to listen when Rawson spoke of our duty to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our waiting comrades; and, in spite of the forbidding</seg><seg type="columnLine">precedent set by Stranahan and Ripley, I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">but consent to try to return to our shipmates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the doors of our dwelling were wide open and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no one to interfere with us, we sauntered</seg><seg type="columnLine">forthwith into the streets. As usual, we found them</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost deserted, and so had no hesitation in proceed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing along the winding walks and broad avenues and</seg><seg type="columnLine">past the innumerable terraces, courts and temples in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction from which we had entered the city. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">the various distinctive gardens and palaces constituted</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmistakable landmarks, we were seldom at a loss as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our route, and in little more than half an hour we</seg><seg type="columnLine">found ourselves at the threshold of the town, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">that odd statue-like edifice where we had been impris-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">oned. The path of escape now seemed open, and our</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight appeared so easy that we paused momentarily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost with misgivings at having encountered no ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stacles. But not a person was in sight, and no sign</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any impediment was visible, and so in surprise we</seg><seg type="columnLine">started up that slope which led to the colonnades and</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlying temples.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had almost reached the top, and I was already</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep in regrets at leaving this charming city just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was becoming so interesting, when half a score of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale-gowned individuals suddenly appeared from above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ridge, their vociferous cries and commanding ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures warning us back. They carried no weapon, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">they could not have been more imperious had they</seg><seg type="columnLine">borne loaded rifles; there seemed almost to be some</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden compulsion, some irresistible magnetism about</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, so that our weak wills quailed and bowed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">theirs, and we retreated before them as impulsively as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a singed animal retreats before fire. T do not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">why it was, for they surely would not have set violent</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands upon us; but we no more thought of disobeying</seg><seg type="columnLine">them than a trained dog thinks of disobeying its mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter; and back to the city we hastened, while they fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed on our heels with faces stern and set; and, hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing re-entered the town, we made our way directly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the building we had just left, as though some superior</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind controlled our movements and we were no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">free.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon our return, we met with another surprise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Naturally, we were prompted to seek Stranahan and</seg><seg type="columnLine">our three other shipmates again; but we had expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they would be occupied, as before, by cards or</seg><seg type="columnLine">some other time-killing game. Instead, we found them</seg><seg type="columnLine">seated in the four corners of the room, each with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a companion (needless to say, a native); and from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar gestures of those companions and their habit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of writing occasionally on pads of paper, we recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were giving instructions in the language</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the land. But this in itself was not the surprising</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact. Two of the four newcomers were ladies, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them being of matronly years; but the other, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat opposite Stranahan, smilingly making notes with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her pen, was not only in the full bloom of youth, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">had that singularly sweet cast of countenance, those</seg><seg type="columnLine">singularly clear and magnetic large blue eyes, Which</seg><seg type="columnLine">could belong to only one woman in the world!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">             CHAPTER X</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">             Discoveries</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GREAT as was my joy upon observing that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrancing mysterious lady was Stranahan's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tutor, it was to be some time before her daily</seg><seg type="columnLine">proximity had any effect upon my life.

This</seg><seg type="columnLine">"home-work" (as Rawson designated it) would keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">us busy until late in the afternoon, when a native</seg><seg type="columnLine">would arrive with a tray containing various savory</seg><seg type="columnLine">viands: a gray bread made from a grain with a flavor</seg><seg type="columnLine">like walnuts; a succulent vegetable like French toast</seg><seg type="columnLine">well browned; a spiced, starchy food reminding me</seg><seg type="columnLine">Vaguely of baked potatoes; cakes of a hundred varie-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties, and fruits shaped like tomatoes and tasting like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">muscat grapes, or elongated like cucumbers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flavored as oranges, or round and large as cantaloupes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and substantial as bananas. But while we were of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course delighted at the abundance of these appetizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfamiliar foods, we were not a little surprised--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a little disappointed--at the absence of much that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would once have considered essential; and we con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly wondered why it was that no meat nor fish</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor any other animal product found its place on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bill of fare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After this meal (the second and last for the day)</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were once more free to do as we wished; and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would ordinarily spend the time until dark in strolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the city, or in sitting about in a little circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">exchanging anecdotes, or in propounding theories as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we were and how we had arrived, or in playing</seg><seg type="columnLine">cards or any other little game that we could devise.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Except for our tutors, we came into contact with</seg><seg type="columnLine">none of the natives; we were too ignorant of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">language to speak with the occasional few whom we</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed on the streets; and as yet we knew virtually</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing of how they lived.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But we were much less concerned about the natives</seg><seg type="columnLine">than about our comrades of the X-lll.

For all that we could say, they might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have perished of starvation or fallen through a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole in the ground--or, more plausibly, they might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been discovered by the natives, and led as cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">313</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">          siinicEEBE nun</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">innumerable stone edifices shone palely and with sallow luster. Surely, we thought, this was some unheard-of Athens, doomed long ago by tidal</seg><seg type="columnLine">countless statues, tall as the buildings, pointed up at us with hands that were uncannily life-like; wide avenue after wide avenue flashed by,</seg><seg type="columnLine">theatres of Grecian design ...</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tives to lodgings miles away. Should we see them</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon, or at least have news of them? or should we</seg><seg type="columnLine">never learn what had befallen them? There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to decide except to wait--and the process of wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was distressingly slow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT I was secretly determined to do everything pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible to hasten events. Obviously, the first neces-i</seg><seg type="columnLine">sity was to understand the native language--hence I</seg><seg type="columnLine">put forth every effort to learn to read and write. Less</seg><seg type="columnLine">because of my natural linguistic tendencies than be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of my acquaintance with ancient Greek, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">making more rapid progress than any of my fellows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was acquiring the rudiments of a speaking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading knowledge. Not only did my own ears tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">me so, but my instructor admitted as much by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional nods of approval, and now and then even</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a "Very Good" or "Excellent" when I was speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing or reciting to him. But not content with my</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal rate of advance, I was fortifying myself with</seg><seg type="columnLine">much secret practice. Often I would refrain from</seg><seg type="columnLine">joining my comrades in their morning and evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">strolls and pastimes, and would remain quietly in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">room with a pad of paper and a pencil supplied me</seg><seg type="columnLine">by my tutor. I would devote hours to writing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">native alphabet, until I could employ it with facility</seg><seg type="columnLine">and assurance; or I would jot down a list of words</seg><seg type="columnLine">and phrases and repeat them aloud time after time, try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to imitate the peculiar accentuation of my in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structor. The latter task in particular was difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even painful, and subjected me more than once</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ridicule, when Stranahan or the others entered the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">room unexpectedly and found me apparently talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">to myself. But I persisted in spite of discouragements,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had hopes that, instead of commanding but a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered words and phrases, I would shortly be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to conduct an extended conversation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was only natural, however, that I should be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ,read the language before I could speak it. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than two or three weeks had passed before I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt capable of deciphering any average native docu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. But, unfortunately, I had little opportunity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">practice my talents, for the only written material I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw was in the shape of the simple exercise books</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent me by my instructor. These, while admirably</seg><seg type="columnLine">adapted for clarifying grammatical problems, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely devoid of vital information; and when I asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">my instructor for more edifying works, I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem able to make him understand, for what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought me was merely a more advanced exercise</seg><seg type="columnLine">book.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Consequently, I had every reason to be grateful for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that chance which put me in possession of several</seg><seg type="columnLine">volumes designed for adult readers. For lack of bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter occupation, Rawson and I were minutely inspecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">our apartments one afternoon, scrutinizing in partic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ular the picturesque patterns of the veined marble</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls, when suddenly I stopped short with a cry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise, startled at sight of a little rectangle faintly</seg><seg type="columnLine">although unmistakably engraved in otherwise unbroken</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the marble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Promptly I informed Rawson of my discovery. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">shared in my surprise, and excitedly suggested that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was some mysterious trap-door.</seg><seg type="columnLine">314</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although I saw no reason to agree with him, I ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached the rectangular patch to examine it more</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely, and in so doing rested my hand appraisingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the marble surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To my utter amazement, a portion of the wall gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, swinging inward as if on noiseless hinges!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But if Rawson had had visions of secret corridors</seg><seg type="columnLine">ar.d darkened chambers, he was to be disappointed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The displaced rectangle revealed not a mysterious pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sageway, but a little closet or vault possibly three</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet deep--a vault filled to the brim with treasure!</seg><seg type="columnLine">At least, it was filled with what I regarded as treasure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for within it were piled scores of books!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hastily I reached for the nearest volume--a heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">tome bound in what I took to be a sort of artificial</seg><seg type="columnLine">leather. The title filled me with rejoicing: it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Lexicon of the More Commonly Used Words."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aided by the bewildered Rawson, I at once examined</seg><seg type="columnLine">the entire collection. Although he could decipher not</seg><seg type="columnLine">a word, Rawson feigned the profoundest interest; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, he may well have been interested, for, as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">read and translated the titles, I was making discovery</seg><seg type="columnLine">after extraordinary discovery. Not that any of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">books were those works of sheer information which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">most desired, but that they all embodied significant</seg><seg type="columnLine">hints and clues. Some, like the inscriptions I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed among the colonnades, seemed to refer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">some great disaster, as in the case of one entitled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Artistic Progress Since the Destruction"; another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">;wliich was called "Speculations Concerning the Super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marine World," fortified my impression of being in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some inexplicably buried land; while several were</seg><seg type="columnLine">treatises on such difficult subjects as "Intra-Atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Engineering," "Marine Valves and Their Construc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion," and "The Creation of Artificial Sunlight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the book that caused me the greatest surprise--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a book that struck me as at once a priceless find and</seg><seg type="columnLine">an insoluble mystery--was the well-thumbed yellowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">little volume at the very bottom of the heap. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">today, when all that passed in those enigmatic realms is</seg><seg type="columnLine">an old and oft-repeated story, I have difficulty in re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressing my astonishment at that discovery. Imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bewilderment of one who, having voyaged to an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other world, suddenly receives news of familiar things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at the same time learns unsuspected facts about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the familiar! Imagine this, and you will have only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vague notion of the amazement I felt when, turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pages of the book in that unknown cavernland, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized the name of--Homer!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And not only did I recognize the name of Homer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I found it affixed to a work not previously cata-</seg><seg type="columnLine">logued among the productions of the great Attic bard!</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Telegonus" was the title--and instantly I recalled that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been a legend among post-Homeric writers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of one Telegonus, the son of Odysseus and Circe, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been sent by his enchantress mother in search of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his father, and had slain his sire without realizing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his identity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One may be sure that I wasted no time about plung-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into the book. One may be sure that I took no</seg><seg type="columnLine">heed of the surprised exclamations of Rawson, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">even paused for more than a word of explanation, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">read and read as fast as my knowledge of the lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guage would permit. Truly, the poem was Homeric</seg><seg type="columnLine">in quality!--I recognized at once the swing of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inimitable hexameter, handled with masterly crafts-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manship; and the opening passages, executed with epic</seg><seg type="columnLine">dash and sweep, simplicity and power, convinced me</seg><seg type="columnLine">that here was a work worthy of standing side by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bide with "The Iliad" and "The Odyssey."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But how came the poem to be here in this weird</seg><seg type="columnLine">undersea realm? How came these submerged people</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to possess an Homeric work unknown to the modern</seg><seg type="columnLine">world? These were the questions that perplexed me</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I excitedly followed stanza after noble stanza; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponder the problem as I might, debate it as I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">with myself or the eager Rawson, I could conceive of</seg><seg type="columnLine">no explanation, but was as mystified as if I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveled to Mars and found the people addressing me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in English or presenting me with copies of Shake-</seg><seg type="columnLine">speare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Questions and Answers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE chief effect of the discovery of the books</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to make me doubly anxious to speak the</seg><seg type="columnLine">native tongue. Not one of the score of volumes</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast any light on the problems that bewildered me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">least of all on the mystery of Homer's "Telegonus";</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was apparent that I should remain in ignor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance until I could converse with the natives. Accord-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly, I had need of that rarest of all qualities, a vir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tue in which I am almost wholly lacking--patience.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stifling my eagerness and curiosity as best I could, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to plod away for days and days in acquiring new</seg><seg type="columnLine">native words and phrases and in practicing speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the solitude of my own rooms. The task was far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from pleasant, and the suspense and the waiting were</seg><seg type="columnLine">harrying; but I was like a traveler following a trail</seg><seg type="columnLine">through an unfamiliar jungle; and, feverish as I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to escape, I had no choice except to persist on the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But had I not been so eager to batter down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery, I would have found abundant cause for en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">couragement. I was still progressing, progressing rapid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, attaining a speaking knowledge of the language with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a speed possible only for one long trained as a linguist.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, as the result of many a secret conversation, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I held with myself by way of practice, I advanced swift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly to the point of being able to exchange ideas with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives. At least, I felt that I had advanced to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">point, and awaited only opportunity to test my new-</seg><seg type="columnLine">won powers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The obvious course would have been to address my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self to my tutor, and several times I was on the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">of doing so, but on each occasion he seemed so ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorbed in the day's exercises, that I decided to post-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pone the experiment. In the end, however, I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt have opened my mind to him--had not chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervened and sent me a more charming informant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had of course not forgotten that entrancing Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">donna-like woman who was Stranahan's tutor. Indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not easily have forgotten her, for her exquisite</seg><seg type="columnLine">features and bright eyes kept flashing before me at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all hours of the day and night; and already I felt my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self as completely subject to her spell as Dante to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spell of a Beatrice. Under the witchery of her influ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence, Alma Huntley was becoming no more than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">figment of a remote and misty past--and yet I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not even acquainted with the fair unknown, I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never exchanged more than a formal greeting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. I scarcely knew how to sow the seeds even for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a casual friendship, and what she was like at heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">and how she would react to my advances, were mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters of pure conjecture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the time was to come when she would be more</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me than one to be admired at a distance. She was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fact, to serve in a double role: for not only was</seg><seg type="columnLine">she to fascinate me with her companionship, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to cast light upon those problems which were</seg><seg type="columnLine">tantalizing me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although I caught glimpses of her almost every</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning when she came an Stranahan's instructor, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">315</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I would have had little chance to speak with her even</seg><seg type="columnLine">had I chosen, since (as I have already related) she</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinarily arrived and left in the company of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other tutors. But one day--perhaps because she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">some particularly difficult bit of grammar to explain--</seg><seg type="columnLine">she lingered over her work much longer than usual,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was so absorbed in it that she did not appear to</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice that her fellow teachers had left. At the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment I did not perceive tljat this was my opportunity;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but good fortune was to be with me, and when she</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged from the marble doors of our home, I hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to be strolling along the colonnade not a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred yards away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first it was almost a shock to me to see her come</seg><seg type="columnLine">unaccompanied toward me--a shock in which intense</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure was mingled with something akin to dread.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For a moment I had an impulse to hide behind one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great stone columns; fortunately, I thrust this</seg><seg type="columnLine">foolish desire from me, and, after a few seconds, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost regained my composure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As she approached, I could scarcely take my gaze</seg><seg type="columnLine">from her. Upon her face was a serene, placid ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression, such as she almost always wore; but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow of a smile flickered about her lips, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">great blue eyes were withdrawn as if they saw not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world wherein she walked but only some calm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect inner vision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly I advanced, and diffidently placed myself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her path. At first she did not seem to see me, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an instant, almost as though she had been expect-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing some one, her gaze was lifted to meet mine; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">no surprise was marked there, nor any trace of annoy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance, only an unlooked-for pleasure. In low, musical</seg><seg type="columnLine">tones, and with grace that to me seemed goddess-like,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she murmured "Good morning," while suÂ£?\ a lovely</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unmatched light shone in her eyes and such trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">figuring inner radiance illumined her features, that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that I had encountered an immortal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good morning," I replied, in the native dialect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and at the cost of greater effort than I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">cared to admit; and I shuddered inwardly lest I give</seg><seg type="columnLine">her cause for laughter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She smiled charmingly, and was about to pass on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when in desperation I strove to detain her. "I beg</seg><seg type="columnLine">your pardon," said I, stiffly, speaking almost by rote</seg><seg type="columnLine">in phrases I had memorized days before. "I beg your</seg><seg type="columnLine">pardon, but have you a minute to spare? There are</seg><seg type="columnLine">one or two questions I should like very much to ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR an instant she stared at me in transparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise. But a smile played lightly about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">corners of her mouth, and apparently she was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">offended. "Why, of course, you may ask any ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion you want," she replied, more puzzled than annoyed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, pointing down the colonnade to a circular marble</seg><seg type="columnLine">bench enclosed by a ring of slender columns, she con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued, "Let us go over there. Then we can talk, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you wish."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In silence we traversed the intervening two or</seg><seg type="columnLine">three hundred yards. My heart was so full that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not have spoken had I desired; I could scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">credit my double good fortune in having won this</seg><seg type="columnLine">lady's good will and in speaking well enough to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">understood by her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And when at length I found myself seated at her</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, her vivid blue eyes looking inquiringly and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindly into my own, I felt as one who enters the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land of dreams come true. It was with difficulty that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I answered when, in low, sweet tones, she asked me</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it was that I desired to know; and when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first words came to me, they were forced out only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">by an effort of the will, for I should much have</seg><seg type="columnLine">preferred to sit there in silence, staring and staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her animated lovely face, her sharp-cut classic</seg><seg type="columnLine">profile and symmetrically modelled features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, unfortunately, the laws of human intercourse</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded that I do more than gaze at her in speech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less rapture. And I answered her question, there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, with one or two commonplace remarks which ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed nothing of the exaltation within me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">which could have conveyed no high opinion of my,</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligence. "I am a stranger in this land," said I,</seg><seg type="columnLine">picking my words with a translator's care, "and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">find many things here which perplex me. I was won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering whether you would not be good enough to help</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Am I imposing too much upon your kindness?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, no, of course not," she murmured; and as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke I noted that her upper lip trembled slightly, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though from extreme sensitiveness and sympathy. "Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you not know that it would be a pleasure to be of aid?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was enchanted by this reply, for there could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubting the utter candor and sincerity in her earn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est blue eyes, which were glowing with a softness</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal to the magnetism they sometimes displayed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Encouraged to the point of boldness, I decided upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a daring step. "Before I ask any other question," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventured, "might it not be well for us to know each'</seg><seg type="columnLine">other's names?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, of course," she agreed. "My name is Aelios."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Aelios!" I repeated, charmed by the sound. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">a delightful name! And what is your other name,</seg><seg type="columnLine">may I ask?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My other name?" she echoed, astonished. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">other name do you mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw that somehow I had made a mistake. "Why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't you another name?" I inquired, with distinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">loss of confidence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Another name?" She tittered delightedly, as thougK</seg><seg type="columnLine">enjoying a rare joke. "Well, if that isn't the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlandish idea! What do you think I'd do with an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other name?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, that--that's not for me to say," I stammered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Only, where I come from, every one has at least two</seg><seg type="columnLine">or three names."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, how perfectly ridiculous!" she exclaimed. "Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if we haven't enough to remember one name</seg><seg type="columnLine">apiece!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She paused momentarily, and I was too much em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrassed to resume the conversation. Fortunately,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she continued without my aid. "How many names</seg><seg type="columnLine">have you?j^ she inquired; and the playful light in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes told me that she could not have been more</seg><seg type="columnLine">amused if asking how many hands or feet I had.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Only two," I admitted, glad that I had not to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fess to three or four.

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stranahan appeared to be afflicted with no foolish</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensitiveness; and, having decided to join us, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed not to notice the frozen reception I accorded</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And like one determined to see things through to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end, he remained resolutely with us. He seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely discouraged by his limited knowledge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">language, which made him a total stranger to most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what we were saying; and for a good part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our conversation, he sat by in gaping ignorance, ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turing an occasional remark with such poor display</seg><seg type="columnLine">of grammar and pronunciation that I could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet our discussion was so engrossing that for min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">utes at a time I quite forgot the existence of Strana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">han. Even the bright sparkling eyes of Aelios had</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the moment no more than an impersonal interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me, for I found myself making a discovery so</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange, so amazing and so utterly unprecedented as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to upset my conception of human history.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can this really be Atlantis?"

"I didn't know there was any lost Atlantis."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I explained as briefly as possible the legend of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient continent that was said to have sunk beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea. "If there's any truth in the story, thrt was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the greatest disasters in history," I remarked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to lend importance to what I felt to be but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flimsies of myths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Disaster!" echoed Aelios, her perplexity deepening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Disaster!

"That a whole continent</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank beneath the waves?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, of course!" she exclaimed, astonished at so</seg><seg type="columnLine">self-evident a question. "How else do you think we</seg><seg type="columnLine">got here beneath the sea?" And she pointed signifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cantly to the great greenish roof and the bright, golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbs above us, while into her eyes came a wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully sweet, indulgent light, as into the eyes of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who delights to teach children the obvious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where did you suppose we could be now," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued, "except in Archeon, the Capital of At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantis?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was at this point that Stranahan thought it time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to let himself be heard. He drew his lips far apart</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if to speak, uttered an inarticulate syllable or two,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then stopped abruptly short, as though unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">frame the desired words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it, my friend?" asked Aelios, turning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stranahan with a gracious smile.

Surely, if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole continent of Atlantis was lost--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What makes you think the whole continent was</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost?" demanded Aelios, a quizzical, almost amused</seg><seg type="columnLine">light in her great blue eyes. "Why, the better part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Atlantis is safe here beneath the sea!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Safe here beneath the sea?" I cried, in growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusion. "Why, how is that possible?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is a long story," she started to explain. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">goes back very far, thousands of years, in fact--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And cannot you tell me that story?" I proposed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly. "Cannot you tell me from the beginning?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remember, I am a stranger here and find everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">very confusing. What is this Atlantis of yours? And</seg><seg type="columnLine">how old is it? And how large? And how did it come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be submerged? And how does it happen that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are living here now beneath the ocean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Whole volumes have been written in answer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">those questions," declared Aelios, with a winning</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile. "But I'll try to explain everything as best I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can." And she paused momentarily, while Stranahan</seg><seg type="columnLine">craned his long neck far forward, as if to take in all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she had to say.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is perhaps the most romantic tale in history,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she resumed, speaking almost with exaltation, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes took on a far-away dreamy look that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought most becoming, and her upper lip twitched</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the same sympathetic quivering I had noted be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore. "Atlantis is one of the most ancient republics</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the world, and at one time was the most populous</seg><seg type="columnLine">and powerful of all countries. Our history goes back</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than seven thousand years, four thousand above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea and three thousand beneath--four thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of growth, tumult and conquest, and three thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand years of maturity and peace. At a time when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Egypt and Babylonia were still unheard of, our engi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neers reared monuments more massive than the pyra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mids; and when Babylonia and Egypt were in the full</seg><seg type="columnLine">pride of their renown our people regarded them con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">temptuously as the merest barbarian tribes. Our ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complishments were to them what theirs were to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unclothed blacks of the south; and our country sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed theirs as a marble palace surpasses a clay</seg><seg type="columnLine">hut."</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">317</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Â«T)UT what was the precise location of your coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">SJ try?

I interposed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was in an isolated position a full day's sailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">west of the Pillars of Hercules. As for its size, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was large, and yet not overwhelmingly so; a swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">runner might have traveled around it between full</seg><seg type="columnLine">moon and full moon. But today you might look vainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for its plains and snow-tipped mountains, for above</seg><seg type="columnLine">all but its highest peaks, the unbroken waters foam</seg><seg type="columnLine">and toss."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aelios paused momentarily, and a melancholy rem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iniscent light came into her eyes, while her long, lithe</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers toyed absently with the folds of her lavender</seg><seg type="columnLine">gown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, how sad!" I could not forebear murmuring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What a ghastly tragedy!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, not a tragedy," she quickly denied, regarding</seg><seg type="columnLine">me again with a peculiar surprise that I could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand. "There is no tragedy in the history of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantis, though of course there might have been."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No tragedy?" I cried, wondering vaguely if Aelios</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be trying to make sport of me. "Is it not</seg><seg type="columnLine">tragedy for a whole great country to be submerged?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It may be, or again it may not be," she replied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">enigmatically. "In this case, it was not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Noting my quizzical silence, she continued, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">reassuring smile, "No doubt you will find this difficult</seg><seg type="columnLine">to understand. In your world above seas, conditions</seg><seg type="columnLine">are perhaps very different from those of old Atlantis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Certainly, you are spared the perils which we faced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and which compelled us to submerge our continent."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Compelled you to submerge your continent?" I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peated, growing more amazed each instant. "Do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean to say you submerged it deliberately?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. How else?" she returned, in matter-of-fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">tones. "The Submergence--or the Deliverance, as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is sometimes called--was the most fortunate event in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our history. We celebrate it annually at our great</seg><seg type="columnLine">festival, the Festival of the Good Destruction."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again she paused, as if uncertain how to proceed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I was forced to join Stranahan in a bewildered</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In order to make things clear," she continued at</seg><seg type="columnLine">length, with upper lip still fluttering and eyes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled with kindly good will, "I suppose I will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to describe Atlantis as it was in the old days, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">days before the flood. Thirty-one hundred years ago,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or at the time when the Submergence was first pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed, we were in possession of secrets which the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">world has perhaps not rediscovered even today. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not speak of our art, literature and philosophy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, though advanced for their day, were incompar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably inferior to what we have since produced; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in scientific spheres that our progress was most</seg><seg type="columnLine">pronounced. From the beginning, our science was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely lopsided growth; it was most developed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the purely material side; and while it could tell us</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to compute a comet's weight and enabled us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">communicate with the people of Mars, still on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole it was concerned with such practical questions</seg><seg type="columnLine">as how to produce food artificially or how to utilize</seg><seg type="columnLine">new sources of energy. And in these directions it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazingly efficient. We had long passed the stage, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">example, when we needed to rely upon steam, gaso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line or electricity to run our motors or to carry us</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the ground or through the air; we had mastered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the life-secret of matter itself, and by means of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy within the atoms could produce power equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">to that of a tornado or of a volcanic eruption."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Marvelous!" I exclaimed, enthusiastically. "Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velous! What magnificent opportunities that gave you!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, that was just the trouble," pursued Aelios, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">trace of a frown darkening her lovely cheeks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. "There are some opportunities that no men</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have. What would be the gain in giving a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasp the power of a bull? It was not a mere coinci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence, for example, that the decline of art was sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultaneous with the rise of science. After thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of years in which the pursuit of the beautiful had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been one of the objects of life, men began to be be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildered by the idea of their conquest over matter;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came to apply themselves to the construction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge and intricate machines, of towering but unsight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly piles of masonry, of swift means of locomotion and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unique and elaborate systems of amusement. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same time they devoted themselves extensively</seg><seg type="columnLine">to destruction. Not to the destruction of their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">monstrous contrivances, alas! but to the undermining</seg><seg type="columnLine">of human happiness and human life. In our isolated</seg><seg type="columnLine">position, we had had comparatively little intercourse</seg><seg type="columnLine">for centuries with other lands; but now that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">possessed lightning means of travel and lightning</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons of aggression, our citizens began to swoop</seg><seg type="columnLine">down occasionally upon a foreign cast, picking a quar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rel with the people and finding some excuse for smiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands dead. At first, of course, our enemies had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no means of retaliation, but it was certain that in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end they would have imitated our methods and singed</seg><seg type="columnLine">us with our own fire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And is that what actually happened?" I asked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancying I saw a trace of light at last. "Is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">why you had to submerge your land?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, that is not what happened," said Aelios, smil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at my naivete, while a ~ialf-suppressed yaw from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stranahan gave her but little encouragement to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinue. "Not all our people were savages, and not all</seg><seg type="columnLine">approved of our policy of international murder; nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all content to see art and beauty trodden down</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the twin hoofs of mechanism and multiple produc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Of course,' the protestants were at first mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices wailing against the waves, and more than one</seg><seg type="columnLine">was jeered as a maniac; but the protest continued and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew through many decades; and though there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands that continued to appraise the cities by</seg><seg type="columnLine">their size and scientific accomplishment by its deadli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, the time came when the party of rebellion was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost as numerous as the conservatives or 'Respec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables,' and when the limitation of mechanical power</seg><seg type="columnLine">became an issue that threatened the very life of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">State.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will not trouble you with the details of that strug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gle, or with the powerful cause made out by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies of Super-Science--for of this you shall hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">more later. For the present it is sufficient to state</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the climax arrived in the year 56 B. S.-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What does B. S. mean?" I interrupted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Before the Submergence, of course!" explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aelios, with a slight frown that instantly made way</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a broad and glowing smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was in the year 56," she proceeded, "that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agripides ministry came into office. Following the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open insurrection of beauty-lovers against the 'Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectables,' the Anti-Mechanism party triumphed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">general election; and Agripides, known by his friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">as 'Savior of the World' and by his foes as the 'City-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wrecker,' began to carry out the revolutionary policies</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been advocating for years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These policies, which were perhaps the most dar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ever conceived by the human mind, contemplated</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing less than the overthrow of existing civiliza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and the substitution of something better suited to</seg><seg type="columnLine">endure.

He declared, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">word, that Atlantis was not sufficiently isolated and</seg><seg type="columnLine">enisled; that it would never be safe while exposed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tides of commerce and worldly affairs; that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only rational course was for it first to destroy what-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever was noxious within itself, and then to prevent</seg><seg type="columnLine">further contamination by walling itself off completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the rest of the planet. And since no sea how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever wide and no fortress however strong would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">efficacious in warding off the hordes of mankind, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one possible plan would be to go where no men could</seg><seg type="columnLine">follow; to seal Atlantis up hermetically in an air-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tight case--in other words, to sink the whole island</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the bottom of the sea!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord!"

But I did not deign</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reply, and fixed my eyes sternly and appraisingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the countenance of Agripides. The hair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beard were perhaps a little long, I thought, uncon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciously agreeing with Stranahan; but the features</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the most striking I had ever seen in any human</seg><seg type="columnLine">being. Like many of the faces which have come down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us from classical times, this countenance combined</seg><seg type="columnLine">intellect and beauty to a singular degree. The brow</seg><seg type="columnLine">was broad, as in the representations of Homer, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">also rose to a majestic dominance; the eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">large and alert, the lips thin and compressed, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheeks long and firmly modelled, while the features</seg><seg type="columnLine">were furrowed with deep lines of sympathy that re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded me of Lincoln, and at the same time were</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked with a wistful, dreamy expression that con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trasted strangely with a savage, almost tigerish de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termination more implied than clearly graven on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">even contours of the face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Agripides was a remarkable orator, and at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time a writer of force," stated Aelios, as we re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to our seats. "Hundreds of his essays and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">â¢ . . although perhaps five hundred feet In length, it was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much like a great statue as like a building; It hnd none of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those features common in edifices for the shelter of man and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his works, hut seemed to have been erected exclusively as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">picce of art.

Or perhaps it would not be fair to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he converted all Atlantis--there was plenty of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wordy opposition to his schemes, as well as several</seg><seg type="columnLine">little armed revolts and insurrections that had to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppressed. But Agripides was not a man to be easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">daunted, and in spite of the strenuous objections of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the 'Respectables,' the year 49 saw the publication of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his complete plans for the Submergence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Those plans were more daring than the worst</seg><seg type="columnLine">enemies of Agripides could have anticipated. He pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed, in a word, to cover a large part of Atlantis with</seg><seg type="columnLine">an enormous glass wall, reaching like an artificial sky,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of feet above ground, and thick enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">withstand the pressure of unthinkable tons of water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Near the base of this wall should be two great valves,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one through which the ocean might be admitted into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad canal or artificial river, and a second (at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposite end of Atlantis) through which the waters</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be forced out again by means of gigantic intra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic pumps. I need not mention, of course, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep wells and distilled sea water would serve for</seg><seg type="columnLine">domestic and drinking purposes; that decomposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">water would provide sufficient oxygen for breathing;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that artificial sunlight, synthesized chemically so</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to produce the life-giving elements of the original,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not only supply illumination but would support</seg><seg type="columnLine">vegetation and human life as well.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, yes, that is all very good," said I, feeling that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aelios had not yet touched upon the most essential</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact of all. "But how did Agripides propose to sink</seg><seg type="columnLine">the island beneath the sea?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is a difficult question," she murmured, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a smile that was worth more to me than volumes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge. "It involves technical questions of engi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neering with which, I must confess, I am very poorly</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquainted. But, as I understand it, what Agripides</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposed was that enormous tanks be buried under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea bottom far to the west of Atlantis, and that, at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">given signal, the water should be raised to boiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">point by an application of intra-atomic heat. The re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulting tons of steam, in their fury to escape, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">create an explosion that would burst the very floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sea; in one direction there would be a gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">upheaval, and a lifting of the ocean bed; and in an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other direction, by way of reaction, there would be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinking of the ocean bottom in an effort of the strata</seg><seg type="columnLine">not directly affected, to fill in the gap left by those</seg><seg type="columnLine">displaced. And while a whole vast area would rise</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of feet (although not to the level of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water), another area would be forced downward an</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal distance; and that area, which would be of</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous extent, would include the island of Atlantis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To use a crude illustration, one may think of a com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man plank, balanced on its center, of which one end</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot be tilted upward without causing the other end</seg><seg type="columnLine">to slant down; and one may imagine Atlantis as re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posing on the lower slope of such a plank."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">&lt;ct&gt;UT that is all mere theory," I pointed out. "Cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">-D tainly, Agripides wouldn't dare to sink the island</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely on the basis of such unproved calculations."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, no, of course not. The computations were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">verified by actual experiment. With the aid of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplished engineers, Agripides made a small model</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the continent and the surrounding ocean, accurately</seg><seg type="columnLine">reproducing every detail; and, having stimulated an</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosion under the proper conditions, he found that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the miniature island sank precisely as he expected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">real island to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even so," I argued, "would not the explosion have</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattered the entire crust of the earth? And would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not the great glass dome have been split and ruined</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if the ground beneath it remained firm?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All that was duly provided for," explained Aelios.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The submergence was to be so gradual as to require</seg><seg type="columnLine">several hours; and since the explosion was to occur</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the sea rather than under the island itself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would shatter the crust of the earth only in remote</seg><seg type="columnLine">localities, and the shock would not be severe enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">affect the glass wall. In other words--to make an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other comparison--the island was to be like a ship that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinks in its entirety after striking the reefs, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">only the prow is damaged and the rest remains unin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jured."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I understand perfectly," said I, recalling my</seg><seg type="columnLine">recent experiences in the X-lll. "But even assuming</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the experiment was perfectly safe, how did</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agripides ever persuade the people to sink their homes</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath the sea?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was precisely there that he proved his great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness," said Aelios, casting an admiring glance in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction of Agripides' statue. "Well knowing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination is the most powerful force in human life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he began to work upon the imagination of the masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show the dangers of civilization. Simultaneously</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the publication of his plans for the Submergence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he opened to the public an enormous exhibition palace</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which he presented the most ghastly display in his-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory. With the vision of the social philosopher and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intuition of the prophet, he had constructed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">miniature the Atlantis of the future as he conceived</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be--and no man could gaze upon that At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantis without heartily praying for the Submergence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The landscape had been blasted, muddied and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">black, and scarcely a green leaf could be seen; steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">towers and smokestacks dotted the island until it</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like a range of artificial hills; great wheels and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chains whirled and rattled in the dark interiors of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buildings, and to each wheel and chain a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was tied; and the huge engines and motors were fed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the blood of men, and watered with their tears.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Innumerable multitudes--not only of men but of</seg><seg type="columnLine">women, and of sickly, pinch-faced children--were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound as slaves to the machines, and responded to</seg><seg type="columnLine">automatic orders that the machines flashed forth; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">after they had served long and their limbs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing frail, they were crushed and mangled by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very masters they had served, or else were cast out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to perish like frost-bitten flies. But the great wheels</seg><seg type="columnLine">never ceased to turn or the levers to clatter, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">their steel jaws gnashed the gouged-out hearts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brains of men, and their dust and cinders clouded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fields and forests, and their poison fumes invaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lungs of the people, blunting their minds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">making them droop and die by the million."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What a hideous picture!" I cried, with a shudder.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But certainly, certainly it was an exaggeration!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, Agripides had no need to exaggerate. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely showed the logical advance upon existing ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vances. But this was the least grewsome of the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hibits. One half of the display, which he entitled 'The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Triumph of Science,' was devoted to the supreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror. Here again he depicted artificial landscapes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and many-towered cities; but the wheels of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities were not revolving, though smoke was indeed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air. At first sight, they might hardly have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognized as cities at all; they were really little</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than chaotic heaps of iron and stone; many of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buildings had been blasted to fragments, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">320</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had toppled over, others were mere mangled frame-</seg><seg type="columnLine">works of steel. Scarcely more than an isolated wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained standing here and there to show that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been the home of men; but of the inhabitants</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves there was indeed an occasional sign: here</seg><seg type="columnLine">one was futiley gasping for breath, writhing on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground like a tormented worm; there one was groping</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazily through the ruins, with torn breast and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinded eyes; yonder a family group was lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprawled at all angles, with pale faces convulsed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their last agony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But had one looked for the source of the destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, one would not easily have found it--except that</seg><seg type="columnLine">far above, so remote as scarcely to be visible, a fleet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mosquito-like flying craft were buzzing on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">way like stealthy marauders."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aelios paused, a deep seriousness darkening' her</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair features; and as I sat there regarding her in</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence, I could not but reflect what unspeakable dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tances separated the bloody picture she described from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the enchanting scenes among which she dwelt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tcxjATURALLY," she continued, "the people were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1not captivated with the thought of the future</seg><seg type="columnLine">depicted by Agripides. And, Agripides, acting at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">psychological moment when all Atlantis was most</seg><seg type="columnLine">aroused, convened the National Assembly, and polled</seg><seg type="columnLine">a majority of--three to one in favor of the Sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mergence! This majority being confirmed by a refer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">endum of the people, the great leader took immediate</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps toward carrying out his revolutionary project.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nearly forty-eight years were consumed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary preliminaries, and in that time Atlantis</seg><seg type="columnLine">found itself forced halfway toward the realization of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agripides' direct prophecies. The island of Antiles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small republic located far to westward, had spied out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aggressive schemes of the Atlantean military ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perts, and enlarging upon them, had manufactured a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fleet of poison-bearing aircraft capable of smiting whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities with death and ruin.' That they were aimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">â¢for a contemplated conflict with Atlantis there could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be not a doubt; that such a conflict could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">averted by diplomacy was too self-evident to require</seg><seg type="columnLine">demonstration; and that there was no resisting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">destructive airships was generally, although unofficially,</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitted. Conceivably, it was the dread of imminent</seg><seg type="columnLine">disaster that restrained the minds of the people from</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacillating at the last moment and that brought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans of Agripides to their triumphant issue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Agripides, unfortunately, did not survive to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the consummation of his plans. Such a happiness</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more than he had hoped for; the years were al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready heavy upon him when his revolutionary ideas</seg><seg type="columnLine">first won approval. But, dying peacefully at an ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced age in the year 15 B. S., he yet lived long</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to supervise the more important details of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the project and to be assured of its eventual success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In accordance with Agripides' directions, a rein-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced glass wall many layers thick was erected over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most picturesque part of Atlantis, for it was agreed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the rest (which included the site of many cities)</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not worth saving. I shall not describe the steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken to insure the health and comfort of the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the Submergence, to rear elegant palaces and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mansions, to duplicate the sunlight and to produce</seg><seg type="columnLine">food chemically; I shall not even dwell upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Good Destruction, except to say that all save the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">essential of power-driven tools were piled up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doomed part of the island, to be buried on the day</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Submergence together with the towers of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserted cities. But what I must mention--and this is</seg><seg type="columnLine">most important--is that not all our people were con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tent to be submerged; that about one-third, irreconcil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to the last, emigrated eastward in a great body a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few months before the Submergence. It was this that</seg><seg type="columnLine">made us most sad when Agripides' plans were fulfilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we sank at last to the bottom of the sea.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Have you ever heard what happened to them?" 1</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquired, marveling at this extraordinary migration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, how could we? We have never since established</seg><seg type="columnLine">communication with the earth. But I was thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">that perhaps you, who are from the upper world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">could give us some tidings of our lost fellow men."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am not sure but that I can," I replied, slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking of the ancient Greeks and their striking re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">semblances to the Atlanteans and wondering whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">the immigrants from the sunken island might not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been among the original settlers of Athens and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corinth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, recalling the mystery of the "Telegonus,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">that powerful lost Homeric epic, I perceived a pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible clue.

And then, with the ease of</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect familiarity, "Why, Homer was one of the great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est poets we know of--almost equal to the best that</seg><seg type="columnLine">have arisen since the Good Destruction. He lived at</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the time of the Submergence in a country far</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the East, with which we had trade relations in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of its half barbarous condition. It was, in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, a sort of dependency, a ward of Atlantis; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was from us that its people derived their alphabet</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as much of their language and many of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">institutions. Possibly it was there that the Atlantean</seg><seg type="columnLine">migrants settled."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, I see," said I, with a flash of understanding.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Then you mean--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before I could utter another word, interruption</seg><seg type="columnLine">came from an unexpected quarter. And with a jolt I</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned from ancient Atlantis to the realities of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own life. "Hello, boys! Hello! Hello! There they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are, there they are!" came in loud familiar tones from</seg><seg type="columnLine">our rear, followed by a salvo of cheers; and before</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stranahan and I could quite realize what was happen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, we felt our hands grasped in a multitude of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, and found ourselves surrounded by dozens, liter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally dozens, of well known faces. The first I recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized was that of Captain Gavison, who grinned hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pily in welcome; then I distinguished one after one</seg><seg type="columnLine">the faces of my fellow seamen, apparently all of them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all of them talking, laughing, crowding about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">slapping us on the back, and shouting out greetings in</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumultuous chorus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIII</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trial and Judgment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TO our disappointment, we received no immediate ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planation of the arrival of Captain Gavison and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. A score of the natives, who stood frowning</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the background, appeared disinclined to permit any</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended conversation; and it was but a minute before</seg><seg type="columnLine">they motioned the newcomers to follow them. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested .to observe that all, from the Captain down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the humblest recruit, obeyed as readily as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">in response to an absolute master, marching not in</seg><seg type="columnLine">military formation and yet at a regular pace and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">every appearance of discipline.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Having nothing better to do, Stranahan and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">trailed in their wake, for at their first appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aelios had murmured a hasty "Good-bye" and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone tripping out of sight around a bend in the col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onnade.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">321</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few minutes we saw our comrades entering a</seg><seg type="columnLine">building we well knew--the palace of sapphire and</seg><seg type="columnLine">amber. Although expecting to be ordered out, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">made bold to follow, and to our surprise passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the gates of the building and into its gorgeous</seg><seg type="columnLine">interior without attracting any noticeable attention.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arriving at the great central theatre, we observed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of the natives were assembled as though in</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemn debate. Many an eye was turned upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">newcomers in curiosity and amazement; but there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no audible murmur at our entrance. And when Cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain Gavison and his followers were motioned to seats,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stranahan and I had no hesitation about joining them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the unlucky Stranahan was doomed to still</seg><seg type="columnLine">further boredom. For nearly an hour he was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelled to listen to a discussion of which he understood</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely a word. Certainly, he had cause to envy me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I easily followed the greater part of what was said</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and most unusual and absorbing I found it!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leader of the debate was a broad-browed</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman, with a firm and distinguished manner, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a trace of beauty in spite of her graying</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair. But she spoke comparatively little; and six or</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight of the audience took turns in standing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">open space in front and delivering brief addresses.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their theme was not at first apparent to me; I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were perhaps discussing some question of</seg><seg type="columnLine">politics, or pleading the merits of some new law; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was surprised to discover that what they were argu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was no mere practical matter, but concerned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">architecture of a new building, to be known as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Palace of the Ten Arts." One, there was that sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested a lagoon fronting the edifice, a second who</seg><seg type="columnLine">recommended rainbow fountains, and a third who fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vored an arcade of multi-colored crystal; and all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposals were heard with equal respect and duly noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">down by the leader of the debate, who smiled be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nignantly upon all the speakers and refrained from</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtruding her personal preferences.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was relieved when at length all who desired to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak had had their say.

A hush of expectation</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come over the gathering; all eyes were fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the tall young man as though he had a message</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rare importance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His first words were to justify this impression.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Fellow citizens," said he, speaking in a deep-toned</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice which had something of that musical quality</seg><seg type="columnLine">common to his people, "I have to bring to your atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion today a matter unique in the history of Atlantis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">First, however, let me recall to your minds several</seg><seg type="columnLine">facts with which you are no doubt familiar.

How they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">penetrated beneath the secluded dome of our country</seg><seg type="columnLine">we could not imagine, but it was decided that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best course would be to educate them in our language,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, after they were thoroughly conversant with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tongue, to question them in the attempt to solve the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mystery. This decision was only reinforced by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of two more of the queer creatures a day</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so later, and then again by the arrival of a third</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange couple. While it was feared that our age-old</seg><seg type="columnLine">seclusion had been broken and that we were being in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaded by the upper world, still it was decided that for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the present the best course would be to maintain an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unperturbed but vigilant silence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The speaker paused, and cleared his throat as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">the important part of his address were to follow. "Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">yesterday, fellow citizens," he continued, "you heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">startling sequel. A field naturalist, roaming along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Salty River in the wilderness beyond the furthest</seg><seg type="columnLine">colonnades, made the most surprising discovery of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">life--a peculiar ugly rod-like ship of unknown type,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ship that seemed to be fairly swarming with un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">couth humans! Naturally, the scientist was alarmed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, having made his escape, he hastened back to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city to secure aid in capturing the aliens. As he</seg><seg type="columnLine">described them, they were in every respect like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barbarians of which ancient annals tell,--great, brawny</seg><seg type="columnLine">humans of unkempt and ferocious appearance. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">we knew that they could be no more redoubtable than</seg><seg type="columnLine">their kindred who were already among us; we knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they would be easily subdued by the superior</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds and irresistible magnetic wills with which na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture and a select inheritance have endowed our race.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And when the twenty men of the searching expedition</seg><seg type="columnLine">set out early this morning, we had reason to believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the aliens would be present by evening to face</seg><seg type="columnLine">trial before this assemblage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As you observe, we have not been disappointed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But now, fellow citizens, the great problem arises.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The prisoners appear to be unclean as well as wanton</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unprincipled men. Contrary to all regulations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have been catching fish from the Salty River and</seg><seg type="columnLine">using them for food. They have been slaying un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">offending crabs and turtles, and--disgusting though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea be--frying and eating them! They have been pol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">luting water of the stream; they have been trampling</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the rarest seaweeds, and beating to death the</seg><seg type="columnLine">daintiest of water-flowers; they have been scrawling all</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorts of crude and outlandish designs on the delicate</seg><seg type="columnLine">pink and blue of the roof-bearing columns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But all this--criminal though it be--we may over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">look for the moment. The chief problem presented by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arrival of these aliens is of such wide-reaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">social consequence that their minor transgressions pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">into insignificance. For the first time in more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">three thousand years, the principles of Agripides have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been violated. Visitors from outside have at last ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared; at last we are in danger of contamination by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passions and vices of the upper world. Whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">the invasion was deliberate is not definitely known,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but how it was made is sufficiently clear: the bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barian ship, which was equipped to travel under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea, was sucked into the whirlpool at the ocean en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance of Atlantis and forced into the valve through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the waters of the Salty River find admittance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course, this trespass may have been merely acci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dental; but remembering the warlike and unfriendly</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways of the upper world, I personally suspect that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">intrusion was planned with cunning design, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">other invading craft--possibly a whole invading fleet--</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be expected to arrive. Fellow citizens, what is</seg><seg type="columnLine">your opinion?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMID general silence the speaker took his seat--</seg><seg type="columnLine">applause was apparently unknown among the At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lanteans. But this fact did not then enter into my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts; I was too much enraged at the tall young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's misstatements. With a lack of self-consciousness</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I can explain only by my blinding fury, I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself doing the unprecedented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Springing excitedly to my feet, I demanded, hotly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the native tongue, "Friends, may I say a word?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly hundreds of pairs of eyes were turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon me in surprise; I saw that I had no more been</seg><seg type="columnLine">322</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">expected to speak than if I had been a tree or a stone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the glances that were darted at me were not un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly, and as yet I was too much incensed to regret</seg><seg type="columnLine">my words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly, you may say all you wish," rang out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear, well-rounded tones of the lady leader of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">debate. "This is the Hall of Public Enlightenment, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know, and any person with anything to say will gladly</seg><seg type="columnLine">be heard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go on, old sport, give it to them good!" whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stranahan into my ear, although he could not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught the drift of what was happening; and, with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">words rankling in my mind, I started toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaker's space.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as I took my place before that silent, staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitude, I wished that I could have been safely back</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my seat. Something suspiciously like fear overcame</seg><seg type="columnLine">me--what right had I to be addressing this strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">assemblage? What reason to expect that I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak their language intelligibly? Yet necessity</seg><seg type="columnLine">prodded me on; and, after gaping stonily at the spec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tators, I found myself somehow uttering a series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">more or less connected sounds. I did not say what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had intended, and I suspect that more than one Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lish word got itself intertwined with my Atlantean vo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabulary; but I was encouraged when I observed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all eyes were fixed upon me with apparent interest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that no one openly laughed or so much as tittered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though one or two (and among them Stranahan) could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly suppress a smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a vague, sputtering introduction that I can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">not begin to recall, I found myself on fairly solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. I declared that I could answer many of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions which the previous speaker had put; I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained that my companions and myself were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">babarians, being representatives of the highest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern civilizations; I stated that we had no evil in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentions, having come to Atlantis by accident, and cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainly not being the forerunners of a wave of in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vasion; and, at the same time, I offered our thanks</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the treatment already accorded us, and expressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">our intention to abide by the laws of Atlantis and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">act in conformity with the best traditions of the land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I took my seat, I could see from the faces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my hearers that I had produced a favorable effect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many were the nods of approval that greeted me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">many the sympathetic smiles. But at the same time I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could perceive that I had not made myself perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear; and when a score of voices simultaneously re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quested that I return to the platform, I had no other</seg><seg type="columnLine">choice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Questions regarding my native land were now</seg><seg type="columnLine">rained upon me in profusion. But whether because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my limited knowledge of the language or because</seg><seg type="columnLine">the experience of the Atlanteans differed so fundamen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tally from my own, I had great difficulty in making</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself understood. My description of the growth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">attainments of the modern world was listened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">with interest, but with a lack of comprehension that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought almost idiotic. Thus, when I declared that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States was a leading nation because of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">population of a hundred million, its rare inventions</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its prolific manufactures, my hearers merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked blank and asked how the country ranked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">art; and when I stated (what surely is self-evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all patriotic Americans) that New York is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest city on earth because of its tall buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">and its capacity for housing a million human beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one square mile, my audience regarded me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">something akin to horror, and one of the men--evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently a dolt, for he seemed quite serious--asked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">whether no steps had even been taken to abolish the</seg><seg type="columnLine">evil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But it was when describing my own career that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was most grievously misunderstood. Had I confessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to murder, the people could not have been more</seg><seg type="columnLine">shocked than when I mentioned that I was one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crew of a ship commissioned to ram and destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">other ships; and I felt that my prestige was ruined</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond repair when I stated that I had entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">war voluntarily. Even the most friendly hearers</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to draw unconsciously away from me after my</seg><seg type="columnLine">recital; loathing and disgust showed plainly in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces, as though I had announced myself to be an</seg><seg type="columnLine">African cannibal or a Polynesian head hunter. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">too plainly I perceived that what was termed heroism</seg><seg type="columnLine">among my fellows was here regarded as villainy. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">did little good to explain that war was a cherished</seg><seg type="columnLine">custom in the upper world, and that patriotism wa3</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the prime virtues; it was useless to plead that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there might be reasons for taking the lives of men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom one had never seen, and that such reasons were</seg><seg type="columnLine">generally recognized among civilized nations. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">more I argued, the greater the abhorrence I aroused;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beyond an occasional murmured "Agripides was</seg><seg type="columnLine">right," my words brought little direct reply. And at</seg><seg type="columnLine">length I returned to my seat feeling myself to be in</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgrace, yet curbing my embarrassment by inwardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursing the stupidity of the Atlanteans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The remaining business of the assemblage was dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed of quickly enough. Following my retreat, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall young man again addressed the meeting, remind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his audience that they had not yet passed judg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment upon us. "Fellow citizens," said he, in conclu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion, "I have a proposal to make, which, so far as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">can see, is the only one possible under the circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances. Whether we like it or not, we must recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nize that the intruders are here; and, though we did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not will their presence, we must treat them humanely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since we cannot dispose of them by violence and since</seg><seg type="columnLine">we must accept their assurance that no others of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind are to follow, we must let them remain, and see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they are educated and put to work like all other</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizens. But one thing we must insist upon above</seg><seg type="columnLine">all else: the isolation of Atlantis must be protected, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the countries above seas must never learn of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence. Hence we must decree that, no matter how</seg><seg type="columnLine">many years go by, none of the aliens shall ever return</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the upper world!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And it was with a sinking heart, with the hopeless-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of one being sentenced to life imprisonment, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard the assemblage endorse this recommendation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Upper World Club</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING the next few hours, Captain Gavison and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new-found members of his crew were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided with the native garb and lodged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumptuous quarters in various parts of the city. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked peculiar indeed in their new costumes of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue and green and yellow, and grumbled not a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the change; but they confessed to their relief at</seg><seg type="columnLine">having left the X-lll; and not even the prospect of</seg><seg type="columnLine">passing their remaining days in Atlantis sufficed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">neutralize their joy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As nearly as I could determine, they had had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">altogether wretched time during the past few weeks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A spirit of panic had grown among them, following</seg><seg type="columnLine">the failure of Rawson and myself to return from our</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching expedition, and neither by bribe nor by</seg><seg type="columnLine">threat could any other member of the crew be induced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to venture into that wilderness where we had disag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD	323</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Half a dozen of the queerest beings we had ever seen came crowding into our path . . . from the blank amazed stares with which they greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, it was evident that our appearance was as much a surprise to them as theirs was to us. But from a certain sternness and resolution which</seg><seg type="columnLine">invested their faces following the first speechless astonishment, we concluded that they had probably seen others of our kind, and were not dis*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">posed to treat us leniently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">324</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">peared. And so they had all remained anxiously in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vicinity of the disabled ship, drinking the distilled</seg><seg type="columnLine">water of the Salty River and snatching what food they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could from the land while exhausting their vessel's re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve supplies. How long they could have held out it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was impossible to say, but certainly they could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">have held out long; madness had been overtaking them</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the delay and the suspense; and, but for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">timely arrival of the natives, bloody disaster might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have ensued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet, while they realized that they had been rescued</seg><seg type="columnLine">from possible destruction, I must not give the im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression that they were altogether contented with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">new surroundings, or that their queer native garments</seg><seg type="columnLine">constituted their only source of complaint. Being</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal human beings, they found abundant cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">for dissatisfaction. And, indeed, they were not much</seg><seg type="columnLine">to blame, for how could they adapt themselves imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diately to an environment so unfamiliar as that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantis? For some time they walked about like men</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a daze; or, rather, like men who know they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreaming and expect shortly to awaken; and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared with incredulous eyes at the marble columns</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Sunken World, its sculpture-lined thorough-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fares and statuesque palaces. And what wonder if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were dazzled and yet a little frightened by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty, which seemed to them so cold and alien a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing? What wonder if the more superstitious shud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered a little at times, and muttered to themselves in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the presence of what they took to be the supernatural?</seg><seg type="columnLine">What wonder if they missed the familiar things of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth, the scenes and the faces they had left be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind them, the habits they had discarded and the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered life that was dwindling to a shadow?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortunately, they were not always free to brood</seg><seg type="columnLine">over their misfortunes. Like those of their shipmates</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had preceded them to Archeon, they were at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplied with tutors who sought to teach them the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantean tongue. Each of them received at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hours a day of personal instruction, and each was</seg><seg type="columnLine">required to devote several hours to various prescribed</seg><seg type="columnLine">written exercises. It need hardly be stated that not</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of them took kindly to this enforced application,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for most of them were anything but studious by na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture; but the tutors persisted even though their task</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a hard one, and prevailed by means of that mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">netic dominance I had often noted in the Atlanteans;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all of the crew, from the grizzled McCrae to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">callow young Barnfield, were soon plodding regularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">over their lessons in grammar and spelling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But among a group of nearly forty men, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">but natural that some should make more willing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">able students than others. And so, while the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward were still struggling with the elements of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantean, others were striding toward a speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge. Among the latter was Captain Gavison,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who still had a position to maintain, and could not let</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself be outdone by his men. Whether because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a natural aptitude or of diligent application, he speed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily outdistanced all his crew, with the exception (I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must modestly admit) of one whose pre-war specialty</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been Greek. And partly on account of his evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent supremacy in Atlantean, but more largely owing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the force of ironclad habit, he was still the acknowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edged leader of us all; and his word still was like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the word of a king, his approval still a favor to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">courted and his anger a thing to make one quail, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">though his commission from the United States Navy</seg><seg type="columnLine">Department, could hardly give him any authority here</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Atlantis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I do not know whether it was at Captain Gavison's</seg><seg type="columnLine">prompting, or whether it was at the suggestion of one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the men, that we took the step which was to band</seg><seg type="columnLine">us more closely together. At all events, the step was</seg><seg type="columnLine">inevitable; for all of us felt like kinsmen isolated</seg><seg type="columnLine">among strangers, and our common experiences and</seg><seg type="columnLine">common origin constituted an irresistible bond.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so it was that we found ourselves convening</seg><seg type="columnLine">one afternoon--the whole thirty-nine of us--in a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">colonnaded court in one of the city parks. All of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">were waiting in vociferous expectancy, for it had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">whispered .that important events were in store; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so we listened eagerly when Captain Gavison arrived,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and took the center of the stage, launching at once into</seg><seg type="columnLine">an address.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The proposal has been made," he announced, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning without formality, "that we all join forces by</seg><seg type="columnLine">forming a social club. We're all in the same boat still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you see, even though we're out of the X-lll. Most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us feel rather out of place down here in Atlantis;</seg><seg type="columnLine">we find the people strange, the land stranger still, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the customs strangest of all. And so the best way</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be to stick together and try to make things agree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able for one another . . And in this vein he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued for five or ten minutes, pointing out the ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantages of union, the increased power as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the social gain, the possibility of making our will felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Atlantis if we acted in concert.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN he had finished, he asked for opinions--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">received them in abundance. . . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If we got together and started a club," summarized</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stangale, whose views coincided with the majority,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"things might begin to look a little less dead. Seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me every day down here is Sunday!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, and they've got lots of Sunday closing laws,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too!" Stranahan contributed, with a wry grimace to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward the massive columns and tinted statuary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Very tactfully Captain Gavison reminded Stranahan</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the question to be decided did not concern the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sunday regulations of the Atlanteans. And without</seg><seg type="columnLine">further dalliance he raised his voice and inquired how</seg><seg type="columnLine">many were in favor of a social club.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The proposal having been accepted by unanimous</seg><seg type="columnLine">acclaim, the next question was one of nomenclature.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Various names were suggested: "The Woodrow Wilson</seg><seg type="columnLine">Club," "The Theodore Roosevelt Club," "The U. S. A.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Club," "The X-lll Club," "The Underseas Association"</seg><seg type="columnLine">--but finally, after much pointless debating, we decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, since we were the sole representatives of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper world in Atlantis, the most appropriate title</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be "The Upper World Club."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having threshed out this important matter, we now</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt it necessary to elect the officers of "The Upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">World Club."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Obviously, there was only one possible nominee for</seg><seg type="columnLine">President. It seemed almost a matter of form to pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose the name of Gavison; and once this name had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been mentioned, the election was settled, for there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one daring enough to run in opposition or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">to think of suggesting another candidate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After being duly installed in office, the Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">made his inaugural address. It was brief and to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">point. He began by thanking us in conventional terms</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the honor and by assuring us that he would try</seg><seg type="columnLine">to run the club as well as if it were a ship under</seg><seg type="columnLine">his command. And he concluded with a declaration</seg><seg type="columnLine">of policy: "We're all of us caught like rats in a trap,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know, so while we're here there's nothing to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">but to try to make the best of our prison. And I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think the Upper World Club should be the means. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have, I believe, the following objects: first, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring us together for social purposes. Secondly, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">should give us the chance to discuss our problems in</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">325</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">this strange world, and should be the means of ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressing our combined views to the Atlanteans. Lastly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it should keep us all together, so that we can act in</seg><seg type="columnLine">unison if the time ever comes to make a dash for</seg><seg type="columnLine">liberty."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> r'That time will never come!" I surprised myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">by exclaiming, after Gavison had lapsed into silence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, finding all eyes bent upon me inquiringly, I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound to continue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us not deceive ourselves by the thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape," I proceeded, stepping toward the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">assemblage. "We are buried beneath thousands of feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water, and for all practical purposes America is as</seg><seg type="columnLine">far from us as the moon. Even if there were a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, what good would that do us when we cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">even leave this city against the will of the Atlanteans?</seg><seg type="columnLine">No, my friends, let us look facts in the face. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall remain here till we are gray and toothless, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall never see the United States again. And let us</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to reconcile ourselves to that certainty. Let us</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to become citizens of Atlantis, and share in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">life about us ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in this vein I continued for some minutes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while my hearers followed me with transparent interest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reluctantly nodded agreement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In general, my words may have been without effect;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they had at least one result I had not anticipated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For when, a few moments later, Gavison announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">that nominations were in order for Vice-President, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was surprised to find that my name was the first put</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward, and that no others were put forward at all--</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that I was selected without opposition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After I had duly thanked my fellow club members</seg><seg type="columnLine">for this honor, the President turned to me, and said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Harkness, I appoint you a committee of one to confer</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me in drawing up the constitution of the Upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">World Club." And with that the meeting adjourned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'And. thus began my intimacy with Captain Gavi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. I do not know how seriously he took the Upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">World Club and its constitution, for at most times his</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim, firm face was inscrutable; but he acted as if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">took it seriously indeed, and he and I spent hours to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether debating and planning for the club, almost as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though we had had to draw up a pact not for thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine individuals but for thirty-nine sovereign states.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How much the club profited from our activities shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">always be a question in my mind; but I am certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I personally profited a great deal, and make bold</seg><seg type="columnLine">to believe that even Gavison was not without benefit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Although he had a habit of shutting his thin lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">stoically and glaring upon the world with stern, impas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive air, an occasional look of weariness and even of</seg><seg type="columnLine">melancholy in his keen gray eyes told me that he too</seg><seg type="columnLine">was suffering from loneliness; and while he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been the last man in the world to make such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">admission openly, he made it tacitly by the amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">of time he spent in my company, theoretically draw-'</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up the constitution of the Upper World Club. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was always far from loquacious; frequently he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">taciturn indeed, and would simply sit before me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a detached and meditative air, occasionally grunting</seg><seg type="columnLine">some comment or question in response to my remarks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps the consciousness of the former gulf between</seg><seg type="columnLine">us would not leave him; but all the while I felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were drawing together, were even beginning to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon one another with a genuine, although undemon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strative regard. Certainly, he was emerging by de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grees from the thick shell of his reticence, as I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerging from mine. We began quite naturally by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussion of Atlantis and the Atlanteans; and grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually we ventured into more personal subjects. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a day when I went so far as to tell him of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">my former life, my training in ancient Greek, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">betrothal to Alma Huntley; and, responsive to my con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidence, he offered me one or two glimpses into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own past, and made himself appear more human than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever before, by stating that he had a wife and two lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle daughters in New York, who no doubt were even</seg><seg type="columnLine">now mourning him as lost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know, Harkness, that's the hardest thing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all to bear," he said, while his thin fingers stroked his</seg><seg type="columnLine">bristly chin ruminatingly, and the drawn lines of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaunt face enhanced his habitual gravity. "If there</seg><seg type="columnLine">were only some way of getting word to them, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be so bad. But I might be dead for all they</seg><seg type="columnLine">know--and would you believe it, Harkness, sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seems to me as if I'm actually in my tomb." And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Captain averted his gaze, and after staring into</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacancy for an indeterminate period, he continued,</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking more rapidly, and almost with brusqueness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now you see why I'm so anxious to get back! For</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own part, it wouldn't matter so much, but I can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">help thinking it must be Hell for those waiting up</seg><seg type="columnLine">there!" And he concluded by drawing vivid pictures</seg><seg type="columnLine">of blue-eyed Martha, his wife, and of the auburn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired six-year-old Ellen, who was waiting for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">father that would never come back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To all this I listened earnestly; and when Gavison</seg><seg type="columnLine">had finished, I tried to say whatever I could by way</seg><seg type="columnLine">of consolation. And in order to make his woes seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">less by comparison, I exaggerated my own; I discoursed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the misfortune of being sundered from my old</seg><seg type="columnLine">father and mother (who, as a matter of fact, had pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viously been sundered from me by death), and dilated</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon my grief at losing Alma Huntley--although, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell the truth, she had been almost driven out of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts by the proximity of one even fairer than</seg><seg type="columnLine">she.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was from the time of our mutual confessions that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my real friendship with Gavison dated. Not unnatur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally, we now lost sight of our former positions as</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior officer and subordinate, and began to act</seg><seg type="columnLine">unrestrainedly toward one another as man to man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And while I was on terms of fellowship with all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew and intimate with several, my attachment to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gavison became the closest of all; and often of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon, when he had completed the day's studies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or of an evening before the great golden orbs had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been extinguished, we might have been seen strolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">together along the winding colonnades, or seated on</seg><seg type="columnLine">seaweed cushions in a marble hall, discussing the art</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the odd ways of Atlantis, practicing the Atlantean</seg><seg type="columnLine">speech, exchanging reminiscences of the world we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, or merely absorbed in one of those long silences</seg><seg type="columnLine">that marked our queer acquaintanceship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Pageant of the Good Destruction</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHILE my intimacy with Captain Gavison was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripening, I had of course not forgotten one</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose friendship meant more to me than that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of any man. In the exhilarating moments of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">first happy interview with Aelios, I had had visions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of speaking with her often, visions of an Atlantis</seg><seg type="columnLine">made bright by her very presence. But before long I</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to feel that I had been too sanguine. Although</seg><seg type="columnLine">I still caught glimpses of her when she came to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stranahan his daily lesson, and although she would</seg><seg type="columnLine">sometimes nod ingratiatingly to me, it was long before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had another opportunity to speak to her, since I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not detach her from the company of the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">tutors. And so day after long uneasy day dragged by</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they had piled up into a week, and slow, pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">326</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted weeks until they had accumulated into a month,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before at last we had another conversation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came a day when I observed her by chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">in one of the great festooned courts at the base of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">towering campanile. She saw me even before I saw her;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and approaching of her own volition, she flashed upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a smile that seemed to make the universe stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">still with joy. "I am glad to see you, my friend,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said, simply and with unaffected kindliness. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been wanting to tell you about our coming</seg><seg type="columnLine">pageant. I know you will not want to miss it, for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will explain many things you have been wondering</seg><seg type="columnLine">about."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What pageant do you mean?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Festival of the Good Destruction," she ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained. "Every year, as I believe I've told you, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold a celebration on the anniversary of the Sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mergence. This year it will take the form of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pageant. It will be the Three Thousand and Thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifth anniversary."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In eight days. It will commence at noon in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agripides Theatre, which you will very easily find,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since it is in the center of town. I certainly hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see you there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I certainly hope to see you there," I declared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite truthfully. But at the same time a shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed my thoughts. Hesitatingly, and possibly blush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in my embarrassment, I had to confess that, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, I would not be able to go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not be able to go?" she demanded, in manifest dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointment. "What other engagement can you pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibly have?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since some definite excuse appeared to be neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary, I explained--very reluctantly to be sure--that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not pay my admission.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pay your admission?" echoed Aelios, in such shrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise that I thought she had misunderstood me.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What on earth are you thinking of? Do you imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are barbarians?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid I haven't made myself clear," I hastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to explain. "Where I come from it is customary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay upon going to a theatre."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Really?" demanded Aelios, so incredulously that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought her most naive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course!" I assured her, in such a manner as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamp all doubt from her mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How queer!" she exclaimed. "How very queer!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still, I do remember hearing that people used to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pay for everything before the Submergence. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was so long ago, I thought the world had out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown such crudity."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't see anything wrong about paying for what</seg><seg type="columnLine">you get," I stated, thinking this the most topsy turvy</seg><seg type="columnLine">land in the world. "Don't they really charge you</seg><seg type="columnLine">for going to theatres down here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course not! How could any one be so gross?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fancy being charged for beauty or ecstasy or dreams!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why, one would as soon think of paying for the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">one breathes or the light that shines upon one! The</seg><seg type="columnLine">State naturally recognizes the theatre as the birth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">right of every citizen, just as it recognizes poetry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">music and education. We all take part in giving the</seg><seg type="columnLine">performances, and of course every one is invited."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And do you yourself take part?" I queried, my per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal interest in Aelios overshadowing my general in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest in the native customs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes, I try to do my share," she acknowledged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a faint blush that seemed only to accentuate her</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty. "I sometimes lead in the dances."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And a most exquisite dancer you make!" said I,</seg><seg type="columnLine">recalling my first enchanting glimpse of Aelios on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colonnade outside the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before I had had time for further compliments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had whispered a light "Good-bye," and had gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">tripping toward the further end of the court and out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sight through a little half concealed door at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base of the campanile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT hardly need be stated that I waited eagerly for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day of the Pageant. Not that I was looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward to the entertainment itself; I remembered only</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Aelios had seen fit to invite me, and that I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to see her again. So utterly out of my head</seg><seg type="columnLine">was I that her bright face now appeared to me at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">times of the day and night; her least smile, her slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est gesture, her most careless nod, was re-enacted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand times in my memory. And what if somewhere</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the past there had been an Alma Huntley whom I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had admired and fancied I had loved?--she was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more than a ghost amid the shadows of a vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Certainly, I had no thought of Alma when at last the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day of the pageant arrived. I was jubilant merely at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prospect of speaking with Aelios again; I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly restrain my impatience, but left for the festivi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties a full hour earlier than necessary. Such was my</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerness that I could not even walk at a normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace, but unconsciously hastened my steps as when,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my native land, I had feared to miss a street car</seg><seg type="columnLine">or be too late for an appointment with Alma.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the day's pleasure was to be unexpectedly varied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As I hastened through the streets, striding more rap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">idly than ever before in this land of leisure, I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">a well known voice shouting behind me, "Hey, wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minute! Where are you going so fast?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a sinking heart I wheeled about--to face the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinning Stranahan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Great Jerusalem, you were racing so I could hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch up!" he panted, as he joined me. "Where you</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound for, anyway?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are you bound for?" I countered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To the pageant, of course," he informed me. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">amiably unconscious that he might be interfering with</seg><seg type="columnLine">my plans, he suggested, "Well, we both seem to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">going in the same direction, so what do you say to</seg><seg type="columnLine">going together?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, let's go together," I had to acquiesce; and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">it happened that Stranahan and I reached the Agri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pides Theatre arm in arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I might have known, we were much too early;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the doors were open, but the audience had scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun to arrive. Indeed, the whole enormous open-air</seg><seg type="columnLine">theatre was occupied only by a few children who</seg><seg type="columnLine">danced and played about the stage and romped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">tier to tier of the seaweed-cushioned marble seats.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Upon entering, we paused for a view of the giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">theatre, which seemed large enough to accommodate</seg><seg type="columnLine">an entire community, and which was constructed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a simple and yet majestic art that I thought admir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. The seat arrangement was that of the typical</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greek theatre, but the stage surprised me, not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">by its size but by its general appearance, for it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not less than two or three acres in extent, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely enclosed by a ring of columns bearing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome apparently inlaid with ebony and gold. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">what particularly caught my attention was an object</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was evidently not an integral part of the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing--an amorphous mass many feet in height and cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering more than half of the stage, but completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">mantled in a linen-like white cloth that was like, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">garment of mystery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But Stranahan would brook not more than a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment's pause for viewing the building. Impetuously he</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">327</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">started down the steeply sloping central aisle, and did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not halt until he had reached the front row, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he appropriated the best seat as nonchalantly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it had been reserved for him. Of course, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no choice except to deposit myself at his side;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I could not help wishing that he had chosen a</seg><seg type="columnLine">less conspicuous position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not long before the theatre began to fill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Singly and in whole family groups the people were</seg><seg type="columnLine">arriving, children and gray old men and bright-faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">girls and youths; and all wore happy, expectant smiles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all were clad in their pastel-tinted gowns that made</seg><seg type="columnLine">them look like animated flowers. I had a chance now</seg><seg type="columnLine">to observe the Atlanteans as never before; and, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">never before, I was struck by the exceptional number</seg><seg type="columnLine">of well formed and beautiful faces; by the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">every one seemed tranquil and contented, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was little if any sign of tragedy or sorrow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here was no evidence of the worn and withered, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distorted, the grotesque, the wolfish, the weasel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bovine types so common on earth; even the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to wear a sweet and placid and at times a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful look, which contrasted strangely with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sour and crochety expression I had regarded as</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural; and most of the faces bore the imprint of</seg><seg type="columnLine">something akin to poetry and music, an exalted some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that I had first noted in Aelios and that set the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlanteans apart from every other race I had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">known.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even to be among these people seemed to produce a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange and uplifting effect upon me. I do not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what mysterious psychic currents were at work, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I cannot say that my imagination did not betray me;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I do distinctly remember that, as the theatre grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually filled, a singular sense of well-being and almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thankfulness came upon me, a feeling of spiritual</seg><seg type="columnLine">tranquility and repose, as though by some subtle</seg><seg type="columnLine">transference of thought I had shared the mood of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the multitude and become one with them in heart.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even Stranahan seemed to have been affected, for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had none of his usual boisterousness; he talked but</seg><seg type="columnLine">little, and there was a rapt and almost devout look</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his eyes, as though he too had caught the glimmer</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some rare loveliness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet there was still a shadow across my happiness--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and possibly across his as well. As I scanned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces that thronged down the aisles and along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiers of seats, there was one smiling countenance for</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I searched in vain. Surely, Aelios had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten the day, nor had she forgotten her implied</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise to see me here; yet till the last seat was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled by the expectant crowd, I scrutinized the faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the newcomers, only to be assured that Aelios was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not among them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But after about an hour, my thoughts were forcibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">recalled from Aelios to the spectacle in the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">theatre. A sudden flickering of the great golden orbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">attracted our attention; and we noted that those lumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">naries were being dimmed as though by unseen hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they had less than half their usual brightness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At the same time, long shafts of light began to shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">out simultaneously from all points of the horizon, --</seg><seg type="columnLine">multicolored shafts that included all the hues of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rainbow. In wide ambling curves they met the dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass of the roof, splashing it with red and purple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">orange and green, lavender and violet; and for many</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes the play and interplay of color continued, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">searchlights seeming to work out all manner of pat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terns and arabesques which endured for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">and vanished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE one thing to which I could liken this pageant</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light was the music that sometimes preceded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">theatrical performances in our own lana. The flashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">colors had all the ethereal loveliness of music; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">like music they prepared one for a mood of rapture</seg><seg type="columnLine">and contemplation. And when at length the original</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights had faded out, to be replaced by others that</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone directly down upon the open platform or stage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this mood was strengthened and intensified; and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time I felt that we had but beheld an intro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duction to the real exhibition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, in the illumination of the many-hued</seg><seg type="columnLine">searchlights, a white-gowned woman appeared upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stage. She was very young, scarcely more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a girl, I thought, and her face had something of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweetness and radiance which distinguished Aelios;</seg><seg type="columnLine">while in the colored glow of the everchanging lights</seg><seg type="columnLine">she seemed some shimmering, ethereal thing, possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">a butterfly, possibly some apparition as unreal as rain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bows or moonlit cloud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was surprised, accordingly, when the fairy-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature began to speak. Or perhaps it would not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">correct to say that she spoke; her words came in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">soft, wonderfully melodious voice more than half like</seg><seg type="columnLine">song; and merely to listen to her was to be lulled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">soothed as though by music.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet, despite the spirit of exaltation and almost of</seg><seg type="columnLine">worship she aroused in me, I did not miss the drift</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what she was saying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fellow citizens," she declared, while a hush came</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the assemblage, and all strained forward so as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to lose not a syllable, "fellow citizens, for this year's</seg><seg type="columnLine">celebration we have decided to present a historical</seg><seg type="columnLine">pageant. Imagine yourselves borne backward almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty-one hundred years, to those days when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Submergence was not yet an accomplished fact, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agripides stood before the old National Assembly</seg><seg type="columnLine">urging the Good Destruction. Agripides shall now</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear before you, as he appeared to your forefathers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the lands above the sea; you shall be the National</seg><seg type="columnLine">Assembly before which he speaks; and he shall present</seg><seg type="columnLine">his views to you as he presented them to our ances-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors, and depict for you, as he depicted for them, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reasons why Atlantis should become a sunken conti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nent. Behold, here comes Agripides!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a wide-sweeping bow the speaker ceased, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">treating from view through some unseen door; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same instant some invisible instrument sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth a sound like a trumpet blast, and from the rear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stage a tall figure appeared, walking slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with head bent low as though in thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Agripides! Agripides!" came one or two indistinct</seg><seg type="columnLine">murmurs from behind me, but there was no such</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumult of applause as I might have expected. Yet all</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes were directed eagerly toward the newcomer, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found myself a partner in the tense excitement of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the multitude.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even had I not heard the name Agripides, I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have recognized the advancing figure from the bust</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown me by Aelios--there was the same bearded</seg><seg type="columnLine">countenance, the same broad and noble brow, the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">furrowed and sympathetic features. But one charac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teristic there was which the bust could not show,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and which, while merely incidental, struck me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar force. The garments of Agripides were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">gay-hued, like those of modern Atlanteans, but were of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deep and somber brown; and they clung to his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">so closely as apparently to interfere with his walking,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to make him look disquietingly like an animated</seg><seg type="columnLine">corpse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I forgot all such irrevelant impressions the mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment that Agripides--or, rather, his living representa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive--had - uttered his first word. "Fellow members</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the National Assembly," said he, with a low bow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">328</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">while in the audience an awed silence held sway, "for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hundredth time I address you on the subject of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proposed Submergence. And for the hundredth</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I remind you that we have no choice in the mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter : it is a question of the submergence either of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the land of Atlantis or of its soul. Let me prove this</seg><seg type="columnLine">to you, Members of the Assembly; let me show you</seg><seg type="columnLine">how near the soul of Atlantis already is to submer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gence. Watch carefully as a stream of typical present-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day men and women passes by."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The speaker ceased, and from invisible corridors on</seg><seg type="columnLine">both sides of the stage came a noise as of shuffled</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, chattering voices, horns and bells and clattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheels. "By the Holy Father, if we're not back in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old U. S. A.!" muttered Stranahan so loud that</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of the audience could hear him; and he leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">so far forward that I feared he would fall over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">railing into the stage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the spectacle before us was so engrossing as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make me forget even Stranahan's absurd conduct.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Very quickly I came to agree that Atlantis before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Submergence must indeed have been hideous; I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never known anything quite so ugly as the scene we</seg><seg type="columnLine">now witnessed. From both sides of the stage a slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">procession of men and women began to file, the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">streams passing each other and trailing out in opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">directions; and the faces and figures of the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the most repulsive I had ever seen. Some were</seg><seg type="columnLine">so lean and scrawny as to remind me of walking</seg><seg type="columnLine">skeletons; others, fat and bloated, waddled along like</seg><seg type="columnLine">living caricatures with scarcely the power of self-</seg><seg type="columnLine">locomotion; and the majority had an unnaturally sal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, flushed or mottled complexion that seemed to set</seg><seg type="columnLine">them off as a species apart. And their clothes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">in accord with their appearance; they were all clad</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a drab brown or black, some with a peculiar steely</seg><seg type="columnLine">color that encircled their chins and ears, some with</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange metallic waist-bands that prevented them from</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning in any direction, some with ornamental brass</seg><seg type="columnLine">spikes that elevated the soles of their feet inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">above their heels and converted their walking into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">form of hobbling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what chiefly interested me were the faces of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. Not a few, with heavy paunches, and baggy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeble cheeks, reminded me of nothing so much as of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain bristly domestic beast; not a few others had</seg><seg type="columnLine">features grotesquely like those of baboons, bears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wolves, foxes, weasles, or tigers. And a majority</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like nothing so much as the prey of tigers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">weasels, and foxes. Their eyes had a hunted expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion, and their whole manner was one of timidity;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they seemed continually confused and frightened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to run at any sound, and yet had something of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cowed look of creatures beaten into resigned</seg><seg type="columnLine">despair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the while, as they "proceeded across the stage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they produced a perfect pandemonium of squeaks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grunts, hoots, rumblings, howlings, and snarlings, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeming quite familiar to me, others sounding like</seg><seg type="columnLine">voices of the wilderness. The acting, I' thought, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous; it was executed so perfectly that for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time I had quite forgotten it was acting at all. Hear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the uproar and looking at the dark-robed, dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torted multitude, I could not but think by contrast of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aelios and the grace and beauty that surrounded her;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I missed her even more keenly than before, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered impatiently if I should not yet see her at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pageant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At length, to my relief, the last of the uncouth mob</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone trooping off the stage, and only the tall</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure of Agripides remained. "Members of the As-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembly," resumed the statesman, after all had again</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">become quiet, "you have now had a close view of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">typical citizens. Do you not believe them more deeply</seg><seg type="columnLine">submerged than if a thousand fathoms of water rolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">above them? Or if you are not yet convinced, let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">show you these people in their normal occupations."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As though at a prearranged signal, three or four</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge instruments, with long segmented oblong belts</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving on wheels, were dragged to the center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage by half-invisible wires. I recognized these ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines as curious forms of treadmills, for on each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the belts a man had been deposited, and each man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was forcing his legs back and forth at tremendous</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, as though running in a desperate hurry. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">no matter how furiously they worked, all the men re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained in exactly the same place, for the belts slid</seg><seg type="columnLine">backward precisely as fast as their feet pressed for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Saints in heaven," opined Stranahan, with a puzzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">frown, "they'd get there just as fast if they took their</seg><seg type="columnLine">time!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a minute or two the treadmills were pulled off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stage and Agripides again briefly addressed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">audience. "My friends," said he, "I will now illustrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you another of the leading occupations of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">times."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I DO not know what rare art of stagecraft was then</seg><seg type="columnLine">applied, for as if by magic a bright bed of flowers</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang to life before us, and long-stemmed purple and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow blossoms resembling tulips and hollyhocks waved</seg><seg type="columnLine">above some retiring white-budding plant reminding me</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the violet. But I was to be disappointed if I ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected anything beautiful to follow. From one side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stage came a series of oaths, growls, curses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieks, hisses, and mutterings, gradually increasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fierceness and volume; and soon an amorphous mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of squirming, twisting, embattled men writhed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">view. I could not tell how many of them there were,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except that they were numbered by the dozen; and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not determine what they looked like, except that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were all soberly attired. But it was as if a</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm had been let loose among them; they were liter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally tumbling over one another, wrestling with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferocity of lions, snatching violently at one another's</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, legs and necks, until they seemed little more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a blur of convulsive, wildly agitated trunks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">limbs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Holy Methuselah, it's a new kind of football!" cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stranahan, excitedly, as he craned his long neck far</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward for a better view of the contest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before I had time to chide Stranahan on this</seg><seg type="columnLine">senseless outburst, I was occupied by a new observa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. The struggling men were advancing across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stage, and slowly intruding upon the flower beds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But none seemed to notice, and the pandemonium con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued until the actors were beating down the flowers</seg><seg type="columnLine">on all sides and not a hollyhock or tulip or violet re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then suddenly one of the men was thrust out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wild multitude, and lay on the ground as if dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his clothes ripped and torn, his body gashed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleeding. But no one seemed to notice him, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrieks and howls rang forth until another had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">flung aside with broken limbs, and then another, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then another. In the end only two remained standing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">both grappling desperately for a little metallic disk</seg><seg type="columnLine">that glittered a deep yellow. With bestial snarls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">screeches they wrestled over this trinket; and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">length, still wrestling, and with faces blood-red and</seg><seg type="columnLine">distorted, they tumbled, moaning, off the stage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After this exhibition there was silence for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes. I was glad when at length Agripides seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">329</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, while the clamor Increased and the buildings heaved and wavered with tho motion of tossing ships at sea, the ground beneath them gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sharp lunge downward; and like toy castles, the towers all at once collapsed . . . But scarcely had the thunder of the overthrown walls died</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, when a new and more ominous roaring came to my cars, a tumult as of Niagara or of sea-waves splashing the cliffs . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">330</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to feel that his audience was ready for a change of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mood, and again took the center of the stage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Members of the -National Assembly," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you have now observed modern life in two of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">more common phases. You will find something no less</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar in the third phase, which I am about to pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time a gigantic clattering black machine was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolled on to the stage by some unseen power, its in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">numerable wheels and belts and chains in rapid mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, some of them moving so swiftly as to look like</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirring shadows. But it was not the speed or smooth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of its action that made the mechanism remark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able: all about its side, in a long, even row, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">scores of grime-faced and sooty men, their feet clamped</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground by iron vises, their arms fastened by</seg><seg type="columnLine">long rods to the wheels above. And all the while those</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods were moving, moving with rhythmic, clock-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">regularity, moving unceasingly up and down, pulling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arms of the men with them, first the right arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then the left, then again the right and then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, as though they had done so for all eternity and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would continue to do so for all eternity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The devil take me," muttered Stranahan, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have his way, "It ain't the men that work the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chines! It's the machines that work the men!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am afraid that Stranahan's remarks' diverted my</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention and made me miss part of the performance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for when next I turned my eyes to the stage, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene was much changed. A great claw-like steel de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vice was reaching out from the interior of the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine, seizing one of the men, wrenching him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his position as though he had been a misplaced screw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and casting him bleeding to the floor. And while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay there moaning and helpless, a clamor of shouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">was heard from off stage, and a score of tattered men</seg><seg type="columnLine">came rushing in and threw themselves down before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine as if in reverence. And, as though en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dowed with intelligence, the machine seemed to hear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it reached out the same great claw-like hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched one of the men at random, and thrust him</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the place of the rejected one. And now the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms of the newcomer began to work up and down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and down unremittingly, accompanying the steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods in the same even and automatic fashion as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms of his predecessor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next feature on the program was a long oration</seg><seg type="columnLine">delivered in Agripides' most celebrated words; fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowing which the actor prepared the way for the cli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">max by a few explanatory comments. "Members of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the National Assembly," said he, still using phrases</seg><seg type="columnLine">first uttered three thousand years before, "I wish you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look carefully at- Axios, which, as you know, is one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the leading commercial cities of our age. First</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze upon its domes and towers as they are now</seg><seg type="columnLine">familiar to you; then behold them as they will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the unleashed waters of the Atlantic come sweep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing across them; then open your eyes wide for a fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of our land in the golden era after the Sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mergence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EVEN as the last words were uttered, my atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was drawn to the huge amorphous mass which</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay cloaked in white linen at one side of the stage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Invisible hands seemed to take hold of the covering;</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly it was lifted into the air, then slowly pulled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one side and out of sight. At first I could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">gape in astonishment--the strangest of all conceivable</seg><seg type="columnLine">things was being unbared! Distinctly I was reminded</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the paintings I had seen in various of the halls of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Archeon--that which stared before me was a city in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">miniature, but a city such as I would have expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">no Atlantean to conceive. Not the faintest resem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blance did it bear to this undersea realm of statue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like temples and many-columned palaces; rather, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was like a city of the modern world. Row upon un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bending row of box-like edifices, apparently of granite</seg><seg type="columnLine">or brick, loomed at irregular heights and with flat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ungarnished roofs; tier after tier of little oblong win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows looked out from the smoke-stained sides of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">towers; slender defiles, so narrow that they reminded</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of light-wells, separated the opposing ranks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">masonry; and at the base of these dreary gray pits</seg><seg type="columnLine">swarmed masses of dark-robed men and women,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jammed together so compactly that one wondered if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were not standing on each other's toes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By the Blessed Mother, if it ain't little old New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York!" stuttered Stranahan, nudging me knowingly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as he spoke, I was startled by a noise as of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thunder clap. And the next instant, the midget</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and women scattered pellmell, vanishing through</seg><seg type="columnLine">little openings in the walls. Meanwhile the thunder</seg><seg type="columnLine">claps continued, loud-rumbling and resonant, one crash</seg><seg type="columnLine">pealing and reverberating before the echoes of the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">had died away; and miniature lightnings darted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flared from the great greenish vault above. As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">display proceeded, it grew constantly brighter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more vivid; and I was wondering what the sequel</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be, when suddenly there came a blast so loud</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I clapped my hands to my ears in terror. Simul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneously a brilliant blade of light seemed to cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">dagger-like through the buildings, wrapping them</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentarily in a sheet of flame; the walls seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be heaving and trembling as though in an earth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quake's claws, and there came to my ears a rattling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crashing as of falling masonry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, while the clamor increased and the buildings</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaved and wavered with the motion of tossing ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">at sea, the ground beneath them gave a sharp lunge</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward; and like toy castles, the towers all at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">collapsed, some falling over their neighbors in crash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing confusion, some shaken into great dusty piles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mortar and stone, some stripped of their walls yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">still standing with gaunt contorted ribs of steel, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">bursting into flame that glared and crackled fiendishly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and poured out dense, black spirals of smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But scarcely had the thunder of the overthrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls died down when a new and more ominous roar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing came to my ears, a tumult as of Niagara or of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea-waves splashing the cliffs. Out of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthen basin into which the ruined city had subsided,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there issued a foaming confusion of waters, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">a reservoir had burst its dam; and from all sides a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white-flecked torrent came plunging down upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrecked towers, struggling and storming above their</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower stories as if to wash them utterly away. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">it seemed that they were to have their will, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">towers were sinking, visibly sinking beneath the waves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heap after gigantic heap of debris dipped its head into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waters and was lost to view; edifice after loom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing edifice, dismantled and battered, was engulfed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the insatiable flood. And now the fires no longer</seg><seg type="columnLine">burned and the smoke no longer soared; now only two</seg><seg type="columnLine">or three tortured steel columns reached out of the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">different sea; now only one was left, one lean and</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooked metallic shaft like the agonized clutching hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a drowning man. But soon even this had slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from view, and the frotliy-tongued, deep-blue waters</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave no sign that a city had ever barred their path.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And as the last trace of old Atlantis vanished, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grayness as of twilight suffused the scene; the golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights became dim, and dimmer still, until they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">331</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fluttered out altogether, and blackness blotted all</seg><seg type="columnLine">things from our gaze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as we sat there spellbound in the dark, feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">like men who had beheld the end of all things, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came an airy change to break the dreariness of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">mood. From far, far away, apparently whole worlds</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, issued a faint tinkling music, more like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">song of elves than of any mortal being. It was half</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the loveliness that one hears in dreams, and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than half like the remote ghostly melodies borne to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one across the wind; but gradually it grew nearer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gradually louder and more distinct, although its</seg><seg type="columnLine">ethereal and fairy-like quality still remained. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">length I recognized that it proceeded from a chorus</seg><seg type="columnLine">of voices, a wonderfully sweet womanly chorus whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">members may have been human but who seemed little</seg><seg type="columnLine">less than angelic. For it was with a divine exaltation</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they sang, and their tones were the tones of im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mortal sweetness and hope, and they seemed to assure</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that all was well with the world and with life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that beauty and happiness must triumph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the singing continued, the darkness was gradu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally dispersed; yet the great orb above did not resume</seg><seg type="columnLine">the full brightness of the Atlantean day, but remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">subdued to a rose-tinged twilight glow. And in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">twilight a troop of shimmering-gowned dancing maid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ens appeared, swinging from side to side with superbly</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmonious movements of arm and waist and ankle</seg><seg type="columnLine">until they seemed not so much individual dancers as</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts of the eternal rhythm of the universe. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether the singing proceeded from them or from per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sons unseen was more than I could judge; for just</seg><seg type="columnLine">then my eye was caught by the leader of the dancers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my thoughts were as if paralyzed. As she glided from</seg><seg type="columnLine">side to side with movements like music, she smiled a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloriously sweet smile; and that smile seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent full upon me, though here my imagination may</seg><seg type="columnLine">have borne false reports. But with furiously thump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing heart and a surging of something dangerously like</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenderness, I realized that Aelios had kept her promise</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see me at the pageant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVI</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">An Official Summons</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THREE or four days after the pageant, I was sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised to receive a visitor in the shape of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious-looking gray old man whom I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember ever having seen before. In his hand he</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore a little blue-sealed parchment scroll, on which my</seg><seg type="columnLine">name had been inscribed in the native language; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his grave manner, and particularly by the signifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cant way in which he held the document, I feared that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mission might prove of ominous importance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My first impression was that I had unwittingly vio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated some local law, and was being summoned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">court to answer for the crime. But this fear was</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly dissipated. "I congratulate you, young man,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said my visitor, having determined that I was the per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son he sought. "This is an occasion such as comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">but once in a lifetime." And with a sedate and defer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ential air, and apparently not surmising that the na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of his mission was still a mystery to me, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed the little document to me; following which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">congratulated me again, and solemnly bowed his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I now suspected that I was either the recipient of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some high honor or the appointee to some responsible</seg><seg type="columnLine">office. It is no wonder, accordingly, that my fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">trembled when I ripped open the blue seal, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my eagerness I almost tore the parchment as well.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But again my; expectations were to prove ill-founded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The message turned out to be very brief; and, far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from providing cause either for exultation or dismay,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it served merely to puzzle me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To the respected Anson Harkness," ran the words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were handsomely formed in the native script,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"the Committee on Selective Assignments wishes to</seg><seg type="columnLine">announce that it is ready for the hearings and exami-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nations in his case. If he will therefore be so kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to present himself at the Committee offices any noon</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the next ten days, he may be assured that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigations will be carried out with a minimum of</seg><seg type="columnLine">delay and a decision promptly rendered."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that was all, except for the signature of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Head of the Committee! Not a word as to what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Selective Assignments might be! Not a word as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nature of the "hearings and examinations!" Time</seg><seg type="columnLine">after time I re-read this queer message, scrutinizing it</seg><seg type="columnLine">until I had memorized it in its entirety; but the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">I read the more perplexed I became, and I could almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe myself the target of some practical joker. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was to be investigated? And what decision was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be reached? Was it that my conduct was thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">improper and was to be reviewed? That I was con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered too scornful of local customs, or too friendly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aelios? Or--judging from the congratulatory man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner of the gray-haired one--was I somehow deemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthy of reward, possibly through the connivance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aelios? Or was I to be examined as prize scholars</seg><seg type="columnLine">are sometimes examined before being granted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scholarship?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To confess the truth, none of these possibilities ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared very credible to me. But I could think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing more plausible, and at length was forced to</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognize that the mystery was too deep for my pene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tration. The only reasonable course would be to con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sult one of the natives, who could doubtless answer</seg><seg type="columnLine">all my questions without any trouble. And since I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was acquainted with only one of the natives besides</seg><seg type="columnLine">my tutor, and since it would give me particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure to consult that one, I decided that, if possible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I should refer the baffling document to Aelios.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But how to isolate Aelios long enough for a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation was in itself a problem. After some thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, I conceived an idea which seemed promising:</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I could determine where Aelios lived and then pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">her a visit, I might solve the mystery of the Selective</seg><seg type="columnLine">Assignments at the same time as I made possible a</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer intimacy with Aelios herself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet it was only by a severe effort that I found the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">courage to carry out my plans - to follow Aelios</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">one afternoon after the conclusion of her day's in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction. Through innumerable curving lanes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">avenues I trailed her and her fellow tutors, pressing</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the columns and the walls of the building,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a detective tracking his prey. At length, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we seemed to be approaching the outskirts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, Aelios waved a pleasant farewell to her com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions, and started off alone down a little path bor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered by a deep-red geranium-like flower. Thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">this to be my opportunity, I hastened my footsteps;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but before I could overtake her she had reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the path, and, quite oblivious of my approach,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had entered the arching doorway of a house--or, should</seg><seg type="columnLine">I call it a palace?--with curving convex walls of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">color of pearl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For several minutes I stood wavering without. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was in half-timid hesitancy that at last I forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">my feet to the threshold and urged my hands to rap</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the violet stained-glass panels of the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was but a minute before the sound of approach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing footsteps notified me that I had not knocked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">vain. But in that minute I was swept by wild hope3</seg><seg type="columnLine">332</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and still wilder torments and regrets. Would it be</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aelios herself that answered me? Or would it be</seg><seg type="columnLine">some member of her family, possibly her mother or</seg><seg type="columnLine">father, or else a sister almost as charming as herself?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, if so, what should I say? and on what business</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretend to seek a conference with Aelios?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While I was wrapped in such thoughts, the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung open, and I found myself face to face--not with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aelios, nor with her mother or father, nor with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sister of hers! But a young man of perhaps twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five, broad-browed and sparkling-eyed like most of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlanteans, stood looking inquiringly out at me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is this--is this where Aelios lives?" I gasped, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">embarrassment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, Aelios lives here," he returned, in matter-of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact tones. And then, with a winning smile, "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">would like to see her?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I admitted that he had surmised correctly, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">relieved to be admitted into the house without further</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioning. Having passed through a broad hallway</seg><seg type="columnLine">or vestibule illumined by large, swinging orange-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored lamps, we entered a daintily tapestried sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">room featured by lanterns of pale blue. The young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man bade me be seated on the seaweed-decorated sofa,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then left me momentarily to myself; and in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">brief snatch of solitude I found myself assailed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">storms of jealous questions. Who was the young man?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And in what relationship did he stand to Aelios?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Was he perchance some suitor of hers? Or was he</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely her brother? Or was it possible--oh, unspeak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able thought!--that she was already married, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was her husband?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the latter reflection I experienced in advance all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pangs of unsuccessful love. My head swam with</seg><seg type="columnLine">senseless fury; I was weighed down with anticipatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">despair, and saw myself the victim of hopes that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could never be fulfilled. I had just reached the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est point of my broodings, and was just telling myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of course I could never attract so admirable a</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman as Aelios, when I heard a well known mel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">odious voice murmuring, "What is the matter today,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend? What are you so depressed about?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RECALLED from my dejection as from a bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">dream, I sprang up to take the hand of Aelios,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was smiling as graciously as though my visit had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been expected and even welcomed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what I next said I cannot recall. No doubt it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was some bit of nonsense not worth repeating; indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would perhaps have been some bit of sentimental</seg><seg type="columnLine">nonsense, had I not recalled the existence of the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known young man. But since I was too diffident to</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquire who he might be, and since the thought of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained with me in spite of Aelios' kindness, I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">frained from all sentimental advances in this, our first</seg><seg type="columnLine">private meeting. It is true, that whenever her blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes flashed, they drew me toward her like twin mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nets; it is true, that whenever she smiled, her inex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressibly sweet smile, I yearned to dash down all</seg><seg type="columnLine">barriers in one long fervent confession; yet I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thankful even to be able to sit side by side with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly talking. In the wide years that separate me</seg><seg type="columnLine">now from that brief enchanted interview, my memory</seg><seg type="columnLine">has lost track of what she said, it merely retains how</seg><seg type="columnLine">she said it; I can recall the sparMing eagerness with</seg><seg type="columnLine">which her words poured forth, like the wavelets of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid crystal stream; I can recapture the sage nodding</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tossing of her head, the ripples of deep feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">that passed and repassed on her mobile countenance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the luminesence as from some inner sun that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">make her whole face shine as she uttered some rare</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit of wit or fancy. But I do not even know the sub-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ject of our discussion, except that it was a theme</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested by her and that it was impersonal; I only</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that it was she who did most of the talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I looked on in awed worship, and that either</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was blind to my reverence for her or else chose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ignore it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not until I rose to leave that my thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverted to the subject which had brought me to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aelios. And then, since the hour was late and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mood was no longer prosaic, I did not choose to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cuss that topic long. I merely showed Aelios the</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter, which she glanced at briefly and with a broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile; then she surprised me by congratulating me</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as the gray-haired bearer of the message had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But she was exceedingly chary of information. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will go to the Committee offices," she suggested,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"the whole matter will be made much clearer to you</seg><seg type="columnLine">than I could make it." And, after directing me where</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find the offices, she added, "I'd advise you to waste</seg><seg type="columnLine">no time, or else you may lose your turn and have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait another half year. You know, that's what hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened once to my cousin Argol, who met you at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door just before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Genuinely gratified that my doubts about Cousin</seg><seg type="columnLine">Argol had been dispersed, I thanked Aelios and turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave. My heart pattered happily when I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">her accompanying me to the outer door; and I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">an actual thrill of joy when she pressed her little hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmly in my great one, and murmured, in tones that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could leave no doubt of her sincerity, "Come' again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my friend. Come whenever you wish some one to talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">with. I shall always be glad to see you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And it was with a glow of triumph that I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself walking down the flower-bordered walk toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main avenue. Aelios was more friendly than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had had any reason to expect!--her company was even</seg><seg type="columnLine">more charming than I had imagined! Considering all</seg><seg type="columnLine">things, I had every cause to be thankful, and who</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew but that some day-- But here my thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached a dazzling veil beyond which I would not allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to penetrate, for there were still heights that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not mount even in my most daring fancies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVII</seg><seg type="columnLine">The High Initiation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PROMPTLY at noon the following day I presented</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself before the Committee on Selective As-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signments. The offices, which I found without</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty, were located on the lower floor of an impos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing blue-tinted granite edifice; and the Committee itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupied a hall reminding me vaguely of a court-room,'</seg><seg type="columnLine">except that its ornamental columns and busts and</seg><seg type="columnLine">statues were unparalleled in any court-room I had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. Before a long marble railing sat about fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and women, some old but several conspicuously</seg><seg type="columnLine">young. All were perched on cushioned marble seats</seg><seg type="columnLine">before little marble pedestals or writing stands, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their rear were cases lined with rows of parchment-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound volumes that lent the place a scholarly dignity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In front of them, across the railing, were half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dozen tiers of blue stone benches; and on each of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">benches stood a huge pile of books, as though the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectators were expected to make use of their time</seg><seg type="columnLine">during any delay in the proceedings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I was not admitted at once into this great hall.</seg><seg type="columnLine">First I was escorted into a small anteroom, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">three Atlanteans--two youths of about twenty, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl of the same age--were seated studiously reading.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From a little parchment document which each car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried, I felt sure that they were here on a mission</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">333</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Some of the trees had branches symmetrically woven into the likenesses of great cobwebs, and from those cobwebs at regular intervals dangled</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusters of grape-like fruits; other trees were cactus-like and leafless; and some of the shrubs and creepers bore pods resembling those of beans</seg><seg type="columnLine">and peas, cxcopt that they were over a foot in length.

For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment I merely stared at them impatiently; then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turning to ispect the room, I was delighted to observe</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pile of little books on a reed stand in one corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER a single curious glance, I began examining</seg><seg type="columnLine">these volumes with hungry interest. Their very</seg><seg type="columnLine">titles proved alluring, far more alluring than anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">printed I had yet seen in Atlantis, with the exception</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the lost Homeric masterpiece. Some were works</seg><seg type="columnLine">of information dealing with subjects so varied as</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Post-Submergence Mural Art," "The Rise of Govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment by Selection," "The Stimulation of Plant Life by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Artificial Sunlight," "History of the Abolition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crime," or "History of the Decline of the Upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">World"; others were essays on such rare topics as</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The Cultivation of Genius," "Is Altruism One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Human Instincts?" and "How Atlantis Found the</seg><seg type="columnLine">World by Losing It"; still others were works of liter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ature, and, though I had no time to observe them</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully, I saw that they included an epic poem on</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Agripides," a volume of lyrics by some unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">writer of two thousand years ago as well as selections</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a dozen lyricists of the present, a poetic drama</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently designed for performance at the annual cele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bration of the Submergence, several novels and a col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lection of stories, and a romance of the far future</seg><seg type="columnLine">entitled "Super-Art."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what particularly engaged my attention was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a genial little satire known as "The Prisoner." This</seg><seg type="columnLine">story, which was written in a crisp and simple style</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I found delightful, recounted how an Atlantean</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a thousand years before had been sentenced, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the penalty for his sins, to pass his remaining years</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the upper world. Having been sent above seas in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little water-tight craft propelled by intra-atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines, he had set about to seek his fortune in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">new surroundings; and, finding that the way to win</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinction was to accumulate much gold, he applied</seg><seg type="columnLine">his superior Atlantean wits so well that in a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he became fabulously wealthy. But, after at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining what was reputed to be success, he discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his wealth meant nothing to him; he was hungry</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the art and the beauty of Atlantis, without which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world seemed barbarous and empty. Even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could have purchased any treasure or luxury on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, he took to morbid repining; he brooded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brooded until he went completely out of his wits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which were finally restored to him when the Atlan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teans took pity and decided to let him return. And so</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poor man went back to his native land, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">first forfeited his riches; and this was the last case</seg><seg type="columnLine">of insanity even known among the Atlanteans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had just completed this little story when I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">roused to reality by hearing a strange voice sonorously</seg><seg type="columnLine">pronouncing my name. Looking up, I saw a lavender-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gowned man motioning me toward the main Committee</seg><seg type="columnLine">Room; and I observed with surprise that the youths</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the girl had disappeared while I was absorbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my book.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I found the central hall empty except for the fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and women sedately seated behind the railing;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but at sight of these grave individuals I felt my mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">givings returning, and wished that I could have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">anywhere else in the universe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is Anson Harkness, is it not?" rang forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">the high-pitched and yet not unpleasant voice of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged man whose proximity to the railing indicated that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was the head of the Committee. And after I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured him that I was the person designated, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Head Member continued, earnestly and yet not so men-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">acingly as I had expected, "Be seated, Anson Hark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. It is an important matter that brings you here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I believe that, in your case, more than the usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of time and thought will be necessary before</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can reach a decision."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Head Member paused, cleared his throat, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly proceeded, "I trust that you will co-operate</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us to the best of your ability, for only so can</seg><seg type="columnLine">we expect satisfactory results. Just as the average</seg><seg type="columnLine">man is betrothed but once in his life, so he appears</seg><seg type="columnLine">but once before this Committee; and since, as in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case of a betrothal, much may depend upon the proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">choice--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I beg your pardon, sir," I interrupted, unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">endure these long-winded sentences that only added to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my confusion, "Would you mind telling me why I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">here? As yet I haven't the faintest idea."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Head Member peered at me in mild surprise;</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fourteen associates darted inquiring looks at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">another.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, yes, that is a proper question," he resumed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blandly. "I had forgotten: you are a foreigner, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">are unacquainted with our ways. You will under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand, of course that foreigners were so totally un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known before your coming that the necessity for ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">planation had not occurred to me. However, the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter can be made clear in a few words. You are</seg><seg type="columnLine">summoned for what is known as the High Initiation--</seg><seg type="columnLine">in other words, this should be the happiest day of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your life, since you are now regarded as having</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached maturity and so may set forth upon your</seg><seg type="columnLine">career of service to the State."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAVING been a voter in the United States for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past eleven years, I was not flattered to be told</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had reached maturity. None the less, I held</seg><seg type="columnLine">my tongue, and listened patiently as the Head Member</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The government tutor who has been instructing</seg><seg type="columnLine">you," he pursued, "has reported that you have at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">an elementary knowledge of our language and cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toms, and suggests that you be assigned at once to</seg><seg type="columnLine">service. Acting upon his recommendation, we intend</seg><seg type="columnLine">to promote you to duties that accord as nearly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible with your desires and capabilities. But first</seg><seg type="columnLine">we must say a word as to the methods in vogue in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our land. Ever since the great social revolution which</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred in the second century after the submergence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and which for a time threatened to engulf us in chaos,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have employed what is known as the Beehive Sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem of labor--which means that every citizen is re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired to perform a certain minimum amount of</seg><seg type="columnLine">work for the State in order to accomplish those tasks</seg><seg type="columnLine">indispensable for our continued existence. Fortun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately, the utilization of intra-atomic energy and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elimination of waste and of duplication of effort have</seg><seg type="columnLine">reduced the essential work to one-tenth of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought necessary before the Submergence; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">average citizen now labors not more than an hour and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a half or two hours a day. There have, indeed, been</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasional men and women so enamored of their em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ployment as to insist on working four or five hours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but such excessive application is not encouraged, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is believed to overcast the mind and blunt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">esthetic sensibilities."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then for heaven's sake," I burst forth, thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">this country to be wholly without "push" and energy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"What do people here do with their time? If they</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't work, they must be simply bored to "cTeath!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Head Member regarded me with a tolerant</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile, as one might regard a lunatic â nfco makes some</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmless remark.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">335</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is where you misunderstand the meaning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the word work," he explained, with something of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner of a schoolmaster to a backward pupil. "Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">people do work, and work diligently indeed, and some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times work many hours a day--but not on those barren</seg><seg type="columnLine">practical duties to which they are assigned, and which</seg><seg type="columnLine">are necessary merely in order that the community may</seg><seg type="columnLine">exist. As soon as any man or woman has passed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">period of elementary instruction and is assigned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">service by this Committee, he finds himself in posses-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of many leisure hours a day--and those hours of</seg><seg type="columnLine">leisure constitute the important part of his life, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is on their account that he is to be congratulated</seg><seg type="columnLine">on reaching maturity. For now he may have the op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portunity both for self-expression and for the better</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of service to the State; he may devote himself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">study, research or creation in any field that suits his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancy (there is absolutely no restriction in this re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gard, although every one is expected to apply himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">to some definite pursuit). One, for example, may elect</seg><seg type="columnLine">to paint landscapes; a second to conduct some elaborate</seg><seg type="columnLine">philosophic inquiry; a third to write poetry; a fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">to investigate the ways of marine animals; a fifth to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be an actor, or a musical virtuoso, or the author of</seg><seg type="columnLine">historical essays, or a critic of architecture, or a de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signer of fine tapestries."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what if one finds nothing at all that he can</seg><seg type="columnLine">do?" I inquired, wondering how on earth I could fit</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself into this superior scheme of things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, but one must find something!" declared the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Head Member, while his colleagues eyed one another</seg><seg type="columnLine">with looks implying that I was really too naive for belief.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It would be a disgrace to do nothing at all except</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's practical duties. It would mean that one had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a failure in life; that one's existence had added</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to the world. Why, there isn't more than one</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a case a year--and then it's usually found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poor sufferer has been the victim of some acci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent, which blunted his mental faculties."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Head Member paused; and while I had horrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">visions of myself as the first failure in a year, one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the members just to the rear of the Head Member</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned over and whispered something into his ear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just what he said I could not catch, but the evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect was to hasten proceedings, for the chief official</seg><seg type="columnLine">promptly turned to me, and, with unwonted directness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued, "Well, now that we have made all the neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary explanations, let us get down to the actual as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signment. Just what sort of work do you think you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would prefer, young man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having no reason to believe that I would prefer any</seg><seg type="columnLine">work at all, I did nothing but gape blankly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am surprised at your hesitancy," that sedate indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vidual at length continued, blandly. "There is so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much for you to do that I should think you would</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply overwhelm us with suggestions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT I fear that I continued to do nothing but look</seg><seg type="columnLine">blank. "You will pardon me," I pleaded, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the suspense had become embarrassing, "if I leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestions to you. I really know so little about At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantis that I couldn't possibly choose wisely."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True, you do know little about Atlantis," coincided</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Head Member, with a smile. "But there is some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about which you undoubtedly know a great deal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and about which we Atlanteans know nothing at all."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You mean--my own country?" I demanded, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the members of the Committee leaned forward with</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested glances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course--your own country, and the upper world</seg><seg type="columnLine">in general," the Head Member nodded, approvingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"You must remember, our latest news of your world</seg><seg type="columnLine">was received some three thousand years ago. Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a leisurely people like us, that is a long while. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot imagine how curious we are as to all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">has happened since."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And that's what you want me to tell you?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Naturally. We know, to be sure, that no one man</seg><seg type="columnLine">could begin to tell us everything, but at least we'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to learn the general outline of events. And so</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are thinking of appointing you Official Historian</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Upper World."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Official Historian of the Upper World!" I repeated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like one in a daze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. Why not? Judging from the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you've made quicker progress in our language than</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of your companions, we think you would perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">be better qualified for the office."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I haven't specialized in history--" I started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">plead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're more interested in general movements than</seg><seg type="columnLine">in particular incidents," explained the Head Member.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The sort of knowledge that any educated man might</seg><seg type="columnLine">give us, is what we want.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You certainly are not unacquainted with the present</seg><seg type="columnLine">civilization up above, are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, not altogether," I was forced to acknowledge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And you've been taught a reasonable amount about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the past, have you not?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've taken a number of history courses at college,</seg><seg type="columnLine">if that's what you mean."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Excellent! Excellent!" And the Head Member</seg><seg type="columnLine">beamed upon me ingratiatingly. "Then the rest should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a mere matter of study and application. You don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">object to the appointment, do you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I confessed that I did not object.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Whereupon, turning to his associates, he inquired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Do you all approve of the appointment of Anson</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harkness as Official Historian of the Upper World?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Since there was no dissent among the Committee</seg><seg type="columnLine">members, my life-work was apparently settled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But just what do you expect me to do?" I queried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat doubtfully, after my appointment had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">confirmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are to write a history of the upper world, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course," explained the Head Member, surprised that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should ask the obvious. "How you are to proceed</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be for you to decide; but you must remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this will be your assigned work, to which you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected to devote not less than two hours a day. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might point out, moreover, that yours is one of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">rare cases where the assigned work is so important</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you might do well to combine it with your op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional work, and so dedicate your time exclusively to</seg><seg type="columnLine">your duties as historian."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps that would be the best way," I agreed, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it struck me that the task before me would require</seg><seg type="columnLine">all my energies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at that juncture an important question occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me. I did not wish to seem too commercial; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was evident that the examiners had overlooked some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing essential. "Now as to the practical returns," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventured, mildly. "I know, of course, that I cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect to be paid very much--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To be paid?" repeated four or five of the Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mittee members all at once, with looks of such sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement that I knew that I had blundered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, then perhaps I must show you some results</seg><seg type="columnLine">first?" I suggested, perceiving no other alternative.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For two or three seconds there was silence--an</seg><seg type="columnLine">ominous, puzzling silence which made me realize that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had given deep offense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Young man," the Head Member at length broke ^</seg><seg type="columnLine">336</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">forth, severely, "I fear that you are under a grave</seg><seg type="columnLine">misapprehension. "But possibly you are not wholly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame, for it may be that your own country still labors</seg><seg type="columnLine">under those primitive social arrangements which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlanteans abolished three thousand years ago. Know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, that there is no such thing as payment in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">land. There is no money; there is no medium of</seg><seg type="columnLine">exchange. You do your work, and in return receive</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the necessaries of life; your meals are brought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you by State employees, just as they have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought to you thus far; you are also lodged by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">State, clothed by the State, educated by the State; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">State works of art are at your disposal, you are ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted freely to all State entertainments, and are</seg><seg type="columnLine">even granted periodic vacations to break the monotony</seg><seg type="columnLine">of existence. What more could any man desire?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No more, of course," I conceded, feeling utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed. _</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well, then," said the official, with an indulgent</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile that made me feel ridiculous. "Now there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one more matter to be decided. How would you</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to set out on your travels the day after to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What travels?" I gasped, wondering what-on earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could mean.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, evidently you haven't heard about that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">either!" remarked the Head Member, noting my sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise. "You see, every Atlantean, upon receiving his</seg><seg type="columnLine">assignment and before taking up his duties, is ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected to make a tour of the country, so as to ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quaint himself with it at first hand. Otherwise, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">could he expect to voice himself intelligently on na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tional affairs?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having nothing to say in reply, I merely gaped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">remained silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ordinarily, this journey requires about a month,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">my informer proceeded. "The trip is made entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">on foot, so that one may observe the country thorough-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. There is a party leaving in two days--perhaps you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would like to join them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well," I assented. And, after being advised</seg><seg type="columnLine">regarding a few details of the trip and then notified</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my dismissal, I went away feeling more puzzled than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, for I could not believe that Atlantis could show</seg><seg type="columnLine">me anything more marvelous than it had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XVIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Journey Commences</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TWO days later I set out on what was to prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most extraordinary excursion of my life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arriving early in the morning at the appointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting place--an open, flower-bordered "circle" or</seg><seg type="columnLine">park near the western end of the town--I was greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a score of eager young men and women, who intro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced themselves as my traveling companions. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all in an excited, highly animated condition, chat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting and jesting continually, moving about restlessly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gay with the gaiety of high expectations; and they all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without exception, were conspicuously and vividly</seg><seg type="columnLine">youthful, for their ages must have varied between</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighteen and twenty-one. At the same time, they re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembled their fellow Atlanteans in that they looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">utterly wholesome and unworldly, and had the grace</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beauty of persons whose lives have been unstained</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whose minds untarnished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was just wondering whether these attractive crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures were to be my sole companions, when I was sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised by the sight of four newcomers--two men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">two women of somewhat maturer years than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">others. At the moment of their arrival they were sur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> rounded so enthusiastically by the members of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">party that I had not a chance for a clear glimpse of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them; but even a partial glimpse was enough to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">me stop short with a gasp of delight--among their</seg><seg type="columnLine">number I thought I saw the sparkling blue eyes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aelios! At first I was not sure; but with fast-throb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing heart I pressed forward, and to my inexpressible</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy found that I had not been mistaken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aelios!" I cried, as soon as I could manage to</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw her to one side. "Aelios--what are you doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She smiled her bewilderingly sweet smile, but did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not choose to answer directly. "What are you doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">here?" she countered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, you should know without asking," I reminded</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. "Didn't I show you my summons from the Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mittee on Selective Assignments?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I remember," she murmured. "Only, I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know you would set out on- your travels so soon. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm really very glad. Now you'll be a full-fledged</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizen of Atlantis!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But are you going with us, Aelios? Are you going,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too?" I asked, still unable to credit my good fortune.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I am going." And, observing how quizzically</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was regarding her, she continued, "You see, three</seg><seg type="columnLine">or four tutors are assigned to each of the traveling</seg><seg type="columnLine">parties, for we have made the journey before, and are</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to explain the sights along the way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how can you leave so suddenly?" I questioned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembering Stranahan's daily lessons. "How about--</seg><seg type="columnLine">how about the work you were doing here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, I am excused, of course, until my return. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">other tutor is substituted for me, and everything goes</seg><seg type="columnLine">along smoothly enough with my students."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Their loss is our good fortune," said I, quite truth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully; and Aelios acknowledged the compliment with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gracious bow, and then smilingly rejoined the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">tutors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A few minutes later we were under way. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">crossed the Salty River on a long bridge overarched</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a crystal arcade and lined with friezes repre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">senting mythological scenes; then on the northern</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank, we followed a little winding lane westward at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the base of the marble palaces and towers. Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">many minutes, we approached the borders of the city;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when at length we passed into the open country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my companions experienced a rare burst of high spirits.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some gave expression to their feelings by low, soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">cries of joy; some capered, romped and laughed mer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rily along the way; some engaged in loud-pitched and</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthusiastic discussions; but all looked carefree and</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy indeed; and I could not help being infected with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their gay mood. I experienced nothing of the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">straint that might have been only natural, for my</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions seemed to accept me frankly as one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and in consequence I felt hardly out of place.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before long I was chatting with several of the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">men as volubly as though I had known them all their</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of Aelios I caught no more than a glimpse on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">first day. She seemed to be absorbed in her conversa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions with the other tutors; and an occasional smiling</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance in my direction was all that she would vouch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe me. But I was happy merely to know that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was near, and was convinced that succeeding days</seg><seg type="columnLine">would offer opportunities to strengthen our friendship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And at the same time I was so well occupied that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had little leisure for thinking of anybody in particular.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To one who has never been underseas and gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the landscapes of that incredible world, it will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible to convey any idea of the enthusiasm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wonder I felt. Already I had beheld marvels in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">337</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantis, marvels sufficient to bewilder the most auda-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious imagination; but that which I now observed was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so unique as momentarily to overshadow even my pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vious discoveries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR the first hour after leaving the city we pursued</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little path that ran almost in a straight line</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the banks of the Salty River. Opposite us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the stream, stretched the long, low contours of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the colonnades and temples I had inspected soon after</seg><seg type="columnLine">arriving in Atlantis; and at our feet the waters shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly by, with gentle swishing and murmuring, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">green-gray expanse several hundred yards across, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">differing from all other rivers I had ever beheld in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was of the same width at all points and flowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">dn a straight and orderly manner without any twists,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns or meanderings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this, of course, I had already observed; and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">first surprises were not to come until at length the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road bent abruptly northward away from the river and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we entered what was for me a virgin territory. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">we advanced, the vegetation became denser and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious; tall reeds, bushes and trees began to cluster</seg><seg type="columnLine">about us until I had the impression of being lost in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a jungle. But it was a jungle such as no explorer has</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever viewed in the wilds of Africa, New Guinea, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brazil, for the plants were so fantastic that even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange undersea vegetation I had already beheld</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed commonplace by comparison. Here, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time, the trees were of a vivid green, and a nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal foliage was abundant; yet there was so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">which looked abnormal that I could only stare and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stare in amazement. Some of the trees had branches</seg><seg type="columnLine">symmetrically woven into the likenesses of great cob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">webs, and from those cobwebs at regular intervals</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangled clusters of grape-like fruits; other trees were</seg><seg type="columnLine">cactus-like and leafless, with huge round protuberances</seg><seg type="columnLine">at regular intervals along their spiny boles; still others</seg><seg type="columnLine">;were almost concealed amid thick meshes of vines, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">were adorned with multicolored cup-shaped blossoms</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger than a man's head, or dominated by scores of</seg><seg type="columnLine">succulent-looking stalks like gigantic asparagus. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">again some were little more than great rounded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">compressed masses of leafage, reminding me of ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot cabbages; and some would have struck me as</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing more than ordinary mushrooms, had they not</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached as high as my waist; and some of the shrubs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and creepers bore pods resembling those of beans and</seg><seg type="columnLine">peas, except that they were over a foot in length. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most conspicuous fact about this strange assem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blage of plants was that the vast majority seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be fruit-bearing; and on all sides one could observe a</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitude of green fruits of all sizes and shapes, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as a profusion of the ripening and ripe product,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of it small as cherries and some large as water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">melons, some pale green and some gaudy red, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">lemon-hued and some a modest pink and some a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">purple, but all striking one by a contrast and a variety</seg><seg type="columnLine">as pleasing to the eye as it was extraordinary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we entered this peculiar jungle-like region, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted a marked change in the atmosphere. For the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time, I became aware that there could be such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing as climate in Atlantis: the air was growing dank</seg><seg type="columnLine">and overheated, and I had the impression of having</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the tropics. And simultaneously I observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">an increase of light that for the moment dazzled me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I felt as if a torrid sun were burning directly above.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet the source of the added warmth and illumination</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in no way a mystery: brilliant white lamps had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been placed at intervals along the great roof-supporting</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinted columns, glaring down upon the foliage like</seg><seg type="columnLine">miniature suns, and combining with the larger golden</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> orbs to lend the scene a dream-like and unearthly</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before long I noted that the vegetation was inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rupted every few hundred yards by a ditch from five</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ten feet across and filled to the brim with sluggish</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown water. Had not these trenches invariably been</seg><seg type="columnLine">of even width and geometrical straightness, I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have mistaken them for rivulets; but their precise out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines would permit but one interpretation, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought me remembrances of the irrigation canals I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen on the semi-arid plains of Arizona and Cali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fornia. It seemed, however, that they served more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a single purpose; for as we crossed a little arch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing bridge over one of the widest of their waterways,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw a long, flat boat anchored just beneath my feet;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and four or five men, clad in close-fitting gray instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of in the usual long-flowing tinted robes, were busy</seg><seg type="columnLine">loading this barge with newly plucked clusters of blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crimson and orange-colored fruit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even had there been no one to enlighten me con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerning these queer jungles, I would now have under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood their general nature. Still they seemed to em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body a multitude of mysteries, mysteries to be ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained by no known laws of biology; and, accordingly,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	listened eagerly when one of the tutors, finding him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self besieged by an enthusiastic, questioning coterie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">launched forth upon an explanatory discourse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "From the earliest times, as you know," said he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaking informally, and yet with something of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manner of a professor addressing his class, "We At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lanteans have been skilled in horticulture. To begin</seg><seg type="columnLine">with, nature provided the stimulus, for the flora of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an island such as Atlantis is apt to be unique, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of our own country was particularly so. But long</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the Submergence, we had outdone nature by de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloping a multitude of new plants; and since the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Submergence our botanists have busied themselves in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessantly with the study of artificial stimulation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">vegetable life. It is well known how industriously they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have experimented, trying the effect of new soils and</seg><seg type="columnLine">environments, grafting the limbs of innumerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">bushes and trees, cross-fertilizing and encouraging all</seg><seg type="columnLine">favorable chance growths or "sports"; and in these</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuits they have been aided by the altered environ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of Atlantis, which seems favorable to rapid and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden variation, and has given rise to innumerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">varieties of plants unknown before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not need to tell you how essential all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been for the maintenance of Atlantean life, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">our land is limited in extent and much of it is un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suited for agriculture; only by the intensive and</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced development of the rest can we hope to sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port our people. And so it has been necessary to</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolve food-plants that would produce more prolifically</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any known before; and at the same time we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to develop a light which would be the chemical</seg><seg type="columnLine">equivalent of sunlight, and so would stimulate the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chlorophyl of the leaves, the original source of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">organic matter. This, to be sure, was accomplished</seg><seg type="columnLine">even before the Submergence; but since the Sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mergence there has been a constant improvement in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the quality of the artificial sunlight; and in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eleventh century A. S., the great chemist, Sorandos,</seg><seg type="columnLine">produced a light actually superior to sunlight. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">least (for some reason that Sorandos himself never</seg><seg type="columnLine">made sufficiently plain) it stimulates plant life to an</seg><seg type="columnLine">extraordinarily rapid growth, even though it has the</seg><seg type="columnLine">compensating fault of inducing rapid decay. It is this</seg><seg type="columnLine">light which you see shining down upon you now from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great stone columns."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE speaker paused, and I thought the time op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portune to put a question which had been puzzling</seg><seg type="columnLine">338</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   And along each side of tho broad passagoway, rising almost to meet the coiling, was a scries of what I took to be gigantic boilers. All of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these were connected with innumerable wires and with pipes thicker than a man's body, while at the further end of the gallery the tubes wero</seg><seg type="columnLine">Interwoven in intricate loops, coils and convolutions like the exposed entrails of a Titan.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">339</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">me. ''You tell us that you have need for intensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">crop production," said I, "and yet have I not heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">that you can produce food chemically?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, indeed," admitted the tutor, with a shrug.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The same light that develops the chlorophyl in</seg><seg type="columnLine">plants may be employed for the synthetic manufacture</seg><seg type="columnLine">of starch and sugar out of charcoal and distilled water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But that is an old-fashioned method, and not very suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessful on the whole, for we have found that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">artificial food lacks some element essential for good</seg><seg type="columnLine">health."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even so, why rely wholly upon plant life?" I in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired, curious to know why my diet in Atlantis had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been strictly vegetarian. "Do you never--do you never</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat meat?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eat meat?" The tutor's tone was one of astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment; and I observed half a dozen pairs of eyes star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at me in shocked surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment I felt like one who has urged canni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">balism or some other barbarous rite. And my dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfort was scarcely relieved when my informant</seg><seg type="columnLine">sternly declared, "There has been no meat consumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Atlantis since the Submergence; flesh-eating has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been discarded along with the other uncivilized prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tices of the ancients. How could we feel ourselves to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be superior to the beasts and yet live at the cost of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But are there no animals at all in Atlantis?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found the courage to inquire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes, though naturally we couldn't take care</seg><seg type="columnLine">of many after the Submergence." And my companion</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused, and pointed to a little red-breasted feathered</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing perched amid the dense green of the foliage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There are birds of course--we could not dispense with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Then there are a few insects, such as the but-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terflies--and the bees, which give us honey and are</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary for plant pollenization--though all harmful</seg><seg type="columnLine">insects were long ago destroyed. Also, there are squir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rels and chipmunks and other small creatures; and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Salty River and the canals there are numerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">fish. And in some places along the banks of the Salty</seg><seg type="columnLine">River there are hundreds of bullfrogs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Bullfrogs!" I exclaimed. "Bullfrogs!" And sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly I understood the meaning of those strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">noises which had so terrified my shipmates and my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self during our first night in Atlantis!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XIX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Glass City</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR five or six hours we proceeded through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fruit-bearing jungles, which seemed limitless in</seg><seg type="columnLine">extent and yet constantly displayed new and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected features. But the journey was by no means</seg><seg type="columnLine">arduous, for twice we paused for rest and refreshments</seg><seg type="columnLine">at little open-air inns that fronted the roads; at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">times our pace was unhurried. And most of the party</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed still fresh and energetic when, toward the mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle of the afternoon, we emerged suddenly from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thickets and saw a group of fairy-like towers gleam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing straight ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is the city of Thalos," I heard one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tutors explaining. "It is there that we stay for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">night."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we approached, I directed my eyes eagerly upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thalos, which even at a distance appeared strikingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">different from Archeon. Indeed, it appeared strikingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">different from any city I had ever seen, for no streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">or thoroughfares of any kind were visible, and, as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew near, the various buildings seemed to merge in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long unbroken line dominated by turrets, domes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spires spaced at geometrical intervals; and all those</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">domes and spires flashed and sparkled with a multi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored light, which changed in hue and intensity with</seg><seg type="columnLine">every step we took and was elusive and yet vivid as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glittering of innumerable gems.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So awe-stricken was I that I scarcely thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">questioning my companions, but hastened toward this</seg><seg type="columnLine">alluring city. And the nearer I approached the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazzled I was. By degrees I came to realize that a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high wall surrounded the town; but this wall brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">no reminders of the fortified bulwarks of ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities, for its outlines were graceful and pleasing, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">color an agreeable dark blue, and its evident purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">ornamental. And when I had come within a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred yards of the city,. I observed that its blue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness was translucent, indicating that the building ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terial was glass!--and, judging from the peculiar glis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tening and glinting of the towers projecting above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, I wondered whether stained glass were not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance of the entire town!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This, in fact, I discovered was so. Having passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the wall by means of a little arched gateway</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible at a distance, I found myself in what might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been a city out of the Arabian Nights. I can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">not say with certainty whether I beheld a single build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing or a hundred, or whether I stood in an open court</seg><seg type="columnLine">or in a street; for before me spread a wide expanse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of glass masonry, of arches and covered galleries, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">steeples and cupolas and winding balconies; and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">this masonry seemed to be joined in a more or less</seg><seg type="columnLine">unified whole. There may have been individual edi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fices, but there was no edifice not connected with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighbors by arching walls or overhead passageways;</seg><seg type="columnLine">there may have been streets winding through this</seg><seg type="columnLine">wilderness of glass, but it struck me that there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">only open spaces alternating with twining glass-roofed</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridors. Yet, however bizarre the total impression</seg><seg type="columnLine">(and bizarre it was beyond all imagining), there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">also a certain unity that prevented the city from ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearing grotesque; and its various segments, in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">garments of lavender or pale blue or turquoise or</seg><seg type="columnLine">vivid ruby, fitted together as perfectly as the parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an intricate and beautiful mosaic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had barely entered the city when half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">natives emerged from unseen corridors and greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. Like the members of our own party, they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed in exquisite light-tinted gowns; and, like all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Atlanteans, they were well built, prepossessing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance and handsome; and there was a perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural courtesy in their manner when they assured</seg><seg type="columnLine">us how welcome we were and bade us accompany them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our lodgings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still speechless with wonder, I followed my com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions through long crystal galleries, around the base</seg><seg type="columnLine">of jewel-like glimmering towers, and across flowered</seg><seg type="columnLine">parks where iridiscent fountains splashed and bubbled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"This is typical of the latest in architecture," I heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the men saying, as he pointed up at the curv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, interlinking stained glass porticoes and domes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Thalos in its present form is not more than five cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turies old, and is exclusively a development of Post-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Submergence art."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost before these words were out of the speaker's</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth, we were led up a long flight of stairs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through an elliptical doorway into a chamber which, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my surprise, was walled and roofed not with glass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but with marble. Here we were treated to a sumptu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous repast, consisting of a sort of vegetable steak, native</seg><seg type="columnLine">cakes and bread, honey and fruit, which already lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread for us on half a dozen little tables. And, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had dined, we were each shown to a room on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof, which was equipped with all articles that neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sity or convenience could demand, and where, if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">340</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wished, we might well rest from the day's exertions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of our party may possibly have availed them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves of this opportunity; but, for my own part, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so exciteed merely at being in Thales, that a rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">.was out of the question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS soon as I had washed myself clean of the dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the journey, I made my way down from my</seg><seg type="columnLine">roof-apartment and out of the building. As I stepped</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the outer door, I was rejoiced to see a fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliar blue-clad figure preceding me down the stairs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Aelios!" I cried; and when she turned to see what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the matter, I joined her with the breathless sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestion that we take a little stroll together.

I exclaimed, thinking this the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible statement I had yet heard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, not quite all abolished," she amended,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully. "Our clothes and books and personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">ornaments are still private property, of course."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But does the State supply one with everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">else?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, with everything, including one's clothes. You'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">see for yourself when you return from this trip and</seg><seg type="columnLine">set out as a citizen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thereupon she told me a few more facts about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">State control of property, and how things such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">inheritance and taxation were unknown. Then gradu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally the conversation shifted to less impersonal and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more alluring subjects. She asked me about the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had come from, and whether it had any architectural</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvels rivalling those of Thalos; and I replied that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had not, though the skyscrapers of New York were</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered wondrous enough. I was reluctant to talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">about my own world, however; I did not wish to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">disturbed by remembrances; I desired only to be walk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with Aelios as I was walking now, and to hear</seg><seg type="columnLine">her speak, and to be permitted to look into those</seg><seg type="columnLine">bright and glamorous blue eyes of hers. And so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened like one in a trance as she told me of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, and how she had been the eldest child of two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">celebrated artists and had never lacked anything she</seg><seg type="columnLine">really wanted, and how from her earliest years she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had loved music and the dance, but particularly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dance, and had followed her childhood inclinations in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her chosen work for the State, though in her pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scribed work she was a tutor. All this and much more</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aelios told me about herself, while I heard her with</seg><seg type="columnLine">adoration that must have been all too apparent in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">fascinated gaze. But she seemed without self-con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sciousness and without realization of the tender senti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments welling up within me; and she rambled eagerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">on and on, speaking with animation and vivacity, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">one speaks to an old and amiable companion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We must have strolled through the rambling thor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oughfares for an hour, when we seated ourselves on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a cushioned marble bench at one corner of a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">court. "If we stay here until dark," suggested Aelios,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"you will see one of the most curious exhibitions that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have ever seen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed only a few minutes later when, without</seg><seg type="columnLine">warning, the golden orbs above us flickered, grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim, and flashed into blackness. Then, while I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering whether we were to be left in total gloom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">other lights gleamed from the city's unseen pinnacles;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their rays darted in long streamers against a</seg><seg type="columnLine">blank glass wall directly across from us, illuminating</seg><seg type="columnLine">it with fantastic and unbelievable designs. Unlike the</seg><seg type="columnLine">searchlights that had amazed me at the Pageant of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Good Destruction, these lights were not without</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent purpose; they shed definite patterns, I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost say pictures, upon the broad glass screen. First</seg><seg type="columnLine">one could make out the form of a man, life-sized and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with pale-colored robes, moving in agile cinemato-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graph fashion; then a woman or a child would advance</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the screen to meet him; then the two would</seg><seg type="columnLine">engage in various significant motions or gesticulations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be joined perhaps by others; and in the swaying</seg><seg type="columnLine">and blending of the lights, the weird mingling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">intermingling of a myriad shades and colors, the back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground of shadows and the foreground of lithe and</seg><seg type="columnLine">active figures, I realized that I was witnessing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">representation of scenes from Atlantean life!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What those scenes were I cannot recall. But I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the impression that they aimed to present life sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolically rather than literally; that beauty was their,</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose rather than accuracy, and that a pleasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmony of color, tone and proportion was deemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">more important than a stringent realism. I fear that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was not sufficiently advanced in the native art to</seg><seg type="columnLine">appreciate them, for they left little more effect upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind than an exhibition of mere technique with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the violin or piano would leave upon one untrained</seg><seg type="columnLine">in music.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, at the time, the spectacle certainly did have its</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence. Although vaguely aware that the seats</seg><seg type="columnLine">about me were being silently occupied, I could scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">give a thought to my surroundings; and under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">enchantment of the shifting and pictorial lights, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt as if Aelios and I were alone together; and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed close to her, until not a fraction of an inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">divided us and it seemed that we breathed not as two</seg><seg type="columnLine">persons but as one. Very cautiously, as though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a clandestine and forbidden act, I reached out my</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand till it touched hers and the palm closed softly</seg><seg type="columnLine">over her fingers. She did not return the pressure and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet did not withdraw her hand, nor even seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice what I was doing; and, in my confusion, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely knew whether to feel encouraged or repulsed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, by that wavering and uncertain light, I caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">a glimpse of her eyes. They were bright and shining</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and did they merely reflect her joy at the colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">display? Not a word was spoken between us, nor was</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">341</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I anxious that a word be spoken; I had sudden visions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a tomorrow fairer than I would once have dared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XX</seg><seg type="columnLine">Farm and Factory</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EARLY the following morning we were again under</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. Leaving Thalos through a little arched</seg><seg type="columnLine">gateway under the western wall, we trudged for</seg><seg type="columnLine">several hours through flat green countryside. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there, amid breaks in the vegetation, we observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">edifices which my companions described as "farm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses," but which, with their statue-lined walls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">marble columns, seemed to me to be little less than</seg><seg type="columnLine">palaces. These remarkable dwellings, of which there</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been four or five to every square mile, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">conspicuous from a distance, for there were no ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scuring trees, and the landscape was dominated by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hardy reed that grew shoulder-high in impenetrable</seg><seg type="columnLine">clusters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Except for the size of this plant, I might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancied it to be a variety of wheat. Not only were</seg><seg type="columnLine">its leaves long and grass-like, but it bore a rich crop</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some grain that closely resembled wheat, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">each of the seed-clusters were large as ears of Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">corn. That it was cultivated for food purposes was</seg><seg type="columnLine">obvious, for brilliant white lamps were beaming from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tinted columns as in the fruit-jungles, and at regu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar intervals we passed irrigation ditches, and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then caught glimpses of gray-clad men at work</seg><seg type="columnLine">amid the green thickets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But while this scenery was fairly interesting, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was on the whole the most monotonous I had yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">viewed in Atlantis. Hence I was relieved when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">landscape showed a sudden change, and the cultivated</seg><seg type="columnLine">plains gave way to a series of long, low, grass-covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">hills. From the beginning, I noticed something</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar about these eminences, for their contours were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded with almost geometrical evenness; while be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the furthest heights, a clear, rapid stream flowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the ground as if forced up from nowhere, and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after meandering to the edge of the reed-covered plain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">divided into half a dozen diverging irrigation canals.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But all this was less surprising than what I next</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed; for as I stood staring at the stream in</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder, a huge rock at the base of the nearest hill</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust itself outward, and a man emerged as if from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the earth!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Startled, I turned to my companions for an explan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation--but not a murmur issued from them, and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces showed none of that amazement I might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">expected. "Here is where we enter," declared one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tutors, in matter-of-fact tones; and followed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of the party, he plunged through the aperture</seg><seg type="columnLine">made by the dislodged boulder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like one in a dream--or rather like one in a night-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mare--I trailed with the others into that hole on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hillside. As I approached the entrance, I found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I had taken to be a rock was not a rock at all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but merely a cleverly disguised bit of metal; upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">reaching the doorway, I was amazed to find, instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tunnel-like corridor I had expected, a spacious</seg><seg type="columnLine">and wide-vaulting hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the exception of the Sunken World itself it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the largest enclosure I had ever entered; indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it occupied the entire interior of the hill. Along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">full length of a half-mile gallery the white-lanterned</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceiling arched to a height of two hundred feet; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">on each side of a broad passageway, rising almost to</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet the ceiling, was a series of what I took to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic boilers. All of these were connected with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">innumerable wires and with pipes thicker than a man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, while at the further end of the gallery the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes were interwoven in intricate loops, coils and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volutions like the exposed entrails of a Titan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I stepped through the doorway, a warm breeze</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept my face, bearing to my nostrils the odor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">oil, and at the same time bringing me reminders of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the furnace-dry air of steam-heated apartments. "What</seg><seg type="columnLine">place is this?" I could not forebear to ask; but almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">instantly I was sorry that I had spoken, for four or</seg><seg type="columnLine">five pairs of eyes were turned upon me in surprise at</seg><seg type="columnLine">so obvious a question.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is a distillery, of course," answered one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my young companions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A distillery?" I echoed, scarcely less astonished at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his words than at the extraordinary appearance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the place. And although the Atlanteans had seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me to be a sober people, I had visions of the man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ufacture of intoxicants on a scale inconceivable to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most bibulous of my own countrymen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, this is where we prepare our distilled water,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued my friend, surprised at my surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a moment I merely stared at him without com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prehension. "But why so much distilled water?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all that I could gasp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's easily explained," said the young man, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a smile. "The water piped from our deep wells, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">serves us for drinking purposes, couldn't begin to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">care of our irrigation problems--and without irriga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion Atlantis would be a desert. The Salty River,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, contains enough for all our needs; but it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean water, and the brine would kill all land vegeta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. And so the only possibility was to distill the water.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was arranged for long ago by Agripides, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he built this distillery and eleven others, which to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether keep the irrigation system of Atlantis supplied,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and incidentally provide us with all the salt required</seg><seg type="columnLine">for domestic and chemical purposes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That may be all very well," I remarked, "but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of heat necessary to evaporate so much water</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be tremendous. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is no problem at all," my companion assured</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. "By means of intra-atomic energy, we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">generate power enough to distill the entire ocean."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I felt certain that this statement was an exaggera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, but before I had had time for comment, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention was suddenly diverted. All of our party had</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused before a circular slit in the floor; and a brown-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad workman, stepping forth from amid the boilers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">applied a key to a little hole near the edge of the slit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and removed a steel disk perhaps five feet in diameter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly we were bathed in a brilliant copper light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so dazzling that at first I had to turn abruptly away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then as my startled eyes gradually accustomed them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves to the vivid illumination, I peered through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass partition far down into what remotely reminded</seg><seg type="columnLine">me of a furnace, except that no flames were visible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but from the vague fire-bright background great sheets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rods of a shining red or a blinding brassy yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">stared at me steadily with unbearable incandescence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those are the intra-atomic generators," explained</seg><seg type="columnLine">the workmen. "They are constantly liberating energy;</seg><seg type="columnLine">which is transformed into electrical power by means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of giant induction coils; and it is this electricity which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is wired to the boiler-room below and heats the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Salty River."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how terrible to work down there!" it occurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me to comment. "How can any man--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is not necessary to work down there," I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">promptiy informed. "The generators continue operat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">342</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing automatically eo long as they are supplied with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuel."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What fuel do you use?" I inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The reply was not at all what I had expected. "Any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the heavier metals will do," stated the workman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"One of the best of the cheaper fuels is gold, for its</seg><seg type="columnLine">high atomic weight makes possible extensive dissocia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Sometimes, however, we use silver, platinum,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or lead--although the latter is ordinarily regarded as</seg><seg type="columnLine">too valuable for such purposes. A supply of lead will</seg><seg type="columnLine">run the generator for twenty-seven years, one of silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">for thirty-three, and one of gold for forty-five. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">new fuel is required, we simply shoot it in through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tube over there." And the speaker pointed to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube of about the thickness of a man's wrist, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">projected several feet above the floor between two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boilers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thought that I had now seen enough of the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tillery, and was not disappointed when my companions</seg><seg type="columnLine">made ready to leave. But there was one problem which</seg><seg type="columnLine">still troubled me: why did the building look so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a hill from without, and why had such evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">pains been taken to conceal its existence?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To these questions I found a speedy answer. "If</seg><seg type="columnLine">this edifice had been erected in the days before Agrip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ides," declared one of my young friends, "it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been nothing more than an ugly mass of steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stone. But Agripides, seeking a way to beautify</seg><seg type="columnLine">the structure and hide its unavoidable defects, hit upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plan of covering it with a coating of earth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sowing the earth with grass, so as to give the appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of a green hill. All our factories, you will find,</seg><seg type="columnLine">have in some such way been concealed or made</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This, indeed, I discovered to be the case. We had</seg><seg type="columnLine">now reached the industrial center of Atlantis; and all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rest of that day we were busy inspecting manu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">facturing plants of sundry kinds and sizes. But no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where was the air clouded with that smoke and dust</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I had come to associate with industrial dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tricts in my own land; nowhere was there a dingy or</seg><seg type="columnLine">soot-blackened building, nowhere were my ears as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">saulted by the shrieking or droning of whistles, or by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hammering, pounding, screeching, whirring or grat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of machines. Instead, we passed through a region</seg><seg type="columnLine">that might have been recommended to sufferers from</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous ailments. In the midst of pleasant, grassy</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands an occasional tree-bordered building arose with</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittering steeples or stainless marble facade or august</seg><seg type="columnLine">columns of granite; and within each building, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">one might have mistaken for a mansion or a temple,</seg><seg type="columnLine">electrically driven wheels and levers would be oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ating noiselessly, preparing the food of the Atlanteans</seg><seg type="columnLine">or weaving their clothes from the fibre of a flax-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant, manufacturing farm implements or fertilizers</seg><seg type="columnLine">or scientific articles or household wares; and in each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these factories a few workers (never more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">score) would be calmly and often smilingly tending</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machines, occupying thus their two or three hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">of assigned daily service for the State.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE institution that interested me most was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building where chemists were at work renewing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">air supply of Atlantis--or, rather, the oxygen supply.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here, in a long hall dominated by great vats connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">by pipes and wires reminding me vaguely of the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tillery, a continual stream of water was being disin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tegrated by a process of electrolysis, the hydrogen</seg><seg type="columnLine">being diverted to enter into various chemical com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds, with carbon nitrogen and other elements, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oxygen being released into the atmosphere to replace</seg><seg type="columnLine">that consumed by respiration and combustion. By</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">means of the air-gauge, a finely adjusted apparatus</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose index was a flame that varied in intensity with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amount of oxygen, chemists were able to determine</seg><seg type="columnLine">how much of this vital gas was required at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">specific time; but some oxygen had to be provided</seg><seg type="columnLine">continually, for, large as Atlantis was, it was not so</seg><seg type="columnLine">great that nature would preserve a balance and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">place the oxygen that was consumed by that freed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the course of organic processes of plant life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But if the Atlantean industries were arranged with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a regard for the welfare and esthetic sensibilities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the people as a whole, scarcely less pains had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken to insure the health and convenience of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers. I will not speak of the safety devices, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been so perfected that accidents were virtually</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown; I will not dwell upon the precautions to</seg><seg type="columnLine">vary the monotony even of the two- or three-hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">working day, to make possible individual initiative, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard against fatigue and excessive strain, or to ren-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the surroundings pleasant to the eye and mind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But what I must mention, because it impressed me</seg><seg type="columnLine">as unique, is the fact that the workers were housed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in dwellings not less imposing than the most stately</seg><seg type="columnLine">city homes. The road took us through half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">villages reserved for the factory workers; and each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these seemed to be in itself a work of art, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">many-columned residences, arches and marble portals</seg><seg type="columnLine">and connecting colonnades, flowered parks and statuary</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fountains, all co-ordinated in a tasteful and elegant</seg><seg type="columnLine">design.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXI</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Wall and the Wind-makers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THAT evening we were lodged in the city of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arvon, a moderately large town which differed</seg><seg type="columnLine">strikingly from anything we had yet seen. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattered houses were huddled amid vegetation so thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">that from a distance it resembled a forest; and even</seg><seg type="columnLine">at close range one could not lose sight of its sylvan</seg><seg type="columnLine">aspect, since all the buildings were vine-covered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">painted a green and brown that harmonized ideally</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the woodland colors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I must not devote too much space to the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance of this town--still stranger sights were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">greet me on the following day. For then I was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach a turning-point in my journey, and to penetrate</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the salient mysteries of Atlantis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even though I did not know what interesting dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coveries were before me, I had a hint of something un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">usual very early in the morning. We had hardly left</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arvon when I observed that the golden-lighted dome</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed lower and nearer than usual, and curved grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually down to westward until it appeared to merge</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's where the glass wall begins," said one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tutors, pointing; and I looked eagerly, hopeful that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would soon reach the wall itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A little further on, the road curved abruptly south-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, and for several miles we merely paralleled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. Then, to my joy, a familiar gurgling met my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears--we were back again near the Salty River.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Straight across the stream we passed on an arching</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridge dominated by a crystalline pale-blue colonnade;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, on the further side, we again turned westward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and followed the river directly toward the green glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we advanced, I noticed that the waters were be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming white and foamy, with great briny patches as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if a passing steamer had churned up the waves. Grad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ually these frothy expanses grew wilder and more con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spicuous, until the entire river was a seething, effer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vescent mass; and troubled waves sprang to life, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">343</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">turbulence that increased as we moved upstream, until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bubbling white was mingled with the green and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gray of leaping surges, and the waters were agitated as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if by a storm-wind. Yet only the faintest breeze was</seg><seg type="columnLine">blowing, and I could not understand the source of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange commotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the same time, a disquieting sound came to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears--the continuous and droning sound of thunder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dull and muffled but gradually growing louder in spite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the clamoring and roaring of the waves. So deep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toned and voluminous was it that it reminded me of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a din I never expected to hear again--the booming of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ocean along resisting shores.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All of our party moved without a word now, moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly and with faces straining westward, as if eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some rare and long-awaited event. In their very</seg><seg type="columnLine">speechlessness there was a contagious tension; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">responsive to their mood, I too was expectant, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not imagine what there was to be anticipated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I did not have long to wait. "Look! There it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is!" exclaimed one of the party, suddenly. And he</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused, and pointed straight ahead; and all his com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panions paused and pointed straight ahead, joining</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his awed cries of "Look! There it is!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, I strained my eyes quite as earnestly as</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of them. But at first I saw nothing to impress</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. All that was visible was a broad sheet of white</seg><seg type="columnLine">looming just above the river for almost its full width,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though there were a falls a mile or two upstream.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, in my ignorance, I accepted this as the explan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I was speedily to discover my error. Suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">the path bent away from the river at an acute angle;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as we followed our new course the distant thun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dering grew louder--while a cold wind began to sweep</seg><seg type="columnLine">over us and the supposed waterfall took on unexpected</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimensions. By degrees it lengthened until it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long jet of water shot horizontally out of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossal hose. Intensely white, with the whiteness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of foam and edges blurred with spray, it went hurtling</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the impetuousity and swiftness of an arrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the nozzle of a gigantic pipe, plunging outward</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of yards in a graceful parabola and giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise to the Salty River.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Almost as remarkable as this torrent of water was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tube from which it was discharged. This great</seg><seg type="columnLine">pipe, which may have been of a steel alloy, was well</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a mile long, and was a hundred yards across at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opening; but it narrowed gradually as it crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">westward along the ground and disappeared where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the green horizon met the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Needless to say, I did not have to inquire as to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning. Only one explanation was conceivable: the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metallic tube was the valve through which the X-lll</seg><seg type="columnLine">had found entrance to Atlantis, the valve that ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted the ocean water and kept the Salty River sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied. The aperture at the ocean end was doubtless</seg><seg type="columnLine">not very wide (I was later told that it was but twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five feet across); but such was the pressure at these</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths that the waters burst through with the force</seg><seg type="columnLine">and swiftness and tremendous volume I had observed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had to be diverted through a long and gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">widening tube before their torrents could be controlled</seg><seg type="columnLine">and safely emptied into the river channel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS we approached the glass wall, the hoarse and</seg><seg type="columnLine">resonant roaring was continuously in our ears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thudding and crashing with echoes that reverberated</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the combined monody of a hundred Niagaras. But,</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgetful of the tumult, I kept my eyes fastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight ahead, where the great green dome sloped</seg><seg type="columnLine">down to meet the ground in a curve modelled on that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of the actual heavens. Except for the dark weird</seg><seg type="columnLine">coloration, I might have fancied that I was staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward an actual horizon on earth; and so close was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the resemblance that the illusion persisted until I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost within a stone's throw of the barrier. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">then could I persuade myself that I actually beheld a</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid mass; and, even so, the curvature was so grace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful and so elusive that I could not feel that a mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall stretched before me; but, rather, I had the sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was some ultimate boundary, the dividing line</seg><seg type="columnLine">between reality and infinite nothingness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This impression was confirmed by the fact that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall at close range looked opaque. Olive-green and</seg><seg type="columnLine">of impenetrable thickness, it seemed impervious to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays of light; though, remembering my experiences</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the X-lll, I knew that it was really transparent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the members of our party approached the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost breathlessly, then held out their hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched it in silence--a procedure which may have had</seg><seg type="columnLine">some ceremonial importance, or may have been akin</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the actions of persons who, seeing the ocean for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time, gravely dip their hands in the salt</seg><seg type="columnLine">water. At any rate, I lost no time in following their</seg><seg type="columnLine">example, and found that the surface of the wall was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as I had expected--smooth and polished, and of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a substance that would have been apparent to a blind</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the twenty students had duly inspected the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall, one of the tutors lifted his voice so as to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard by the entire party.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My friends," said he, "we have now reached the</seg><seg type="columnLine">border-land between Atlantis and the outside world. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">rim of glass fifty feet thick divides us from the ocean;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that glass, as you know, is composed of dozens</seg><seg type="columnLine">of layers, one above the other, several of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">strengthened with interwoven strands of fine wire, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all composed of a special pressure-resisting glass devised</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the orders of Agripides. You understand, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the wall does not end where you see it, but pene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trates five hundred feet underground, lest the ocean</seg><seg type="columnLine">overwhelm us from beneath; you also understand that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass is ribbed with steel, which holds it together</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a sort of latticed framework, with girders, beams</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stanchions at measured intervals like the metallic</seg><seg type="columnLine">skeleton of a great building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The erection of the wall represents the supreme ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complishment of Atlantean engineering, and required</seg><seg type="columnLine">the labor of thirty thousand men for thirty-four years.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Agripides, with his usual foresight, planned it so,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the work, once done, would never require re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">newal, for glass is one of the most durable of sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances, and is virtually immune to dissolution by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean waters. We have our immersible vessels, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, which regularly range the seas around the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass dome in search of any possible fault or fissure;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but no serious damage has ever yet been discovered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it is safe to say that the present edifice will serve</seg><seg type="columnLine">us and our descendants for a hundred thousand gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erations."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The speaker paused, as if for effect; then, noting</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his audience remained silent, he concluded, "Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">there anyone that would like to ask a question?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I would," I surprised myself by saying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All eyes were bent curiously upon me, and I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to continue, "Glass is, as you say, an exceed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly durable substance, but it is also extremely</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragile. Is there no possibility that the wall will ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">be cracked?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cracked?" echoed the tutor, with a surprised smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Do you think that, if there had been such a pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility, Atlantis would not have been inundated long</seg><seg type="columnLine">ago? Granted, if any very heavy object were to col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">344</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lide with the wall, it might be broken and we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be flooded out like ants. But how could there be any</seg><seg type="columnLine">such heavy object here in the deep sea Certainly, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fishes couldn't break through."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, of course not," I conceded, feeling that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made myself ridiculous--and with that the discussion</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended. But my words were often to be recalled to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the tempestuous days that followed; and more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of my hearers was to speak of them as strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">prophetic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">' For the next hour we followed a little path that</seg><seg type="columnLine">clung close to the glass wall. And, as we proceeded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my impression of its opaqueness was dissipated, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">from time to time a little flickering light was mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mentarily visible beyond the green thicknesses; and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had disturbing remembrances of the lantern-bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">fishes that had haunted us on our way to Atlantis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had covered not more than a mile or two when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we met with a new surprise. A brisk breeze began</seg><seg type="columnLine">to blow over us; and the further we walked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharper the breeze grew, until it assumed the fury</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a gale, and for the first time since reaching At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantis I felt cold, almost as if I were back on earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why we continued in the face of this strange blast</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could not understand, nor whence it proceeded nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">how it had been produced. But while I was wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and fighting my way through the wind, a singular</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirring sound came to my ears, a buzzing as of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gigantic flies; and gradually that sound grew louder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until from resembling the murmuring of insects it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to remind me of the flapping of colossal wings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That this noise was somehow connected with the quick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening wind was apparent from the first; and the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lationship became evident when the path swerved</seg><seg type="columnLine">abruptly away from the wall and I glanced back, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">behold a series of queer-looking machines supported</seg><seg type="columnLine">on stone pedestals high up against the glass. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be impossible to say just what the machines were like,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for they were in such rapid motion that the part3 were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not visible; but there were six or eight of them, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were round, and probably each a hundred yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">across; and so swiftly were they rotating that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed each a gray blur through which the green of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall was vaguely discernible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Those are the electro-intra-atomic wind generators,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained one of the tutors. "By means of these great</seg><seg type="columnLine">fans and others like them stationed at various points</seg><seg type="columnLine">around the wall, the atmosphere of Atlantis is kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">in constant circulation. Without them the air would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be stagnant and the climate sultry and unhealthy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These generators are in action at all times, with great</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-wheels that make from ten to fifteen revolutions a</seg><seg type="columnLine">second; and it is estimated that the daily energy con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumed by each of them would be sufficient to boil a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand tons of ice water."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We did not linger long in the vicinity of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">fans, for the strong wind was most annoying and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the temperature too low for comfort. But we set out</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a brisk pace across a moss-covered plain away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall; and we did not pause again until we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the city of Lerenon, which was our destination</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This town, which was located some miles from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall and yet was constantly fanned by cool breezes</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the wind generators, had one striking feature</seg><seg type="columnLine">all its own: it was dominated by two colossal bronze</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures, one of a man, the other of a woman, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached far above the city domes and towers halfway</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the green-glass sky. Both these statues were carved</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an irresistible majesty, the man's face that of</seg><seg type="columnLine">an Apollo, the woman's that of a Diana; and their</seg><seg type="columnLine">right hands were extended high over the city roofs</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and joined in a firm clasp, so lifelike that I might al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most have expected them to move and speak. At first</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought that they represented mythological charac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters, but an inscription at their base informed me of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my error, for the man was meant to typify Wisdom,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the woman Beauty; and in their union above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spires and columns of Atlantis I thought I could read</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meaning and purpose of the entire land.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXII</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Journey Ends</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING the thirty days of our journey, I was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">witness of marvels so numerous that, if I were</seg><seg type="columnLine">to dwell upon them all, I might fill hundreds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pages. Yet while there is much that cannot be re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">corded and much that I have forgotten, there are some</seg><seg type="columnLine">observations which have stamped themselves indelibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon my memory, and which are so essential for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding of Atlantis that I could not well over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">look them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus, I found that the wall enclosing the country</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed a vast circle, of a diameter impossible to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termine precisely but probably in the neighborhood</seg><seg type="columnLine">of two hundred miles. Thus, also, I learned that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass roof was at an average height of five hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet above the ground, although the distance varied</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly according to the level of the land; and I dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered that it was everywhere supported by myriads</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the huge tinted columns--columns with steel in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teriors and surface of concrete or stone. I ascer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained, likewise, that the Salty River followed an ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solutely unbending course, flowing in a straight-line</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on an even, gradual grade from the western wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Atlantis to the eastern (since it was really a canal</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than a river); and I was amazed and dazzled</seg><seg type="columnLine">at sight of the great intra-atomic pumps which forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">the torrents back into the sea.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since they were expected to overcome a pressure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">many tons to the square foot, these pumps had to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">very powerful; and powerful they were, with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">labyrinths of levers and revolving chains, and three-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred-foot pistons and rods that pounded against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waters like gigantic pile-drivers, pressing them</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly back into the sea to the accompaniment of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring and thundering that could be heard for miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that proved deafening upon close approach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The cities of Atlantis, according to the count I made,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were eighteen in number (exclusive of the smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">towns and villages). But an Atlantean city, although</seg><seg type="columnLine">always occupying considerable space, was what we</seg><seg type="columnLine">in America should scarcely regard as a city at all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since it never had more than twenty or twenty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand inhabitants. This insignificant population,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when considered along with the liberal amount of ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ritory allotted each town, accounted for the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">no great crowds were ever to be seen on the streets;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it also explained how it was possible for efficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">popular assemblages to debate and decide public ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the surprising fact about the Atlantean cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not so much their small population as their al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most unbelievable variety. No town in Atlantis was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like any other town; the only characteristic possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by them all in common was their unfailing beauty. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">give some idea of their amazing diversity, I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">mention the city of Atolis, which, when seen from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill that surmounted it, formed a definite pattern, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sembling some colossal Grecian temple of which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets and avenues were the columns. Or I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture Aedla, which was built along a series of canab</seg><seg type="columnLine">connecting with the Salty River, with a lake in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">345</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">center, giving a Venetian effect, except that the pal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aces were more exquisitely designed than any in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper world. Then, again, I might depict the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">town of Acropolon, in which all the houses were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nected in an enormous colonnaded quadrangle sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounding a vividly flowering park, reminding me of</seg><seg type="columnLine">some university I had seen long before; or I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch into a lengthy description of Mangona, another</seg><seg type="columnLine">small town, whose houses were all roofless and col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapsible, and were generally taken down during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day and put into place only at night or when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhabitants desired seclusion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But more interesting to me than any of these was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sardolos, one of the few present-day Atlantean cities</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had existed before the Submergence. Although</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course the town was not the same as in ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">times, and although its gracefully winding thorough-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fares and marble friezes and frescoed domes repre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented the work of modern artists, yet some relics of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old days had been carefully preserved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In one corner of the city, concealed from the gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral gaze in a statue-lined bronze enclosure, were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">remains of buildings said to date from the second cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tury B. S. Yet, ancient as these ruins were, my first</seg><seg type="columnLine">impression was that there was something familiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">about them. The most conspicuous exhibit was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone wall, five stories high and with gaping rectang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ular holes where the windows had been; and to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear was a mass of rusted and distorted steel, reach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the full height of the wall with twisted, spidery</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms that had once lent it support.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A splendid specimen of pre-Submergence architec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture," stated a placard placed prominently before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhibit. "This was the seat of the Stock Market of</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Sardolos--a wholesale gambling house abolished by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Anti-Corruption Act of the first century A. S. Th6</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of shapeless and desiccated stone opposite is all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that remains of the Inter-Atlantean Bank, which owned</seg><seg type="columnLine">a controlling share in this gambling resort; while just</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the right were the ruins of the shrine in which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">owners of the bank worshipped, and of the club-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house in which, late in the second century B. S., they</seg><seg type="columnLine">convened in the interest of their lotteries, and decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">to declare the fifth Atlanto-Bengenese war."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT when I looked to see the ruins, all that I be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">held was a series of irregular stone walls, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">over two or three feet high and brown with the lifeless</seg><seg type="columnLine">parchment hue of extreme age. Somehow, it made me</seg><seg type="columnLine">uncomfortable to look upon these vestiges of the past;</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor was I relieved when I gazed at a picture of Sar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dolos as it had been, and saw two long opposing rows</seg><seg type="columnLine">of geometrically regular five-story buildings. To think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these, and then to turn to present-day Atlantis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was merely to shudder at the contrast; yet all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">while I could not repress the sense that I was stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the presence of something undefinably familiar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If it was somewhat irritating to gaze at the ruins</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Sardolos, the disagreeable moments were few in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed during the thirty days of the journey. All in all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have rarely taken part in so thoroughly delightful</seg><seg type="columnLine">an expedition; and my joy in the trip is not to be ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained merely by the engrossing sights of Atlantis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor by the companionship of the twenty enthusiastic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendly young students, but rather by the presence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who meant more to me than all else that Atlantis</seg><seg type="columnLine">contained. My opportunities of speaking with Aelios</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not plentiful, for she seemed always to be en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaged in conversation with some member of the party;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but occasionally I exchanged a few words with her,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By decrees It lengthened until It seemed a Ions jet of water shot horizontally out of some colossal hose.

The morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the thirtieth day had arrived, and we had set</seg><seg type="columnLine">out through wide fields of the wheat-like reed toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city of Archeon, which we hoped to reach shortly</seg><seg type="columnLine">after noon. But, absorbed in somber contemplation, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">took no part in the merriment of my companions, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost from the first I lagged moodily behind them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hence it was a relief to hear light footsteps suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my side, and to find a flaxen-curled head nodding a</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeting and a pair of kindly bright blue eyes peering</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me inquiringly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aelios!" I exclaimed. And I returned her greet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in terms that could not half express my pleasure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She wasted no time about plunging into the subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had brought her to me. "Today our journey</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends," she reminded me, almost regretfully. "And to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow you must take up your duties as a citizen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You may find matters a little strange at first. Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps there are already some things that puzzle you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Indeed there are," I admitted. "I really have very</seg><seg type="columnLine">little idea what I am expected to do."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, but you must have some idea!" she remon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strated. "Why, haven't you been appointed Historian</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Upper World?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, that is so," I murmured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then you must set out at once upon your duties.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In work such as yours, no record will be taken of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hours you employ, but you have a moral obligation</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work not less than two hours a day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That doesn't seem excessive," I stated, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, but remember you have also an obligation to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do some work on your own account for the State.

"Oh, but you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">already a good speaking command of Atlantean," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed out. "And with practice you should be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to write passably well. Meanwhile I'd advise you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to_the government library, and read up all you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can to familiarize yourself with our language--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with our life."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thanked Aelios for the suggestion, and promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">to visit the library at the first opportunity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But don't forget that mere working and studying</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't be enough," she continued. "I hope you'll make</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends of many of our people, and participate in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">intellectual contests and recreations. You might even</seg><seg type="columnLine">join one of the political parties."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Political parties?" I repeated. "I didn't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were any parties in Atlantis."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, yes, of course there are," she quickly returned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There are always several parties to present their</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinions at the Hall of Public Enlightenment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What parties are those?" I inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, let's see," she enumerated, reflectively.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"First of all, there's the Party of Submergence, so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">called because it was founded by Agripides and has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the ruling group ever since the Good Destruction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then there is the Industrial Reform Party, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">contends that all machines and in particular intra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic engines are incongruous in Atlantis and should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be reduced to a minimum far below the present num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber. Then, again, there is the Party of Artistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emancipation, which is really literary rather than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">political, and appeals for freedom in art. Also, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is the Party of Birth Extension, which maintains that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the government should relax its restrictions on pop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ulation. And, finally, enlarging the principles of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Birth Extension Party, there is the Party of Emer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gence, which is the smallest of them all and has always</seg><seg type="columnLine">been highly unpopular if not actually despised, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">it holds that we should renounce the principles of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agripides, enter into communication with the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, and send our excess population to live above</seg><seg type="columnLine">seas."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That sounds quite interesting," I commented, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Party of Emergence seemed to me to be the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">understandable of the group. "But you say this last</seg><seg type="columnLine">party has never had much success?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fortunately not. Its members have always been</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked down upon as anti-social agitators, for they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have transgressed against that fundamental principle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">'Atlantis for the Atlanteans.' Few self-respecting citi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zens have ever lent them support, and they have never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been powerful enough to carry any of their proposals."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Too bad," I found myself remarking, with un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded frankness; and the shocked expression on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aelios' face showed me how I had erred.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At any rate, now that you know something about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parties, you will be better able to choose among</seg><seg type="columnLine">them," she concluded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I assured her that I would choose as best I could.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"If there's ever anything you're in doubt about,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she urged, "don't b?. afraid to ask me. I know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">things aren't 'eaSy here for you, a stranger from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange land, and I'd like to help if I could."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thanked her fervently, and declared that I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hesitate to consult her should occasion arise. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">secretly I was determined that the occasion should</seg><seg type="columnLine">arise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm glad to hear you say that," she returned. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes shone with a bright light, and her lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">quivered sympathetically, and her whole face radiated</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindliness and warmth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at this juncture she saw fit to give the inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">view an impersonal turn. "See, over there!" she ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed, pointing through a break in the dense green</seg><seg type="columnLine">foliage. "Those are the towers of Archeon!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I looked eagerly, and far across the plain I beheld</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minute glittering spire, more than half obscured by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the intervening array of tinted columns--the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign of that city which I was this day to enter, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">where I was to make my home, and seek the fulfill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of my love, and undertake my duties as a citizen</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Sunken World.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXIII</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xanocles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS an accredited citizen of Atlantis, I was as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed to permanent lodgings immediately after</seg><seg type="columnLine">returning to Archeon. The housing representa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive of the Atlantean government (the only substitute</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Sunken World for our "realtors") accompanied</seg><seg type="columnLine">me on a leisurely tour of the city, allowing me my</seg><seg type="columnLine">choice of not less than fifteen or twenty apartments.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The task of selection was by no means easy, not be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause it was hard to secure suitable quarters but</seg><seg type="columnLine">because it was difficult to choose among so many de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sirable places. Never before had I realized how utterly</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior the Atlantean homes were to our own--out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all the houses I visited, there was not one that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not separated by wide spaces from its neighbors, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">that did not enjoy a full share of air and light, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">that did not look comfortable and alluring. The grim</seg><seg type="columnLine">and musty interiors of many of our own dwellings, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">347</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">furniture-littered rooms, the glaring bad taste of gilt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tinsel chairs and adornments, found no parallel</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the Atlantean residences I visited. Instead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">each apartment was so artlessly inviting that I might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have claimed it at once as my home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The distinguishing feature of most of the Atlantean</seg><seg type="columnLine">houses was a central court that reminded me of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwellings of the ancient world. Usually the court was</seg><seg type="columnLine">square or rectangular in shape, though in some in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances it was hexagonal or round; and more often</seg><seg type="columnLine">than not it was completely enclosed. Some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">courts were surrounded by stalwart columns, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">majority were plain. Some had walls of granite, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of marble, some of a peculiar bluish stone that I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not recognize; some were marked by spangled foun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains, some by flower-gardens, some by swimming</seg><seg type="columnLine">pools; and the most distinctive of all was arranged as</seg><seg type="columnLine">an art gallery, with a dominating statue in the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter and paintings hung at intervals along the sides.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But whatever the particular contents of the court, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was certain to be accessible by four or five doors</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading into the several apartments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After inspecting the various prospective lodgings, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally decided in favor of a little three-room suite</seg><seg type="columnLine">(three rooms, that is, in addition to the sleeping cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber on the roof) which looked out over a tree-lined</seg><seg type="columnLine">expanse toward the sapphire dome of the Hall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Public Enlightenment. I was urged to take these</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters largely because of the fascination of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frieze-lined adjourning court, whose finely modelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">images of gods and nymphs and satyrs offered me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospect of fruitful study. But I was also captivated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the rooms themselves, which gave a bizarre effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their walls decked with seaweed tapestries, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">which seemed at once like a home and a temple with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their high vaulted ceilings, their arching doorways and</seg><seg type="columnLine">great elliptical windows, and their removable parti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions capable of transforming the entire apartment into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single good-sized hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was fortunate perhaps that I chose these partic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ular lodgings, for otherwise I might never have</seg><seg type="columnLine">known Xanocles. Xanocles was to be my one intimate</seg><seg type="columnLine">among all the men of Atlantis. It so happened that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that fiery spirit, audacious thinker, and trustworthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend--had chosen his abode in the same building;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it also happened (since fate works in inscrutable</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways even in Atlantis) that he and I were early thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">together. It was, indeed, on the very day after my</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to Archeon that Xanocles and I met. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just settled in my new home, and had gone out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the court for my first close inspection of its mural</seg><seg type="columnLine">decorations, when a door across from me slid open</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a tall, white-clad figure emerged. A single glance</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have told me that the stranger was exceptional,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a single glance perhaps told him that I was ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptional in Atlantis: for he paused in startled sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prise, and for an embarrassed instant we stood staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquiringly at one another. In that first fleeting</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse I had an impression of a powerful personality;</seg><seg type="columnLine">a large head poised squarely over a pair of broad and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tapable shoulders; two vivid blue eyes deeply set be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath a massive brow; a beardless oval face dominated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by flowing chestnut locks; classic features, with chin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nose consummately modelled. But I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice then what I was often to observe later: the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ironic glitter in the alert eyes, the forceful and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined lines into which the face would habitually</seg><seg type="columnLine">Settle, the air of overflowing vigor tempered by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy self-command. Judging from the smooth con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tours of the man's face, I took him to be not over</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty years of age; and I was later much surprised</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to learn that he was well past forty (since in At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantis people do not age so rapidly as on earth).</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By Agripides! You must be one of those visitors</seg><seg type="columnLine">from up above!" exclaimed the newcomer, recovering</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his astonishment. And he approached me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a winning smile, and held out both hands by way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">greeting. "My name is Xanocles. We seem to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighbors, you and I. Perhaps we can get to knoty</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope we shall," I seconded, as I took his hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My name is Harkness. I've just finished my tour</seg><seg type="columnLine">around Atlantis, and now I'm supposed to begin duty</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a citizen."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's quick work," nodded Xanocles, approvingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then, after an instant's pause, "So you're the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one they've appointed Historian of the Upper World?'5.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I pleaded guilty to the accusation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knew it must be so," explained my new ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quaintance, "because only one of the immigrants has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been admitted to citizenship. Of course, there will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be others later on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Won't you come in?" I invited, with a gesture</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward my new apartments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Xanocles needed no second invitation. A minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">later we were seated opposite one another on seaweed</seg><seg type="columnLine">cushions in the little room that was to be my study.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It seems to me, Harkness," he suggested, using</seg><seg type="columnLine">my name as familiarly as though he had known me</seg><seg type="columnLine">all my life, "we might as well be frank with one an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other from the beginning. At least, I might as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">be frank with you. And I'd better start by warning</seg><seg type="columnLine">you that you'll not gain much from acquaintance with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I'm none too popular."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No?" I demanded, wondering vaguely what offense</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had committed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he confessed. "I'm so very unpopular, in fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it may reflect upon you even to be seen in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">company."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what is it that you've done?" I asked, thinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">it strange that this attractive and able-looking man</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be so disliked. "Surely, you haven't blown up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">building, or stolen some one's jewels, or killed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A frown of disgust passed across Xanocles' face.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Such primitive forms of violence," he reminded me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"are unknown in Atlantis. No, I haven't stooped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything so low. But I've done something bad enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the eyes of the people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll have to give it up," said I, growing morei</seg><seg type="columnLine">puzzled each moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It shouldn't be hard to guess--not if you know the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways of Atlantis," he continued, gravely. "I've joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Party of Emergence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Party of Emergence?" I exclaimed, remember-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing what Aelios had told me of this minority group.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I not only joined the party," he acknowledged, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleting the indictment, "but I've let them elect me one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their Debating Delegates."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I don't exactly understand--" I admitted, hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tatingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You would understand if you knew more about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantis. Every people has to have its pet aversion, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose, and our pet aversion down here is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emergence Party. That's because it opposes the prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciples1 of the one hundred per cent Atlanteans."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But just what is the Emergence Party?" I inquired,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still in doubt as to the tenets of this detested fac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. "Is it anything so terrible?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That all depends upon the point of view," declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xanocles, enigmatically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused long enough to give me an instant's</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutiny with keen and quizzical eyes. "I am not sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">348</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that you would understand," he decided, speaking as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much to himself as to me. "But the main thing is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we oppose the compulsory limitation of population."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Compulsory limitation of population?" I repeated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering if I had heard him correctly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Most certainly. You've heard, perhaps, that our</seg><seg type="columnLine">population is limited by law to five hundred thousand."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But that's impossible!" I cried, incredulously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Experience has proved quite the contrary," he dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR a moment I did not reply. I merely sat star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at my companion, trying to fathom the secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden in those inscrutable grave eyes of his. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he gave no sign of not being utterly truthful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ended by giving expression to my scepticism.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What do you do with your extra inhabitants? Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">they emigrate to the center of the earth?

"Do you know nothing of the Milares Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsory Population Law?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was forced to confess my ignorance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then let me enlighten you," volunteered Xanocles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a tolerant smile. "First let me take you back</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few thousand years, to the days just after the Sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mergence. At that time the population of Atlantis</seg><seg type="columnLine">was several millions, and the swarms of our people</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so dense that long hours of labor were necessary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">living quarters were crowded- and unsanitary, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was little time for the creation or appreciation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of beauty. This state of affairs endured for over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">century, when, after much discussion, the Milares</seg><seg type="columnLine">Compulsory Population Law was passed, and the citi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zenry was gradually reduced to its present satisfactory</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what was the Milares Population Law?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is the law that is still the backbone of our life.</seg><seg type="columnLine">According to Milares, a great social philosopher of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second century A.

He maintained that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parents of each generation might either poison or</seg><seg type="columnLine">uplift the next; and all of his numerous pamphlets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and books bore the warning that persons congenitally</seg><seg type="columnLine">deficient in mind or physique should not be permitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to breed, while those of the higher physical and intel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lectual qualities should be encouraged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In pursuance of these views, Milares proposed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">basic innovation in social customs; he recommended</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the institution of marriage be dissevered from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of parenthood. In other words, while marriage</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and likewise divorce--should be permitted to all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">desired it, parenthood should become a subject of</seg><seg type="columnLine">drastic state regulation: any young couple wishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">children must have their fitness examined by a care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully selected State board. Since effective methods of</seg><seg type="columnLine">birth control were kntfwn, this system was wholly</seg><seg type="columnLine">practicable, and, in fact, has proved--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what if the orders of the Board were dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">obeyed?"

Or do you imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the intellectual and artistic types were then pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dominant? Far from it! Thousands upon thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">were sickly and stunted in body; a myriad were im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">becilic, weak-minded or insane. But thanks to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigidity of the selection, these types have been en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely eliminated; and, owing largely to the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause, the average human life has been lengthened</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the pre-Submergence figure of sixty-five years to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hundred and twenty--which means that-%; man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability has a whole century of mature service to render</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead of a mere four or five decades."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had no choice except to admit that the results were</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous. But at the same time I remembered a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vital oversight in Xanocles' recitation. "All this tells</seg><seg type="columnLine">me nothing of the Party of Emergence," I pointed out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"In fact, if the Milares Population Law has worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">so successfully, I cannot understand why you should</seg><seg type="columnLine">oppose it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It would not be strictly correct to say that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">oppose it," he explained.

Not that we would increase the population</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Atlantis beyond the half million mark, for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be to impose an intolerable burden upon us all;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but we hold that many deserving persons are being</seg><seg type="columnLine">deprived of parenthood, and that many more children</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the highest quality might be born. To furnish a</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple illustration, the Board seems to believe it un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise to perpetuate the radical strains, and so rules</seg><seg type="columnLine">with suspicious frequency against members of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Party of Emergence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then precisely what /.s it that your party advo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cates?"

Of course, there might</seg><seg type="columnLine">be no possibility of a return, but_a return would not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be desirable: it would be enough'to insure life for</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousands of our unborn sons and daughters, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">remake the upper world by an infiltration of our su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perior blood and standards. "Besides,"--here Xanocles</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitated perceptibly--"there is another reason."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is that?" I felt bound to inquire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Xanocles remained silent for a moment, staring ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stractedly toward the romping fauns and mermaids on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seaweed tapestries of the opposite wall.

Hence I was determined to accomplish a</seg><seg type="columnLine">double object: to prepare myself for my prescribed</seg><seg type="columnLine">work and at the same time to gratify my curiosity by</seg><seg type="columnLine">an extensive course of reading.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as I was fully settled in my new apartment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I set out for the main government library--and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">highly interesting and even startling results. I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the building without difficulty: a many-domed edifice</seg><seg type="columnLine">of granite and white chalcedony, located in a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">flower-bordered square near the center of town. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">I not been able to identify it from the descriptions, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have recognized it by the streams of people</seg><seg type="columnLine">constantly filing in and out, giving me the feeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was the business heart of the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet my first impressions of the library were bewild-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering in the extreme. Not only was the building one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the largest I had seen (covering not less than five</seg><seg type="columnLine">or six acres) but the volumes it harbored were amaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in their profusion and variety. My first surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">was at the discovery that there were no railings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">fences or locked doors, as in all other libraries I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known. Here the visitor was admitted without ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to every room and corridor; my second surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and a far greater one--was caused by the queer</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrangement of the books. For the volumes were cata-</seg><seg type="columnLine">logued and stacked, not alphabetically, but chronolog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ically; there was a gallery reserved for each century</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Atlantean history, down to the seventh century</seg><seg type="columnLine">B. S.; and within the galleries, the books were ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged by authors and subjects in a way that im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed me as utterly novel. In a niche among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">books, for example, one would observe the bust of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">stern-browed, bearded man; and, coming close, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">would note that this was the poet Sargos; and just</seg><seg type="columnLine">below the bust one would find the complete collection</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the poet's works, as well as the commentaries upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Or, in another corner of the room, one would</seg><seg type="columnLine">pause to admire the painting of a crowded ancient</seg><seg type="columnLine">seaport; and the inscription below the painting would</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell one that this was the vanished maritime city of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therion; and just beneath this inscription would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the books wherein Therion was pictured and discussed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a way, the building reminded me of a museum</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much as of a library, for, in addition to the paint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings and statues, each gallery was featured by furni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, rugs, vases, tapestries and decorations that cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">responded with the original date of the books. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect of oddity was enhanced by the fact that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">volumes themselves, while in many cases modern re-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">prints, were not infrequently bound in the style of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their first editions; and the total impression was most</seg><seg type="columnLine">curious and interesting, considering the contrasting</seg><seg type="columnLine">sizes and the numberless shades and colors of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">books, and the various grades of silk, parchment and</seg><seg type="columnLine">artificial leather in which they were attired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet the appearance of the books was the least note-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthy fact about them. Their sheer abundance was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">source of unceasing astonishment to me--it seemed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if every era in Atlantean history had been a literary</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. As nearly as I could determine, there had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">an average of several hundred books a year which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been thought worthy of preservation--and the high</seg><seg type="columnLine">period of productivity had already endured for twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five centuries! Nor were the favored works merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">stored up in dusty shelves where they might remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever unnoticed--every book of the scores which I</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened had been well thumbed, and the crowds con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly browsing along the alcoves and aisles gave evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence that literary interest was not purely a thing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the past.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not long before I myself felt inclined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">emulate those enthusiasts. Seated in company with</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty or thirty Atlanteans before the long marble</seg><seg type="columnLine">table that adorned the most modern of the galleries,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I began to taste the contents of several books I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">selected at random; and so delightful did they prove,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was four or five hours before I had any thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of leaving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHILE all the books which I inspected proved rich-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly diverting, the one that interested me most</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a little volume entitled "Social Life in the Thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">first Century." When I recall today the unusual size</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the type and the extreme simplicity of the style, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel sure that the book was designed for an immature</seg><seg type="columnLine">audience; but this fact did not then occur to me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found the work admirably suited to my needs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Questions that had been perplexing me ever since my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrival in Atlantis were now explained, in a manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">that dispersed all doubts; and I found myself pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sessed of a clearer conception than ever before of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantean ideas and institutions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had been wondering, for example, about the statue-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like palace wherein Rawson and I had been imprisoned;</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was now informed that this, "The Temple of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stars," was among the oldest buildings in Atlantis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">having been erected just before the Submergence so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the people might bring back to mind at will the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aspect of the skies. I had been wondering, likewise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the "Hall of Public Enlightenment," that amber-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hued and sapphire theatre in which I had lately wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nessed several debates; I now read that such a build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing had been erected centuries before in each of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantean cities as a place of popular assemblage, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of forum, wherein the people might decide upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">public questions; and I also learned that any citizen</seg><seg type="columnLine">might attend the meetings there, that any might take</seg><seg type="columnLine">part in the discussions, and that it was at such popu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar gatherings that the few laws of the country were</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposed and the most important problems weighed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The discussion of the Halls of Public Enlightenment</seg><seg type="columnLine">naturally paved the way for a description of the po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">litical system and government of the Sunken World.</seg><seg type="columnLine">''The State of Atlantis," I read, "is neither a mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">archy, an oligarchy, nor a republic. It is a Common-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ality, which means that all things are possessed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">common by the people and all activities shared among</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. At the head of the Atlantean State is the High</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief Adviser, whose principle duty is by way of coun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seling the people, but who decides certain specified</seg><seg type="columnLine">350</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">minor questions confronting the Atlantean State and</seg><seg type="columnLine">is empowered to assume dictatorial authority in case</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a national crisis (although such a crisis has never</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred since the riots of the second century A.

His term of</seg><seg type="columnLine">office is indefinite, but every three years he is expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">to prove his fitness by engaging in contests with</seg><seg type="columnLine">qualified aspirants for the Advisorship; and unless he</seg><seg type="columnLine">can still outdo all opponents, a new chief executive</seg><seg type="columnLine">is installed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would have seemed to me that such a system</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have detracted from the dignity of the -High</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief Adviser; but the book informed me that, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the contrary, it added to his dignity, since he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured of holding office on a basis of merit only. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, he was bound to keep fit and even to improve</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself while in office; and most High Chief Ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visers did actually remain so well qualified that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">stayed in power for an average term of thirty years.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indeed, Icenocles (the incumbent at the time of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">publication of the book) had already ruled for forty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five years, and now, at the mature age of one hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and seven, he still regularly put all competitors to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shame.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALL this, of course, told me nothing about Atlan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tean law-making, law enforcement and the admin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istration of justice. Therefore I eagerly read on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found many of my questions speedily answered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To my astonishment, I learned that there was no such</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing as a legislature or a law-making group in At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantis!--and yet such bodies were not unknown to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">native political theory. "Ancient experience has taught</seg><seg type="columnLine">us," said the book, "that representative government</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually represents only some particular faction. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a community whose members are few and all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose citizens are intelligent, there is no necessity</seg><seg type="columnLine">for delegated authority. Local statutes and ordinances</seg><seg type="columnLine">were abolished in Atlantis at the time of the Sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mergence; and the few national laws are proposed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of the cities in the Hall of Public Enlightenment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Having been debated and approved by an assemblage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a hundred citizens or more, the measure is sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted to a referendum of all the Atlanteans after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lapse of thirty days--and a majority vote will</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffice for its passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At the head of each city is a Local Adviser,</seg><seg type="columnLine">selected in the same manner as the High Chief Ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viser; and, aided by a corps of from five to fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistants also chosen competitively, he decides those</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions not settled in the popular assemblies,--</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions such as the amount of energy to be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voted to the erection of new buildings, the time and</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature of local festivals, the regulation of local hy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gienic problems, the number of public physicians re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired to attend the ill and aged, and a dozen other</seg><seg type="columnLine">matters of practical and artistic concern. Equally</seg><seg type="columnLine">important theoretically, though in actual practice far</seg><seg type="columnLine">less so, is the court of eleven judges which presides</seg><seg type="columnLine">in each town, settling all disputes among citizens and</seg><seg type="columnLine">reprimanding the law-breakers. No doubt there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequently such persons as law-breakers three thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago, when these courts were planned, but today</seg><seg type="columnLine">such offenders are virtually unknown, for the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimes are those of impulse and passion, and these</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">are exceedingly rare--fortunately, the congenital</seg><seg type="columnLine">criminals have been wiped out along with lunatics and</seg><seg type="columnLine">morons by our rigorous birth selection.

Even aside from what I have already men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned, the facts that it told me were innumerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">and highly varied: how the great golden lamps of At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantis were electrically lighted and were switched on</seg><seg type="columnLine">and off at specified intervals by country-wide clock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">work; how all Atlanteans, old and young, ill and</seg><seg type="columnLine">healthy, were cared for by the State, so that no man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was weighed down with dependents; how disease had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been almost wiped out, since all the commoner noxious</seg><seg type="columnLine">germs had been conquered; how religion in the or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ganized sense had ceased to exist, for the reason that</seg><seg type="columnLine">each man was expected to arrive at his own philosophy;</seg><seg type="columnLine">how the temples that littered the country were with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out theological meaning, but were sanctuaries of beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereto any one might come at any time to worship</seg><seg type="columnLine">amid the solitude of his own thoughts; how educa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was one of the prime pursuits of the people, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was participated in by all from childhood to old age,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but was never undertaken by the mob method popular</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the upper world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the few pages that the author of the "Social</seg><seg type="columnLine">Life" devoted to the latter subject, I feel sure that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlanteans would have been horrified at our system of</seg><seg type="columnLine">herding forty or fifty children together in subjection</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a glowering pedagogue: their theory was that per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonal and friendly contact with the teacher was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">important thing, and so their boys and girls were</seg><seg type="columnLine">taught in small groups, and never for many hours a</seg><seg type="columnLine">day, nor with more than a minimum of restraint upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">their natural spirits, nor in a specified and unvarying</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, for as often as not their school-room was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">marble colonnade or the court of a temple or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open fields. And, in the same way, the higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">education among the Atlanteans (except in the case of</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientific work requiring laboratory training) was</seg><seg type="columnLine">much less formal than among us. There were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">such things as universities or university degrees, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and women of recognized wisdom and learning</seg><seg type="columnLine">were chosen to commune with the young and discuss</seg><seg type="columnLine">with them the problems of life, much as Socrates did</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he presided among his disciples; and these</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Guardians of the Mind," as they were called, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">counsel and direct their young charges, and guide them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that reading which constituted their primary source</seg><seg type="columnLine">of information.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Duties and Pastimes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT is from my first visit to the library that I date</seg><seg type="columnLine">my real initiation into the affairs of Atlantis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From that time forth I was no longer a stranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an unknown world; I became involved in such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">round of activities that I began to feel almost at home.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For it was my good fortune to have plenty to do, far</seg><seg type="columnLine">more to do, in fact, than the average Atlantean; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">351</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with the demands of the Sunken World calling me on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one hand, and my old companions of the X-lll</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing me on the other, I did not have far to seek</seg><seg type="columnLine">for an interest in life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> First of all, of course, I was applying myself to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">"History of the Upper World." It took me a month to</seg><seg type="columnLine">plan the book, though meanwhile I devoted hours a</seg><seg type="columnLine">day to improving my knowledge of the Atlantean lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guage and institutions. And when finally I had com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted my preliminary outline it did not satisfy me</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely, and yet seemed adequate as a working basis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The introductory section of the book--necessarily a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengthy affair--was to be devoted to a description of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the modern world, to the various nations, their cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">toms, languages, social systems, scientific advances and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wars; and having begun with this grand resum6 of</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern achievement, I intended to show the steps by</seg><seg type="columnLine">which that achievement had been consummated, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to picture in general the course of those social fluctua-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, those invasions, battles, slave-raids, civil con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flicts, religious persecutions, crusades, economic revolu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, industrial tumults and international blood-feuds</seg><seg type="columnLine">that have brought civilization to its present proud</seg><seg type="columnLine">estate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But while I was planning my book, my thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were frequently on more personal subjects. And, hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing completed the outline, I could not forget a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain invitation made me by the most fascinating woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Atlantis, but wasted no time about seeking her ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vice and approval.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Late one afternoon, when I knew that her tutoring</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be over for the day, I paid my second visit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her home. I went just a little hesitatingly, I remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber, yet not without some justifiable hope, for our</seg><seg type="columnLine">interview was to begin most auspiciously. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aelios herself that came to the door in response to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my knock; and it was Aelios that escorted me into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the house, with cordial greetings and delighted smiles</seg><seg type="columnLine">that reaffirmed my impression of her unrivaled merits.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, my friend, I thought you would be coming,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said she, simply, as we took seats side by side on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">seaweed sofa we had occupied on my first visit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what made you think that?" I questioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, didn't you say you would come?" she re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned, in unfeigned surprise. "You're undertaking a</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficult task, you know--to write a book in a strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">language. Isn't it only natural to want advice?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is, indeed," I confessed, and should have liked to</seg><seg type="columnLine">add, "when I can have such a charming adviser."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose you've been working hard," she con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued, evidently unaware of what was in my thoughts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And, of course, you've brought something with you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I have brought something," I admitted; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there being no choice, I forthwith unfolded the paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">that contained my plans for the history.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For several minutes she gazed at it intently, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">features furrowed with thought, while eagerly I</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaited her verdict.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is going to be very interesting," she at length</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided. "As far as I can see, you've covered most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the important points. You will find it easier than</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought to write in our language--your beginning is</seg><seg type="columnLine">most promising. Of course, you do make some errors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of style. . . And she proceeded to point out my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mistakes, in such a manner that I felt certain never</seg><seg type="columnLine">to repeat them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For possibly an hour--or two--we discussed my out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line, though all the while I was conscious that there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something in Atlantis far more interesting to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">than my book.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was still aware of that fact, when, at last, feeling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was growing late, I arose reluctantly to leave.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As she took my hand, Aelios flashed upon me her</seg><seg type="columnLine">most genial smile, and requested, "Come again, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend. Perhaps I'll be able to help you some more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our doors are always open, you know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, if it wouldn't be asking too much of you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I started to reply, fumbling for words, while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood rushed all at once to my head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will be a pleasure. And besides"--here she hesi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated momentarily, and her fingers absently toyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the folds of her gown--"besides, if I help you</seg><seg type="columnLine">with your book, I will also be helping the State."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, possibly that's true," I conceded. And so-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what could I do but agree to give Aelios a further</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity to help the State?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But if I based any glamorous hopes upon her evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendliness, I was building without knowledge of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">foundations. Not long after my visit to her, a chance</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation showed me how far I was from that goal</seg><seg type="columnLine">which my more sanguine fancies pictured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was Xanocles that unwittingly made me see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulties. During one of our numerous little</seg><seg type="columnLine">talks, he touched casually upon the marriage system</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Atlantis. "The Milares Compulsory Population</seg><seg type="columnLine">Law," he chanced to inform me, "is perhaps not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only reason for the present superiority of the Atlan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tean stock. Another factor is what I may call the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marital selection. This is regulated primarily by cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom and is almost exclusively in the hands of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">women, yet is so rigid that an inferior man can hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">find a mate--indeed, a superior woman would be dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graced by linking herself to a weakling."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But just what do you mean by a weakling?" I in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Xanocles looked at me in surprise. "A weakling, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, is one with nothing to give to society. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">great poet, for example, could never be thought of as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakling; nor a competent painter, nor philosopher, nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">musician, nor biologist. But the man whose contribu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions show no particular skill or individuality is re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">garded as a weakling, no mattter what his pursuit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Naturally, he is not condemned so long as he does his</seg><seg type="columnLine">best; but he is not regarded as a fit subject for mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riage except with another weakling--and, needless to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, weaklings are not permitted to propagate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If Xanocles noticed that I was moody and silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the rest of the day, the reason would not have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been hard to find. I do not believe that, in my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, I had ever suffered from what is known as an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inferiority complex; but among the Atlanteans, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their higher standards, mere honesty demanded that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">question my own qualifications. And what, I won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered, had I to offer to a woman such as Aelios?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Would not my meagre attainments appear childish and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unattractive to her? Even if I finished my "History</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Upper World," would it not be a second-rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">affair, altogether incapable of winning her admira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion? And would I not, by comparison with the na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives, be considered a weakling, a man whom Aelios</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not marry without incurring disgrace?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For days and weeks I was harassed by such</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughts; and it was to be long before I had wholly</seg><seg type="columnLine">recovered. Meanwhile, however, I was partially con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soled by the companionship of Xanocles. The friend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship begun at our first meeting, was strengthening</seg><seg type="columnLine">and solidifying in the course of the months; the prox-</seg><seg type="columnLine">imity of our lodgings rendered it easy for us to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">one another, but there also seemed to be a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">proximity of mind, which made each of us take pleas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ure in the company of the other; and in spite of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gulf of race, training and experience, we found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">352</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">we actually had more in common than many persons</seg><seg type="columnLine">who have spent all their lives in the same home. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">eo he would often seek me out, and we would spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours exchanging ideas in the dim seclusion of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms; and often I would seek him out, and we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold friendly debates in the quiet of his rooms; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not infrequently we might have been seen strolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm in arm about the city, while I pictured to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wonders and vastness of the upper world, or while</seg><seg type="columnLine">he in his turn regaled me with colorful reminiscences,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and told how he was employed by the State as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">binder and designer of books, but how he spent his</seg><seg type="columnLine">spare time in writing economic and philosophical treat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ises or delivering lectures in favor of the Emergence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was under the pilotage of Xanocles that I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Introduced to the social life of Atlantis. The Atlan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teans did not spend all their time in grave and serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuits, as I had at first imagined; they did not de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vote themselves to art until it palled upon them, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">seek for beauty until it became blurred and illusory;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but they knew how to vary their lives and make them</seg><seg type="columnLine">symmetrical, and they had quite as much time for</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughter and recreation as for earnest endeavor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sober thought. Indeed, they proved to be an unusu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally sociable people; and after I had entered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xanocles into the rare spirit of their life and pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times, I was forced to conclude that a prime reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the success of Atlantean society was the sane</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance it preserved, and the fact that its more ideal</seg><seg type="columnLine">aims were tempered by a recognition and a measured</seg><seg type="columnLine">encouragement of all the normal inclinations of man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR sheer range and variety, the Atlantean pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times excelled those of any other people I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever encountered. To begin with the simplest first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were athletic games, races and competitions that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been popular even in the upper world;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and on the outskirts of Archeon were fields where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young and even the middle-aged gathered in crowds,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">testing their prowess by boxing and wrestling, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurling round, flat objects like the ancient discus, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprinting along specified race-courses, by engaging in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of ball game remotely like tennis, or by partici-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pating in that more popular contest know as "sortos,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">which reminded me of baseball except for the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it did not require so many players. I was surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">to observe that the Atlanteans could enter into these</seg><seg type="columnLine">sports with hot enthusiasm; but I also noted that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could view their athletics with sanity, and were inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested in their games only while actually engaged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and did not come forth in throngs as mere on-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookers, nor waste time discussing the contests before-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand or after they were over, nor prostitute their</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit to a professional or commercial outlook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not less popular than the athletics--in fact, prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably much more popular--were the dances that fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured prominently in Atlantean life. These were of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred styles and varieties, from the ethereal butter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fly movements of trained women, such as Aelios, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tripping and capering of children keeping time</seg><seg type="columnLine">spontaneously to the rhythm of a song. Leaving out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of account the dances for which unusual skill was</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary, the most interesting to my mind were those</seg><seg type="columnLine">held on the polished floors of the temples, where as</seg><seg type="columnLine">many as a hundred men and women would gather, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">swaying synchroneously to the subdued beat of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">music, some in couples holding hands and some singly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but all lightly passing back and forth with bird-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">co-ordinated movements, until as one watched, one lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight of individuals and thought of them all only as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parts of some exquisite, ever-varying whole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was not surprising to me to observe that the At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantean love of the dance was matched by an equal</seg><seg type="columnLine">taste for music. Having no technical musical knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge, I cannot comment upon the Atlantean develop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the art, except to say that its cultivation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">widespread, that public concerts were held almost daily</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the halls of Archeon, and that invariably their effect</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Til at this noise was somehow connected with the quickening wind was apparent from the first; and the relationship became evident when the path</seg><seg type="columnLine">swerved abruptly away from the wall and I glanced back, to behold a series of queer-looking machines supported on stone pedestals high up</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the glass. It would be impossible to say just what the machines were like ... so swiftly were they rotating that they formed each a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gray blur through which tho green of tho wall was vaguely discernible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">353</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">upon me was pleasing beyond anything I had ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard on earth. Perhaps it was that the Atlantean</seg><seg type="columnLine">music possessed in high degree the power of awaken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing ecstacy and visions; perhaps it was that its re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strained melancholy and plaintive rapture were as keys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that unlocked a universe beyond the universe of sense,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and brought the time-bound spirit into touch with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">timeless; but, at all events, it possessed a ravishing</seg><seg type="columnLine">power reminding me of the most consummate violin</seg><seg type="columnLine">performances, and yet surpassing even the violin in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the almost complete severance it effected between</seg><seg type="columnLine">body and soul.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Much the same may be said of the drama in At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantis--a drama almost as popular as the music, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">built like the music upon that beauty which reaches</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond time and space. The prose drama seems never</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have been introduced; poetry, as the natural vehicle</seg><seg type="columnLine">for ecstatic expression, was evidently regarded as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">inevitable substance of all plays; and the playwrights</seg><seg type="columnLine">were all in a tradition that might have appealed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sophocles and Euripides, although they had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard of those master dramatists. Indeed, Atlantis</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a score of dramatic writers who in my judgment</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in no way inferior to any produced by classical</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greece; and the best works of these authors, staged</seg><seg type="columnLine">with picturesque simplicity and presented by actors of</seg><seg type="columnLine">power, afforded me some of the most absorbing hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">I passed during all my years in Atlantis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But if delighted by such performances, I was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">less pleased to note that dramatics flourished also on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small scale. In any little social gathering one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most popular diversions would be the improviza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and acting of short plays; and the proficiency of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Atlanteans in this game seemed almost incredible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me, for the actors would not only originate their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own little dramas, but would speak their impromptu</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines with feeling and beauty; and so deeply was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spirit of poetry engrained that long fluent passages</seg><seg type="columnLine">of exceptional verse would sometimes be delivered</seg><seg type="columnLine">spontaneously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beyond these dramatic exhibitions, the chief private</seg><seg type="columnLine">pastime of the Atlanteans was in the art of discus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. To say that discussion was an art is not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">exaggerate; it was believed that the mark of the cul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured man was his ability to express himself intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently ; and themes for consideration in an Atlantean</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing room varied from the latest poetry and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">latest music to the nature of the human personality</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the ultimate meaning of life. To the self-re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">specting citizen, it would have been an insult to</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggest that he avoid the boredom of conversation by</seg><seg type="columnLine">games of dominoes or cards; and it would have seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">ludicrous to attempt to gossip concerning one's food or</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes, one's athletic prowess, one's neighbor's idio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">syncrasies or bad manners, or any of those hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one subjects that might have proved diverting in</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper world conversation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHILE Xanocles was introducing me to the social</seg><seg type="columnLine">life of Atlantis, much of my time was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken up by social life of a different type. Now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 had been elevated to the dignity of Atlantean citizen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, I could not forget that I had thirty-eight com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rades who aspired to a similar honor. I saw fully as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much of my former shipmates as before; indeed, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw some of them more than ever, and in particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">Captain Gavison, who would frequently visit me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">exchange reminiscences; and I rubbed shoulders with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole crew at the regular bi-weekly meetings of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Upper World Club, which were now held in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These meetings were sometimes exciting affairs, per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">haps because there was little else in Atlantis which</seg><seg type="columnLine">offered the possibility of excitement. Looking back</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the lapse of years, it is not easy for me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">recall just what there was to be agitated about; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is certain that we would be agitated indeed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there would be fiery debates and discussions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which occasionally became so heated that President</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gavison would rap and rap with the bit of stone that</seg><seg type="columnLine">served him as gavel, raising his voice until he almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouted and the sheer awe of his presence would re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">store order. As nearly as I can remember, most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disputes were due to conflicting opinions of At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantis; for frequently one of the club members would</seg><seg type="columnLine">denounce the Sunken World in the most picturesque</seg><seg type="columnLine">terms at his disposal; and immediately some cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pion of Atlantis would spring to his feet in disagree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and the debate would wax fast and furious,</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the club taking a part, until the imperious</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice of the President would put an end to the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">test.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sometimes, however, the altercation would be over</seg><seg type="columnLine">some proposal for improving our status in Atlantis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many and curious were the views as to the draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">backs of our lot; and one of our members would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely to suggest that we attempt the construction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a motor boat or of an automobile; and another would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be convinced that a prime shortcoming of Atlantis</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the absence of the phonograph or of motion pic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures; and many would toy fondly with the idea of</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape, and would advocate wild and wholly imprac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tical schemes that would foment a tumult in the club.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As time went by, it became increasingly apparent that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the majority would never be reconciled to Atlantis;</seg><seg type="columnLine">they felt estranged by its art, overwhelmed by its</seg><seg type="columnLine">majesty, irritated by its suave peacefulness; and while</seg><seg type="columnLine">they still studied the native language for several hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">a day, and at times derived much satisfaction from</seg><seg type="columnLine">being allowed a part in the native pastimes and ath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">letics, yet on the whole they felt out of place in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere not adapted to them, and were coming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look upon the upper world as a sort of lost Elysium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXVI</seg><seg type="columnLine">Curiosities, Freaks and Monstrosities</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EVEN though my companions felt constantly ill at</seg><seg type="columnLine">ease in Atlantis, yet as the weeks went by they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were'becoming more proficient in the use of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">native tongue and were taking their places in the life</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Sunken World. One by one they were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">summoned, as I had been summoned, before the Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mittee on Selective Assignments; and each in turn was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered to perform some specified daily work after</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking the usual thirty days' tour around Atlantis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Captain Gavison, as one of the most adept of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">in mastering the language, was one of the first to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">graduated into citizenship. But his advancement</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him no great pleasure, since his prescribed</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty was to spend two and a half hours daily in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bureau engaged in compiling statistics of population</seg><seg type="columnLine">and industry; and his chosen work for the State,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was to write a comparison of Atlantean and</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper world civilization, gave him no end of trouble</seg><seg type="columnLine">owing not only to linguistic difficulties but to his lack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of training in authorship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile Stranahan and Rawson had also matricu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lated into citizenship; but their assigned work differed</seg><seg type="columnLine">strikingly from the Captain's. Rawson, as a well</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed and brawny youth, was permitted to exercise</seg><seg type="columnLine">his muscles for an hour and a half daily in a marble</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarry some miles to the north of the city; while</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stranahan, who had been given his choice of several</seg><seg type="columnLine">354</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">occupations, decided that it would suit him best to</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve three hours daily as doorman at the Archeon</seg><seg type="columnLine">City Museum.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seemed almost as if this position had been made</seg><seg type="columnLine">to order for him; for when he stood at the museum</seg><seg type="columnLine">entrance, robed in an official red, and politely directed</seg><seg type="columnLine">visitors to the various aisles and departments, he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dignity of one born to a lofty station, His work</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not altogether easy, he assured me, for the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hibits were many and confusing, and he had difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">in memorizing their names and positions; yet to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as he swayed commandingly from side to side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great arched doorway, with chest thrown well out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hands folded sedately behind him, one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely have believed that he was troubled by any</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubts, but might have imagined him to be the owner</seg><seg type="columnLine">and creator of the building.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Indeed, the interest which he took in the museum</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be almost personal. He summoned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole Upper World Club to inspect it, as though it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been his own handiwork; and he directed us from</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallery to gallery and from exhibit to exhibit with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the serenity of perfect knowledge. And while there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was much about the institution that neither he nor the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of us could understand, yet we had him to thank</seg><seg type="columnLine">for introducing us to some truly extraordinary dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plays.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unquestionably, the museum was one of the things</seg><seg type="columnLine">best worth seeing in all Atlantis. Not only were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contents vivid and remarkable beyond description, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the building itself was a never-failing source of won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der. The sides and roof were of glass, and, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower levels the walls were colorless and transparent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that passers-by could feast their eyes on the more</seg><seg type="columnLine">conspicuous displays, just as on earth the passers-by</seg><seg type="columnLine">may gaze into the shop windows. But above the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">story the glass was no longer crystal-clear, but was</seg><seg type="columnLine">frosted and tinted to the semblance of clouds driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">across a pale blue sky; and over those clouds and down</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the enormous rounded dome a dim rainbow</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to reach, spreading a web that varied in hue</seg><seg type="columnLine">and texture with every step one took and every varia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in the luster of the searchlights that shone faintly</seg><seg type="columnLine">from above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To glance at this superb building, one would never</seg><seg type="columnLine">have guessed what queer objects it concealed. For my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own part, I was simply astounded--astounded at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beauty of some exhibits, at the strangeness and ghast-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liness of others. The department of science and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ventions (to select merely at random) was a source of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bewilderment, for it showed the oddest contrivances I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever beheld--machines for preventing earthquakes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines for regulating the undersea temperature,</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines for detecting and isolating noxious bacteria,</seg><seg type="columnLine">machines for transforming iron into copper or tin</seg><seg type="columnLine">into lead, machines for boring through the ground as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a submarine bores through the water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But what particularly interested me was the his-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torical department. I shall never forget my first visit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it; it was one of the most surprising experiences of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my life. Imagine, for example, a glass case that con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained nothing but the fragment of a brick wall, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly commonplace wall of red brick!--and imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">reading that this was a substance employed for build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing purposes in the days before the iEsthetic Renais-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sance! Or, again, picture yourself in contact with</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a dozen gold coins, larger than silver dollars and</seg><seg type="columnLine">each worth several days' wages, yet left unguarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">where any one might seize them!--and fancy reading</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these bits of metal had once been considered val-</seg><seg type="columnLine">uable and had even been contended for and hoarded!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Or, to take still another illustration, conceive of one's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise at seeing a carefully treasured speck of coal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and being informed that this was used for fuel in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the days before intra-atomic energy; or paint for your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self the shock of coming across a case of fine jewelry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rings, earrings, brooches, bracelets, and the like,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to find them represented as typical of primitive</seg><seg type="columnLine">taste!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT while all of the historical department proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">most diverting to me, there wa3 one section that</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested me more than all the rest. This was known</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the "Hall of Horrors." Once having observed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">title, I was eager to explore the department in detail</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and I was not to be disappointed. Somehow, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was something about the "Hall of Horrors" that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed familiar, even though a placard at the entrance</seg><seg type="columnLine">assured one that all the exhibits had been preserved</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a remote antiquity. Thus, the first thing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I noted was a gas masque said to date from the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">century B. S., but looking as if it might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">useful in the present World War. Beside the gas</seg><seg type="columnLine">masque was a steel helmet reported to be from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth century B. S.; yet, had it not been for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">card identifying it, I might have suspected it of</seg><seg type="columnLine">being taken from the Germans this very year.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This suspicion, however, would not have applied to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other military implements ranged about the room;</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of them were so crude of design as to make me</seg><seg type="columnLine">positively smile. Even as I write this, I can re-capture</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mood of exultation I felt at the proof of our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">superiority: the rifles of the second century B. S. were</seg><seg type="columnLine">so puny-looking and feeble as to appear worse than</seg><seg type="columnLine">primitive, and the bayonets were fully half a foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorter than our own; the machine guns of the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">century B. S. had obviously not half the killing ca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pacity of ours, and the cannons were not constructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for long distance firing; while the conspicuous absence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the armored "tank," the hand grenade and "liquid</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire," showed that the ancient Atlanteans would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">had much to learn from the sanguinary experts of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the "Hall of Horrors" Stranahan conducted us</seg><seg type="columnLine">into another and scarcely less interesting department</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was apparently nameless, since its miscellany of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancient oddities would have defied classification. "Here's</seg><seg type="columnLine">where you'll feel at home," grunted our guide, as with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gesture of welcome he preceded us through the door-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. But his remark had been poorly chosen. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not feel in the least at home. In fact, I had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a more distinct reminder of my exile than when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gazed at great brick and iron chimneys towering</seg><seg type="columnLine">within glass cases, and catalogued as typical of "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Age of Steel and Fire"; and it made me almost home-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sick to see pictures of long-vanished cities wrapped, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">great clouds of smoke and soot, and described suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cinctly as "Representative of the Tubercular Era in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Old Atlantis." But much more surprising to me were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the huge ancient furnaces, resurrected in detail, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">puppet stokers in the act of pitching the coal into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant flames. An explanatory card naively declared</seg><seg type="columnLine">that "These were once considered necessary evils, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only for industrial reasons, but because the Sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mergence had not yet made possible the automatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">regulation of the weather,"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But an apparently insignificant object in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">department aroused far greater interest among my</seg><seg type="columnLine">companions. Carefully guarded under a glass cover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it had evidently undergone some special process</seg><seg type="columnLine">of preservation, was a flat, little rectangle of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrivelled brownish substance, which upon close scru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny I took to be tobacco!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That my guess had been correct was demonstrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">355</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">by a placard that accompanied the exhibit: "This is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fragment of a narcotic imported into old Atlantis from</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the western ocean. It found high favor at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">time among the women of the country, and to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lesser extent among the men, although its use was</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered a mark of effeminacy. There were several</seg><seg type="columnLine">common ways of absorbing this drug, the most popu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lar being to ignite it and suck the smoke into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs by means of a little twisted tube. Happily, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">disgusting habit has long ago disappeared, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elimination of this plant at the time of the Good De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction is not the least of the benefits conferred by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agripides.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am afraid that few of my companions agreed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter statement. They cast longing glances in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the direction of the tobacco; and, had it not been safely</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded beneath glass, its career would surely have</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended then and there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the memory of the tobacco still rankling in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our minds, we were escorted into what was known as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the "Department of Human Evolution." Here was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picted the rise of man from the lowest savage state</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the height of present-day Atlantis. A series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">skeletons indicated the gradual transformation from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a broad-boned, ape-like thing to a big-skulled modern</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and, to my great surprise, the large cranial capacity</seg><seg type="columnLine">was represented as belonging almost exclusively to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboriginal and Post-Submergence eras!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHILE I was wondering why this should be, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanced to overhear the words of a sagacious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking bearded man, who accompanied a party of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth-faced youths, evidently as their tutor. "Before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Submergence," he was saying, "we were civilized</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a rude sort of way, and yet were not intelligent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That is to say, we were not intelligent as a people,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for only one man in a hundred possessed any under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing of civilization; and it was that one in a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred, or perhaps one in a thousand, who accomplished</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the changes in science, art and culture. Today,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, every normal man is intelligent enough to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than the dead lumber of civilization. You will ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serve this skull here"--the speaker paused, and pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one of the most ancient of the group--"this is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fossil of a paleolithic pre-Atlantean, who inhabited our</seg><seg type="columnLine">island forty-five or fifty thousands years ago. You can</seg><seg type="columnLine">see for yourselves how much higher and ampler the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skull is than that of your own ancestor of thirty-two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred years ago, although of course the latter repre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented the world's most advanced civilization. For-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunately, our intellectual decline was counteracted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vigorous measures of Agripides and his successors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we can now boast of being on the same high men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal plane as the men of fifty thousand years ago. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The speaker withdrew with his students toward a</seg><seg type="columnLine">further exhibit, and I could catch no more of what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. But I had heard quite enough, for it seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that his words were not to be taken seriously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I was more interested in browsing about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallery than in listening to his pointless remarks--</seg><seg type="columnLine">particularly since I had chanced to set eyes on some</seg><seg type="columnLine">arresting tables of statistics. These figures, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">dated back more than three thousand years, showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">how the rise in the appreciation of beauty had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost simultaneous with the growth of intellect; how</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mental advance and the decline of crime seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">likewise to be related phenomena; how the general</seg><seg type="columnLine">measure of happiness, as indicated by the absence of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous disorders, mental abberations and suicides, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been incalculably increased since the intellectual re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vival.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having read to the end of the statistics, I passed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with my companions down several long corridors to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the art departments, where some of the more notable</seg><seg type="columnLine">contemporary paintings and statues were placed on</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhibition along with a multitude of classic works.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But if I were to dwell upon the contents of these gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leries, beyond saying that its art was in that same ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quisite and original style I had already observed, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have to add chapters to my story; and, like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise, I should find my narrative interminable if I were</seg><seg type="columnLine">to describe the other exhibits: the natural history de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment, with specimens of the flora and fauna of</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Atlantis, the paleo-botanical department with life-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like restorations of long-extinct tree-ferns and gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">palms, the sociological-historical departments, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">represenations of scenes in prisons, poorhouses, orphan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ages, and insane asylums, all of which were declared to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been "herding places of the days when unfor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunates were so plentiful that they had to be dealt</seg><seg type="columnLine">with by the pack, instead of, as at present, being con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed individually to the care of those sympathetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and women who make social work their service</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the State."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But while the sheer abundance of the exhibits makes</seg><seg type="columnLine">it impossible to describe them all, there is one that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must not fail to mention, since in some ways it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most remarkable in the museum. We had just en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the section ambiguously known as "Curiosities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Freaks and Monstrosities," when Stranahan, with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd twinkling expression, warned us to be ready for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a surprise. And, certainly, he warned us with good</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason! As we glanced toward the further wall, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were shocked by sight of something dazzlingly fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliar--so very familiar, indeed, that several of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">uttered little cries of amazement. Neatly arranged be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind a glass case, flattened against the rear panels so</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to afford a better view, were dozens of well known</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue uniforms! Among them, from the Ensign's</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripes, I recognized my own; and among them, also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the decorated uniform of the Captain! And above</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, on a large-lettered placard, appeared the state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment that these were the clothes worn by the only aliens</seg><seg type="columnLine">to enter Atlantis since the Submergence, and that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were interesting as showing what grotesque and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sightly garments were fashionable in the upper world!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXVII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Warning of the Waters</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALTHOUGH at times during my first months in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantis I may have felt out of place and wished</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the waters would open above me and bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">me back to my own land, yet my longings were never</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixed with misgivings and my regrets never tinged</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fears. Even in my most pessimistic moments, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had-ho doubt but that the Sunken World was secure;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that no menace to life or tranquility lurked in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-ordered depths; that I might live out my days</seg><seg type="columnLine">unmolested and in a peaceful routine. Hence I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the more shocked at discovery of that peril which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to give Atlantis the aspect of a beleaguered city,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to overcast its beauty with foreboding and horror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had been in Atlantis over a year when the crisis</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred.

And, like such a disease,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might have been checked had it only been discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered in time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I remember that one night, after many onerous hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">devoted to my "History of the Upper World," I slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">356</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">but poorly, with an intermittent slumber disturbed by;</seg><seg type="columnLine">nightmares of huge towers crashing to destruction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And during the wakeful intervals my thoughts framed</seg><seg type="columnLine">other nightmares, and I was agitated by a vague</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarm and excitement, though I could not understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">. .why.

I wondered. Had the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Atlanteans all suddenly gone mad? Or were they fac-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing an insurrection or a civil war? Or had the gov-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ernment perhaps been overthrown by a band of in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">surgents? Or had there been an earthquake through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which I had somehow slept? Or was there an in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vasion from the upper world, and had some of our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">countrymen, seeking for clues of the lost X-lll, dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">covered the Sunken World and entered?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  All these possibilities, as I turned them over in my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mind, seemed so fantastic that I had to discard them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Yet it still filled me with apprehension to observe the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">natives scurrying about the streets--apprehension that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was to be speedily justified.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">I WAS just preparing to go out and investigate when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there came an excited rapping at my door. Un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">able to imagine who might be seeking me at this early</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hour, I cried out sharply, "Come in!"; and the door</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">swung abruptly open to admit--Captain Gavison!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He was far from his composed and normal self. His</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pale blue costume was all ruffled, and had been flung</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">over his shoulders as though in great haste; his long</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hair hung dishevelled over his narrow bronzed brow;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his face looked all hot and sweaty; his gray eyes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">burned and sparkled with a vague distress.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He did not wait for a formal greeting. "Have you--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">have you heard the news?" he gasped, as he strode</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I confessed that I had heard nothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Don't see how you could help hearing!" he snapped,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and began to pace slowly about the floor, with brow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wrinkled in bitter thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What news is it?" I demanded. "Just what have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">you heard?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "One of the natives told me strange things last</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">night," he confided, as he continued his restless peram-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">bulations about the room. "I haven't slept a wink,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not a wink!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "What strange things? We're not going to be sent</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">back home, are we?" I inquired, with an abortive</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">effort to be facetious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "We'll be sent to a worse place than that!" he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">growled, bristling almost into his old military man-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ner. "The glass wall has been cracked!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "The glass wall cracked?" I cried, stupidly, stunned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by the terror of the words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, the glass wall has been cracked," the Captain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">affirmed, in a more matter-of-fact manner. "One of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the patrol boats discovered the damage late yester-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">day afternoon. There's a dangerous fracture near the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">entrance of the Salty River."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For reply I could only groan. The glass wall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantis cracked!--the whole Atlantic Ocean bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">down upon the Sunken World! Too well I understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">what that meant, too well to require comment! And</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that first moment of horrible realization I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">visions of torrents pouring through a gap in the wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooding over the streets and temples and highest</seg><seg type="columnLine">towers of the land!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how--how under heaven did it happen?" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst forth, when I had half recovered from the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggering blow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is not hard to say," he declared, slowly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in measured tones. "At least, there are suspicions--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suspicions?" I demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suspicions that you and I and the rest of us are</seg><seg type="columnLine">to blame."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how is that possible?" I exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's possible, all right. It all happened before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">got here. The X-lll, caught in the whirlpool out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the Salty River, was hurled by the force of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters against the glass wall, probably striking with</seg><seg type="columnLine">its steel prow, which, as you know, was built for ram-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ming our foes. The wall, luckily, was too stout to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">shattered; but it was cracked, and the crack must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been growing all this time without being noticed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Merciful gods!" I cried. "Then if--if anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">happens to Atlantis, it will be all on account of us!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But before Gavison had had time to reply, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">came another rapping at the door. And, hardly wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for my summons, a wild-eyed Xanocles burst in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like my other visitor, he did not waste time on greet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings. "You--do you know?" he faltered, with a lack</seg><seg type="columnLine">of self-command most unusual in him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Solemnly we assured him that we knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without further delay we plunged into the subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had brought him to us. "Maybe you'd like to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">and see for yourselves?" he suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how can we see for ourselves?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The government--that is to say, the High Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adviser--has ordered the intra-atomic river boats put</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the people's disposal. Seven of them are now</seg><seg type="columnLine">plying back and forth, bearing thousands to the glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. The Adviser thinks the people should see for</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves just what has happened."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Very well then, let's go," decided the Captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without another word the three of us set out to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether. In silence we strode down the long avenue</seg><seg type="columnLine">that meandered toward the river. And as we sped</seg><seg type="columnLine">along we encountered dozens of the natives, all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in as great a hurry as we; and all had faces</seg><seg type="columnLine">flushed and excited, or fearful and drawn, or pale as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though with apprehension.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">UPON arriving at the piers, we found that hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds of Atlanteans had preceded us, most of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">so transformed that I could hardly recognize them as</seg><seg type="columnLine">citizens of the Sunken World; for they were chatter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wildly, or pacing distractedly back and forth, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">uttering half-hysterical exclamations; and one or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">were mumbling and muttering to themselves, or moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lips silently in what might have been prayer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But they did not fail to notice our arrival; angry</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclamations broke forth at sight of us, and several</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the men and women withdrew visibly from U3;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, in my surprise, I did not know whether to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ascribe their hostility to the unpopularity of Xanocles'</seg><seg type="columnLine">or to the part that Gavison and I had played as un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious agents of disaster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To calm the excited multitude, a vigorous-looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man ventured to raise his voice, and proclaim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Friends, there is still no reason for alarm. We do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet know how serious the damage may be, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">357</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">glass wall still holds; not a drop of water has broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">through. . . .

Yet I was relieved when at last the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boat hove into view, a slender affair as long as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">longest river vessel, but not more than twenty-five</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet from rail to rail. I did not then give any at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention to its details, though I did note how low-lying</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was, with but one visible deck, one small cabin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">no smokestack or mast. But after it had drawn up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the pier and the gangplank was flung down, I wasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">no time about boarding it with my two companions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Benches and chairs were strewn liberally about the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck, sufficient to accommodate the entire crowd; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had hardly taken seats when the boat commenced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shiver and throb, and we started upstream with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the velocity of an express train.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So rapidly did we move that in less than an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were approaching the head of the Salty River. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">during the interval I only once ventured to break the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moody solitude of my own thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When did you find out about all this?" I asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xanocles, who like the rest of us seemed to be ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorbed in bitter reveries.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Last night," he returned, in an abstracted manner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I chanced to be in the Hall of Public Enlightenment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and heard the news over the Autophone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Autophone?" I demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, naturally, you wouldn't know what that is,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained Xanocles. "We get our ordinary news by</seg><seg type="columnLine">wireless telegraph, of course, and it is then reported</seg><seg type="columnLine">by speakers at the various public meeting places. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Autophone is more effective, and is used only on</seg><seg type="columnLine">rare and important occasions. It operates instan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneously, and consists of a tube and electrical attach-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, enabling one to hear a speaker miles away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I understand," said I, for, after all, the Autophone</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not impress me as unfamiliar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And with that we lapsed again into silenec, a silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">shared by all the hundreds of passengers. For now</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they had actually embarked upon the voyage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their excitement seemed to have died down to a mood</seg><seg type="columnLine">of solemn waiting, a tense and painful waiting all too</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent in the rigid, staring faces of the men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the women's pale cheeks and frightened eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was with relief that at length I saw the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">growing white and agitated ahead of us, and knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we were not far from the valve where the tor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rents were hurled in from the sea. Yet I was filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with impatience before we swerved finally into a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">side canal and our boat came to a landing before a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long granite dock whence a sister ship was just leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. I need hardly state that I lost no time in step-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping across the gangplank, as soon as the crowded</seg><seg type="columnLine">state of the deck permitted; and though we were still</seg><seg type="columnLine">three or four miles from the glass wall, I was thankful</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be able to walk the distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TO watch my two companions and myself set out</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the clay footpath toward the wall, one might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have thought that we were athletes training for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">race. But if we moved rapidly, we were in no way</seg><seg type="columnLine">exceptional, for there were scores who easily kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace with us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For many minutes we hastened parallel to the Salty</seg><seg type="columnLine">River. We passed the long, white rapids; we passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spot where the gigantic jet of water shot thunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out of the pipe-like valve; we saw the wall itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">sloping down before us, and near the wall we could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">make out a long, black mass which ultimately resolved</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself into a multitude of humans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This multitude, as we drew near, showed itself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be in a wildly agitated condition. Men and women</seg><seg type="columnLine">were pacing frantically to and fro, swarming and</seg><seg type="columnLine">squirming like worms or ants; some were gesticulating</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehemently, some speaking in high-pitched tones audi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble from afar, some merely standing petrified like men</seg><seg type="columnLine">dealt a blow too great to bear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet, as we took our places among them, we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">observe nothing that gave cause for alarm. To our</seg><seg type="columnLine">right loomed the elongated, steely gray valve, a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube as high as a three-story building, which narrowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it approached the wall, and passed through it on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a level with the ground. And just before us sloped</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall itself, now roped off so that we could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">come within a stone's throw, but apparently still the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same smooth, dark greenish barrier I had viewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">months before. No sign of any break or crack was</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible, and it was almost with disappointment that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed how flawless it seemed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But while I stood there watching I heard a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">swishing sound, like the lapping of sea-waves against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocks. I may have been mistaken, for amid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chattering and shouting of the mob and the distant</seg><seg type="columnLine">roaring of waters from the valve, it was difficult to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure just what one heard. But Gavison and Xanocles</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to note that same ominous noise, and both</seg><seg type="columnLine">paused to listen, while the anxious expression on their</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces did not relieve my misgivings. "It's the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">working through the inner layers of the glass," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought I heard Xanocles remark; but here again I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be sure, for even as he spoke a tumult of</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouts burst forth, and I turned in sudden fright to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see what was the matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time I did not have long to wait. On one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great roof-supporting stone columns a searchlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been mounted; and I observed that it was slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging round, casting a piercing illumination upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall from a bright, yellow eye glaring like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">headlight of a locomotive. For a moment it shook and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavered as if it could not find a focus; then it became</seg><seg type="columnLine">rigid and still, and a circle of the wall, many yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">across, stood out in brilliant relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly the people began to press forward. So</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited were they that for a moment I almost lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch with Gavison and Xanocles, and could catch no</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse of the illuminated patch of wall. And at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same time shrill cries of terror and dismay broke</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth. A man just to my rear groaned as if in pain;</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman gave a half suppressed sob; somewhere from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear came a hysterical wailing. Then, when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">circle in the wall again became visible, I was wedged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in so tightly that I scarcely gave it any attention. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only by degrees that I made out its features, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw what resembled an enormous piece of cracked</seg><seg type="columnLine">crockery. From an amorphous central blur several feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">across, great seams and fissures ran in a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">directions, with long, spidery arms that reached out</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the roots of a tree, gradually growing thinner till</seg><seg type="columnLine">they vanished in vacancy. It seemed a miracle that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water had not already burst through, for each of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the scores of diverging cracks were rods long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have been many feet deep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I DO not know how long I stood staring blankly at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that tragic break in the glass. I was as one</seg><seg type="columnLine">divested of power of thought or movement; I merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovered there transfixed, listening to the muttering</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sighing of the multitude. Strangely enough, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not occur to me to ask whether the damage could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be repaired; it was as though I had known all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">353</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wmB</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hubl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      Mpssi</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      iSlsai</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      sissd</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      immzm</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">HMMM</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    $*tMÂ§</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    &amp;&amp;Â£.rÂ£r&lt;ZW:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">       Â»-t'|&gt;.?t Â»?â wV^-tWrX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">!v,'Â«i',Â«v &gt;vV r'y/^i:^;&lt;v-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">â ' :.

A dull and</seg><seg type="columnLine">settled sadness had fallen over me; and, depressed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">no reason that I would have acknowledged, I expressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">my purpose of returning at once to Archeon, saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I had already seen everything there was to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But you haven't seen a thing yet," demurred Xan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocles, who seemed determined that I should remain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The submeusible repair ships have not yet arrived--</seg><seg type="columnLine">and when they come, they should be a sight worth</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he slipped his arm about mine, and drew me</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him toward the wall, while I still protested that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be better for me to return to Archeon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No doubt in the end I should have had my way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not another hubbub arisen to distract my atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Once more the thousands of voices were lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in excitement; but this time a note of joy was mani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fest, and even seemed to predominate. At the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, many hands pointed eagerly toward the illumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated circle in the glass; and from just behind me I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a thankful murmur that sounded encouragingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jike "The repair ships; They're here! They're here!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Indeed, the repair ships had arrived. Even through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkest sections of the wall, half a dozen faintly</seg><seg type="columnLine">phosphorescent cigar-shaped forms were dimly ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent. They were all rather small, scarcely more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a third of the size of the X-lll; but they seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be exceedingly agile, and were darting lithely back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forth like great fishes, or else were whirling or</seg><seg type="columnLine">pirouetting or standing almost on end, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken with giddiness and unable to control their</seg><seg type="columnLine">movements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're having the devil's own time!" muttered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xanocles, as he stood watching. "That's the worst</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger-spot in all the ocean, for the waters are con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly in a whirlpool because of the torrents emptied</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the Salty River. But our men are brave, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow they'll manage it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how can they set about it?" I inquired, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to imagine any way of making repairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's far from easy, but it can be done," continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xanocles. "One of the ships will have to press itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the wall, so closely that there is no space</seg><seg type="columnLine">between. Once all water has been excluded between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel and the wall, you understand, the pressure on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ocean side will keep the ship in place. And after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship is in the proper position, a porthole will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened, and through this the men will pour cement</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the crack."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even as Xanocles explained, an anchor was dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">from one of the ships into the rocky sea bottom; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vessel, having steadied itself, began to drift slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the wall, so that at length its side was pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly against the cracked glass. Then a little circle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of light seemed suddenly to open on the ship's side;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in that circle I could make out the rigid, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined faces of half a dozen men, while in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands I could observe a variety of strange rods, tubes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lantern-like contrivances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pessimistic as I had been before, I could not but</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel a burst of hope when I watched the capable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">courageous way in which these men set to work. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently the waiting throng had become hopeful too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for murmurs of admiration and approval were re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peatedly on their lips; and as they saw tube after</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube of cement poured skilfully into the cracks, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">became almost mad with relief; and some began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">clap their hands and caper childishly, and some sighed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in thanksgiving, and some wept silently, for, after all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantis seemed to have been saved!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, with the suddenness of a thunderbolt, all their</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes were dashed out. So swiftly did disaster de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scend that none had a chance to say how or whence</seg><seg type="columnLine">it came--but it was disaster complete and irretriev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. Perhaps it was that the anchor-chain holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">the submarine had snapped, or that some water had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeped in between the side of the vessel and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass wall. At all events, the submarine was plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible one moment, the men pumping the viscid</seg><seg type="columnLine">cement through long tubes to the very extremities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crack; and the next moment there was only a dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow flitting away into a watery obscurity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For an instant there was an awed silence. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as comprehension dawned upon the crowd, a convulsive</seg><seg type="columnLine">shudder swept it through and through, and a howl of</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror and dismay rang forth. Men glanced askance</seg><seg type="columnLine">at their neighbors, blank terror gaping from their</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes; and all at once, as by a common impulse, hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreds pressed confusedly toward the wall, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might succor thus those unfortunates lost in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">briny wastes. But many, conscious of the futility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all action, sadly remained in their places, and mutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowed their heads--a tribute of respect for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXVIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Waters Retreat</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE eight days that followed the discovery of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack were among the most harrying I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever spent. Indeed, they were among the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">harrying that any resident of Atlantis had ever spent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That the peril was acute became more and more ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent as the days went by and the damage was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">repaired--the submarine disaster which I had wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nessed was but the precurser to other and not less</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightful disasters. Vessel after vessel battled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the swirling waters in the effort to force itself against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall and cement the crack; and vessel after vessel</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shaken away like a twig by the fury of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">maelstrom. Sometimes, fortunately, the portholes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut in time and the crew managed to save their lives;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but on other occasions the maddened waters snatched</seg><seg type="columnLine">their prey; and before a week had gone by Atlantis</seg><seg type="columnLine">was mourning for seven lost parties of rescuers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the country was now in a tumult, I might almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">say in a delirium. The regular currents of life had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped short; men no longer went about their daily</seg><seg type="columnLine">duties; the libraries and art galleries were deserted;</seg><seg type="columnLine">the young were without tutors, the governmental de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partments without clerks; and the cities would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">360</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">been without bread, had it not been for the drastic</seg><seg type="columnLine">orders of the High Chief Adviser. But citizens who</seg><seg type="columnLine">once had been amply occupied would loiter aimlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the streets, or would flock to the Hall of Public</seg><seg type="columnLine">Enlightenment to hear the latest report over the Auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone; or else they would pace nervously along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colonnades, or stand discussing in small groups, nerve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">racked and bewildered as men under sentence of death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though I never heard them mention the fear that must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been uppermost in their minds, yet their pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces and shuddery manner gave proof of the dread</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was preying upon them; and my former shipmates</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I had reason to know how overmastering was their</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror, for that aversion I had already noted was deep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening, and the people would glance at us with hostility</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even accusation in their eyes, looking mute re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proach at us, as though our coming had been re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponsible (as indeed it had been) for the threatened</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of their world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every morning five or six of the little intra-atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">submarines would leave Atlantis through the valve in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eastern wall, where the waters of the Salty River</seg><seg type="columnLine">were forced back into the sea. And in the evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">(if they survived till evening) they would return</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the valve in the western wall, where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters of the Salty River found entrance. In the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terval, their occupants would work as courageously as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had ever known men to work, warring against odds</seg><seg type="columnLine">that were apparently insurmountable; while all At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantis would stand watching, or waiting at the Auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone for news of their progress. It seemed wrongful</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my comrades and me that these men, brave and will-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as they were, should risk their lives to repair</seg><seg type="columnLine">an injury which we had caused; and so at Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gavison's suggestion several of us volunteered to join</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rescuing forces. But the High Chief Adviser,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although expressing his gratitude, refused our offer in</seg><seg type="columnLine">terms that could admit of no reply; for the repairing</seg><seg type="columnLine">crews, as he explained, consisted of skilled mechanics</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially trained for their duties and therefore irre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placeable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fortunately, our assistance was not necessary. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eighth day, the officials in charge of the repairs</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided upon a change of tactics; and then it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the "Acrola," a specially equipped submarine pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vided with five anchors and an extra battery in intra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic engines, made its way out of the Salty River</seg><seg type="columnLine">and around the glass dome to the scene of the damage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Truly, it was time that something desperate was done,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for, according to official measurements, the crack had</seg><seg type="columnLine">expanded between nine and ten inches since its detec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Thanks to its unusual powers of resistance, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, the "Acrola" withstood the buffeting of the waters</seg><seg type="columnLine">and remained pressed against the wall while Captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thermandos and his crew pumped the cement into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">innumerable fissures. Except for the extraordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage of the men, it is probable that they too would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have failed, for the task occupied them for more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">six hours, any moment of which might have been their</seg><seg type="columnLine">last; and they not only had to fill the cracks, but had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hold to their post till the cement had begun to</seg><seg type="columnLine">harden and was no longer in danger of being washed</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the notable fact is that they succeeded. Though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were worn and haggard from their exertions, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had succeeded magnificently. They had saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantis! After all, the flood-gates would not burst!--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the devouring waters would never race along the streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and colonnades! The people might return calmly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their work, certain that tomorrow would bring no</seg><seg type="columnLine">new menace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SUCH, at least, was the general impression. And so</seg><seg type="columnLine">great was the public relief that the pendulum</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung violently from a crisis of despair to an extreme</seg><seg type="columnLine">joy. Like men newly awakened from a nightmare, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlanteans refused to believe that the peril had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been utterly wiped away; and so great was the force</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the reaction, so sudden the snapping of the tension,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that for a while their emotions controlled their heads,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their desire to feel safe became converted into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">conviction that they were safe. Later, many of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to awaken from their self-hypnosis; but during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the celebration that followed the repairs, the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost without exception, acted as if convinced of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">rescue; and all the speakers at the great public gather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings referred in positive terms to the deliverance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantis; and the songs that were sung were songs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thanksgiving, as of triumphant escape from a foe;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the games and dances and festive processions were</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of a people wild with joy of new-won salvation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet even at the time there was at least one dissent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing voice. Like most dissenting voices at a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of popular emotion, it was but little heard, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">was heard contemptuously; yet it was often to be re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered in later days, when the occasion called for</seg><seg type="columnLine">little beyond regret.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Among the seven governmental experts sent to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vestigate the repairs and report on their soundness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was one who strenuously challenged the views of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his colleagues. While the other six agreed that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">damage had been remedied beyond possibility of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">further disturbance, the seventh (Peliades by name)</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought in a vigorous minority report in which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">contended that the relief was only temporary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His plea, as I remember it, ran somewhat as fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For four or five years--possibly for ten--the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pairs will prove adequate; but after that period the</seg><seg type="columnLine">damage will re-appear in a much more aggravated</seg><seg type="columnLine">form than before. For the cement constitutes a for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eign element in the glass, and produces an abnormal</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulge, so placing an exceptional strain upon those por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions which are still sound. For a while the wall may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to endure the strain, but in the course of time</seg><seg type="columnLine">the additional tension will become too great for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brittle material of the wall to resist; and first small</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracks will appear, and then larger, growing by inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">and by fractions of inches, until the break spreads</seg><seg type="columnLine">towards the surface, and the tremendous pressure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ocean shatters the remaining barrier. This effect,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, will take years before it begins to be notice-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able; but when finally it becomes apparent, the crack</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have spread so far that only heroic measures will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be able to save Atlantis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The remedy, therefore, is to undertake the imme-</seg><seg type="columnLine">diate erection of a new glass bulwark against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">affected portion of the wall. Prodigious though this</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort will necessarily be, we will probably be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete the work in time. But unless we do complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, we will find ourselves within a hair's breadth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">catastrophe."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unfortunately--most unfortunately, in view of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">ensued--Peliades' warning was scarcely heeded. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">some quarters he was denounced as a crank, a mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">alarmist; in other quarters he was openly laughed at,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or derided as the victim of hysteria; while the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jority paid no attention to him at all. Least sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathetic of his hearers were his fellow specialists; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">these, in response to an inquiry by the High Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adviser, testified at length as to the scientific unsound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of Peliades' theories, and disproved his views to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own satisfaction and that of the people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so the dissenter's motions were quietly tabled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">361</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and Atlantis returned to its normal duties with confi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence in the future.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXIX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Party of Emergence</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALTHOUGH all Atlantis resumed its normal aspect</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon after the wall had been repaired, things</seg><seg type="columnLine">were never again to be quite as before. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though there were some unseen fissure in the life</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Sunken World as well as in its glass boundary;</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though the people realized, subconsciously, that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">hovered on the rim of a smoldering volcano. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing seemed to be lacking that had been there before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps because something was present that had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been there before; and the corrosive effects of fear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">injected for the first time during all the centuries of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Submergence, seemed to dissipate the charmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">tranquility of Atlantis and to suggest that inimical</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even treacherous forces lurked beyond the marble</seg><seg type="columnLine">fountains and palaces and the weird green-golden dome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the one tangible result of the discovery of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crack was the rise of the Party of Emergence. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">despised minority group, whose very name had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a phrase of contempt, now burst into a prominence</seg><seg type="columnLine">as surprising to its members as to the people as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole, and for the first time in history, threatened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">become a power in Atlantean politics. Perhaps it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there were thousands who, beset by a secret dread,</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked to the Party of Emergence as their only salva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion; perhaps it was merely that they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">shocked into a more liberal-minded attitude, and could</seg><seg type="columnLine">view the policy of Emergence with wide-open eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At all events, a host of disciples flocked voluntarily to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Emergence banners; and among these were many</seg><seg type="columnLine">persons of influence and position, including Peliades,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engineer who had declared the wall unsound, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chorendos, the Local Adviser of Archeon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now began a heated and aggressive campaign,</seg><seg type="columnLine">conducted incessantly and not without success in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hall of Public Enlightenment of every town and vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage in Atlantis--a campaign that threatened to de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velop into a life-or-death struggle between the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">generated Emergence Party and the more venerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">Submergence group. It happened that I myself took</seg><seg type="columnLine">an active, if minor part in that contest; and it also</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened that the entire Upper World Club was im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plicated, for we all realized that the cause of Emer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gence offered us our only opportunity of returning to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Innumerable were the meetings that we attended,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and innumerable the pleas that we made. To give a</seg><seg type="columnLine">complete account of all our activities would be im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible, even if I could recall them all; and so I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to confine myself to describing a particular meet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, which stands forth in my mind as typical.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One afternoon, many months after the crack in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall had been sealed, Xanocles and I found ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparing for a strenuous session at the Hall of Pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lic Enlightenment. It had been rumored that the day's</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting was to be unusually interesting, and Xanocles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I were secretly determined to make it so; hence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we arrived at the sapphire and amber theatre</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found almost all the seats occupied, we felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had every reason to congratulate ourselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We took chairs in the rear, and quietly awaited out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn. A discussion was in progress regarding the</seg><seg type="columnLine">award of honor to be made to a certain lyric poet. (I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not know quite what the issue was, for I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">listen attentively.) But everyone understood that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not to be the topic of the day; and after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">question had been settled, a momentary hush came</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">over the audience and many pair3 of eyes were bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward us inquiringly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then it was that Xanocles arose. At a gesture from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that same broad-browed elderly woman who had pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sided when Gavison and his crew had been brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to trial long before, my friend stepped out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aisle and down to the central platform or stage, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">all eyes followed him intently and a speechless lull</seg><seg type="columnLine">dominated that great assemblage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fellow citizens," he said, not taking time even for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant's pause after reaching the foot of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stairs, "I am here today to make one of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">momentous proposals ever presented since Agripides</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleaded for the Submergence. But it is not a pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posal that has never been put forth before; it is merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">one that has never been endorsed. It has been, indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the very backbone of the Party of Emergence, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">will continue to be argued and preached until it meets</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that success which it merits. For it is impos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible, my friends, that Atlantis should retain its age-</seg><seg type="columnLine">old isolation; modern progress makes such backward-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness inconceivable, as the arrival of thirty-nine men</seg><seg type="columnLine">from outside has demonstrated. I am certain that if</seg><seg type="columnLine">Agripides himself were here now he would agree that</seg><seg type="columnLine">our policies must be revised."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here Xanocles paused as if for emphasis; but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">audience remained intently silent, and with increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">forcefulness he continued, "The question of emigra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, my friends, is one of the most important that can</seg><seg type="columnLine">confront any land. Never in the last three thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">years has Atlantis had an adequate law on this sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject; our prohibition of emigration has been a form</seg><seg type="columnLine">of intolerance unworthy of the high traditions of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">people; and free emigration, if forbidden by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arbitrary 'conventions of society, is justified by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mandates of nature and the normal human craving</seg><seg type="columnLine">for romance and adventure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Therefore I suggest that the fundamental law of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantis be modified.

"And that must necessarily be so, for what</seg><seg type="columnLine">can you have learned of the upper world? But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">happens that I, thanks to some years of experience,</seg><seg type="columnLine">do know a little of the upper world; and it is because</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this that I venture to address you on behalf of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the policy of Emergence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I paused momentarily, to pave the way for my next</seg><seg type="columnLine">point; and I observed that hundreds of pairs of eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were straining toward me, in a silence so intense that</seg><seg type="columnLine">one might have heard the dropping of the proverbial</seg><seg type="columnLine">pin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I shall not dwell upon the merely physical advan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tages of my own world," I continued. "I shall not</seg><seg type="columnLine">describe its wide spaces and splendid vistas, its tree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mantled valleys and sun-burnished lakes, its uproarious</seg><seg type="columnLine">white-splashed oceans and billowy mountains, dark</seg><seg type="columnLine">with forest or glittering with the snow. I shall not</seg><seg type="columnLine">linger over the tingling freshness of starry winter</seg><seg type="columnLine">nights, the feathery softness of the spring, the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chantment of firefly-haunted glades or of the ever-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shifting skies, with their fragile blue or gray or burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sunset red. I shall not discourse upon these sights,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for even in the upper world they are but little noted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">save by an occasional nature crank or poet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what I shall strive to make plain are those</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantages familiar to every thinking citizen of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth. Let me begin, for example, by picturing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">life of the typical dweller in our greatest city. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only in his home but in his work he enjoys the bene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fits of the most progressive civilization ever known.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To begin with, his dwelling may be of any type that</seg><seg type="columnLine">accords with his means and capacity, for if he likes</seg><seg type="columnLine">high places and can afford them, he may enjoy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">privilege of looking down upon his neighbors from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eleventh story; or, if he prefers exercise, he may</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk up to the sixth floor whenever he goes home; or,</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, if he be of a sluggish disposition, he may take</seg><seg type="columnLine">lodgings at street level--and all without extra charge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now let me depict the daily routine of such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. After being aroused in the morning by a won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful little clock that is almost human in its faith-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulness to habit, he slips hastily into his clothes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">consumes a breakfast perhaps featured by refriger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated beefsteak grown half a world away, and by coffee</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixed with the condensed milk of cows that lived far</seg><seg type="columnLine">away and long ago. Having thus'fortified himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the day's exigencies, he loses no time about</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving the house; and, in company with thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">as fortunate as himself, he enters a little hole in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, and twenty minutes or half an hour later</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerges from another and precisely similar hole five</seg><seg type="columnLine">or ten miles away. But this is the least of his con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veniences. After climbing from the second hole, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wedges his way into a little movable electric box in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">any of our downtown buildings, and promptly finds</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself delivered opposite his office on the fifteenth or</seg><seg type="columnLine">twentieth floor. He is now ready for the day's duties;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so marvelously simple is modern civilization that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no matter what those duties be, they are always the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For there is only one task that seems worth while</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the modern man, and that is the making of money.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just why money-making is so important is a question</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I personally cannot answer; but it must be im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">portant indeed, for every one becomes involved in it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">especially those who have more already than they</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what to do with; and this is doubtless why</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern civilization runs so smoothly, why the wheels</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn so regularly in so many mills, the shafts are sunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">so deeply in so many mines, the forests are cut so</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely from so many mountain sides, and men</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue to spread out and multiply despite battles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pestilences, labor wars, earthquakes, and explosions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN the latter part of my address I had rather lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">control of myself, saying things I had not intended</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say, things I did not exactly mean. But my en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thusiasm carried me along irresistibly, and it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">until I was launched into mid-channel that I paused</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a glimpse of my audience and observed the stares</seg><seg type="columnLine">of amazement; the nods of incredulity and the frowns</seg><seg type="columnLine">of repulsion with which my words were received. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly I was sorry, for now I remembered how once</seg><seg type="columnLine">before I had damaged my own cause by dwelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">indiscreetly upon the merits of the upper world. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">though I was following the wrong track I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how to find the right one--for unless I described</seg><seg type="columnLine">our industrial and mechanical progress, what was there</seg><seg type="columnLine">for me to boast about? And so, face to face with an</seg><seg type="columnLine">impassable barrier, I faltered midway in my address,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hastily summarized, led up to a feeble peroration, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">confusedly took my seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I returned to Xanocles' side, a strained silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled the air; and the shocked and even hostile glances</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the audiences showed how gravely I had harmed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of Emergence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But though I personally had failed, Xanocles was</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal to the emergency. Springing to his feet during</seg><seg type="columnLine">the momentary lull that followed my fiasco, he caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attention of the chairwoman, and for the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">time was accorded permission to address the meeting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fellow citizens," he began, while the full attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the assembled hundreds was focused upon him, "it</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply grieves me to hear of the deplorable state of</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs in the upper world. No doubt our friend has</seg><seg type="columnLine">unconsciously exaggerated, for it is incredible that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all these thousands of years, the unsubmerged</seg><seg type="columnLine">races should still be so primitive as he has indicated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet we must accept his picture of conditions; we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">reluctantly admit that our fellows on earth are still</seg><seg type="columnLine">groping in the semi-savagery of the Age of Smoke and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Iron, from which we Atlanteans escaped three thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But does that mean that we should ignore the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">world? Does that mean that we, in the consciousness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our superiority, should not reach out a helping</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to our brothers? To forget them in their need'</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be unworthy of the disciples of Agripides! In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed, it is because of the very limitations of the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">world that we must emerge!--it is because the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">are so deeply in need of assistance! Let us show them</seg><seg type="columnLine">the folly of their ways! Let us convert them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wisdom of Atlantis! Let us teach them that steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gold are but frail things after all! Let us send out</seg><seg type="columnLine">our missionaries among them, and bring them the</seg><seg type="columnLine">creed of Agripides!

For not only may you deliver the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">world from its barbarities and teach it a true culture,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but you may show its peoples how to build glass walls</seg><seg type="columnLine">and submerge as we have submerged!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in this wild vein Xanocles rambled on and on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jvhile his hearers followed him with enthusiasm that</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed gradually to mount to the point of conviction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Other arguments followed, which I will not weary</seg><seg type="columnLine">the reader with repeating; and after all who desired</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, had had their say, a vote was taken on Xanocles'</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergence proposal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To our great joy, the motion carried--carried by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the decisive ratio of almost two to one! The moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of triumph, however, had not yet arrived; for, before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the measure could become operative, it had to be ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved by a referendum of all the Atlanteans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That referendum, according to the law, could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">be held for at least thirty days, the interval being</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered necessary for discussion. Hence there en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sued a most exciting thirty days for Xanocles and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of expressing in apt and pointed terms. But the desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">for discussion was particularly in evidence at the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">assemblies held daily at the Hall of Public Enlighten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment; and it was there that Xanocles and his fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Debating Delegates" of the Emergence Party made</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the most forceful and eloquent pleas I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever heard; and their rivals of the Submergence group</seg><seg type="columnLine">were scarcely less fervid in appealing for the time-</seg><seg type="columnLine">honored policies. These activities, I need hardly point</seg><seg type="columnLine">out, were not confined to one city, but were participated</seg><seg type="columnLine">in by all the eighteen cities of Atlantis; and numerous</seg><seg type="columnLine">speakers from outside points would arrive to address</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gatherings in Archeon, while occasionally Xanocles</seg><seg type="columnLine">or some other leader would leave to speak in neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boring towns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not least eager among the fighters for Emergence</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the thirty-nine members of the Upper World</seg><seg type="columnLine">Club. Indeed, it is certain that none of the older</seg><seg type="columnLine">members could have outdone us in enthusiasm or de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termination. For we had more than an abstract prin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciple at stake--our entire future lay in the balance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And the utter helplessness of their plight--and of ours--became tragically apparent when suddenly a great elongated gray mass came flying in</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the torrents from tho sea--a rescuing submarine that had been hurled in through the gap in the wall!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, as well as for all members of the parties of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emergence and Submergence. Never in the past three</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand years had so fundamental an issue been</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought before the people; for the first time since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Good Destruction, the basic principles of Agrip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ides were at stake!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since there were no newspapers in Atlantis, at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">one agency of political excitement was lacking. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were other agencies in abundance. Never--with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the exception of those dreadful days following the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery of the crack--had I seen the Atlanteans so agi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tated. In all the houses and meetings that I visited,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chief topic of conversation was the proposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Emergence Act"; every one was anxious to deliver</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his opinion, and every one-man and woman alike,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">- seemed to have an opinion, which he was capable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And while I personally was not eager to return to</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth just now (being detained by thought of a cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain fair-haired, blue-eyed woman), yet most of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">comrades were almost passionately anxious to escape,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for as time went by they found themselves more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more out of place in this too-perfect land, and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creasingly unable to perform the duties required of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them as citizens of Atlantis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But if they were dissatisfied with the Sunken World</seg><seg type="columnLine">and incapable of making any contribution to Atlantean</seg><seg type="columnLine">culture, they proved very competent when it came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">helping the cause of Emergence. Few of them were</seg><seg type="columnLine">sufficiently skilled in the language to speak in public</seg><seg type="columnLine">(Captain Gavison was an exception, and several times</seg><seg type="columnLine">expressed himself forcefully and to good effect); but</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were all adepts at private electioneering; and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">364</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would stop every Atlantean they could inveigle into</seg><seg type="columnLine">conversation and plead the cause of Emergence.

But on the whole the men were well</seg><seg type="columnLine">coached by members of the Emergence party, and knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to confine themselves to describing the beauty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the upper world! Partly because of their aid, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">chiefly by virtue of the vigorous campaign being con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ducted in all the four corners of Atlantis, we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes that our revolutionary measure was to become</seg><seg type="columnLine">law.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXX</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Crucial Moments</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AN election in Atlantis was seldom accompanied by</seg><seg type="columnLine">intense excitement. There was no registration,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all citizens were permanently enrolled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the population bureau; on election day all the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and women of voting age (which means all who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed their High Initiation) appeared quietly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">designated polling places to cast a secret ballot, or else</seg><seg type="columnLine">--if they preferred--they sent in their vote in writ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing two or three days earlier. The election boards then</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly counted the votes, and the fate of the measure</seg><seg type="columnLine">(for laws were the only things passed on by the voters</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Atlantis) was disclosed at the Hall of Public En-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightenment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the Emergence proposal proved an exception to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rule. Not a little agitation was apparent among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men and women thronging to the election cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers; and this agitation was heightened by the mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers of the Upper World Club, who used earthly politi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cal tactics by accosting the voters before they reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the polls and showering them with final arguments</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pleas. It is doubtful whether these eleventh hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts had any effect, and, indeed, the results showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they might have been spared; but at the time we</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that our exertions had not been in vain, and dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the election and the days of suspense that fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed, we remained unwarrentedly hopeful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came the disillusioning blow. After three days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the election results were announced in the Hall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Public Enlightenment. Out of more than a third of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a million votes cast in all Atlantis, our party had</seg><seg type="columnLine">polled nearly a hundred and fifty thousand--yet had</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed by many thousands to equal the Submergence</seg><seg type="columnLine">total.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Even so, we were not wholly discouraged. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xanocles pointed out, the cause of Emergence had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never before been able to attract one-tenth as many</seg><seg type="columnLine">voters; and we had reason to hope that we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventually bring the majority to our side. And no</seg><seg type="columnLine">sooner had the news of our defeat reached us than</seg><seg type="columnLine">we began to plan for further campaigns, for we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined not to abandon the fight so long as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had breath with which to wage it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet in one respect, I was already regretting my</seg><seg type="columnLine">connection with the Emergence Party. My regrets, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be sure, arose from purely non-political motives, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not make me alter my allegiance; but they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">none the less deep-rooted. To my surprise and chagrin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found that my campaigning activities were bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">me into disfavor with Aelios. As one of Agripides'</seg><seg type="columnLine">staunch admirers and a devoted member of the Party</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Submergence, she looked with growing disapproval</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">upon my association with Xanocles and his kind; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">during those little conferences, which we had for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">supposed purpose of discussing my "History of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Upper World," she would take occasion to reprove me</seg><seg type="columnLine">mildly and even to suggest that my conduct savored of</seg><seg type="columnLine">disloyalty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, I would plead my right as a citizen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">espouse any political cause that appealed to me; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she would nod gravely with dissent. "Theoretically</seg><seg type="columnLine">you may have the right," she would remind me, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't you think you are showing remarkably bad taste?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remember, you came into our land uninvited, and have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been freely received as one of us, and given citizen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship and all the privileges of a native. And how do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you show your appreciation? By taking sides with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the party that would undermine our institutions; by</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing all you can to wreck the very country that suc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cored you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To this I would reply that I had no intention of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrecking the country; that I was trying to further</seg><seg type="columnLine">its interests according to my own lights. And Aelios,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while not convinced that my own lights were the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">ones, would at least admit that my motives were sin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cere; and having reached this halfway point of agree-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, we would invariably turn to less. provocative</seg><seg type="columnLine">subjects.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But despite her disapproval of my Emergence views,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had reason to be encouraged by her attitude toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. I saw her, while not often, at least often enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be assured of her friendship; and now and then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught in her eyes a bright, warm light which intimated</seg><seg type="columnLine">that what she felt might be more than friendship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yet it may merely have been that my desires passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">judgment for me, for not by a word or a gesture did</seg><seg type="columnLine">she give evidence that she regarded me otherwise than</seg><seg type="columnLine">as one kindly disposed human being may regard an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other; and the occasional hints of some gentler emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion were so rare and so fleeting that I could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure. And so, as best I could, I restrained my impa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tience, at first never seriously believing that I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">aspire to her height, then gradually fanning faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopes that remained concealed beneath the mantle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my diffidence. It was long before we even approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the subject of love; and meanwhile, we would speak</seg><seg type="columnLine">of impersonal things, or personal things securely buried</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the past, and nothing in my words would give hint</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the passion flaming to life within me, while in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">words I saw the traces only of a vivid and beauty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loving mind serenely unconscious of sex.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BUT even in Atlantis it was impossible that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">should cont.'nue to see one another and yet retain</seg><seg type="columnLine">a merely placid brother-and-sister attitude. How it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was with her I do not know, but I was the son of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">world whose passions burn gustily and strong; and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was becoming almost painfully obsessed with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of her, and would be given to long fits of</seg><seg type="columnLine">melancholy in her absence, while at times in her pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence I would be tantalized by her passionless calm, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">would feel the old sweet primitive prompting to slip</seg><seg type="columnLine">my arms about her, and enfold her as one might</seg><seg type="columnLine">enfold the Ultimate. But always I would restrain my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, for how be sure of the reaction of this daughter</seg><seg type="columnLine">of an alien civilization? How be sure that embraces</seg><seg type="columnLine">and caresses would not be repulsive to the Atlanteans?</seg><seg type="columnLine">And so, though possessed by the thought of her, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">by some exquisite perfume that provokes and allures,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I repressed my eagerness for many, many months,</seg><seg type="columnLine">awaiting that opportunity which in the end, I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure, time and circumstance must provide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in the end my patience was rewarded, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was favored unexpectedly by one of those occasions</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">365</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">which life, if left quietly to itself, seems usually to</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer to lovers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was after one of my rare and delightful after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noons with Aelios, that the supreme event occurred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We had been strolling together about the city, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gone for a moment's rest into the "Temple of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stars," that majestic edifice in which Rawson and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been trapped so long before. Seated on a stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">bench in the darkness, we gazed awe-stricken at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectacle above us--the whole glittering panorama of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night-skies, almost as I had beheld them so many</seg><seg type="columnLine">times on earth. And as I peered up at the image of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those heavens I could hardly hope to see again, a sad</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reminiscent mood came over me; I could fancy</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself once more on earth, and was wistful for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that earth contained; I missed the friends I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">known, the sparkle of the sunshine, the magnificence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of white-throated mountains: I longed for the bluster</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cannonade of tempests, the icy tingling of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow, the splashing and foamy turbulence of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean. And Aelios, although she had never known</seg><seg type="columnLine">these things and could scarcely imagine what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">meant, was strangely responsive to my mood, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed even to feel my melancholy. She asked me</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently about the world I had left, and how it felt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wander among the great cities of the earth, and how</seg><seg type="columnLine">it felt to hear the purling of mountain brooklets or to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sit on a grassy knoll with the great sun blazing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue above. And, remembering all that I had seen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard before my captivity in Atlantis, I described to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aelios what my life had been, and told of my adven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures and wanderings, my happy childhood and youth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and early manhood; and I drew upon my imagination</seg><seg type="columnLine">for gorgeous pictures of the upper world, and painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">the home I had lost as little less than a Paradise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, now I see why you've joined the Emergence</seg><seg type="columnLine">Party," Aelios remarked, her face glowing dimly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the near-starlight, and her eyes soft with a kindly</seg><seg type="columnLine">luster. "Of course, you must sometimes wish yourself</seg><seg type="columnLine">back among all those wonderful scenes you left."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sometimes, indeed, I am sorry," said I, in low</seg><seg type="columnLine">tones and reminiscently. "Sometimes I almost wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be again in my native land. But there are other</seg><seg type="columnLine">times when I am glad, very glad to be here, and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would not go back to my own country if I could--</seg><seg type="columnLine">not if you offered me the whole world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And when is that?" asked Aelios. "When you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the beautiful buildings here, or look at the exquisite</seg><seg type="columnLine">statuary?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, sometimes then," I replied. "But not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">then. There are other exquisite things that make me</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish to stay."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I can understand," she declared, apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">still innocent of the trend of my remarks. "The paint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, for example, or the colonnades, or-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, not only that," I interrupted. "There is some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing more personal, more human--something that--"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here I hesitated, hardly able to proceed, for I realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was approaching an embarrassing climax.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You mean then, that you like the people here?" she</seg><seg type="columnLine">volunteered, still with perfect candor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, indeed I like the people!"

"Oh, I am glad you</seg><seg type="columnLine">are so attached to your friends!" she responded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether innocently or with calculating cleverness I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not say, since the darkness concealed any blush</seg><seg type="columnLine">that may have suffused her face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But don't you understand, Aelios?" I persisted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't you know whom in particular I mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The note of surprise in her answer was either gen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">unine or else was born of remarkably skilful acting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How should I know whom you mean? Am I with you</seg><seg type="columnLine">often enough to know all your friends?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was making matters difficult for me. But, hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing reached this tactical position, I was determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to surrender. "Why, Aelios," I countered, "whom</seg><seg type="columnLine">should you imagine that I have for my particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend? Whom but yourself?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Myself?" she repeated, in sheer astonishment.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Myself?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T^OR a moment there was silence; but this time I</seg><seg type="columnLine">A felt that there could be no doubt about the blush</seg><seg type="columnLine">that mounted to her face. And at length she turned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me with softly, smoldering eyes and the assurance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">victory entered my heart and then swiftly receded as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she murmured, bashfully, "I am pleased, very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased, to know you feel that way. It is a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">compliment to me, and I am very proud--for nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Atlantis is held more precious than friendship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Oh, but it is not only friendship!" I remonstrated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondering if it were possible that she still misunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood. "It's not only friendship, Aelios! It is love!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Love?" she echoed, in low tones of surprise; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">another long silence followed, while I waited eagerly</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the words that did not come, and she averted her</seg><seg type="columnLine">head so that not even the dimly glowing eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible. Then, when the suspense was becoming em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrassing, I found hesitating speech, which gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew more fluent and assured; and all the pent-up emo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of months welled forth and forced a passionate</seg><seg type="columnLine">torrent from my tongue, so vehement as to surprise</seg><seg type="columnLine">even myself. I told her how immeasurably dear she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become; how she had been for me the central</seg><seg type="columnLine">light of all this strange world; how she had soothed</seg><seg type="columnLine">my loneliness, dispersed my despair, and given me</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope and a reason for living; how my life could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning and beauty only if she had a share in it, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">without her all things would be desolate and blank.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All this and much more I poured forth in an eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhapsody, not pausing to reflect that I was but re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peating the sentiments of a million lovers; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength of my feelings perhaps lent wings to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">commonplace words, and gave them a power that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">analysis could reveal. Or perhaps it was that At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantean lovers never expressed themselves as do lovers</seg><seg type="columnLine">on earth; for even in the darkness I was aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Aelios was listening, listening intently, listening</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost with a breathless interest, as though she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never heard or imagined words such as mine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After I had finished, she seemed still held in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">spell of speechlessness. For several tense seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow-dragging portentous seconds that seemed minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, I waited for her to break silence. But when her</seg><seg type="columnLine">response came, it was in passionless tones that con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trasted oddly with my emotion; and with an accentua-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion so feeble as to resemble a whisper, she declared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">All this that you say seems strange to me, very very</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange. You speak of love, but I fear I do not under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand. Perhaps love in your land is not the same as</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, for I am sure that what you speak of is not what</seg><seg type="columnLine">we would call love."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what would you call love?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is something that hardly needs a name.

Consid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ering the magnitude of the task, it surprises me</seg><seg type="columnLine">now to remember that I finished it so quickly, for not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only was it longer than three average-sized volumes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I was retarded by writing it in an adopted tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">and by having to work exclusively from memory and</seg><seg type="columnLine">without reference books other than the Atlantean dic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionaries. But six or seven hours of daily application</seg><seg type="columnLine">is certain to show results even though one works</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was indeed a proud day, and yet a day of many</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubts, when I bore the finished manuscript to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">office of the Literary Registrar. This official, assisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a board of fifteen recognized writers and critics,</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed upon all literary works submitted by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">authors of Atlantis; and all books found worthy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">perpetuation were published under his direction, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">unstinted advice and criticism was given to promising</seg><seg type="columnLine">aspirants. In the case of my own book, there could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be no doubt as to publication, for not only had I been</seg><seg type="columnLine">specifically directed to write it, but all Atlantis was</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly awaiting the information it was expected to</seg><seg type="columnLine">convey. None the less, it had to undergo the regular</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">procedure of inspection by the Registrar; and, as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened, this was more than a fruitless formality.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before the manuscript was given to the press a trained</seg><seg type="columnLine">essayist was appointed to help me reconstruct the</seg><seg type="columnLine">style; and, thanks to his assistance, my writing at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained a dignity and polish I myself could never have</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when at last the publication of the book was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered, I had good reason to be gratified. An edition</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fifty thousand was to be issued--an edition of phe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomenal size considering that the population of Atlan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tis was only half a million.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Naturally, I sought to know the reason for this</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous printing; and I learned much as to book</seg><seg type="columnLine">distribution in the Sunken World. Publication, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">all other activities, was solely in the hands of the gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment; and copies of all the hundreds of books</seg><seg type="columnLine">issued each year were sent as a matter of course to</seg><seg type="columnLine">every library in the land. Moreover, every citizen</seg><seg type="columnLine">was permitted his choice of any fifty of the year's</seg><seg type="columnLine">books, the receipt of which was considered not a priv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilege but a right; and men and women engaged in re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">search work were allowed in excess of fifty if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">made plain their need of the additional volumes. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case of my own book, public interest was at such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pitch, that a large percentage of the people were</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain to include it among their chosen fifty; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first edition was therefore regarded as conserva-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive in size rather than excessive.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So, in fact, it proved. The book was hardly off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">press when orders began to pour in so rapidly that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second edition of fifty thousand had to be prepared.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For it was literally true that every one was reading</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The History of the Upper World"; and when I say</seg><seg type="columnLine">every one, I do not mean one man out of every hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred, as might be the case were I writing on the earth;</seg><seg type="columnLine">I mean that there was actually not a person of reading</seg><seg type="columnLine">age who did not feel bound to acquaint himself with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the contents of my book.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In consequence, I found my life taking on a tinge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unwonted excitement. The notoriety of successful</seg><seg type="columnLine">authorship was mine--and the satisfaction of one who</seg><seg type="columnLine">finds himself the center of a storm of his own crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. For it was with a start of surprise, a gasp of</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredulity and a wail of horror that Atlantis read</seg><seg type="columnLine">the news of the upper world. Previously, when I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">let loose a few hints as to life on earth, I had wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nessed some curious reactions; but the former be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wilderment and disgust of the people now seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">insignificant by comparison. It would be impossible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to convey any idea of their repugnance to earthly life</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I portrayed it; it was almost as if they had learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we had gone back on all fours, or had joined the</seg><seg type="columnLine">orang-utan and the gibbon in the trees; and the dozens</seg><seg type="columnLine">of letters I received, the dozens of visitors that poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">in upon me, and the dozens of inquiries addressed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me at public meetings, all gave evidence of a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">but profound emotion: a sense of wonder and of re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vulsion at the degeneracy of the upper world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps the clearest proof of the general attitude</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to be seen in the reviews of the book--reviews</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, unlike earthly criticism, were not printed, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">were delivered orally before gatherings at the Hall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Public Enlightenment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LET me quote, for example, from a typical address.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The speaker was Thermanides, a well known</seg><seg type="columnLine">writer on social and philosophic questions; and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">views regarding the upper world were milder in many</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways than those of his audience.

And what, there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, must we conclude? That Agripides was wise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderfully wise, when he urged us to submerge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There can hardly be any more distressing subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the history of the earth; even the most daring</seg><seg type="columnLine">satirist, playing upon his imagination to expose the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupidity of the human race, could not offer a blacker</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture of follies, crimes and inanities than Anson</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harkness has painted for us in all seriousness. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">what do we find to be the outstanding historical facts</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he depicts them? Has the human race gone con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinuously forward, forgetting its savage instincts in</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfecting a civilization at once beautiful and secure?</seg><seg type="columnLine">--has man come to look on man otherwise than as</seg><seg type="columnLine">beast looks on beast?--or has society come to be com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed of nothing more than a clothed jungle pack?</seg><seg type="columnLine">No, my friends--unfortunately no, if we would believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">the volume before us. Slave-raids and wars; rebel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions and murders; conquest and persecution; treachery</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rapine and wholesale exploitation; dynasties that</seg><seg type="columnLine">crumble and empires that decompose--these are the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sign-posts of the past three thousand years; and evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently there has been no concerted or intelligent effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">to create other and less revolting landmarks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yet though the darkness seems impenetrable, I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">see one faint glimmer of hope.

It is that stroke which, it seems to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is about to fall upon the upper world man, smiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rancorous and lopsided civilization, and turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his own throat that knife with which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinks to gouge out the eyes of his foe.

And those that arose in the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suing discussion were not less narrow-minded than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">principal reviewer himself; they seemed to imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">that my book had been intended as a sort of cata-</seg><seg type="columnLine">logue of horrors instead of as a restrained and ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acious history; and either they suggested that I must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have exaggerated hopelessly, or else they agreed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper world was so decadent that a second "Good</seg><seg type="columnLine">Destruction" would be desirable. "Blood-curdling,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sepulchral," "An able story of depravity and crime,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The last word in thrills and terror"--these were some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the expressions used by the various commentators;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, to judge from their remarks, one might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that I had written a popular novel of mystery</seg><seg type="columnLine">and murder instead of a sober history.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But while all Atlantis was reading the book and</seg><seg type="columnLine">being provoked and shocked by my most commonplace</seg><seg type="columnLine">statements, I was surprised to observe one effect which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I deplored even more than the gross misunderstanding</seg><seg type="columnLine">of upper world standards and ideals. For the "His-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tory" had acted like a bombshell against the Party of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emergence! Deserters from our standards were now</seg><seg type="columnLine">legion, and in a few weeks we had lost all that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had gained following the discovery of the crack in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall. It was as if the people had been frightened by</seg><seg type="columnLine">my picture of the lands above seas, frightened so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they wished to shun all contact with the earth as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they might shun things unclean and evil; and despite</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that Xanocles and the other Emergence leaders</seg><seg type="columnLine">could do, it was impossible to shake the masses free</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this ridiculous attitude. At a test vote of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emergence measure two months after the appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the "History of the Upper World," we were defeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">more decisively than even our foes had predicted, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feated by the overwhelming ratio of ten to one!--And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my disappointment and self-accusing despair, I bit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terly regretted that I had not written my book from</seg><seg type="columnLine">a less realistic point of view, for I knew that nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">short of a catastrophe or a miracle could now open</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the lanes back to the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXXII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A Happy Consummation</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOT many months after the publication of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"History of the Upper World" there occurred a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vastly more important event. At least, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">vastly more important to me, and constituted the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunate episode of all my life in Atlantis. Ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">since that encouraging talk with Aelios in "The Temple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Stars," I had been drawing gradually nearer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her; and by slow and unconscious degrees, so subtle</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we ourselves could hardly note the change, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be entering upon the role of lovers. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no emotional demonstration, and no deliberate</seg><seg type="columnLine">reference to love, for in Atlantis it was considered un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dignified to express any casual amorous sentiments;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but at times, in her eyes I would catch that reassuring</seg><seg type="columnLine">look I had noted at rare intervals before, and in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">increasingly frequent meetings, her manner seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be tinged by something indefinably wistful and yet in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">definably gentle, that I had not previously observed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It might be imagined that the appearance and wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussion of my book would have had an adverse</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect upon her; but, fortunately, I had shown her</seg><seg type="columnLine">many chapters before publication, and the contents</seg><seg type="columnLine">were no surprise to her. And while she was at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her people in loathing the upper world, she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly blame me for the conditions I depicted. Indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was soon to give proof that she did not consider</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in the least a partner in the supposed backwardness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I do not now recall the precise circumstances that</seg><seg type="columnLine">led up to the climax; I only know that it was on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my numerous visits to her home, when we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone together in the tapestried room of the pale blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">lanterns. Nothing had suggested to me in advance</seg><seg type="columnLine">that our interview today was to differ from our pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vious interviews, and certainly nothing could have sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested such a thought to her; but somehow the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation drifted into unexpected channels, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">found ourselves provocatively near the subject of love;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and somehow her words (though I cannot now re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">member their trend) stirred up all my checked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slumbering emotions, forced down the barriers of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">reserve, filled me with a sudden and unlooked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage, and urged my lips to frame words that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not premeditated then. And almost as much to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my own surprise as to hers, I found myself proposing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that she marry me!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But was my rashness appropriately punished? Far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it. What was my amazement, and what my</seg><seg type="columnLine">368</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">delight, when she looked up at me with trustful, grave</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue eyes and quietly consented!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And yet it all seemed so simple that it might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been an everyday occurrence! She had taken my pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posal almost as a matter of course, almost as if she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had expected it; but at the same time the exalted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy light in her eyes showed that she was far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">indifferent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was not sure before," she murmured, simply,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after my first rapturous exclamations. "But now I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am quite certain. We will be all in all to one another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">will we not, my beloved?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I forgot just how I replied; I have an impression</seg><seg type="columnLine">that my arms performed some lively antics, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aelios as their goal, and that anything I said must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been merely incidental.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When shall the day be, Aelios?" I asked, when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was again in a mood for discussion. "When do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">say ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When do you want me to say?" she returned, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though surprised at my query. "If we are both sure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is the use of delaying?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, by dint of further questioning, I learned that</seg><seg type="columnLine">long engagements were unknown in Atlantis. Although</seg><seg type="columnLine">usually so slow-going and leisurely, the natives seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me singularly hasty in this one regard; and once</seg><seg type="columnLine">two people had decided upon marriage, it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">customary to allow more than the few days1, interval</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary for the preparations. It had always been</seg><seg type="columnLine">so in Atlantis,. Aelios explained, and she could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine how it could be otherwise, for why subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">the young couple to the unnatural tension of waiting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and why make love ridiculous by arbitrarily starving</seg><seg type="columnLine">it?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Previously, when I had dared to think of the pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility of marriage with Aelios, I had half reconciled</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself to the prospect of a long engagement, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">observation had taught me nothing of Atlantean mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riage customs, and I had imagined that an interval at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least of months, might be considered proper. And so I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a little bewildered by the unexpected imminence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our union; I was like a man who, long blind, has</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly beheld a flash of .light; and it took me a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little while to adjust myself to the startling new un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">folding vistas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TO begin with, I was not sure quite what was ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected of me. Should I present Aelios with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring or similar trinket such as was customary on</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth? or was some more elaborate gift deemed neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary? In my perplexity, I consulted Xanocles, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely smiled at my doubts. "Marriage with us," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">explained, "is not treated as a form of barter; nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">is it a bargain wherein precious articles must be given</seg><seg type="columnLine">as sureties. We have long ago stamped out of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">marriage system all traces of its primitive origin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">al! traces of that old custom which regarded it merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a contract of sale, and which in the beginning de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded the parental receipt of cattle or other material</seg><seg type="columnLine">property, and later required rings or similar baubles</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a tender of the purchase price if not as a pledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of good faith. When two of our people are married,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would consider it degrading to be expected to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything beyond themselves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even after I had been relieved on this important</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject, there was still much that troubled me. Aelios</seg><seg type="columnLine">had decided that but eight days were to intervene be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the ceremony (this being about the usual time);</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, despite all my joyous anticipations, I trembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">just a little at the thought that I was so soon to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">change my known if monotonous bachelor life for an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown career as Atlantean husband. But, fortu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nately, my hours were so completely occupied that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had little chance to be disturbed by doubts. For one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, I spent a great deal of time with Aelios; for</seg><seg type="columnLine">another thing, I was much entertained by my friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were astonished and yet loudly congratulatory</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon hearing the news, and insisted upon putting me</seg><seg type="columnLine">through long ordeals of questions, laughter, and ami-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able chaffing remarks. An entire meeting of the Upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">World Club was given over to a celebration alleged to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be in my honor; and President Gavison, after unbend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from his official sternness to wish me luck in terms</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I thought just a little wistful and a little reminis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent of his own lost happiness, was followed in quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">succession by the various other club members, all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom strove to express themselves with appropriate</seg><seg type="columnLine">levity. Had there been such a thing as an intoxicant</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Atlantis, I am sure that we would have had a merry</seg><seg type="columnLine">old time; but, for lack of the proper stimulants, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men had to be content with their questionable jests,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with poking me mirthfully in the ribs, with slapping</seg><seg type="columnLine">me heartily on the back, with expressing the wish</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they might be in my shoes (or, rather, sandals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since these were the only footwear in Atlantis), and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with laughing and guffawing in a generally irresponsi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble and uproarious manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But as the few remaining days slid by, did I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">no thought of her whom I had left on earth? Did I</seg><seg type="columnLine">not think of Alma Huntley, she to whom I had once</seg><seg type="columnLine">pledged devotion? Perhaps I should be ashamed, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am not, to say that the memory of her scarcely en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered my mind. She was no more than a shadow in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a world that was daily growing more shadowy, in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence I had outlived and could not expect to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter; and if at times she would obtrude herself</seg><seg type="columnLine">before me like a dim melancholy presence without</seg><seg type="columnLine">color or form, such occasions were growing increas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly rare; and now that Aelios seemed so near and</seg><seg type="columnLine">our two lives were so soon to be fused, Alma was ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scured as a pale star is obscured by the sunlight;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all the torrents of my being welled up tumultu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously toward Aelios, and it seemed as if her com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panionship and her love were the only love or compan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ionship I had ever known or desired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And how near I was to enjoying that companionship</seg><seg type="columnLine">for life became vividly apparent to me about three</seg><seg type="columnLine">days after we had reached our decision. Then it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Aelios and I, in accordance with the custom of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the land, visited the local housing bureau, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to assign us to our new lodgings. After we had duly</seg><seg type="columnLine">placed our names side by side in a great venerable-</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking ledger wherein all the wedded couples of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past hundred years were enrolled, we passed an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">citing afternoon in the company of the chief housing</seg><seg type="columnLine">representative, who showed us all the available dwell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing places with the same obliging courtesy as when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had selected my bachelor quarters. As on the former</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion, there were so many desirable locations that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the choice was difficult; and on passing each new</seg><seg type="columnLine">threshold, Aelios would pause with a little cry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder or surprise, and would point in admiration to</seg><seg type="columnLine">some distinctive feature of arrangement or decora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Needless to say, I too was dazzled and delighted;</seg><seg type="columnLine">particularly since I had previously seen only apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments designed for single people. â¢ None of these homes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were very large; indeed, most of them had but three or</seg><seg type="columnLine">four rooms in addition to the roof sleeping chambers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the almost invariable central court; but they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most home-like little nooks one could imagine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were made attractive not only by the lawns and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowering gardens that surrounded them, but by their</seg><seg type="columnLine">tastefully furnished rooms, whose lamps and tapestries</seg><seg type="columnLine">and statuary were never too lavish or ornate and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">369</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">always gave an effect at once picturesque and cozy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our choice was in favor of a little butterfly-shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">dwelling, with silvery walls inlaid with mother-of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearl and liigh-arched windows surrounded by vivid</seg><seg type="columnLine">bands of stained glass. The interior appeared entranc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to us both, for not only were the walls and ceilings</seg><seg type="columnLine">frescoed as though by a master hand, but the painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">designs were matched by the very rugs on the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the draperies that screened the doorways; while</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little statue-lined fountain that bubbled perpetually</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the court fascinated us both by its rainbow glim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mering showers of spray.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may move in any time after your names are</seg><seg type="columnLine">registered in the Marriage Book,'' said the housing</seg><seg type="columnLine">representative, when we had notified him of our de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cision and he had duly recorded it. "But if ever you</seg><seg type="columnLine">should find this house unsatisfactory, you have only</seg><seg type="columnLine">to enter your complaint, and if possible we will pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vide you with another dwelling. But meanwhile this</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be regarded as your official residence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AND with these words the housing representative</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowed a gracious retreat, while Aelios and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">were left to inspect the home that was so soon to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">ours.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the enthusiasm of children we examined every</seg><seg type="columnLine">nook and corner, growing constantly more excited as</seg><seg type="columnLine">our search proceeded. Aelios was radiant; I had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen her eyes sparkle more brightly, her cheeks glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">more vividly; and I realized as never before how</seg><seg type="columnLine">extraordinarily fortunate I was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And it seemed as if her emotions corresponded with</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine! "Is it not the strangest whim of fate," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, "that you have come down here to me, my be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved? How easily I might have missed you! How</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily we might each have gone through life not know-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that the other existed!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So it has been with all lovers since the world be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gan," I returned. "Even in Atlantis, love must al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways seem a miracle."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even in Atlantis, it always is a miracle," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">amended; and she looked up at me with a smile so</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous and trustful, so kindly and so tinged with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapturous emotion, that I could not but admit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The days that followed this delightful interview are</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a blur in my memory. Although every hour was</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow-footed with the suspense and the waiting, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">seems to me that but a moment elapsed between our</seg><seg type="columnLine">departure from our chosen home and our happy re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn ... the intervening events are all obscured by that</seg><seg type="columnLine">never-to-be-forgotten morning when Aelios and I en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered the office of the Local Adviser and were officially</seg><seg type="columnLine">united.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The actual ceremony was insignificant--indeed, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no ceremony at all. We had merely to record our</seg><seg type="columnLine">names for a second time, writing them in the Mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riage Book which the housing representative had men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned--an enormously thick volume bound in blue and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold, with thousands of pages, of which one was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voted to the history of each marriage. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">no questions asked us; there were no high-sounding</seg><seg type="columnLine">formulas to be spoken by clockwork; there were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">official representatives of saintliness to offer dogmatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">advice; there were no vows to be taken, no promises</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be made, no witnesses to gape or snicker, no pom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pous giving or receiving of the bride. We merely fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nished the State with that record which it required,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and did so without having to purchase a preliminary</seg><seg type="columnLine">printed tag by way of permission; and after we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered our names in the book, we were not insulted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with any attempt to sanctify proceedings with words</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of antique witchcraft, nor humiliated by any implica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that our own feelings would not amply solemnize</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, if we desired to celebrate our nuptials</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a festival of any sort, that was our privilege--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">privilege which the State would recognize by providing</seg><seg type="columnLine">an appropriate hall for the day. And, as it happened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">most bridal couples availed themselves of this right:</seg><seg type="columnLine">We were no exception, for when our marriage had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been officially recorded, we repaired to a flower-decked</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber where a few of Aelios' friends and relatives</seg><seg type="columnLine">were awaiting us.

Once, for example, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">my awkwardness betrayed me in an athletic contest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I suffered a broken arm, I was conducted to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">State hospital, where a State physician skilfully treated</seg><seg type="columnLine">my injury; and once when the incessant golden glare</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to tell upon my eyes, I had to visit a State occu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">list, who relieved the strain by prescribing a pair of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide-rimmed amber-tinged glasses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My appearance was changing, moreover, in other</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways than the mere addition of glasses. I was ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiring a long beard, largely owing to the habit formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">during my first days in Atlantis; and my complexion</seg><seg type="columnLine">was taking on a curious greenish tint, due to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar action of the Atlantean light--an action to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the Atlanteans themselves had inherited im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munity. But I was not alone in my queer pistache com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plexion; there were exactly thirty-eight others who</seg><seg type="columnLine">could show the same distinctive pigmentation; and so</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked was the coloration that, as the men sometimes</seg><seg type="columnLine">declared, our origin was "written on our skins."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My fellow members of the Upper World Club mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">while did not share my liking for Atlantis.

One</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, all was tranquil; the next moment, the Sunken</seg><seg type="columnLine">World was in a frenzy. I remember that one after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">noon Aelios and I had gone to the Agripides Theatre</seg><seg type="columnLine">to witness a performance of some sort (its -precise</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature has slipped from my mind); and it was at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">close of the first act that the warning came. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unexplained absence of the chorus that usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">sang during intermissions, I might have suspected</seg><seg type="columnLine">that something was wrong; but actually I was without</seg><seg type="columnLine">misgivings until suddenly a great burnished, silvery</seg><seg type="columnLine">horn--the horn of the Autophone!--was lifted quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the stage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this unexpected sight, a stab of alarm darted</seg><seg type="columnLine">through me; Aelios seized my hand and held it as if</seg><seg type="columnLine">for reassurance; the audience sat rigid and tense, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">persons who behold a ghost. For an instant we heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sound, except for the quick breathing of our neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bors; then the strained silence was broken by an un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">canny hollow voice that issued sonorously as if from</seg><seg type="columnLine">nowhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A great misfortune has befallen," announced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unseen, in tones that sounded almost sepulchral.

But there is danger that the break will ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pand before repairs can be made; and for this reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">the High Chief Adviser requests that you try to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation courageously, and freely enlist your</seg><seg type="columnLine">brains and your services till the peril is overcome."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT would be impossible to convey any idea of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">commotion which these words created. The people</seg><seg type="columnLine">did indeed follow the High Chief Adviser's advice to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be courageous, for there was no more than a hint of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that panic which one might have expected. But there</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be no further thought of the performance in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the theatre. After an instant's chill silence, the audi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence arose with one accord; and men's faces were</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanched and women could be heard muttering in fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the crowd began pushing toward the exits. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">their excitement, the people had forgotten their usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">courtesy; and Aelios and I were shoved and jostled</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a way that reminded me of the New York subways.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was all I could do not to lose track of her amid the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mob; yet both of us were anxious not to be'separated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">particularly since the speechless eagerness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">throng, the sighs of women, the rapid breathing of men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and our own fast-beating hearts, all served to fill us</seg><seg type="columnLine">with grim forebodings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once out of the great theatre, the people were driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">as by a common instinct toward the river. All seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearful of even a second's delay, as though our haste</seg><seg type="columnLine">might repair the fractured wall!--and in a long, swift-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly moving column, constantly augmented as we ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanced, we followed the winding avenue that curved</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the waterfront. None of us spoke more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">an occasional word; even Aelios was silent, but she</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutched my arm with unwonted firmness, and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up at me with eyes wherein apprehension alternated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a reassuring courage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But there was no prop for courage in the sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">that greeted us at the river bank. The stream, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">previously had flowed five or six feet beneath the</seg><seg type="columnLine">docks, was now not more than eight or ten inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">below the level.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In speechless dismay we watched that broad, green-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ish-gray torrent go swishing and gurgling past. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was there that we could do? Nothing--except</seg><seg type="columnLine">to stand and gape helplessly at that swift-flowing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swollen stream. Indeed, we seemed worse than merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">helpless, for as I stood there with Aelios amid that</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror-faced crowd, I became conscious--as during</seg><seg type="columnLine">that other crisis years before--that I was arousing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">singular repulsion. My neighbors were edging away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from me visibly; some were pointing toward me, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">uttering half-suppressed oaths; I thought I heard some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one ruefully mumbling something about "That foreign-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er" and something else about "The cause of all our</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubles."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I would quickly have withdrawn with Aelios from</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hostile throng, had I not chanced to observe a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slim, gray form ?pproaching from far upstream. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">the speed of the swiftest racing craft it drew near,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in a few minutes was recognizable as an intra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic boat, akin to the one I had boarded years be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore. Much to my relief, it came to a rapid halt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drew up at the dock, and let down its gangplank. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the crowd forced its way on to the docks, Aelios</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I was not slow in finding seats for ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">372</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for what was sure to prove an extremely exciting trip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And exciting it was--far more exciting than we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have desired. We had been under way only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few minutes when the aspect of the river began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">change disquietingly. Except for the current, it lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">the character of a river entirely, and took on the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance of a long lake! On both sides the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread in a smooth-flowing sheet two or three miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad; and above the surface in places stared clumps</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clusters of vegetation, with here and there a minia-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture island; while several temples and colonnades stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">with marble bases buried in the water, like the palaces</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some aquatic goddess.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But if this overflow was alarming, the full extent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the disaster was not evident until we approached</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass wall itself. This time it did not require any</seg><seg type="columnLine">searchlight to reveal the nature of the injury; our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears might have told us if our eyes had not--but our</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes had sufficient to report. As we strode along the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little, clay path toward the wall, we became aware of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a broad, gleaming, greenish expanse between--a sheet</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water where all had been dry land! And into that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheet of water, with a continuous thunder equal to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of the floods from the river valve, a long, white</seg><seg type="columnLine">torrent spurted in a gracefully curving jet, shooting</seg><seg type="columnLine">outward hundreds of yards from the glass bulwark,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and descending with a splashing as of some gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">fountain. It was impossible to estimate the volume,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except to say that it was enormous; nor could we</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the nature or extent of the leak, since the inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vening water forbade our close approach. But we</seg><seg type="columnLine">observed how the overflow worked its way circuitously</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the Salty River in a sort of channel of its own</seg><seg type="columnLine">choosing; and occasional swift-moving lights, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">even from our distance we could see flashing from</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond the glass, showed us that the repair ships were</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy trying to seal up the crack. But from the be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ginning we knew how hopeless were their efforts--</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their midget vessels and midget tools they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">like ants trying to stem the floor of a Niagara. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">the utter helplessness of their plight--and of ours--</seg><seg type="columnLine">became tragically apparent when suddenly a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">elongated, gray mass came flying in with the torrents</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the sea, and fell with a splash and a clatter in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a battered heap projecting above the waters--a rescu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing submarine that had been hurled in through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gap in the wall!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXXIV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Swollen Torrents</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was five days later that I received the summons</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the High Chief Adviser . . . and made ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the most extraordinary of all my adventures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the interval, all Atlantis was in a state verging</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon madness. The commotion created by the original</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery of the crack was insignificant beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror that now dominated every inhabitant. To say</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the country seemed stricken with paralysis would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be to understate the conditions; rather, it was driven</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a dumb distraction, like some great beast that feels</seg><seg type="columnLine">its foot in a trap. Only one thought was in any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's mind, only one topic on anyone's lips; the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted hither and thither like phantoms, rushing back</seg><seg type="columnLine">and forth between the cities and the spurting leak</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the wall, sometimes engaged furtively in whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">discussions, on other occasions muttering half-audible</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayers or withdrawing into themselves like men</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought face to face with Fate. Some would hover</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the offices of the High Chief Adviser, awaiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopeful news that did not come; some would haunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river banks, watching the swelling torrents go mur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">muring and whirling past; some would huddle to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether in small family groups, as though mortally</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid to lose sight of their dear ones; some would</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely go pacing around like rats in a cage, scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">heeding where they went, their white faces and harried</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes expressive of a dread they dared not mention.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But none--none who were not driven by the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">stringent orders--were heeding their daily duties. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time in history, the cities were inadequately</seg><seg type="columnLine">supplied with food; the official producers and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tributors shared the general inertia, and the people</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to clamor at the doors of the great municipal</seg><seg type="columnLine">warehouses for their meager rations; and actual star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vation seemed certain unless the workers could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">urged back to the fields.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But more appalling to my mind--vastly more ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">palling, since it seemed like the overthrow of the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">order of nature--was the laxity with regard to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">golden orbs that ruled the Atlantean day. Owing no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt to the negligence of the official in charge, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clockwork that controlled these artificial suns ran down</seg><seg type="columnLine">on what should have been the third night, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminaries continued in full blaze after the usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour of darkness. But few seemed even to notice the</seg><seg type="columnLine">change, and most continued frenziedly watching the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters or awaiting encouraging reports; while those</seg><seg type="columnLine">that could, snatched a few hours of troubled sleep dur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the continuous daylight, and many still kept their</seg><seg type="columnLine">useless vigils with drawn faces and weary eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meantime the Salty River continued to rise. Slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and insidiously, by inches and by half inches, it crept</seg><seg type="columnLine">up and up, up and up, until after two days not more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a hand's breadth separated it from the top of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the embankment. And after three days it had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than a finger's breadth to go, while on the fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">day we could see thin, sparkling streams flowing down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the more low-lying street, not deep enough to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">them quite impassable, but lending to the columned</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughfares the aspect of some pathetic Venice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Simultaneously the autophone brought news that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">small towns of Malgos and Dorion had been inundated</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that their inhabitants had fled for higher ground;</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the larger cities of Atolis, Lerenon, and Aedla</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rearing embankments to keep out the waters, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the farm lands of eastern Atlantis were flooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far as the eye could see. But little that was even</seg><seg type="columnLine">mildly hopeful was reported. It was stated that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">repair ships were still trying to cope with the leak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though without success; that the intra-atomic pumps</seg><seg type="columnLine">were disposing of most of the surplus water, but were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being taxed to capacity; that in several places huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric shovels were at work, digging out great hol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows into which the floods might be drained; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">efforts were being made to freeze huge masses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, and force the ice against the wall, in the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt to stem the torrents. . . . But all the while the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river continued to rise, and nothing short of a miracle</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed likely to check disaster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After five days the water was flowing to a depth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of many inches through half the streets of Archeon;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and only the rapid erection of earthworks had saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other half. And it was after five nerve-racking</seg><seg type="columnLine">days that--as I have stated--I received the summons</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the High Chief Adviser.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The messenger--a wan-faced old man who seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be in a breathless hurry--was waiting for me when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned home with Aelios after strolling aimlessly for</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours through the unflooded portions of the town.</seg><seg type="columnLine">From the grave attitude with which he greeted me, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew at once that something was amiss; but he had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">explicit information to offer. "The High Chief Ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viser wishes to see you without delay," was all that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">373</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would report. And having uttered these words, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">began edging away as though he had immediate busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness elsewliere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There being nothing else to do, I accompanied this</seg><seg type="columnLine">singular messenger after hastily assuring Aelios that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would return as soon as possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I might have anticipated, our walk turned out to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be far from pleasant. The old man had evidently been</seg><seg type="columnLine">long trained in diplomacy, for I could not induce him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak except non-committally and in monosyllables.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And all the way to the office of the Adviser I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">left to my own conjectures, while we skirted public</seg><seg type="columnLine">squares that looked like lakes or waded ankle-deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the salty water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ARRIVING at the many-domed sandstone edifice</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the Atlantean government had its head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters, my companion bade me wait in a book-lined</seg><seg type="columnLine">anteroom, and went to notify his chief of my arrival.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was as though my coming had been awaited, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old man had hardly left me when he reappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">and motioned me to follow him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I have a vague remembrance of accompanying him</seg><seg type="columnLine">through long, arched galleries; but of these my mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">retains no definite impression, and the next thing I</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearly recall is that I stood in a little blue-walled</seg><seg type="columnLine">room before an impressive-looking elderly man whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture I had often seen. His long, furrowed, saga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cious features were manifestly those of a scholar, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a squareness about the jaw that marked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">also as a man of action; while at the same time there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a patriarchal benignity about the sympathetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">lines of the face. But one quality there was which</seg><seg type="columnLine">dominated him now, and which none of the pictures had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown: an air of utter fatigue, of melancholy, almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">of despair, all too plainly written in the hollows that</seg><seg type="columnLine">underlined the weary, gray eyes, in the pale cheeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost totally drained of blood, and in the haggard</seg><seg type="columnLine">expression as of one who has not slept for days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the right of the High Chief Adviser was seated</seg><seg type="columnLine">a man whom I recognized with surprise. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xanocles, also looking pallid and worn--and as he rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to greet me I began to conceive some faint idea why I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been summoned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Chief Adviser gravely motioned me to a seat at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his left; and as I sank into the cushioned chair he</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged without formality into an explanation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I need hardly tell you," he commenced, speaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly but in dull, sober tones, "how serious is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crisis that confronts Atlantis. But perhaps no one--</seg><seg type="columnLine">except those of us who are on the inside of affairs--</seg><seg type="columnLine">realizes quite how acute the danger is. Frankly speak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, we are incapable of dealing with the emergency.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The intra-atomic pumps have been working to ca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pacity for five days, forcing out fifty per cent more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than their usual volume; but, even so, the water is</seg><seg type="columnLine">pouring in at the rate of several tons a second faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">than we can drive it out. This in itself would indi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cate a grave enough peril; but this is not the worst.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our engineers tell us that the crack is extending to</seg><seg type="columnLine">portions of the wall previously unaffected, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">new sections may give way at any time. When this</seg><seg type="columnLine">happens, it will be--the end."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The High Chief Adviser paused, bleakly frowning;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, with a piercing glance at me, as if to see whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had anticipated his meaning, he continued, "It is ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent that Atlantis cannot save itself. We are facing</seg><seg type="columnLine">a peril unique in history, and have not the weapons</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which to combat it. If help comes, it must come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from outside. And that is why I have summoned</seg><seg type="columnLine">you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But I don't exactly see--" I began.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let me explain," the official continued, impatiently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You yourself of course can do nothing. But you come</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a people who, to judge from your writings, have</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed remarkable engineering and mechanical skill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am hopeful that their science may be able to devise</seg><seg type="columnLine">some means of saving us, and for that reason I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">planning to send you above seas for help. What do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you think of the idea?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, I--I think it might be worth trying," was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was able to gasp in reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your friend Xanocles also thinks it worth trying,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceeded the Adviser suavely. "Now I personally</seg><seg type="columnLine">have always been against the policy of Emergence;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it is imperative to try new measures; and at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time like this, fortunately, the law empowers me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take any action on my own initiative. And so I sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Xanocles today as one of the most prominent local</seg><seg type="columnLine">members of the Emergence Party, and when I asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom he would advise me to appoint as special envoy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the upper world he had no hesitation about men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioning you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But why me?" I demanded, doubtful of my quali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fications for so high an office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, to be sure, you were not the only one,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated the Adviser. "He also recommended a certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gavison, but we have decided to hold him in reserve,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and if you do not return in a few days we will send</seg><seg type="columnLine">him out with a second submarine. Meanwhile, if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would care to accept--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why, of course--of course I'll accept--if it is for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the good of Atlantis," I declared. "But just what</seg><seg type="columnLine">would you expect of me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One of our submersible vessels, with a crew of</seg><seg type="columnLine">four men, will be in readiness at the docks early to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow morning. You will board it, and it will bear</seg><seg type="columnLine">you out through the eastern valve and to any part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the upper world you may direct. But you are to</seg><seg type="columnLine">waste no time about informing your fellows of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">menace that confronts Atlantis. They too have sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mersible vessels, as your arrival here proves--let them</seg><seg type="columnLine">send some of their ships down here, if they can, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">materials to repair the wall. But above all things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you must remember not to delay, not to delay!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will do my best," I promised. "But let me not</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold out any false hopes--I am not sure that the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">world will be able to assist."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At any rate, you can try," sighed the Head of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantean government. "It is a chance worth taking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We lose nothing by the attempt."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, fixing on me that powerful magnetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance common to all the Atlanteans, he demanded,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You will spare no effort?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will spare no effort," I solemnly vowed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then the fates be with you!" And the High Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">Adviser rose and firmly took both my hands; and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that just a trace of emotion dimmed his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he fervently continued, "I need say no more. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know as well as I how much depends upon this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Above all things, Harkness, you will make haste, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">will make haste, will you not? Good-bye--and good for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune will be yours!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And the next moment, accompanied by Xanocles, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was passing through the outer galleries. The last</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpse I caught of the High Adviser showed me</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great head wearily sagging, the lids drooping over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the melancholy gray eyes as if in utmost renunciation</seg><seg type="columnLine">or despair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T^ROM the Adviser's office I hastened straight home,</seg><seg type="columnLine">* leaving Xanocles, after being assured that he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to me early in the morning.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I found Aelios impatiently awaiting my return. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">374</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">have been long," she murmured, although it seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that I had come back very quickly. And the big,</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue eyes looked up at me inquiringly, and I had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">explain at once the meaning of the Adviser's summons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She followed my recital without a word; but heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">furrows began to appear upon her brow when I told</seg><seg type="columnLine">her how serious was the plight of Atlantis; and a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">limpid teardrop flowed unheeded down her cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You did right to accept the commission," she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming to me when I had finished my story, and rest-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one hand affectionately upon my shoulder. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deep melancholy made moist her eyes as she con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued, "I am glad that the choice has fallen upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. When do we start on our voyage?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We?" I repeated, staring at her in surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, we. I intend to go with you, of course."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But, Aelios, that's impossible!" I exclaimed, spring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up and drawing her closely to me. "You know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how much I'd like to have you with me. But you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't seem to realize the peril."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Peril?" She laughed disdainfully, as she withdrew</seg><seg type="columnLine">from me. "Do you think I'd have you submit to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">peril I wouldn't share in? Besides, is it not in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest of my own country? Should I stay here</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing nothing when I might help to save Atlantis?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But, even so, would you be permitted--" I started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to protest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course I'd be permitted! The High Chief Ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viser would be more than willing--only, of course, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't ask me to take the risk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And neither would I ask you--" I objected; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she cut me short by demanding, sharply, "Do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">think it's any greater than the risk of staying here?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">And, with the air of one whose mind is made up and is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to be questioned, she reminded me, "We better be</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting ready, for I don't suppose we'll have any time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to waste."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And thereupon, the question having been settled, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">began our meager preparations. But we found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was not much to prepare, for of course the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marine would be well provisioned; and, except for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few personal trinkets, we could think of little to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with us. But it occurred to me to bring a copy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Homer's lost masterpiece, the "Telegonus," which</seg><seg type="columnLine">might convince the upper world of the truth of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">reports about Atlantis. And it also occurred to me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pay a pilfering expedition to the museum, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now untenanted even by the doormen; and, when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned, my pockets were weighed down with several</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces of gold, and my arms were laden with a large</seg><seg type="columnLine">amorphous bundle, whose contents might have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">identified as an Ensign's uniform.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of the night that followed I have only the most con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused and disturbing remembrance. I know that I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not sleep, except to drowse away by brief, nightmare-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunted spells; and I also know that Aelios did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep, for her mind like mine was busy contemplating</seg><seg type="columnLine">the adventure before us. Yet we were both too weary</seg><seg type="columnLine">for connected thought; and jumbled visions were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">that greeted us as we lay there speechless in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The moment the lights were flashed on again we re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced our futile attempts at slumber. And we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly risen and made ourselves presentable when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to receive visitors. Not only did Xanocles ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rive as he had promised, but the entire Upper World</seg><seg type="columnLine">Club appeared in a group, for I had notified Gavison</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my prospective departure and had expressed my de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sire to see all the men again before I left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since all our visitors insisted on seeing us off, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good-sized company that attended us as we bade</seg><seg type="columnLine">farewell to the butterfly-shaped building that had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">housed us so long, and set off through the streets of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stricken city toward the river. Yet our escort, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">large, was far from merry, for the strain of the past</seg><seg type="columnLine">few days was written upon us all, and the pale cheeks</seg><seg type="columnLine">and weary looks of my companions matched their list-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less manner and their silence. One or two--and among</seg><seg type="columnLine">them the unquenchable Stranahan--did indeed attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be jocular; but their efforts were half-hearted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat, and their laughter rang thin and hollow like</seg><seg type="columnLine">mockery; and as we drew nearer our goal and saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flood rippling through the streets ahead, we heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more of their jests, but all of us plunged onward</seg><seg type="columnLine">speechlessly and with stern, set faces, oppressed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though by the shadow of some solemn and awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">presence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN we reached the inundated districts, I of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course urged my companions to turn back. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">they paid no heed, and pressed gravely on their way,</seg><seg type="columnLine">first wading ankle-deep, then halfway to their knees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while strung out in a long line among scattered houses</seg><seg type="columnLine">that looked like lake dwellings. Here a marble edifice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there a colonnade, yonder a cluster of statues, pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected above the deluge, whose green-gray current went</seg><seg type="columnLine">swishing past as though from an inexhaustible source.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Amid those fluid wastes, which had obliterated all fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliar landmarks and gave to well known things a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">and terrible majesty, it was impossible to be sure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our way; and once one of the men slipped into a de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression so deep that he had to swim to save him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self; and more than once some one tripped over some</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried obstacle, and went floundering at full length</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the water, thereby provoking a short-lived out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst of mirth. So great were the dangers that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had to move very slowly; but we also moved with</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim regularity, and our progress was without sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">other than the monotonous splash, splash of our ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vancing feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet it was not only our own plight that made us</seg><seg type="columnLine">moody and sad. As we plodded through the flooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">districts, we had continual glimpses of the inhabitants</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and in their aspect and manner there was nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reassure us. Here, through an open window, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would catch sight of several agile figures straining to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bind some huge collection into a bundle; there we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would observe a man descending from his doorstep</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the enveloping waters, his back bent down with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great pile of household articles, a wan-faced woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging nervously to him or turning back with moist</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes to the home they were leaving. And we passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">not one or two such refugees but scores, literally</seg><seg type="columnLine">scores. One would have a three-year-old perched se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">curely on his shoulder, another would be trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">soothe a crying babe or leading by the hand a fright-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened lad of five; some would be bearing off great</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaps of clothing or huge cans and boxes that looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like food containers, and a few were puffing and pant-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to save their books, rugs and paintings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile the eyes of all the people were baleful</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a wild, unnatural light; their features were as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suming a furtive, hunted expression; their voices had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost their music, and had grown nervous and shrill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And all were looking bloodless and bedraggled; ominous</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollows were forming in their cheeks and beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">their eyes; their clothes were soiled and untended,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their beards scraggly and untrimmed; and many had</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost their normal restraint, so that we passed a woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">who sobbed and sobbed quite regardless of our ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proach, an old man who growled and gibbered insanely</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself, and more than one that did not even seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see us, but stared upward intently with imploring</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, while mumbling incoherent melancholy phrases.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">375</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When finally we drew near our destination, the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached to the knees of the tallest of us, and our</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress was more laborious and slower than ever. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">now began to fear that we would not be able to locate</seg><seg type="columnLine">the river bank, for how tell where the shallow water</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended and the deep began? At length, however, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was relieved to observe a wide, unbroken flowing ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panse several hundred yards ahead, and to note that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long rope, stretched in the water between improvised</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooden supports, marked the river's theoretical edge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was just when we came in sight of our goal that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the supreme horror befell. Even to this day I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">recapture the amazement and alarm of that dread</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment; and the abruptness of it all and the terror</seg><seg type="columnLine">overwhelm me anew. Had the waters swelled and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swept over us in a tidal wave, I would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic-stricken and yet halfway prepared--but I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not have anticipated that the blow was to strike from</seg><seg type="columnLine">above rather than from beneath.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SUDDENLY--although this was only the beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Atlantean day--the golden lights of the glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome began to waver and flicker, then paled to a twi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light glow, then (in less time than it takes to state)</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped into blackness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So startled were we that we stood there transfixed;</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely an oath issued from our petrified lips. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness was .absolute; we could not see our nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighbors; we seemed walled in by oblivion. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment there was silence; then came a light splash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to my left, and simultaneously dozens of voices</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst forth bewilderingly in terror and dismay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And when that first horrified outburst was dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, there crept over us from a distance other cries</seg><seg type="columnLine">--confused cries aa of many voices sighing and wail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in chorus. And all those voices seemed to form</seg><seg type="columnLine">into one, and to grieve and drone in a single long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn sob, with echoes reminding me uncannily of</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost souls mourning in the dark.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But soon that melancholy tumult passed away; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were aware only that we stood there knee-deep in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flood, in a silence unbroken except by the gurgling</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then it was that the most quick-witted of us all</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to his senses. Suddenly a vivid light stabbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gloom just to my left; and by its glaring yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">illumination I could make out the tall form of Xanocles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In his hands was a good-sized pocket flashlight. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a little afraid this might happen," he declared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to be matter-of-fact, and speaking loudly enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us all to hear. "Lucky I had these lanterns with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me." And, to our surprise, he calmly drew several</seg><seg type="columnLine">more flashlights from the folds of his garments, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed them to his nearest neighbors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The High Chief Adviser warned me yesterday that</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was possible," he explained. "And so I thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">it best to be prepared."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then, while we all stood gaping at him like</seg><seg type="columnLine">men with paralyzed minds, he continued, soothingly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There is really nothing to be alarmed about. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">water must have gotten into the electric power gener-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ators--that is all. In a few hours the lights will no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt be shining again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But his words did not carry conviction. In his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a note of concern that he could not wholly exclude;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as we glanced nervously into the gloom--a gloom</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was all-enveloping except for our flashlights and</seg><seg type="columnLine">an occasional firefly flicker in the far distance--we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not believe that the golden luminaries would soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">beam upon us again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a solemn procession that started splashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">once more toward the river bank. Guided by the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sallow illumination of the flashlights, we could barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">find our course; and step by step, with laborious slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, we plodded through the unrelenting flood. None</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us could find the heart to utter a word; and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to time, among my shadowy attendants, I caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">glimpses of lips rigidly compressed and faces firmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">set, as among men who go forth to meet the Ultimate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All the while Aelios was at my side, hovering close</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if for shelter; and when I could I helped her over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the more difficult places, though she too was speech-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, like one whose thoughts are too appalling for ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, for an instant, hope came flashing back. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden radiance burst upon us from above; the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminaries were once more touched with light, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">fitfully expanded from a pale red glow almost to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal golden--and then fitfully died out into utter</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And our cries of rejoicing were frozen on our lips,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the darkness that ensued seemed more intense than</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever. And once more there was only the silence, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavering flashlights and the whirling floods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Groping and floundering and sometimes sinking al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most up to the hips in water, we at last found our-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves near the rope that marked the river's verge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And by turning upstream toward a dim but steady</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow light, we managed to locate the docks and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">submarine, which we recognized by the radiance fil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering through the portholes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, almost before I realized that the ultimate</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment had come, I found myself assisting Aelios</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the half-submerged gangplank and on to the deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the grim, low-lying, shadowy ship. The next that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I remember is that I was back again in two feet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">water, and that a multitude of hands clasped mine, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">multitude of voices were lifted simultaneously, first</seg><seg type="columnLine">the voices of a mob attempting a cheer that died</seg><seg type="columnLine">prematurely, then the voices of individuals, shouting</seg><seg type="columnLine">out advice and farewells, wishing me a safe voyage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">entreating me to make haste for the good of Atlantis.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have a recollection of seeing the earnest, grave face</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Gavison by the uncertain, shifting illumination of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flashlights; the elongated, intellectual face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Xanocles; the youthful but sad-eyed and frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">face of Rawson, and Stranahan's droll countenance now</seg><seg type="columnLine">furrowed almost into a tragic severity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But in an instant all these faces--so familiar to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so well liked--had drifted out of view. I too</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood upon the gangplank, lightly waving although my</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart seemed dull and dead within me. Then I</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted to the deck, cast a last glance at the dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness that hid the marble temples of Atlantis, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">waved for the last time to the dim watching figures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And as the flashlights began slowly to retreat, I de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scended a narrow stairway, heard an iron door clatter</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a close above me, felt a jolt and a shudder that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were followed by a regular, incessant quivering--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that I was on my way back to the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER XXXV</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Return</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE facts of my return from Atlantis have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">reported so widely that it would be futile for</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to dwell upon them. It is generally known</seg><seg type="columnLine">how, having crossed the ocean at the sixty-knot speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">made possible by our intra-atomic propellers, our sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">marine found its way to the mouth of the Potomac and</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost up to Washington; how, after it had anchored</seg><seg type="columnLine">obscurely some distance below the city, I donned my</seg><seg type="columnLine">old uniform and made my way out under cover of</seg><seg type="columnLine">night; how I hastened the next day to the offices of</seg><seg type="columnLine">376</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the naval department, disclosed my identity, and met</seg><seg type="columnLine">with ridicule not only at my incredible tale, but at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my strange appearance, my long beard, my goggles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my greenish skin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Unfortunately, in the haste and confusion of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">departure from the Sunken World, I had made one</seg><seg type="columnLine">oversight. I had forgotten the copy of Homer's lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Telegonus," which I had hoped to exhibit in verifica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of my story! Scattered lines of the poem, to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure, did keep trailing through my mind with a wild,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringing majesty--but they were the merest fragments,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to recite them would have been to brand myself as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a madman. Yet I had little other evidence to dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">play. Aelios could not help me, for she could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak English; and in spite of her exceptional beauty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there would have been nothing to prove that she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">.not been born above seas. And as for the four mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers of the submarine crew, they refused stanchly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the vessel; and, besides, they likewise could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak English, and their fantastic Atlantean garb</seg><seg type="columnLine">would no doubt have marked them also as lunatics.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so there was nothing to do but wait, wait for</seg><seg type="columnLine">days and days, haunting the naval offices, making</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself a laughing stock and a nuisance, yet repeating</seg><seg type="columnLine">my pleas so insistently that in the end they had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be heeded. But meanwhile I was losing time--time</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I knew to be all-important. Even now Atlantis</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be in a death-grip with the waters; and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference of a few hours might bridge the gap be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween safety aiid disaster. Would not my fellows</seg><seg type="columnLine">make haste? was the question I kept asking and ask-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; and all the while they remained inactive and un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved. Every day, with tears in her eyes, Aelios</seg><seg type="columnLine">would inquire when the rescuing expedition was to set</seg><seg type="columnLine">out; and every day I would nod sadly, and sigh, "Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps tomorrow." But tomorrow would bring little</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope; and even when at last an investigation was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dertaken, it was careless and dilatory--and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">long before I could convince the bewildered inspectors</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I was actually one of the company of the lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">X-lll.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was long, indeed, before I could even find any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to identify me. In a land where my acquaint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ances had been legion, I was apparently unknown;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my old friends had either been dispersed or else</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had slipped out of their minds. Even Alma Huntley</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to reply to my letters; and it was months be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore I learned that, having long given me up as lost,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had left two years before for the Pacific Coast</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the bride of the Reverend David Mosely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But though my messages to Alma never reached their</seg><seg type="columnLine">destination, a letter to my old friend, Frank Everett,</seg><seg type="columnLine">survived many forwardings and found its goal; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only did Everett hasten to me from New York,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he summoned others of our former group, whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">testimony combined with the evidence of finger-prints</seg><seg type="columnLine">and handwriting to identify me beyond dispute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Matters now began to move more quickly--in fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a rapidity that was bewildering. Almost over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night my story was flashed from end to end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, and I found myself a public figure. Newspaper</seg><seg type="columnLine">headlines flaunted my name, and the word Atlantis was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on every one's lips; interviewers came swarming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see me, scientists with their demands for information,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heads of lecture bureaus and of motion picture cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porations with their golden offers. But all that really</seg><seg type="columnLine">interested me were the offers of assistance for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sunken World. Several men of means became inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested, and placed large funds at our disposal, so mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing possible the Harkness Institute for Marine Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">search; half a dozen engineers volunteered to accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany me back to Atlantis, and with their aid we se-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cured implements and chemicals capable of sealing wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">breaches in a glass wall. But we could produce no</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel other than that in which we had left Atlantis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the naval submarines were not equipped for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep waters of the Sunken World; and so when finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rescuing party set off down the Potomac from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Washington, its members numbered only six in addi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to Aelios and myself and the original crew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE small size of this expedition and its limited</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment would alone have made us doubtful of</seg><seg type="columnLine">success; but we remembered with acute misgivings that</seg><seg type="columnLine">two full months had passed since we left Archeon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that during all this time the flood waters must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been rising. We were particularly uneasy because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the failure of Gavison to appear ir, a second submarine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the High Chief Adviser had promised; and, brood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing upon his absence, we would recall how we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">bidden farewell to Atlantis, and would think with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shudder of the bleak confusion of the people and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swelling torrents swishing through the darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To make matters worse '(if they could possibly be</seg><seg type="columnLine">worse) our voyage back to Atlantis was beset with</seg><seg type="columnLine">unforeseen difficulties. Owing to the absence of definite</seg><seg type="columnLine">charts and our uncertainty as to the latitude and long-</seg><seg type="columnLine">itude of the Sunken World, we were lost for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">days amid the wildest wastes of the Atlantic. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">times we would dive to the sea bottom, or to such</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths that Atlantis could not conceivably be beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, and would go cruising for hours amid that black</seg><seg type="columnLine">infinity or along the shell-strewn or bouldery floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ocean, staring through the portholes at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous-eyed creatures that flitted ghost-like about</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, and here and there gaping horror-stricken at some</seg><seg type="columnLine">contorted but strangely eloquent rusty iron mass. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Atlantis itself there was no sign, and we had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer impression that it had dissolved bubble-like amid</seg><seg type="columnLine">the watery immensity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so at length our expedition converted itself into</seg><seg type="columnLine">little more than a random questing after what did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear to exist. Should we ever again catch a glimpse</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the green-golden walls of our lost universe? There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were moments when I was given to curious doubts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and felt that Atlantis, once lost, could never be found</seg><seg type="columnLine">again; that the billows would cover it as completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">from our sight as from the sight of the ages. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the time, while we kept dashing at prodigious speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the vacant waters, we were given to strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">fits of hope that alternated with spells of despair,--</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope when we would descry a far-off light that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn out to be merely some elusive fishy lantern,--</seg><seg type="columnLine">despair that our help, already too long delayed, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being retarded to the point of impotence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The final discovery came with startling suddenness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One day, gliding slowly downward at a considerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">depth, we were stopped by a hard, flat barrier that</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread beneath us like the sea bottom. But as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to drift horizontally, we observed that the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face was smooth and ominously light-reflecting--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a gasp of despair we recognized that the sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance was glass!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The surprise and horror of that moment are still</seg><seg type="columnLine">vivid in my memory. "Turn the searchlights down,</seg><seg type="columnLine">down!" muttered the leader of our crew, in a voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">that trembled perceptibly; and as the great water-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piercing streamers began to quiver and shake and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly descended in long, rambling curves, Aelios came</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing to my side like a child who fears to be alone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and clung closely to me while we both stared through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the portholes with faces rigid and eager.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at first we saw nothing. All was dark beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE SUNKEN WORLD</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">377</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">us--not a gleam, not a flicker, broke the blackness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sunken World.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, as the searchlights swayed and shifted till</seg><seg type="columnLine">they swept the depths directly beneath, we began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make out familiar objects amid the obscurity. Dimly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely, as though draped in a fog, the outlines of</seg><seg type="columnLine">great domes and arches and colonnades began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerge, interspersed by Titanic columns and statuesque</seg><seg type="columnLine">temples that appeared to waver uncannily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See! See! It is still there!" Aelios cried, frantically,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as she pressed more closely to me; and with the agony</seg><seg type="columnLine">of despair in her voice was mingled just a tinge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I took her hand and sought to console her; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as I did so her whole body began to shake</seg><seg type="columnLine">spasmodically, and her sobbing throbbed from end</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to end of the ship. For many minutes she seemed unable</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speak.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet, even while the long-drawn, heartbreaking sobs</seg><seg type="columnLine">panted forth, she began to point, to point distractedly</seg><seg type="columnLine">downward, with blind, quivering fingers that called</seg><seg type="columnLine">with frenzied urgency, forcing me to peer again</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the porthole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With my arms still about her, I scanned the dim,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghostly twilight. But for a moment I observed noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing alarming. Then, as my gaze became focused upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a gray dome just below, I too cried out in dread</seg><seg type="columnLine">realization.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Those glass-covered depths were not without sign of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, as I had thought; but here and there a lantern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing object, with flapping finny body, went wavering</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the windows and above the temple roofs!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The End.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Back Numbers of AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IF you are one of the few readers who have begun reading the Quarterly with this issue, you may</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably wish to get the preceding issues.

She would rather be with you, no matter how</seg><seg type="columnLine">inhospitable the little world to which you are going."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But I will come back!" insisted Hale McLaren</seg><seg type="columnLine">urgently. "We know why our experimental animals</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not return.

"We called you over here</seg><seg type="columnLine">to explain to you again the danger of the trip you</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to make with me. Frankly, I don't want you</seg><seg type="columnLine">along, but your father says you can come if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course I'm going!" she retorted with mock de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiance. "Do you think I want to lose you to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">atomic vamp?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This is serious," he persisted, refusing for once</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to yield to her rallying. He led the way to the corner</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the big, bare room, where he moved aside a denim</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtain sliding on a wire, which hid a maze of enig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matic apparatus, evidently electrical in its nature. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of a large helix, on a base of peculiar translucent</seg><seg type="columnLine">green material, stood a great glass bell, large enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">for two or three persons to stand inside. A bank of high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">voltage vacuum tubes against one wall was connected</seg><seg type="columnLine">by means of heavy copper tubiiig to various points</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the helix. The translucent green base was sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported on a number of cylinders, which formed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydraulic hofst so that the heavy green disc could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be lowered in order to permit the introduction of ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jects under the independently supported bell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm going to start in a few minutes," McLaren in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed Shirley, and despite his assumed brusqueness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice betrayed a tremor of tenderness.

I will admit</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we are as much in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dark regarding our</seg><seg type="columnLine">primary quest as ever, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our researches we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened new vistas that</seg><seg type="columnLine">are fully as beautiful and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as interesting as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truths we first sought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By utilizing the newly</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovered cosmic ray,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which has a wavelength</seg><seg type="columnLine">infinitely shorter than any</seg><seg type="columnLine">other known kind of light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have been able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get circumstantial evidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">that electrons do not con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sist solely of a negative</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric charge, as physi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cists have thought before,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that this charge is</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually held by a real</seg><seg type="columnLine">particle of matter, so in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">finitely small that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never get direct</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidence of its existence by the older methods.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "While pursuing these studies, we stumbled upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">another property of the cosmic ray. We found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain harmonics of the ray, when enormously ampli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied, have the property of reducing or increasing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass and volume of all matter, without changing its</seg><seg type="columnLine">form. We have discovered no limit to this power. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe it is infinite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now this suggests a possible solution of the prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lem of the constitution of the universe. Could we</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove that the atom, with its central nucleus and its</seg><seg type="columnLine">satellites, called electrons, is really only a miniature</seg><seg type="columnLine">universe, in fact and not by analogy only, we could</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">1VERYTHING in this world is relative, with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">r or without Einstein. Even time is relative.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">As Benjamin Franklin pointed out, the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Epliemerid fly lives only twenty-four hours;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">yet leads a normal existence. During those</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">twenty-four hours, it lives a full-time life,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which, to the fly is of the same duration as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a 60 to 70 year old life led by the human</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">being. So too, is it with a microbe or mi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crobe organism, which lives only a few min-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">utes and then dies. These few minutes con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stitute a normal cycle. 'It simply lives much</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">more quickly, although it does not realize it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  You can conversely imagine a race of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">super-beings on some other planet, which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">normally would live perhaps 10,000 years,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">as computed according to our time. To</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">them our few years of allotted life would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">be incomprehensible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Here is a charming story which contains</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">excellent science and will make you under-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stand a great deal about the atomic world,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">if you do not knoxv it already.

His assistant was flushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and enthusiastic, and his daughter's cheeks glowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">brightly and her eyes sparkled. But she was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking at the apparatus; she was looking at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth, dark hair of her fianc&lt;5.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have sent things into that sub-universe," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued, "chairs, coins, glasses, bricks and things</seg><seg type="columnLine">like that. And we have brought some of them back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But when we sent guinea pigs or rabbits, or a stray</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog into that world of mystery, we could not bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">them back. Hale thinks the animals may have wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered away, out of focus of our rays. I don't know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He may be right, or they may have met some ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible unknown fate. Now he offers himself for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">experiment. It is dangerous. It may be ghastly. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you wish to go with him, you may. Your mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">is dead. You may leave me lonely in my old age;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but you may go--for science!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A solemn hush followed the simple words. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">Shirley said clearly: "I will go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE physicist turned his head for a moment. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">he faced them again, there was no sign of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental struggle. Firmly, he threw a lever, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green base silently lowered to the floor. McLaren and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl stepped upon it, and when it rose again it</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried them into the glass bell. The professor turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the raised platform where the control board was</seg><seg type="columnLine">located.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good-bye!" he called. "I'll bring you back in</seg><seg type="columnLine">half an hour."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good-bye!" they returned, their voices muffled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A powerful generator sprang into action, filling</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory with its high-pitched whine. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacuum tubes glowed dully, and a powerful odor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ozone permeated the air. With a loud crash, the high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tension electricity discharged between adjacent turns</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the helix. The professor hastened to adjust a</seg><seg type="columnLine">condenser, and again the silence was broken only by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whine of the generator and a low humming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the professor continued to adjust the controls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bell gradually filled with a deep violet light that</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed and swirled tenuously like the drapes of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">aurora borealis. Tho Mght swirled around the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the girl, at times a'most hiding them from view.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It gradually concentratec'. toward the bottom of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell, seeming to cling to vhe green base, intertwining</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two living forms until it almost hid them from</seg><seg type="columnLine">view. Yet they continued to smile and wave encour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now it was evident that they were growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller. Already they were less than four-feet tall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and as the apparatus was brought more and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">into perfect resonance, their rate of shrinkage ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">celerated. Soon they were but a foot high, standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a sea of violet light, then six inches, then hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inch. The professor turned off the generator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl and the man now walked the few inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary to bring them to the exact center of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">base. Here, in a slight depression in the smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">material, was a tiny granule of carbon, one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atoms of which they were to explore. It was so tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it could hardly be seen under the microscope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinarily, yet to McLaren, it must already have be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come plainly visible, for he soon spoke to the girl and</seg><seg type="columnLine">she joined him, standing with him very closely near</seg><seg type="columnLine">a spot on the floor which he indicated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the mysterious harmonics of the cosmic ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">were brought into action, and the two tiny figures</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished from sight. The professor stayed at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">controls, his eyes fixed anxiously on his watch until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proper time had elapsed, as indicated by his cal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culations. He stopped the dynamo again and laid his</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch on the table. He marked the time when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should recall them, 10 minutes after four, and paced</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervously up and down the room in which he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now alone. Moisture beading his brow, he stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stared at the slight depression in which lay a</seg><seg type="columnLine">million universes, each one as complete and as per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fect as his own, and in one of those universes was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a whirling speck on which he had deposited his daugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter and best-loved assistant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started as the telephone whirred and disposed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a student who wanted to make a trifling inquiry. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he went back to his watch again, listened to see if</seg><seg type="columnLine">his watch might have stopped. It was very still in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory, and when a small rill of water sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly cascaded out of the cooling jacket of one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy-duty vacuum tubes, the noise seemed loud and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strident.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A new thought was now harassing Professor Hai-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley. Suppose that in that unthinkably small world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were dangerous creatures, whom Hale and Shir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ley might be battling for their lives even at that mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Perhaps this world might happen to be a blaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sun; suppose they had gasped their lives out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sterile and airless moon? He looked at his watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. The half-hour was almost up. A few more</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes, and they'd be ready and waiting to come back</seg><seg type="columnLine">--wouldn't do to turn on the ray while they might be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a short distance away, out of focus.--A few more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds--now!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WITH a fierce sweep, he threw the switch and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">violet light filled the glass bell again. Quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he reversed the current--then crept to the base of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass dome so that he might see the returned wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derers as soon as they grew into visibility.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within a few minutes a small cloudy patch appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the glassy depression where the microscopic granule</seg><seg type="columnLine">of carbon lay. Before the physicist's eyes this spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">resolved itself into hundreds of tiny dots--dots that</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew rapidly until they resembled minute upright pegs</seg><seg type="columnLine">--pegs that presently grew large enough to show arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and legs. Small human-like creatures that were plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">men and women by the time they were half an inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">tall. Men and women that grew and walked about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and were evidently greatly perturbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hailey watched them with amazement until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were a few inches tall. He did not move until they</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to be so crowded that there was danger of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smothering some of them. Then he leaped to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">switch to stop their growth, and lowered the green</seg><seg type="columnLine">disc until it was at the same level as the table, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">which some of the' more venturesome now jumped for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sake of more room. As he watched them in stupe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">faction, looking vainly for McLaren and Shirley, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man separated himself from the crowd, walked to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the table, made a deep obeisance, and called:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are we?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice was thin and reedy, like the chirp of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">insect, and his accent was slurred and difficult to</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand. Yet he spoke recognizable English.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are on earth," said Hailey automatically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This remark created the most profound impression.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A thin, sighing cry arose from the little people, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">many of them prostrated themselves. They wore filmy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">short robes that came to their kness, held to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies by girdles. Men and women were dressed pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly alike, but there was a well defined plan of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ornamentation which distinguished the sexes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">OUT OF THE SUB-UNIVERSE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">381</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leader turned on them and cried:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hark!

While Taine, one of the shrewdest detec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives west of the Rockies, was rushing across the conti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nent under sealed orders he considered this fact and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked forward with eager anticipation to the time when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would become acquainted with the problem, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was apparently too difficult for the Eastern operators</seg><seg type="columnLine">to handle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Arriving in the great city he at once went to the Penn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sylvania Hotel, where a room had been reserved for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and, in the privacy of that room, he opened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">read his sealed orders. He did so with a growing sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of disappointment. He had expected something excit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and instead was simply directed to wait in his room</seg><seg type="columnLine">till visited by an old man with puppies for sale. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these he was to offer to buy the black one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That was all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To Taine it looked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unnecessary piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nonsense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">However, he had hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to unpack his baggage</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the telephone rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a voice at the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">end asked whether the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleman would like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">buy a fine puppy.

Without speaking,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Taine closed and locked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, and then started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look over the little dogs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally he found one that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was solid black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll take this one he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.

This is Mr. Tally of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the United States Secret Service, who has come espe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cially from Washington for this meeting.

To</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a long story short,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man died, but my de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">partment had time to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">his finger prints and take</seg><seg type="columnLine">his measurements. As soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he died he was buried by</seg><seg type="columnLine">his friends, and all we had was the record we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made. We found that the prints and the measure-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments were identical with those of a negro criminal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">well known some years ago to our Secret Service.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unfortunately for our peace of mind, the dead man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a white man. That has happened twice since then, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had to explain it or confess that our method of</seg><seg type="columnLine">identifying criminals was worthless. After the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">incident in which we also lost the body, we were all</seg><seg type="columnLine">on edge and when it occurred again, we held the body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It took some rather clever work but we were able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have Dr. Jenkins make a thorough examination of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">UR well-known author, who has endeared</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">himself to the hearts of Amazing Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">readers, has written a series of unique</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stories for the Quarterly.

My pathologists examined that</seg><seg type="columnLine">body in every way known to medical science and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body of a white man. The hair, however, was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the negro race. No use going into details about it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though. We felt, when we finished, that while it looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the body of a white man, it was somehow the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a negro, who had in some mysterious way turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">white: Of course such an idea was rather fantastic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not impossible, so we made a full report to Chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gray. He has been working on the problem and can</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you about it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wish I could," said Gray. "If I could solve this</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem I would be very happy. We put two of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">best men on it and they simply dropped out of sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I had a Philadelphia operator sent over and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">never made a preliminary report. The Washington</seg><seg type="columnLine">man put in a call for help but by the time we arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was gone and that was the end of him. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident that we were up against a system that was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">clever as we were. So I called in the United States</seg><seg type="columnLine">Secret Service, and Mr. Tally has been working with</seg><seg type="columnLine">me for some months. Suppose we let him tell about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the international developments."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One of the most interesting parts to that," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tally, continuing the story, "has been the large amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gold transferred to New York from all the Conti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nental countries, especially from France. No definite</seg><seg type="columnLine">information can be secured concerning this gold, save</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it is in bulk and the property of a small group</seg><seg type="columnLine">of foreigners, who are steadily buying New York real</seg><seg type="columnLine">estate with their wealth. We know fairly well who</seg><seg type="columnLine">these people are--that is, we know who they are now--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it has been about useless to try and find out who</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were and where they secured their wealth. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe that as a group they are the richest financiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the world. Some of their purchases in this city</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been so unusual that no one, except the parties</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly concerned, know about them. We have a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">actual facts, a few surmises and one definite conclu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion. We are sure that a group of white men, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">continental Europe, have moved to New York and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their great wealth have purchased large blocks of real</seg><seg type="columnLine">estate. This is all adjacent to Harlem. And, as fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it is purchased, it is being occupied by colored people.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just what this means can only be surmised. Mr. Biddle</seg><seg type="columnLine">will tell you how it affects the financial interests of</seg><seg type="columnLine">America's greatest city. The Government is inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested in the problem, but the New York Bankers' As-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sociation, being directly concerned, is financing this</seg><seg type="columnLine">investigation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Â«X7'OU are a stranger to our city and its problems,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">A began Mr. Biddle, in a low, impressive voice,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and so it may be well to tell you something about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harlem. It is a city within a city, and is populated</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely by the colored race. There they have their</seg><seg type="columnLine">own theaters, hotels, department stores, homes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment houses. During the day most of them work</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the white race in New York; at night they return</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their own city. We have depended on them for our</seg><seg type="columnLine">servants and laborers and have, to a great extent, en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">couraged their forming such a social and economic</seg><seg type="columnLine">center. For many years it has slowly increased in size</seg><seg type="columnLine">but this growth has been in strict proportion to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth of the entire city and so has been considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal and healthy. But the situation during the past</seg><seg type="columnLine">three years has been different and has given us all</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason for the greatest anxiety. In the first place</seg><seg type="columnLine">there has come to New York this group of foreigners,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who are so wealthy that our Association can only guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to what their total assets really amount to.

All of our society has been attracted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, and there have been several marriages between</seg><seg type="columnLine">their young people and ours, though this has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">frowned upon by our best families. These aristocrats</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the financial world are buying stocks, bonds, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the control of many of our great industries. We believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">'they hold the larger part of several of our railroads.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They have fastened tightly to the food supplies. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one has bought all the visible wheat and we believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are to be found at the bottom of the firm who have</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly bought several of our largest hotels. The most</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar thing is their real estate purchases. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">property around Harlem is being sold, and as fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it is being sold and the leases expire the tenements,</seg><seg type="columnLine">both houses and apartments, are being rented to colored</seg><seg type="columnLine">people. From all over the United States, Central</seg><seg type="columnLine">America and Europe, in fact wherever there are mem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers of that race, they are steadily moving to New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York, and in some way they are helped to make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">living. Each day it becomes harder for a white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">to secure work here, and every month a larger percent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the work in the city is being done by colored labor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That does not mean just pick and shovel work. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">ere going into the so-called white collar positions, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white men are forced to either associate with them</seg><seg type="columnLine">or to leave the city. Of course the rich are unaffected,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but when we find the controlling shares of a bank</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock in the hands of these wealthy foreigners, and one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their number elected to the Presidency of the Bank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it becomes a matter of great concern to us. During</seg><seg type="columnLine">the past year the white population of Greater New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York, and here I speak of all Caucasian groups in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, has remained absolutely stationary. On the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, the colored population has gained five hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">per cent."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused long enough to wipe the beads of sweat</seg><seg type="columnLine">off his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can you see what it means?

Well dressed, of olive com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plexion, with classical features, he looked more like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">college professor than a Bank President As the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Harlem Commercial Bank, he occupied a spe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cially favored position in the social and financial life of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that portion of New York. His wife was one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">social leaders, in fact there were many who considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">her The Social Leader. Their daughter, Florabella,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just graduated from a French convent, was perfectly</seg><seg type="columnLine">endowed by nature in every way to perpetuate the social</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing of the New York Acquoines. All that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed was just a little more wealth, and then?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Morosco Acquoine was thinking about a letter he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had just received from Paris, telling him of the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parture for New York of a very interesting person, by</seg><seg type="columnLine">name Jules Gerome. He was from Indo-China where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had amassed great wealth. No one could tell just</seg><seg type="columnLine">how much he was worth. He had been warmly re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived by the colored colony in Paris and had enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tained elegantly and lavishly. Much to the disappoint-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the Parisians he had decided to make New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York his permanent home, and would arrive shortly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was hoped that he would make the Harlem Com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercial Bank his chief depository. If he did, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Acquoine's financial worries were at an end. Finally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was of interest to know that he had very regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">features, was very light in color and was unmarried.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As far as could be ascertained, his morals were exem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No wonder that the Bank President pondered over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">letter. It was not at all surprising that he wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaguely whether such a man would by any chance be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come interested in his daughter, Florabella Acquoine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A week later Mr. Jules Gerome sent in his card and</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked for a few minutes of Mr. Acquoine's time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Within a very few minutes Mr. Gerome was seated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a comfortable chair, refusing a very expensive cigar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not smoke," said that young man sedately. "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found years ago that it injured the pearly lustre of</seg><seg type="columnLine">my teeth. I have been through many hardships in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">life, but I have always taken the best care possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MENACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">385</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of my teeth; but it is not of that I wish to confer</seg><seg type="columnLine">with you. Here are some letters of introduction which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I trust will be sufficient to allow me to become a deposi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tor in your bank."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are not necessary, Mr. Gerome," answered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Banker, cordially.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps not necessary, but usually a good thing. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was advised to select you, not only as my depository,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but also as my fiscal agent."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will be pleased to serve you in any way. Do you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish to open an account today?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I came here direct from the steamer. Can you</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure a small furnished apartment for me, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">competent valet and a cook? I want to be in my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">home by night time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is a rather short time," said Mr. Acquoine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"but perhaps it can be arranged."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think so. My first deposit with you will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty million dollars. Here are letters of exchange</seg><seg type="columnLine">for that amount in gold."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am sure that you will be in your own home before</seg><seg type="columnLine">bedtime," said the Banker. "In fact, I am very sure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. We will go up to my home for dinner. I want you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to meet my family and rest from your trip, while my</seg><seg type="columnLine">agents are preparing for your needs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not want to put your wife to any trouble--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I assure you it will be a pleasure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At dinner that day the Banker tried to explain to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife how very important Mr. Gerome would be in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">business life of New York. The little stranger, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, assured the two women that such was not at all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the case.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have been fortunate enough," he remarked, very</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly, "to amass in a very busy life considerable</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth. I feel that this is not mine, but is really a</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust, and I am going to try and spend at least a part</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it, in this city, to help uplift my less fortunate</seg><seg type="columnLine">brothers and sisters. I have several ideas in my mind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like founding a day nursery and opening night schools.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want my race to rise, but while they are being ele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vated, they must also be helped. I would like to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered in New York as a philanthropist rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a philanderer, a man of charity rather than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of wealth. In order to learn how to help them I</seg><seg type="columnLine">must first learn to know them and I am sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mrs. Acquoine will spend some time with me, teaching</seg><seg type="columnLine">me what I ought to know about the problems of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored race in America."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will be proud to help you, and so will Florabella,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">assented the proud matron, and while the daughter was</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent, her eyes were mute but eloquent witnesses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her desire to be of assistance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From that day on, Mr. Jules Gerome led the life</seg><seg type="columnLine">appropriate to the richest bachelor in Harlem. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">became interested in the hospitals, day nurseries, night</seg><seg type="columnLine">schools and savings banks of the negro colony. He not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only visited them but he carefully studied them and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made handsome contributions, not only in cash, but in</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggestions leadng to their greater usefulness as well.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He made no effort to become a social leader, but more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more his private suppers, for never over five</seg><seg type="columnLine">guests, were becoming the talk and despair of Harlem</seg><seg type="columnLine">aristocracy. There was such a great gulf between</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who had been guests on these occasions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">those who had not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> More and more frequently he appeared in public as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the escort of Miss Florabella Acquoine. Small, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular features and only the faintest color, she pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented a type of beauty that only an expert would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">refused to recognize as purest Caucasian. When the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young couple first appeared together at the theater,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of Harlem was thrilled and pronounced themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly satisfied with the match, and after that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> hardly a day passed but Mr. Gerome needed the assist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of Miss Acquoine with his welfare work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Banker realized that matters were looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious and wore a contented, perpetual smile. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his wife had always had other plans for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter but, when it came to marrying millions, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that their own desires could be set aside. In fact,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they believed that there was no need of making any</seg><seg type="columnLine">change in their arrangements, simply include the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealthy Frenchman in them. He had several lengthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">interviews with the Powerful Ones in a Wall Street</seg><seg type="columnLine">office and then felt ready to go over the entire matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the man he hoped to make his son-in-law.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MB. JULES GEROME had been in New York three</seg><seg type="columnLine">months, when he called, by appointment, on Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Morosco Acquoine. Both men were immaculately</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed. Without hesitation, the Banker opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">.conversation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My wife tells me that you are paying more and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to my daughter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I will have to admit it," replied the smiling young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Are your intentions serious?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I have every reason to believe that the future will</seg><seg type="columnLine">show that they are."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suppose I should ask you to stop? What if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">told you that my idea was to have her marry a white</seg><seg type="columnLine">man?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That would be foolish. No respectable white man</seg><seg type="columnLine">would marry her knowing what she was. She is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lovely child, but she has the drop of blood in her--</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have the drop--so has your wife.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have longed to go over the line but so far I have stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">by my people. You know I could pass any day and</seg><seg type="columnLine">anywhere as pure white. Now if we only were white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would be a different matter."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suppose-" and the Banker hesitated to continue</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in a whisper, "Suppose I knew a way by which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of us and you can actually become white. Would</seg><seg type="columnLine">you join us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That sounds impossible to me, but it is what I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have wanted all my life. Yes, I would go with you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Would you marry my daughter?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why--I have not even talked of love to her.

Five years ago a group of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">race discovered a source of gold. You observe that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">say source--and I use that word because I do not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">any other to use--but whether they found the gold or</seg><seg type="columnLine">whether they make it, the fact is that they are not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the rich groups of the world, but the richest. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">made up their minds to own New York, but their color</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an insuperable barrier to such ambition. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">they added to their combination a brilliant physician.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He discovered something, I don't know what, not being</seg><seg type="columnLine">a scientist, but it was something that turns a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, or a brown man, white. So this group changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the color of a selected number of brilliantly educated,</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable colored men and women, supplied them with</seg><seg type="columnLine">386</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> unlimited funds and started them in a quiet fight to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make New York a colored city. When the time comes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">every negro in the world, irrespective of his brains,</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be turned white. I have talked with the Powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ones and have received permission for the four of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be changed. I will sell all my interests here, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then we will take the treatment and make a trip around</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world. When we return, it will be with new names,</seg><seg type="columnLine">new interests and new ambitions. We will be white,</seg><seg type="columnLine">not just pretended white, but actually white. We will</seg><seg type="columnLine">join those who for the last five years have been leaders</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this movement, that will make the city of New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York our city and that will finally transform an entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">race."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am astonished!" cried Mi-.

Now that I have arrived at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">decision I can hardly wait. I see now how I can make</seg><seg type="columnLine">my wealth and position in life worth something. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will return to Indo-China and make that a white spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the face of Asia."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you will take Florabella with you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If we are married I do not see how I can keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">her away from me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two men parted that night, each thoroughly</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied with the way destiny was shaping his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HIGH above the rest of New York towered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Center Internationale. At the ground it rested</seg><seg type="columnLine">on four city squares. For fifty stories it reared its</seg><seg type="columnLine">colossal bulk without contraction, then it gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">became smaller for thirty more stories. From there it</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose, a gorgeous spire of flashing windows and cop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered frame work for twenty additional levels, ending</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a golden serpent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lower half was tenanted by lawyers, physicians</seg><seg type="columnLine">and business firms of all description. The upper half</seg><seg type="columnLine">was generally supposed to be occupied by an ultra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashionable club, concerning which there was much</seg><seg type="columnLine">rumored and little known.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The battery of elevators ran from the first to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiftieth floor. That floor was unoccupied by tenants,</seg><seg type="columnLine">being merely a large lobby. Those having the right to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enter the upper half evidently knew how to do so but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the modus opemndi was not apparent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Jules Gerome, being told over the telephone that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time had come for the long anticipated meeting with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leaders of this new movement, those mysterious</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknowns called by Mr. Morosco Acquoine, THE</seg><seg type="columnLine">POWERFUL ONES, passed the night in writing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">meditation. His correspondence consisted of a lengthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">report covering his entire knowledge up to that time--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> and a short letter of affection to his wife and daugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters. His meditation was mainly concerning his real</seg><seg type="columnLine">belief in the doctrine of predestination. As a proper</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning to the new day he strolled out after break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fast and purchased two dozen red carnations. Twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">three of these he neatly decapitated, placing the heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his various pockets, while he put the twenty-fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his button-hole. Passing down the Avenue he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost run into by a subservient, whining Servian, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked him if he did not want to buy a puppy. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">whining of the little dogs stung his memory like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lash and he asked if the man had a jet black one.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man had one but the breed was not suitable for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an aristocratic French Colonial, so after some argu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment Gerome continued his walk, while the Servian</seg><seg type="columnLine">hailed a Yellow Cab and disappeared: but in his basket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the puppies, were a red carnation and two letters:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  That noon Mr. Jules Gerome lunched tete-a-tete with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miss Florabella Acquoine. The table was decorated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with pink carnations, from which the dapper millionaire</seg><seg type="columnLine">renewed his wilted bouttonierre. He also, in an absent</seg><seg type="columnLine">minded manner, pulled the stems of others of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowers, placing the flowers in his pocket. Florabella</seg><seg type="columnLine">was deliciously vivacious, while her escort was quietly</seg><seg type="columnLine">adoring in his aristrocratic mood. Anyone could tell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just by watching them, that they were very happy in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their anticipatory dreams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Going out to his automobile Gerome dropped the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a red carnation.

"You make</seg><seg type="columnLine">me nervous.

Their clothing indicated a night</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pleasure, their manner an evening of apprehensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloom. They left their car at the Center Internationale,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and walked to one of the express elevators which went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the fiftieth floor without a stop. As he entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevator, Gerome dropped several carnations on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leaving the elevator, the party entered the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">which marked the separation between the two parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the building. Here long rows of marble columns</seg><seg type="columnLine">separated the large floor into several plazas, the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">of which, open to the air, were being used as roof</seg><seg type="columnLine">gardens, open-air restaurants and dancing pavilions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The floor was thronged with hundreds of men and</seg><seg type="columnLine">women, whose dress and general manner marked them</seg><seg type="columnLine">as leaders in the aristocracy of the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Passing into one of the restaurants, Mr. Morosco</seg><seg type="columnLine">Acquoine beckoned to the head-waiter, gave him his</seg><seg type="columnLine">name and stated that he had ordered supper served in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">private room. The head-waiter remembered the order</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly and led them to a small dining-room, just large</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for four. Here supper was served, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors closed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  None of the party seemed to have much appetite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The conversation did not approach the brilliancy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the glass-ware.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they ate, Gerome noticed, or thought he noticed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slight shifting of the entire room. He closed his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and concentrated on the sensations which came to him</seg><seg type="columnLine">from different parts of his body. Finally he decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his first suspicion was correct.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MENACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">387</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The private dining room was simply a camouflaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevator.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While they were eating their supper, they were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly carried upward. Gerome shrugged his shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">and kept quiet. He did not want to have two hysterical</seg><seg type="columnLine">females to care for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now and then the door opened and another course</seg><seg type="columnLine">was served.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally, after the ice and coffee, the door was again</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened and the same obsequious head-waiter who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ushered them into the room, appeared to usher them</seg><seg type="columnLine">put.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They walked out of the room into a different world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The two women were asked to wait in a tiny parlor; the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were asked to follow the waiter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few seconds they found themselves in what</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be a business office. Around a small mahog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">any table sat five white men. There were three empty</seg><seg type="columnLine">chairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Morosco Acquoine and Mr. Jules Gerome were</seg><seg type="columnLine">given seats. The remaining chair remained unoccupied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Cigars were passed. Acquoine took one and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to smoke in an agitated manner. Gerome refused with</seg><seg type="columnLine">% blas6, but polite gesture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not smoke," he said quietly to the stranger at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his side, "I found out years ago, that it injures the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearly lustre of my teeth. I have been through many</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardships in my life, but I have always tried to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">the best care possible of my teeth. Once gone they can</seg><seg type="columnLine">never be replaced."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man he addressed looked at him as though he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hear a word he said. Then a gong sounded in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">neighboring room. Again and again it boomed with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentle but positive rhythm. Gerome started to dig long</seg><seg type="columnLine">forgotten sounds out of his sub-conscious memories.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly he recalled an evening, floating down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Congo, in a native dug out--He sat just a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">straighter in his chair, saying to himself, between mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tionless lips: "By all that's Holy! That is the tom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tom."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE looked at the men seated around the table. With-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out exception they seemed to be autocrats of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">business world, cultural leaders, Chesterfields: yet all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them were gently moving their heads and bodies in</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmony with the rhythm of the drum-beat, and no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoke till the throbbing waves of sound ceased to invade</seg><seg type="columnLine">the deep silence of the room. Then, and then only did</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the older men speak, in perfect English, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">well chosen words and a pronounciation that could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been gained at Oxford.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We are so glad to have you gentlemen with us this</seg><seg type="columnLine">evening. It means so much to us. When Mr. Morosco</seg><seg type="columnLine">Acquoine decided to join us we looked on it as the usual</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing for a man of his position to do, but when you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Jules Gerome, not only threw your lot in with ours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in addition offered us twenty million for propaganda</seg><seg type="columnLine">purposes, we considered it an event. It is very unusual</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a man like you, with your boundless wealth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">great influence, to freely offer such a gift: in fact, Sir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is a magnificent gesture, and one for which you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be well repaid. I am sure that nothing but the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">deadly hatred of the white race could have impelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to take such an important step. May we ask the</seg><seg type="columnLine">details leading up to that hatred?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I will be glad to tell you about it. I was but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere slip of a lad in Indo-China, just a bit of a boy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I had a difference of opinion with an overseer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Unable to conquer me in a fair fight, he secured help,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had me thrown to the ground and then kicked me in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, knocking out several of my teeth. So extensive was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the damage, that I have to wear a rather large upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate, which I will now show you, as proof that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sordid tale is true." Mr. Gerome placed before them,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on the polished surface of the mahogany table, an upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate, left it there for a full minute and then replaced</seg><seg type="columnLine">it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I felt confident," continued the first speaker, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">something like this had happened to you. I am sure</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it makes us more willing than ever to admit you to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our councils. As we have some moments to spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">before this other chair is occupied, I will take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity of explaining to you very thoroughly just</seg><seg type="columnLine">what we are doing and how we are doing it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You no doubt are thoroughly familiar with thej</seg><seg type="columnLine">effort made throughout the world to advance the inter*</seg><seg type="columnLine">ests of our race. England freed her slaves by purchase,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the United States made them free, solely as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">political movement, to enable the Northern States to</seg><seg type="columnLine">win the Civil War. After that war, various efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were made by well meaning individuals and organiza-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions to help the negro rise economically but never</seg><seg type="columnLine">socially. Throughout the white world, but especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the Nordic peoples, the Caucasians could never</seg><seg type="columnLine">forget that they were white and the negro was black,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as if the matter of color made any vital difference.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was the way they felt--we produced poets, play-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrights, musicians, authors of no mean ability--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">while we were made much of--they could never forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we were black. Ten years ago a few of us gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the effort, and looked for a way of escape--not from</seg><seg type="columnLine">our race--but from our color. A peculiar and fortunate</seg><seg type="columnLine">combination of circumstances made some of us feel that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand of God was in it and behind it, though no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt our enemies more likely call it the claw of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Devil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We were fortunate in securing the aid of a chemist</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a physician who was more of a scientist than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctor. We pooled our finances, established, after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest effort, a fund of over a million dollars and</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed it to these two men. Somehow they were to</seg><seg type="columnLine">produce wealth and whiteness. We believed at the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">that white bodies were useless without wealth and that'</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth was of no avail with discolored epidermis.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "These two men toiled, but it was a labor of love.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Within a year they had expended the million. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised another million. We sold all we had, borrowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">all we could, stole as we might, and then we worked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of us was a Pullman porter, another a valet, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">one even worked as a street cleaner. Living on almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing, we gave our combined income to the cause. Ati</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of three years the chemist produced a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">diamonds, but the market could not absorb enough of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such stones to satisfy our ambition, and we urged him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to concentrate upon gold. To our great satisfaction he</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded, not in making it, but in extracting it. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">no doubt are aware that there is gold everywhere, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air, but in such minute quantities as to make it</seg><seg type="columnLine">commercially valueless. Our chemist invented a means</seg><seg type="columnLine">of separating it from the ocean. The details are of no</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest to you at this time, but we built a yacht with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a twelve-inch pipe running through it to a central</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory and then to the stern of the ship. The water</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply ran through the ship, while the chemist smoked</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pipe and the Captain kept one eye on the weather.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Periodically they came to port and unloaded their cargci</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a most interesting performance, as far as we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned. Of course we put the gold to work; idle</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealth is useless to everyone. The money was invested</seg><seg type="columnLine">and reinvested till the original source was concealed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the changes, and then it was brought to America.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We had no trouble in buying anything we wanted to;</seg><seg type="columnLine">buy. I assure you that selling a man something for</seg><seg type="columnLine">actual cash and meeting him socially are two different</seg><seg type="columnLine">things, especially if one man is a negro; anyway we</seg><seg type="columnLine">bought stocks, bonds, real estate, and in some cases</seg><seg type="columnLine">even secured control of railroads, but even though we</seg><seg type="columnLine">388</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">were the owners, we could not elect the officers, or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the directors: we had to keep our activities covered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We spent a lot of money in education: every young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man of promise, with clear complexion and regular</seg><seg type="columnLine">features was sent to Europe to be developed along some</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinct line that would be of benefit to us if we ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">could become white. You can easily understand that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in a position to buy a city, even buy New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, if only we could become white: that is what we</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoped our scientist would accomplish--and he did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Â«T7'OR centuries there has been a disease known to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> J/ Dermatologists as vitiligo or leukoderma--but</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps it would be better to let Dr. Semon tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">the story. He deserves all the credit for it--it is his</seg><seg type="columnLine">discovery, and he can explain just what it means better</seg><seg type="columnLine">than I can. Dr. Semon, will you kindly continue</seg><seg type="columnLine">elucidating the narrative?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With pleasure," replied that gentleman, "and I trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I shall be able to put it into plain language so our</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend can follow the thread of the argument. You see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the difference between the negro and the white is</seg><seg type="columnLine">mainly a matter of pigment, and the medical literature</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed that now and then, very rarely it is true, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">often enough to cause scientific attention, the pigment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a black man disappeared, leaving him white. Levi,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Parisian, described three such cases in 1865: Hall</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Louisville reported a case, while many others have</seg><seg type="columnLine">occurred in the West Indies. My task was to find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">just what happened in such a case to take the pigment</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the skin and keep it out. Some investigators</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it was a complication of syphilis, while others</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered it to be due to a disturbance of the glands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of internal secretion. That was my problem--and I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy to say that I solved it--after many sleepless</seg><seg type="columnLine">nights. My first cases were of the criminal class and</seg><seg type="columnLine">several of them, killed under unpleasant circumstances,</seg><seg type="columnLine">attracted the attention of the Secret Service. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we were more careful of our cases and avoided any</seg><seg type="columnLine">further notoriety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To put it briefly, I developed something like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">serum. The dose was rather bulky at first and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">serum needed at least three months to finish its work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but now five drops, given through a hypodermic needle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns a black man white in twenty-four hours. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">case of an octoroon with regular features, the final</seg><seg type="columnLine">result is perfect--almost too perfect. I often advise</seg><seg type="columnLine">several weeks at the seashore to add a coat of tan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When we knew that we had a treatment that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could depend upon, we were able to advance more</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly. All of our brilliantly educated men received</seg><seg type="columnLine">the serum and were at once given positions of trust in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the various corporations we owned. The women we</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated were married to white men and used as spies,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it is only fair to state that not one of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">in any way betrayed the trust we placed in them. Over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand of our comrades have been white for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We built this building and called it the Center</seg><seg type="columnLine">Internationale. The first fifty floors are rented to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">public but, from that level on, admission is only granted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our comrades. You will be interested in the use we</seg><seg type="columnLine">make of these upper fifty floors. There are offices,</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratories and store rooms, and most important, our</seg><seg type="columnLine">Temple, where two thousand of our race can worship or</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet in our fortnightly consultations. We run our busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness according to the most approved methods: for</seg><seg type="columnLine">example, we have over ten million of our race in</seg><seg type="columnLine">America thoroughly card indexed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Naturally you will want to know something of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans for social equality. While we do not encourage it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we have not taken any definite steps against inter-mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riages with the white race. If one of our intelligensia</seg><seg type="columnLine">is turned white and he wants to marry a white woman,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">we permit the marriage. Of course they have had and</seg><seg type="columnLine">will have children of mixed blood but our physicians</seg><seg type="columnLine">inject one drop of serum into the child at birth and any</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendency to develop pigment is at once checked. As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">told you before, our converted white women are encour-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged to marry into the Caucasian race so they can</seg><seg type="columnLine">become spies. As our men and women are always</seg><seg type="columnLine">wealthy, they have had no difficulty in contracting</seg><seg type="columnLine">suitable marriages. For example, one of our women is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the daughter-in-law of Mr. B. Bailey Biddle, the Presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent of the New York Bankers' Association. As my</seg><seg type="columnLine">interest is wholly with the development and use of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">serum, I will stop talking and let some one else take</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the story of our plans."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first speaker now resumed the thread of conver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now you can understand, Mr. Jules Gerome, that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with unlimited gold at our command and a positive</seg><seg type="columnLine">method of destroying the pigment in the skin, the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">question remaining to be solved was how far we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">go and whether we should take any steps to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire negro race white. This has been very carefully</seg><seg type="columnLine">considered by the gentlemen you have met tonight, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">are known in our organization as THE POWERFUL</seg><seg type="columnLine">ONES. Our final decision and the plans for putting</seg><seg type="columnLine">them into operation will be explained to you at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time by our Mr. Koons."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And at once a dignified looking man, seated next to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Morosco Acquoine, began to tell his part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Â«T WAS selected for this work, Mr. Gerome, because</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">1 I had had some experience as an organizer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Several negro organizations, such as the one known to</seg><seg type="columnLine">white folks as THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF I</seg><seg type="columnLine">WILL ARISE, owed their beginning and popularity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">my efforts. Naturally it was not at all hard to wield</seg><seg type="columnLine">the negroes of the United States into a compact, well</seg><seg type="columnLine">functioning secret society, especially when they found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that there was no expense attached to membership, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally there would come a white skin and social</seg><seg type="columnLine">equality. Our organization contains practically every</seg><seg type="columnLine">negro in the States, well divided into small Lodges and</seg><seg type="columnLine">each Lodge has either a physician, a dentist, or a nurse</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of giving a hypodermic. After we made up</seg><seg type="columnLine">our minds to extend the benefit of a white skin to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire negro race, it became necessary to prepare over</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten million hypodermics, each loaded with the five drops</seg><seg type="columnLine">of serum necessary to decolorize one person. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been packed up into small packages, each bundle</seg><seg type="columnLine">containing enough doses to care for the membership of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one Lodge. Each bundle is carefully labeled. Their</seg><seg type="columnLine">distribution begins tomorrow morning. We will allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough time for all the packages to be delivered; then</seg><seg type="columnLine">all over the States, on the last day of the year, these</seg><seg type="columnLine">hypodermics will be emptied under the skins of ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">million negroes. On the next day, the first of January,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in town, city and country, on sugar plantation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock-yard, our race in this part of the world will be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come white. Do you see the idea of choosing that day?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Indeed I do!" replied Gerome, enthusiastically. "It</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be a new year, the first day of a new life for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">race."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is partly correct, but remember that it was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">this day that Lincoln issued the final decree of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">famous Emancipation Proclamation, giving liberty</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our race. On the same day we will give them white</seg><seg type="columnLine">skins. Of course we cannot at this time fully realize</seg><seg type="columnLine">the disturbance that this will cause those who think</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are the actual rulers of this country. No doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">they will be considerably agitated. But what can they</seg><seg type="columnLine">do? They cannot kill us: in a large proportion of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases they will not even be able to recognize us, any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than they have been able to identify the thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MENACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">389</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of us in New York City. We expect some trouble and</seg><seg type="columnLine">are prepared for it. In fact the fifty-first floor of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">building is a carefully prepared arsenal. We have</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough trench mortars and high explosives there to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">so much damage that just the mere threat will make</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leaders of this city willing to agree to any com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Once these millions of negroes are made white, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">will start them in business. With white skins, unlim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ited capital and boundless ambition, they will easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure control of the commerce of the nation. We will</seg><seg type="columnLine">fill Congress with them. The whites will elect a</seg><seg type="columnLine">President, a white President, but he will be one of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">race. If a man can be elected a Senator by spending</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a million, we can elect a President by spending</seg><seg type="columnLine">two hundred million. With the States in our control,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will go on and conquer the world."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is an ambitious programme," said Jules Gerome.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am glad that I am considered worthy of having a</seg><seg type="columnLine">part in its execution."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One more thing," said the man who, up to that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time had been silent. "I am the man who planned</seg><seg type="columnLine">this building. Normally there is ample communication</seg><seg type="columnLine">between the upper and the lower half, but by my side</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a button. I press that button and that communica-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion is destroyed. Every stairway is blocked, every</seg><seg type="columnLine">elevator out of commission. At the present time there</seg><seg type="columnLine">are over a thousand of our comrades worshipping in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">temple. I press this button and they stay in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper half till I press it again. They cannot even get</seg><seg type="columnLine">out through the windows. We have enough food for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prolonged stay. Of course an army could eventually</seg><seg type="columnLine">conquer us, but in doing so, it would destroy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">richest part of the city. The point that I wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make is that when I press the button, as I am doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, no one can either enter or leave this part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">building."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How interesting," murmured Mr. Jules Gerome.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And now," said the first speaker, "we have confided</seg><seg type="columnLine">freely to you our hopes and ambitions.

We recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">this early in our history and as even the best of us</seg><seg type="columnLine">were only a few hundred years from Africa, we decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">that some type of Voodoo worship would appeal most</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our followers. Of course nominally we are Catholics,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or Episcopalians or Baptists, but when we worship in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Temple, we bow down before the serpent and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am proud to be the High Priestess. Our particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">representation of the God is over thirty feet long, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">at present is restless and rather hungry. It is a species</seg><seg type="columnLine">of boa constrictor; you will recall that they do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">bite, but slowly squeeze their morsel of food and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">swallow it whole. This particular boa is very fond of</seg><seg type="columnLine">detectives, having developed that taste, from the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that fate made it possible for him to swallow four in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last two years. Naturally, with a hungry divinity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is the duty of his Priestess to satisfy that hunger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we will try to do so tonight. The first part of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">worship is drawing to a close but there are still some</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceremonies to be attended to before we show the snake</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his people and appease his appetite--for detectives.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We will ask you to walk into the adjoining bathroom</seg><seg type="columnLine">and remain there. When we are ready for you we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">call you.

"I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a very well educated man, and I may not see this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing clearly, but I want to say a few things that hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to come to me as I sat here this evening listen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to you talk. In the first place, Madam, I want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask you a question--When you had the ability to be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come white, why have you stayed black?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why should I want to be white--when I hate them</seg><seg type="columnLine">so?

I hate the white race--I want to crush them--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am willing to do all I can to make the black race</seg><seg type="columnLine">white, if that is what most of them want, but person-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally I am perfectly satisfied with my color. I hate</seg><seg type="columnLine">white people too much to be one myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You need not worry, Madam," replied Taine, coolly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Because you have shown me tonight something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I always felt, and am now sure of. Your race can</seg><seg type="columnLine">change the color of their skins but they cannot change</seg><seg type="columnLine">the color of their souls. No matter how white they</seg><seg type="columnLine">may become, they will always remain black inside.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When the tom-tom sounded a while ago these white</seg><seg type="columnLine">men of education and refinement and wealth swayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their chairs and inside them their souls fell at your</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet to worship you and your snake. I have seen that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of thing on the Congo. A sea of white-wash</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot change you.

You are not</seg><seg type="columnLine">really trying for Justice, but for revenge.

You</seg><seg type="columnLine">fail! So shut the door and think about things while</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have time and when we are ready, we will come</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taine went into the room and they locked the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HE walked noiselessly around the little room, appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently deep in thought but in reality making a</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful examination of every detail of the room's con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction. He was still occupied with this task when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw the door open. The woman he had called</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ebony Kate stood in the doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I just had to come back, Mr. Taine.

Why the</seg><seg type="columnLine">only thing white about them is their skins. You take</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shot and pull out with me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is my personal opinion," replied Taine, "that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you do not know what you want or what is good for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you any more than the others do. The only thing I</seg><seg type="columnLine">admire in you is your desire to stay as God made you</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and your nerve.

Of course I might have known--after you</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that I was Ebony Kate--I might have known then</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was useless for me to come back. Still, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">give me credit for trying to save your life, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have done it--been an easy job to pick up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man to take your place. Make yourself com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortable. I am going to lock you in here instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bathroom--youse can't get out anyway. Goodbye--i</seg><seg type="columnLine">youse can't blame anyone for this 'cept yourself."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, that is all right. A word of advice. Why not</seg><seg type="columnLine">learn to talk good English when you are excited instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that horrible dialect?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of answering, the woman shut and locked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taine went over to the door and tested it. No doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it being locked. Then he went over and sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">down at the table, in the chair where the main speaker</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the evening had sat. Taine started to think out</seg><seg type="columnLine">loud.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just as well that I won't make a report. No one</seg><seg type="columnLine">would believe me--think I was insane. What a story!</seg><seg type="columnLine">This is a great life--if you don't weaken. A lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">those thousand may be in earnest but I judge that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaders are a lot of high class criminals--well edu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cated--but none the less crooks--smart, though--look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the way they played with me--told me everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knew all the time it was perfectly safe. By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seven Sacred Caterpillars! Here is a telephone right</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my elbow. Hullo! Give me Rhinelander 100--Is</seg><seg type="columnLine">this police headquarters? Hell!! That was Dr. Semon</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking to me. Might have known they were just</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing with me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at the table. There was something about</seg><seg type="columnLine">a button. If the man pressed a button no one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave the upper half of the building. Now if only he</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MENACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">391</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could press that button, and then tear the wire--he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have them all prisoners even if they did kill him</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and there was--no! not one button, but ten, in a row</seg><seg type="columnLine">--all alike. He looked at them carefully, moving his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair closer to the table--and as he did so, his toe</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck a projection--under the thick carpet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pulling the carpet to one side he saw a circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate. What he had struck with his toe was the iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">handle in the center of the plate. When he lifted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate he simply saw a hole, with sides of polished metal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was hard to tell how deep the tube was or where it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended. It was even difficult to imagine where it ended.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taine took a silver dollar out of his pocket and tossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in. A whining sound came from the void which</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew fainter till it ended in silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think I will try it!" exclaimed Taine. "Anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">is better than to stay here. But first I will load my</seg><seg type="columnLine">revolver. That was a good idea to carry some car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tridges in my shoe heel......Now that is done.......</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I feel better. I am willing to take any chance to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">that snake from eating this poor little puppy sleeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">so calmly in my pocket--I personally do not think they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a snake large enough to eat a man--but a dog--â </seg><seg type="columnLine">that is different. Now if only I could tell which button</seg><seg type="columnLine">to press. Suppose I press them all? Press them all</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then jump into the tube; and jump quick too--no</seg><seg type="columnLine">telling what will happen if I press all ten. I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to stay here and see just what does happen, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I feel that no matter what is at the other end of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tube, I am safer there--than here. I will press every</seg><seg type="columnLine">button, throw the table to one side, tearing all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wires from the buttons and then Fido and I will see</seg><seg type="columnLine">what is at the other end of the tube."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pressed against each button--firmly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he turned the table over, tearing the copper</seg><seg type="columnLine">wires away from the buttons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he went, feet first, into the polished tube.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went down, but it was not unpleasant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had an idea that he was going around in a spiral.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly he dropped out on a well padded floor-^</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a well lighted room. It was evidently a bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. A mulatto girl in maid's dress sat sewing by a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dressing table. Taine had her covered with his re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver a second before she saw him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who lives here?" he asked, in a whisper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Madam Octavia," she replied, shaking with fright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The black woman?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Making her go in front of him, he walked over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a window and ordered her to open it. He saw that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were on the second floor. Several blocks away the</seg><seg type="columnLine">illumined spire of the Center Internationale rose tower-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in graceful bulk toward the foggy sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And even as he looked, a dull roar made the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">shake under Taine's feet. Fire burst out like a volcano</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the middle of the hundred story building. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper fifty stories writhed in a useless effort to leap</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the air, trembled, and then fell, crumpling, twist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, turning like a tortured, dying animal--fell slowly</seg><seg type="columnLine">--down--down--until it came to rest in the ruins of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the buildings it crushed in its doom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taine shivered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The mulatto, unconscious, lay at his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black puppy whined in the Tuxedo pocket and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubbed his wet nose against Taine's hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The San Francisco detective walked out of the apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment and down to the ground. As fast as he could, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked away from that part of the city. In fact he</seg><seg type="columnLine">went back to the apartment that had been his home for</seg><seg type="columnLine">all those months of life as Mr. Jules Gerome. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not afraid of his valet--in fact he very correctly</seg><seg type="columnLine">judged that he would not have any trouble with him</seg><seg type="columnLine">--not now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the apartment, he telephoned to Mr. Biddle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Gray, Chief of the Secret Service of the city.

The Cabinet members, however, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to feel that this was a very favorable solution to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But how am I to do that?" Taine asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The President threw away his cigar and coughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather nervously before he replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 'You will use your own discretion, Mr. Taine. I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">not think it would be wise for any of us to know just</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you do or how you are doing it. All we want is</seg><seg type="columnLine">results--yes--that is all--results. We will help you all</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can and you can call on any of the departments for</seg><seg type="columnLine">aid in any way. You just go and sink that ship on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way over--and sink it deep. I understand there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">one place where the ocean is five miles deep--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be the place of our choice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is a wonderful opportunity to serve your country,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Taine," said the Secretary of State.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And just think," interpolated the Postmaster Gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral, "you will have the satisfaction of knowing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you have done something that no other man in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world has ever done before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I never thought of that," said Taine. "That will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be of great help to me when I am going down with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, five miles down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah! You don't get the idea," growled the man from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arkansas. "Use your imagination, man! After the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship goes down, you swim to the U. S. battleship and</seg><seg type="columnLine">get saved. How do you suppose you are going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">finish the job if you get drowned when it is only half</seg><seg type="columnLine">done?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Got any more suggestions?" asked Mr. Taine, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">San Francisco.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not one," replied the President. "I will see that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are at once provided with all necessary credentials,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all details of every kind can be attended to by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief of the United States Secret Service. That entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">service is at your command. You can draw on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Treasury for any sums you deem necessary. We will</seg><seg type="columnLine">assign as many of our operators to help you as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">require. The entire resources of the Government are</seg><seg type="columnLine">at your disposal secretly--but under no circumstances</seg><seg type="columnLine">can we openly assist you. If you succeed, you will find</seg><seg type="columnLine">that your reward will be commensurate with the grav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity of the undertaking, and now we will adjourn and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">beg of you one and all, to observe the strictest secrecy</seg><seg type="columnLine">in regard to the entire affair."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taine went directly from the White House to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratories of the Department of Agriculture. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">he spent several hours with the old Professor. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">next day he visited the Secretary of the Treasury</seg><seg type="columnLine">and talked over finances and some other details. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately left for Cornell University where his</seg><seg type="columnLine">letters of introduction placed the entire department of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Metallurgy at his disposal and brought to that college</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most brilliant specialists from the Westinghouse</seg><seg type="columnLine">Electrical Company. This act also involved consulta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions with men from the Naval Department and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cramp's Ship Yards in Philadelphia. Following all this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taine disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Secretary of State, acting for the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States and for the President, wrote to the Euro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pean nations, through proper channels, that their offer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pay the war debt was accepted, with thanks. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked that the gold be concentrated at some port in</seg><seg type="columnLine">France, placed on a battleship and be escorted to New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York by a fleet composed of battleships of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nations. At New York it would be weighed, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">representatives of the allied nations would at once be</seg><seg type="columnLine">given their receipts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some weeks after this communication had been sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">and acknowledged, the Ambassador from Great Britain</seg><seg type="columnLine">called at the White House, by appointment, to eat</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast with the President and the Secretary of</seg><seg type="columnLine">State. The Ambassador was a tall, white haired aristo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">crat, with a hooked nose, and a decided limp (his leg</seg><seg type="columnLine">having been broken during the World's War). While</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MENACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">395</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat unused to such fare, he seemed to enjoy the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buckwheat cakes, honey, soft boiled eggs, broiled mack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral, lamb chops, doughnuts and coffee. In fact, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasion caused him to slightly loosen both his coat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dignity. The waiters were dismissed and then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">President said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Ambassador almost smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course all this is strictly informal, Gentlemen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but at the same time you can rely on me as represent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing my Government in what I say. We could not at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time deliberately insult all of Europe, so we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to accept the offer of this group of rich men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who proposed to underwrite the entire war debt. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">we asked was that the gold we were to pay the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States, our share of the debt to you, be brought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">London, and be there repacked before it was taken to</seg><seg type="columnLine">France for the final shipment. This was agreed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the powers, and the gold is in London at the present</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Blood is thicker than water, and my Government</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not fancy the looks of the transaction. We found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that some of the nations had granted large pieces of</seg><seg type="columnLine">land to these financiers, but even worse than that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">several of the powers had secretly promised social and</seg><seg type="columnLine">political equality to any of the negro race that might</seg><seg type="columnLine">settle in their country. Fancy that!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''We wanted to pay you if the other nations did, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all these people asked of us was an issue of two per</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent, long term bonds, but we just felt there was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing wrong with that gold. Because we could not find</seg><seg type="columnLine">out what was wrong with it, did not make us feel any</seg><seg type="columnLine">easier about it. For this reason my Government de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided to keep the gold they had borrowed and send</seg><seg type="columnLine">over our own gold from our reserve. It took just about</seg><seg type="columnLine">all we had on the island to do it, but we finally raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amount and we know that it is all real gold. Next</seg><seg type="columnLine">month we are going to send it to France--and we just</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted you to know that we did the right thing. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">friendship between the two great nations of the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">is far more precious than a few billions in gold, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if there is anything wrong with the gold we borrowed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we wanted to be the ones to suffer. I wish to state</seg><seg type="columnLine">also that we have been approached with the proposition</seg><seg type="columnLine">that platinum be made the monetary standard in place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gold. So far we have been non-committal in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer, as we could not imagine the reason for think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of such a change, when gold has been the standard</seg><seg type="columnLine">for so many years."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The President tried to control his feelings, but it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">some time before he could reply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is a splendid way for your Government to act.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For weeks we have been distressed over this affair and</seg><seg type="columnLine">our worry was increased by the knowledge that Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Britain was a party to the transaction. Your state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment this morning shows me that no matter what hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pens, we can depend upon your friendship. I trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the two nations will always remain in harmony</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the great things in the life of this world, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">together try to keep the world in peace and, at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">in outward harmony."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon after, the Ambassador left. The President and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Secretary of State remained seated, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely at each other. Finally the President broke the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you any idea where Taine is?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not the least. He has just disappeared."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As I remember it we instructed him to sink the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course we did not know at that time what we</seg><seg type="columnLine">know now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We certainly did not."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If he sinks the ship now, it will take with it those</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">billions of actual gold from the banks of Great Britain."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will. Of course it will."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There may be something wrong with some of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold but this from London will be sunk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will be lost. No good to them or to us. Better</seg><seg type="columnLine">find Taine and tell him to leave that ship alone. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">can take chances on anything rather than have England</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that we have been false to her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll try to find Taine--but--I have tried for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks to locate him and he is gone. Do you think we</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to notify France to be on her guard because we</seg><seg type="columnLine">have found a plot to sink the ship."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We cannot do that without giving them some reason.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Taine cannot sink the ship without being near it</seg><seg type="columnLine">or on it. Suppose we send a dozen men from San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco, who have worked with him, to France. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">they find him, we can at least ascertain how far he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">gone with his plans."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This seemed such a good idea to both of them that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a telegram was despatched to San Francisco, and eight</seg><seg type="columnLine">detectives were rushed across the continent and over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to France on the fastest cruiser. They did their best--i</seg><seg type="columnLine">and failed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN the meantime a fleet of warships were gathering in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the harbor of Bordeaux to act as a convoy for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">French steamer which was to carry the golden treasure</seg><seg type="columnLine">over to the United States. Most of the nations were</seg><seg type="columnLine">only represented by one battleship but Great Britain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">France and the United States each had two armed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">floating fortresses. The treasure was placed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of the ship in a specially constructed strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. It was placed in small boxes, each holding two</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred pounds of gold and on the outside of each box</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a number and the name of the nation it was from.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the steamer were representatives of each nation</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in addition several of the small group of bankers</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had advanced the loan to the allied nations and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Germany. These representatives were under instruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions to stay with the gold till it was accepted and</seg><seg type="columnLine">receipted for by the Treasurer of the United States.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While this was a financial transaction absolutely</seg><seg type="columnLine">unique in the history of the world, it had been kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a close secret that the newspapers could only</seg><seg type="columnLine">guess what was behind the gathering of dignitaries</seg><seg type="columnLine">and battleships in Bordeaux.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gentlemen, who were to make the voyage to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, tried to be ostensibly friendly with each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">but instinctively broke up into little groups. Baltic,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mediterranean, Slavic. They were all friendly to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bankers headed by the unknown and enigmatic Count</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sebastian. They believed that any group of financiers</seg><seg type="columnLine">who could underwrite such a loan, had unlimited funds</seg><seg type="columnLine">in reserve, and each man had been instructed by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">country to make the best of the voyage and endeavor</seg><seg type="columnLine">to secure additional loans for the financing of another</seg><seg type="columnLine">war.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Count Sebastian was a striking man in many ways.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His deadly white skin stamped him as a recluse, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">who spent hours in study out of the sunshine. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was strong, well built and seemingly a young man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even though his hair was snow white. His three part-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ners on the ship were all aristocrats in appearance and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strikingly like him in many ways. They all had white</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair. They were all educated and possessed a maximum</seg><seg type="columnLine">of culture. It seemed to the English representative</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they resembled the average Oxford graduate in</seg><seg type="columnLine">many ways.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just a few days before the day set for leaving</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bordeaux, Count Sebastian astonished the French</seg><seg type="columnLine">Government by announcing that his group of bankers</seg><seg type="columnLine">had invited several ladies to make the trip as their</seg><seg type="columnLine">guests, and that the two married bankers would bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">396</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">their wives with them as chaperones. He suggested</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the French and Italian representatives take their</seg><seg type="columnLine">wives and daughters, if possible, and especially invited</seg><seg type="columnLine">the daughter of the President of France to make the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip as the guest of their syndicate. Apparently the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip was to be a social one in many ways. The idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased the nations so much, that by the time the gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship and its convoy of battleships left the French port,</seg><seg type="columnLine">over thirty ladies were on board to make the voyage</seg><seg type="columnLine">one long to be remembered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one knew just why this suggestion to take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladies with them had been proposed by the group headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Count Sebastian. Even his three associates had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been surprised when he made his final statement in</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard to it, but for several years they had obeyed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every detail, having learned that by doing so they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were sure to be successful in every venture.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The real reason for the decision was the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">three weeks before the ship sailed Count Sebastian had</seg><seg type="columnLine">met a lady. This was not at all unusual for one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the richest men in the world and a bachelor. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual part about this lady was that she was rich, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful jewels, a past full of rumor and mystery</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, finally, she did not care at all whether she ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the Count again or not. In fact, for the first week</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their acquaintance, the only time the Count could</seg><seg type="columnLine">even see her was at the theater or restaurant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were a thousand women in France who would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been nice to the Count had they the opportunity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was for this reason that he was driven to des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peration by the coldness of this unknown stranger. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course he wanted what he could not get: and, try as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could, this particular lady seemed to be particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">unattainable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the second week of their acquaintance, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted him to take her out riding, accompanied by</seg><seg type="columnLine">her maid. After this she allowed him to come to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">table at the restaurant one evening and share a bottle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of wine with her. At the beginning of the third week,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the sailing of the gold ship but six days distant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took her out riding again and, maid or no maid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">proposed marriage to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She started to cry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The maid started to cry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But when the Count left her at her hotel, she whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered a request that he call on her that evening. Feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that success was just within his grasp, he prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the call by purchasing an elegant solitaire and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">necklace of matchless pearls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was waiting for him in the small parlor of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">suite in the hotel. He was also astonished to find her</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed in the veiled habit of the Hindoos. Without</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for anv questions, she asked him to be seated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not want you to think, Count Sebastian, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am not fully aware of the honor you showed me this</seg><seg type="columnLine">afternoon by asking me to become your wife. I cried</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely because I felt that you would regret your</seg><seg type="columnLine">decision when you learned all about me. It was for</seg><seg type="columnLine">that reason that I asked you to call on me tonight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">My father was French, an adventurer, while my mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a Malay. Of course they are considered Caucasians,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but three generations back there was colored blood in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my father's family and no matter how you look at it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am not a white woman. We are wealthy. I suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">that my father and mother have no real idea how much</seg><seg type="columnLine">they are worth. They wanted me to come to France,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose as a one hundred per cent white woman, marry a-</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man, and forget them. When I first met you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought that the opportunity had come, but when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw how devoted you were to me, I could not think of</seg><seg type="columnLine">living such a lie--and though it ends, as I know it will,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our separation--better that, than a life of fraud."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  HE Count knelt beside her and kissed her hand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"My dear lady," he whispered, "you have wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ried yourself to death and all absolutely without reason.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I love you and I am going to keep on loving you. Your</seg><seg type="columnLine">ancestry makes no difference to me--because I am a</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored man myself."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What?" said the astonished woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly that. My associates are all colored. Only</seg><seg type="columnLine">some years ago we took a special treatment that gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">us white skins. I will tell you all about that some day.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We hoped to turn the race white--but something went</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrong with our plans. If you are a negro, so am I.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Your skin is white and mine is too. We have both been</seg><seg type="columnLine">honest. Now, will you marry me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, Count, you are going to America in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">days. You have told me that it is the end of one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">your greatest business transactions. You must forget</seg><seg type="columnLine">me till you return from New York."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why cannot you come with me--on the boat?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How would that look? The only woman! Surely</seg><seg type="columnLine">that would not be proper."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But suppose there should be other women? Would</seg><seg type="columnLine">you come if I invited twenty or thirty others?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That would be different, but do you think they</seg><seg type="columnLine">would treat me as their equal, socially?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am sure they will. You leave that to me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepare for the trip. Now, will you let me put this</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring on your finger?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In answer she extended her left hand, well covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with jewels, but with the left hand ring finger bare.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The engagement ring was tenderly placed on it, accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panied by many kisses. Then the rope of pearls was</seg><seg type="columnLine">examined with many exclamations of delight, and fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally an engagement was made and a hurried trip to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paris planned to select a wardrobe suitable for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trip to America.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was after this evening that the Count invited the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other ladies, much to the displeasure of his associates.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of them did not hesitate to express himself, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">night before they sailed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know' as well as I do, George, that we decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago that the less we had to do with women--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is, permanently--the better it would be for our plans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We broke that rule when we took Ebony Kate, and look</seg><seg type="columnLine">what happened! Of course she helped hold the boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, but I always will believe that in some way</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was to blame for that explosion. Of course she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was killed, and nearly everybody else except a few of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us who were lucky enough to be in the vault when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened. She and a thousand of our best men were</seg><seg type="columnLine">just blown to pieces and our plans smashed with them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If we had done as we always did, we would have killed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man right away instead of waiting for the vaude-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ville in the temple. In consequence, he got the jump</seg><seg type="columnLine">on us, and we were just lucky to escape with our lives.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You let this bunch of skirts alone.

We want nothing now but</seg><seg type="columnLine">revenge and a place in the sun for our race. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">we put over our programme there will be time enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the luxuries of life."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Count Sebastian heard his friend through without</seg><seg type="columnLine">interruption and without irritation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What you say is true, Marcus, but unfortunately, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this instance, I am really in love.

Perhaps we</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have been better off without Kate, but you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know as well as I do, that every black man we brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to New York was converted to our cause after spend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing one evening in the Temple. I don't know yet what</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused the explosion. Of course we blame it on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">man Taine, but there is such a thing as spontaneous</seg><seg type="columnLine">combustion.

As soon as the gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">is delivered, we will all board the laboratory ship in</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York Harbor and disappear for a while. She will</seg><seg type="columnLine">go with me as my wife. She has dark blood in her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been well educated.

He at once sent for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Secretary of State.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suppose you have heard the latest about the gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I certainly have," replied that official. "If Taine is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not careful to select the right time, he will not only</seg><seg type="columnLine">sink the ship and the English gold but he will also</seg><seg type="columnLine">drown a few dozen of the most important ladies of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europe, including the daughter of the President of</seg><seg type="columnLine">France. When they find out that the ship was sunk by</seg><seg type="columnLine">our orders, we shall have some explanations to make."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"But we must find Taine!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You tell me how to do it.

Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">he will select a pleasant day and all the ladies will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved. The American battleships are to be on either</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of the gold ship and our officers can have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure of rescuing these fair ladies. Perhaps a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">international weddings will result."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "More likely there will be a few wars," sighed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">President.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day he received a radiogram stating that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ships had left the port of Bordeaux.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE next week was a living nightmare to the Presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent and those in his confidence; but to those</seg><seg type="columnLine">aboard the gold ship it was a continuous round of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure. The weather was perfect, the cuisine won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful and the entertainments superb. The water was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so still that on several evenings a boatload of officers</seg><seg type="columnLine">came over from the American battleships and gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">the European ladies a change of dancing partners.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Among the ladies none was more lovely, more won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derfully dressed or had a greater profusion of exquisite</seg><seg type="columnLine">jewelry, than that of Angeline Pleasance, the exquisite</seg><seg type="columnLine">Asiatic, whose engagement to Count Sebastian was now</seg><seg type="columnLine">known to all. She had permanently discarded her orien-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal robes and appeared in the daring of the latest</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parisian mode, causing her to be the despair of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladies and the Count the envied of all the men. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">match her petite form, she had a pleasing voice and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">brilliant mind. At the card table, piano or tango she</seg><seg type="columnLine">was equally proficient.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the ladies she never failed to mention her wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful maid. Marietta. To hear her talk one would think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that without this maid she would be helpless and hope-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less. The maid herself was rarely in evidence, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was such a dark ugly creature that the jealous ladies</seg><seg type="columnLine">declared openly that the Pleasance woman had selected</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a maid simply to accentuate her own beauty by</seg><seg type="columnLine">contrast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thus the days passed, slowly to the anxious Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cans, all too fast for the pleasure seekers 011 the gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. They passed without incident or accident, the ships</seg><seg type="columnLine">steaming westward as though on parade, the gold ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the middle, a United States battleship on either side,</seg><seg type="columnLine">directly in front two English men-of-war and directly</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind two French cruisers. The other ships brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the rear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One moonlight night Count Sebastian had left the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dance hall and, accompanied by his associate, the one</seg><seg type="columnLine">he called Marcus, walked over to the side of the ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just across the lazy waves he could easily make out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the details of the U. S. Ship Pennsylvania.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is a big ship, Marcus," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It certainly is, George."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "One or two ships like that mean a lot--but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are just symbols, Marcus. They stand for the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States. We hate her, and we have tried our best to</seg><seg type="columnLine">harm her, but so far it has been like shooting an air</seg><seg type="columnLine">gun against that battleship. I feel helpless when I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think about it at times. Look at those guns. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot from that twelve inch gun pointing this way would</seg><seg type="columnLine">send our ship to the bottom."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are pessimistic tonight, George. All this think-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing is the result of your being in love."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not at all. But look at those guns. I fancy I see</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke curling from their open mouths. I have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">nervous since the night the Center Internationale went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bits. Guess I had better take a dose of bromides</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't take any more dope, George," pleaded Marcus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We want your active mind, keen and brilliant and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">dulled by drugs."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The night before the ships arrived in New York,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Count Sebastian took his fiancde to a quiet nook on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just as soon as we arrive in New York I want you</seg><seg type="columnLine">and your maid to go to the Cosmopolitan Hotel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait there for me. It may take me a day or more to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attend to my business and then we are going to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">married and begin our honeymoon on our steam yacht.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is primarily a floating laboratory but the rooms are</seg><seg type="columnLine">elegantly furnished. My three friends are going with</seg><seg type="columnLine">us--we have thought it best to keep quiet for a while--</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have not told you all, but you ought to know the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main facts. This gold we are taking to the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States is synthetic gold. No one can tell it from real</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold. Next week we will send to over a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists all over the world the exact method of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">manufacture from mercury and lead. Just as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">that information is published, gold will become worth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, and the United States will be a bankrupt nation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every nation will declare platinum the standard of</seg><seg type="columnLine">exchange. The United States will be exposed to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridicule of the world. They will never recover from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their humiliation."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Angeline Pleasance did not answer, but her lips gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">full proof of her loving devotion to her hero. Finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">she whispered:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You tell me just what you want me to do and I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it. I want to do everything I can to help you. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">may hate the white race more than I do, but I doubt it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some day I want to tell you the story of my maid.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She also has suffered worse than death at their hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You must be careful. I am afraid of your going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York. They may kill you as they did those poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">people in the building you told me about."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do not worry, my dear," said the Count, soothingly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"They may suspect something but they would not dare</seg><seg type="columnLine">come out openly and harm any of us. They could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">398</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">do that without insulting the world. We cannot hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">them worse than through their pocket book. After we</seg><seg type="columnLine">crush them financially, we will have a final crushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow. Come closer and let me whisper to you * * * * *</seg><seg type="columnLine">* â Â» * â¢ # * what do you think about that?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The woman sighed deeply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh! George! Could you do that? If you do, it will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be wonderful! I hope I live to see that day; and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">think that I am going to share such a wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">revenge with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They agreed between their kisses that' life was won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derfully fine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TO the great delight of the President of the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States and his Cabinet, the gold ship finally arrived</seg><seg type="columnLine">in New York. A regiment of Marines acted as guard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after some delay the boxes of gold were deposited</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Custom House. There the representatives of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Allied nations, the President and his cabinet, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four bankers headed by Count Sebastian, and several</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemists and metallurgists from the Philadelphia Mint</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered to determine the value of the shipment. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxes were placed in separate piles, each pile represent-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the debt of a nation. A detailed inventory was</seg><seg type="columnLine">given to the President, showing in detail the number of</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxes, the value of gold in each box, both by weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in dollars. Each man in the room had a copy of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this inventory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Secretary of State called the persons in the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">to order and spoke from his position on the top of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen, I am speaking for the President of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States. Realizing that you are all anxious to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">through with the business of this trip, so you and your</seg><seg type="columnLine">ladies will have ample leisure to enjoy the hospitality</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the City of New York, I am authorized to say that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we will accept without question, your statement as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the amount of gold in this shipment. We feel, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we should make at least a perfunctory examina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of this shipment, and have determined to open, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">your presence, one box from each country. This will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be given a casual examination by our experts, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we will sign a receipt in full for the debt, giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">a copy on parchment to each representative present.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We shall first ask that a box of gold from Great</seg><seg type="columnLine">Britain be opened."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this point the British Ambassador limped for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Before you open a box of our gold, I should like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a statement. We thought it best to keep the gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">we borrowed in our English banks. We have, there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, replaced the original bar gold with minted gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Realm. As this does not pack as heavily as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bar gold, we had ten more boxes made and filled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So, if you count our boxes, you will find ten more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inventory calls for. You can open any box you</seg><seg type="columnLine">wish, as I am sure you will find them all the same."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The four bankers looked at each other. Count Sebas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tian shrugged his shoulders.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gold is gold," he murmured to the Frenchman beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The top was unscrewed from one of the boxes in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">English pile. As the Ambassador had stated, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with Royal Sovereigns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We shall now have the other boxes opened," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Secretary of State.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As each box is opened, our experts will make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">simple visual examination and then we will go to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lunch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Amid a deep silence, a box was opened from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">French pile. The experts from the Mint looked into</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and began to whistle. Thereupon, without waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for orders, they opened a box of the Italian payment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the German pile, another from Turkey. Then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they went and began to whisper to the Secretary of</seg><seg type="columnLine">State and the President. Meanwhile, the opened boxes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being examined by the various representatives of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the foreign countries and the air became blue with</seg><seg type="columnLine">curses in a dozen different languages. Other boxes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were opened with the same result. Finally the Presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent asked for silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen," he began. "I do not want you to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I am reflecting at all on your own integrity or on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the honesty of the countries you represent, but in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some way you have been imposed upon. Our metallurgists</seg><seg type="columnLine">inform me that these boxes are not filled with gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">but with some alloy which they believe to be a combina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of mercury and lead. Naturally, we cannot, under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the circumstances, sign any receipt for the debt. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">trust, however, that you will remain as our guests for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">private discussion of the matter, which, we are certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">will go far toward relieving the strain of the situation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I assure you that nothing of this will appear in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">American papers and the question of publicity in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europe will depend upon yourselves."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that time some one thought of looking for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">four bankers, but they had disappeared. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably fortunate for them that they could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found. They had taken advantage of the confusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">following the opening of the French box and slipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the building and into one of the taxicabs wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in front of the building. Refusing to listen to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleading of his three associates, Count Sebastian</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered the chauffeur to drive to the Cosmopolitan</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hotel. There he rushed into the lobby and asked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Countess Pleasance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am sorry, sir," the clerk replied, "but shortly after</seg><seg type="columnLine">they went to their room, the lady and her maid came</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, paid their bill and left, without leaving a for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">warding address."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Staggering, the Count left the Hotel and walked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the taxi, where the other three men were waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him. They were driven down to a pier in lower New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York, jumped into a motor boat and in ten minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in a steam yacht headed for the open sea. None</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them talked till they were well into Long Island</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sound. Then the Count took a drink and asked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me what happened, Marcus? What in hell hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened? Surely we had gold in those boxes when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">left Bordeaux."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man called Marcus took a long drink of whiskey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Sure we had gold in those boxes in Bordeaux, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was synthetic gold. We knew how to make it and just</seg><seg type="columnLine">because we did not know how to unmake it, we thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one else would know. Somebody was smarter than</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were and that is all there is to it. The best thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can do is to keep mighty quiet for a while. Europe</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be a hotter place for us than the United States</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever was--after this affair."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what about my fiancee?" cried Count Sebastian.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We must go back and find her!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Better leave her alone," growled one of the men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"and after this you cut out the love stuff when we are</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy. No telling who she was, but I bet she was mixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in it in some way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meantime the steam yacht kept steadily on its way</seg><seg type="columnLine">out through Long Island Sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JUST as soon as he could, the President of the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States took the English Ambassador to one side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want you," he said, "to send a full report of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">to your Government; and be sure to put in all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">details. Tell them not to worry about the gold they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have being of no value, because every piece of the gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">you sent us in good faith is going right back to London,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as fast as one of our warships can carry it. Under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the circumstances, we woud not think of keeping it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You had better have that other gold taken out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MENACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">399</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dumped into the ocean. I do not know yet just what</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to that gold on the voyage but I believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever it was is known to some of our scientists,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you can tell your people that the nations will</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep the gold standard, and Great Britain and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States will do what they can to make this world</seg><seg type="columnLine">a better and safer place to live in."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next two weeks were rather busy ones, spent in</seg><seg type="columnLine">officially entertaining the ladies and gentlemen who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to New York on the gold ship. All things con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidered, they had a rather pleasant time, and finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">they left under the impression that the United States</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not such a heartless country after all. Just what</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind of a report they made to their respective govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments was never learned. Some of the countries made</seg><seg type="columnLine">an honest effort to pay their debt--while others did not,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nations being very much like individuals in this respect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER the visitors had left and everything had</seg><seg type="columnLine">quieted down to normal, the President started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to review the entire problem carefully. He wanted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what had happened--and he wanted to talk to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taine. The Secretary of State assured him, over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">phone, that he had seen nothing of that gentleman.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Secretary of the Treasury informed him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taine had drawn on him for a total of over one</seg><seg type="columnLine">million, but otherwise had not been heard from. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chief of the Secret Service informed him that Mrs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taine had received several messages in code to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect that her husband was all right and would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">home soon. Just as he was giving up hope of ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeing the mysterious gentleman from San Francisco,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that very person walked into his private office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought perhaps you would like to see me before</seg><seg type="columnLine">I went home," said Taine. "I knew that you were</seg><seg type="columnLine">busy, so I waited till things quieted down a bit. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, a lady friend of mine and I have been down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Palm Beach taking a vacation. She is out in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">anteroom making eyes at your secretary. Should you</seg><seg type="columnLine">like to meet her?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I certainly should, but don't dare to get out of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight. I will send for some of the Cabinet and we want</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to tell us what happened. We are literally dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">from curiosity."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A half hour later one woman and seven men were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the President's office. A stenographer was at a side</seg><seg type="columnLine">table ready to take down Taine's verbal report. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleman coughed and rather shyly began:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After I left you here some months ago, I went and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a long talk with that old chemist from the Depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of Agriculture, and he told me that he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">know how gold was made, but that if it was made at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all it was made so and so. Then I went to Cornell</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found out what they knew about it and they called</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some cranks from the Westinghouse and General</seg><seg type="columnLine">Electric and we went into executive session. They said</seg><seg type="columnLine">it could not be done and I told them that if a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had brains enough to make gold, they ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have brains enough not only to make it but to unmake</seg><seg type="columnLine">it as well. That made them mad and they raved</seg><seg type="columnLine">around a while and then settled down to work. Finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">they made something that looked like gold and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold, only it could be changed back to mercury and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead. It was amusing to watch them play with it after</seg><seg type="columnLine">they once found out how to do it. We finally were able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take a piece of the synthetic gold and shoot a</seg><seg type="columnLine">special X-ray at it over half a mile and, pop, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn back to lead. Those youngsters were bright boys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I think that something ought to be done for them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They did all the work: all I did was just to get them</seg><seg type="columnLine">good and mad. Then we found that we could shoot this</seg><seg type="columnLine">long distance X-ray just like a stream of water out of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hose, and were able to send it through a sheet of steel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a foot thick. After that the rest was easy. We ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranged with Cramp's Ship Yard and the Navy Depart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment to put about twenty of these special X-ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators in the two battleships that were to act as</seg><seg type="columnLine">escort to the gold ship. Just for the novelty of it and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep the machines concealed, we hid the X-ray tubes in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the larger guns, and all we had to do was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep them trained on the gold ship. The metal guns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the way, gave the X-rays a beam direction, which'</seg><seg type="columnLine">concentrated them on any desired spot. The naval</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers were very clever in their co-operation and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tensely interested and during the entire voyage the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold ship was fired upon constantly by these rays. Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course we could not be sure that it would work because</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had no way of telling that the gold we made was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same kind as the gold they made. We took a chance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was greatly pleased when we heard the news as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">just how well it did work. I took the liberty of giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty of the men most concerned ten thousand dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">each. I have their names and I really think that some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them deserve more. You can look into the matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and do as you think best.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then I went over to France. I was anxious to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">on that ship and find out whether the bankers were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same men that I knew in New York, but I did not want</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take any chances, so I engaged the best female im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">personator in the world; really he is clever, and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he went by the name of Angeline Pleasance, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half breed from Asia. She had a lot of jewelry and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I bought her some more and a new wardrobe and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed up as her maid. It was the first time I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done anything like that, but I had a good teacher and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we sure made a hit. This lady here is Angeline, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know you will agree with me that she is some bird.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Take off your hat and wig, and show the gentlemen</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you look like as a real man. Our plans worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out nicely and Count Sebastian fell for her hard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to marry her. That is how we got on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. The Count had the other ladies along so he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">take his Angeline. I saw enough of the bunch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crooks to satisfy myself that they were the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">white negroes I met the night the Center Internationale</seg><seg type="columnLine">blew up. I don't know for sure how they escaped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Angeline found out a few things--not as much as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to. Of course we could have gone off with them</seg><seg type="columnLine">on their yacht, but we felt that it was too dangerous.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have promised to pay Bill a half million for his ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vices and he has drawn the money but I made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">promise not to spend any of it till you gentlemen</seg><seg type="columnLine">approved of it. So, while we were waiting for things</seg><seg type="columnLine">to quiet down, Bill and I went down to Palm Beach</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he taught me a lot about his business and I did</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot of practicing down there. I am not so bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself, only it is hard to shave three times a day. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a little memorandum of just what I spent and</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I spent it for. You can have a bookkeeper go</seg><seg type="columnLine">over it and audit it and the checks I have drawn on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Treasury. I think that is about all, so if you tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill the half million is his, we will go. I am anxious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get back home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Your friend Bill can have his half million and more,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, if he wants it," said the President. "We certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">do thank you, Mr. Taine. How much does the Govern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment owe you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh! My salary of two hundred a month from San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco has been going on ever since I left home.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They pay my wife the money when I am out of town,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so you see you really do not owe me anything."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But we want to give you something," insisted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">President.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You decide what it was worth to you and send it to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wife," said Taine shyly. "You see, she tithes/all my</seg><seg type="columnLine">income outside of my flat salary and that means 10</seg><seg type="columnLine">400</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">per cent for the church and 90 per cent for herself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So if you want to give me anything, just send it to her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That will please her. There is another thing I ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say and if you will, sir, I want to whisper it to you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is something that Bill found out and we think you</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to know * * * * * * * *"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You surely do not mean it? They would not dare to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it!" replied the President.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, maybe not, but there is no telling what they</seg><seg type="columnLine">will do so long as they are alive. At least you people</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Washington can be on the lookout, and now I guess</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will say good-bye and take the next train west."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Ho sighed a prayer of thanks to his Presbyterian God when he saw them appear carrying a barrel on an improvised stretcher.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">3.	The Tainted Flood</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AFTER his strenuous period of working in the inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est of the United States, Taine was more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">u glad to return to his home and family in San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco. His wife and daughters were delighted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see him and the little black dog nearly barked his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">off in canine welcome.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taine reported to the Chief of the Secret Service at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once and asked for and was granted a month's leave of</seg><seg type="columnLine">absence from duty. They let him know at Headquar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters that they had received some very nice letters con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cerning his work and that he had done a lot to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city on the map of the world as far as intelligent</seg><seg type="columnLine">detective work was concerned. He thanked them, shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands all around, and went back home prepared for</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty days of peace and quiet idleness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In honor of his return Mrs. Taine prepared a supper</seg><seg type="columnLine">of stewed mutton and dumplings, a dish her husband</seg><seg type="columnLine">was very fond of, but which he got only at rare inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vals, for it was very hard on his digestion. This time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, she felt that he had earned a specially fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">supper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the dishes were washed, they all went into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting room. Taine's slippers were put on and he was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortably placed in his favorite chair with the eve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning paper in his hands and a lighted pipe in his mouth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The black puppy slept curled up at his feet, the daugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ters sat around the center table studying their lessons,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Mrs. Taine talked quietly to a neighbor who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">just come in to leam the latest gossip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, ma'am," replied Mrs. Taine, to her. neighbor's</seg><seg type="columnLine">question, "we certainly are glad to have Mr. Taine</seg><seg type="columnLine">back home again. He had a most exciting time of it</seg><seg type="columnLine">this trip."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh! It must be so thrilling! Doesn't he ever get</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, indeed! He does not know what fear is. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">most horrible places he has been in with his life hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on a thread, and yet he never is afraid."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must be awful proud to have such a husband."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I certainly am. Have you heard about what the</seg><seg type="columnLine">President said?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taine listened to the conversation while he read his</seg><seg type="columnLine">newspaper and smoked his pipe. He smiled a little at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his wife's praise. No one knew better than he himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">just what kind of a detective he really was, and just</seg><seg type="columnLine">how often his blunders had nearly been his ruin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">__s</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MENACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">401</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It was only his firm faith in predestination that en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">abled him to go on with such a hazardous calling.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Meantime the daughters had kissed him and gone to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bed, and as the ladies seemed to be very well occupied</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking about church affairs, he thought he might as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well take the dog out for a walk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Without being especially noticed by his wife he left</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room and, putting on his overcoat, let the eager</seg><seg type="columnLine">black puppy out of the front door ahead of him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">night was cold and damp as is so often the case in San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco and the fog put a white halo around all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the street lamps. Glad to be back in familiar territory,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taine walked briskly down the street. He had not gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">far when he had the peculiar sensation that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being followed. Nothing f'jritates an operator more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than to feel that he is being shadowed; it is all well</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for him to pry into the most secret life of</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, but it is an entirely different matter when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tables are reversed and he becomes the hunted</seg><seg type="columnLine">instead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as he was thoroughly satisfied that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">being followed, Taine started to lose his trailers. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid and zig-zaggy half hour was spent in jitneys,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolley cars, dashing in and out of office buildings, up</seg><seg type="columnLine">and down elevators and into restaurants and movies by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the front door and out by a side entrance. During</seg><seg type="columnLine">this half hour, he believed that he had identified the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three men who were after him, and, once that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplished, it was a matter of professional pride to</seg><seg type="columnLine">double on them in such a way that he became the</seg><seg type="columnLine">follower again. He went into a theater where he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">well known, borrowed a wig and a costume and was out</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the street and into the theater again inside of five</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes. Just as he was buying his ticket, he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three suspects leaving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that he felt thoroughly confident and satisfied</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the game as it was being played. He soon saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three men were following a cold trail and in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">short time they acted as though they also knew it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At least they ceased to double on their tracks, got into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a jitney and started on a straight line to leave the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. In back of them was another jitney occupied by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the course of the next hour, Taine found himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a small balcony of a deserted house in the suburbs</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the city. While the night was cold and damp, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no wind and the increasing fog made it easy for</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone to hide in its enveloping blanket of gray. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">three men he had followed were in a room in the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, seated around a plain wooden table. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear their conversation distinctly as they made no ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fort to speak low. Their entire conduct while in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">room showed conclusively that they were positively</seg><seg type="columnLine">ignorant of Taine's proximity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taine was rather pleased, yet he was worried. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that he had eluded them and trailed them to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">den was a source of pride to the detective. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">also glad that he had left the black dog at a neigh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bor's during the first three minutes of the chase. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that caused him deepest concern was his positive</seg><seg type="columnLine">identification of the three men as the white negroes who</seg><seg type="columnLine">for so many years had been plotting against the safety</seg><seg type="columnLine">and happiness of the people- of the United States. Twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">before he had been able to block their plans, and yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">he felt that conditions would be insecure in his country</seg><seg type="columnLine">as long as these criminals were at large. Their pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence in San Francisco, and their following him was an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other source of worry. No doubt they knew who he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was and just what part he had taken against them. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only reason they were on the Pacific Coast was to</seg><seg type="columnLine">secure revenge on the man who, practically single</seg><seg type="columnLine">handed, had been able to stop their nefarious schemes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taine was not so much worried about himself as he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was about his wife and children. There was no telling</seg><seg type="columnLine">what such criminals would do. Meantime, he was pay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the strictest attention to their conversation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE were three of them. He had seen two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them on the Gold Ship--one known as Count</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sebastian or George, the other, the one called Marcus.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The third was Dr. Semon, scientist and inventor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taine had met Dr. Semon in the Center Internationale</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night that building had blown up and the white</seg><seg type="columnLine">negro had boasted of his discovery of a serum that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would turn a black man white over night. Marcus</seg><seg type="columnLine">was probably the man who had discovered the method</seg><seg type="columnLine">of manufacturing synthetic gold. George was no doubt</seg><seg type="columnLine">the brains of the group as far as leadership and or-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ganization were concerned. Said Marcus:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not want to leave the city till we get Taine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have a hunch that we shall never get very far so</seg><seg type="columnLine">long as he is alive. A day or two one way or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other will not make any difference with our New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans. I know a Chinaman that will slip bamboo</seg><seg type="columnLine">splinters into his food and put him and his whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">family into the cemetery in a few days."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am opposed to it!" answered the Count, de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cisively. "He is a very prominent person, a lot more</seg><seg type="columnLine">prominent than he thinks he is. If anything happens</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him, we shall have the Secret Service of the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States after us in earnest and openly. So far they</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seen fit to leave us alone--that is, they made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to arrest us after that gold fiasco. Taine is</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet now and his performance of tonight shows plainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he is not going to be caught napping. We are all</seg><seg type="columnLine">educated men but at the best we are not super-criminals</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I think we had better go ahead with our plans</seg><seg type="columnLine">and leave Taine alone. He is not going to be success-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful all the time. Semon, have you figured out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of your new chemical that will be needed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly impregnate the water of the New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">reservoirs ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes," replied the Doctor. "I have everything done</seg><seg type="columnLine">except the actual operation. We have the chemical in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a very finely powdered form, enough of it to make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">one to a million solution of all the water the City of</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York uses in three days. My plan is to scatter</seg><seg type="columnLine">it over the surface of the water by aeroplane on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same principle that they dust the cotton fields in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">South. We shall have to make five trips from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">store-house, but the plane can carry five hundred pounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">at a trip and twenty-five hundred pounds will do the</seg><seg type="columnLine">work nicely."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you believe it will work as quickly wholesale</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an uncertain dilution as it did in your experiments?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I am confident of it. Of course, it is hard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">determine just how much water there is in the pipes</seg><seg type="columnLine">leading to the city, but I believe that the treated water</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be used by the end of twenty-four hours and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the lot of the people of the city will be hopeless.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even if they suspect that there is something wrong</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the water, what can they do? They have to use</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water to drink, to cook with, to wash their clothes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their skin and their teeth. Inside and outside of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies they will be exposed to the drug. The first half</seg><seg type="columnLine">million cases will not be understood--the authorities</seg><seg type="columnLine">will do their best to keep it quiet--the changed men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and women will be kept indoors--perhaps quarantined.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By the end of the third day the water supply will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">pure, but by that time it will be too late."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man called Marcus jumped to his feet, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">raised his clenched hands above him as though to</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike the Almighty in the face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What a revenge!

He remembered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a silly story he had learned in his high school days.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something about a god called Time who had lots of hair</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the front of his head but was bald behind. If you</seg><seg type="columnLine">grabbed him at all, it had to be at the very beginning,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"taking time by the forelock"; once he had passed, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too late.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Running out on the street, still feeling rather silly in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feminine array, Taine took the first jitney and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started on his journey to save his country from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peril which seemed to be impending.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They started to laugh at the little woman who came</seg><seg type="columnLine">running into the Government airplane station and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded a plane to take him to Baltimore. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed harder when he said he wanted to make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">non-stop flight. They never would have taken him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the commanding officer (who was playing poker with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his staff) had it not been for the woman's tears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to see you privately!" the woman said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that officer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not by a long shot!" answered the Colonel.

I am Taine, of the San Francisco Secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">Service.

The officer read it on both</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides; then he turned to his Adjutant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know the President's writing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How about this?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looks as though it might be genuine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Commanding Officer drummed on the table with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his finger-nails. Finally he woke up from his silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Captain Jenkins!" he said sharply. "For weeks you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been making preparations to break the record for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the longest time a plane can stay in the air. I under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand you were going to try it tomorrow. Lieutenant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jones was going with you. You and Jones are to start</seg><seg type="columnLine">right away. Throw away one hundred pounds of im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pediments and take Mr. Taine with you. Your route is</seg><seg type="columnLine">Denver, St. Louis, Washington and Baltimore. I under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand that he has to get there at once. If you do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to make the trip in this fog, I will ask for volun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teers."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No need of that, Colonel," said Jenkins. "Fix the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentleman up in some clothes so he will not freeze to</seg><seg type="columnLine">death and we will start in an hour. Will you arrange</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some sandwiches and coffee, sir?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In exactly fifty-five minutes, Jenkins, Jones and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taine were in the air on their way east. Taine was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not at all happy. He had never been in a plane and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had always been confident he would not enjoy an air</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey. During the first half hour he had ample</seg><seg type="columnLine">reason to know that his anticipations had been correct;</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was no doubt as to his increasing sickness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After the worst of his nausea was over, he became</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowsy, and fell asleep. When he awoke, they were on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground. Jenkins asked him if he. had had a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep and explained that they had been forced down</seg><seg type="columnLine">near St. Louis by a leak in the gas line. They would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have it fixed in a half hour and hoped to start at once.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Did Mr. Taine want anything to eat?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TAINE looked at a sandwich, washed down the look</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a cup of black coffee and said he was ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">whenever they were. He was especially anxious to know</seg><seg type="columnLine">if they had passed any planes. Jones laughed at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said that the planes had been thicker than swarming</seg><seg type="columnLine">bees. The sun was shining and the sky blue and clear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taine went back to his seat, told them to let him know</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they arrived at Baltimore. They wanted to know if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not want to see St. Louis and the Mississippi from</seg><seg type="columnLine">an airplane, but he said that all he wanted was to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sleep or anything at all, just so long as he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">avoid a repetition of his recent sickness. He had seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">both the river and the city from the ground and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied him. The two aviators looked with a pitying</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiosity at the little man and made him comfortable</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some blankets. He soon felt a bumping and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything was quiet. In reality he went to sleep again</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and stayed asleep till they arrived at Baltimore. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was really a fairly remarkable trip, from one side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the continent to the other in two hops, but the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that Taine was interested in was that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally in Baltimore and reasonably sure that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">some hours ahead of the three conspirators.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He said a few words of appreciation to the army</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers and took an automobile to Johns Hopkins Uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versity. Here the card from the President again</seg><seg type="columnLine">served him in good stead and within a very short time</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was in conference with the Professor of Derma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tology of that medical college.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Professor was very properly thrilled. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">taught the subject of diseases of the skin for thirty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, and up to the present time no one had seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to realize what a very important part of medicine it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. To have a man come all the way from San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Francisco to consult him, a man with a personal mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage from the President of the United States, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough honor to make him glow to the point of break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out with a neurotic urticaria. He listened, rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">impatiently, to Taine's presentation of the hypothetical</seg><seg type="columnLine">case, and then, rather promptly and in as dignified</seg><seg type="columnLine">a manner as though rendering a decision of the Su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">preme Court, he gave his answer:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is no disease, condition or manner of living,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Taine, that really turns a white skin black. Cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain diseases turn the skin yellow, for example, jaundice;</seg><seg type="columnLine">or give it a bronze color, as in Addison's disease; or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark silver as in poisoning from that metal; but no</seg><seg type="columnLine">disease or drug described up to the present time can</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn a white man into a negro. Of course, there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain diseases where part of the body becomes rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed in color but of the hundreds of such cases I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seen in my long years of experience, I do not</seg><seg type="columnLine">recall a single case where the change in color was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">distinct or universal as to deceive a careful observer</seg><seg type="columnLine">in regard to the patient's race.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "However, in justice to myself, it is only fair to</seg><seg type="columnLine">state that there are thousands of new chemical com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pounds which so far have not been tested in regard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their effect on the human skin. Erlich made six hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred and five arsenical compounds before he discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">the celebrated 606, the basis of all modern treatment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">syphilis. There are many synthetic dyes, some of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">are highly poisonous to the human organism causing</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid dissolution, disintegration and even decay of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire body, Mr. Taine, and in some cases where poison-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing has resulted from the ingestion or injection of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such drugs, the skin has turned a deep purple, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">before death."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taine thanked him heartily and said he would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am astonished at your wonderful learning, Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor. You know a great deal about almost everything,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I certainly thank you for your interest in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter. However, I must say that up to the present</seg><seg type="columnLine">404</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">time you have not definitely answered my question,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was, whether a white man could be turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">black by drinking or bathing in water which was pois-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oned by an unknown drug in the strength of one to</seg><seg type="columnLine">one million?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not know!" said the Professor, rather be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wildered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And I do not know, either," said Taine, "but I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to find out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you do," said tho Professor, eagerly, "will</seg><seg type="columnLine">you come back and tell me? I should like to write a</seg><seg type="columnLine">monograph on it, and of course I would give you a</seg><seg type="columnLine">copy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I would expect you to give me at least one copy,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Taine, "though of course I could go to the Con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gressional Library and read it there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will not have to do that. I shall be glad to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">you a copy. I will even write my name on it, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not "do that for everybody."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taine heard only half of that last remark, for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was rushing out of the building before the Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come to the end of his generous offer. His chief</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiety now was to get to New York City as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could. He would have liked to go back to Wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ington and talk over the problem with some of the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">there, but he resisted this temptation and he rushed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the B. &amp; 0. station instead. Here he became a human</seg><seg type="columnLine">dynamo and after brushing aside three office boys and</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually knocking an insulting clerk down, he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Superintendent and in a few minutes of rapid talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">convinced him that he was in earnest. But it took all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his power of argument and the President's card</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrown in for good measure, to secure a special train</seg><seg type="columnLine">to New York. The tale should include the details of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this ride to New York in a locomotive, hanging on to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fireman, and cinders thoroughly scattered all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inside and outside of the man from San Francisco.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reached the metropolis of the United States at</seg><seg type="columnLine">midnight. At once he telephoned to Gray, Chief of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city's Secret Service. He was in Chicago. He called up</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Biddle, the Banker. He was at home, but had</seg><seg type="columnLine">retired for the night, and could not be seen till nine in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morning. Taine was badly worried and growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather mad. He had a plan and he could not work it</seg><seg type="columnLine">out unless he had help. The President's card was not of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any value, unless he could get the right people to read</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and meantime the precious moments were passing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hunger and fatigue and anxiety made him sweat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the drops running down his cheeks made ludicrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">streaks amid the dirt and cinders clinging to his three</seg><seg type="columnLine">day old beard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He dashed over to the ticket office and had a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollar bill changed. Then he ran out to the taxi stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gave the driver of a yellow cab the address of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleeping banker, Mr. Biddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After frantic ringing of the door bell, the Butler</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the sacred portals. He was very haughty in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">statement that Mr. Biddle would see no one. Taine</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong-armed him so thoroughly that he did not wake up</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some hours and then did not have a very clear idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of what had taken place. The detective ran up the steps</seg><seg type="columnLine">calling Biddle's name. A woman screamed and a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran out in white pajamas and shot at Taine, who cried:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't shoot again, Mr. Biddle. I am Taine, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">detective. Don't you remember the man from San Fran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cisco? Put that gun up. You will hurt someone shoot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that way."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BIDDLE finally quieted the household and himself and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then sat down in the library and listened to Taine.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The banker made a very good listener. Finally the</seg><seg type="columnLine">detective finished.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What can I do to help you?" asked Biddle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to see the man who knows the most about the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Croton Water Shed.

Finally he jumped up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">triumph.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I found the man," he said, "and he is on his way</seg><seg type="columnLine">down town. He will be here in twenty-five minutes, pick</seg><seg type="columnLine">us up and we will all go down town to his office where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the maps are. I shall have to dress. What can I do</seg><seg type="columnLine">for you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How about a safety razor and a place to shave?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can have that. How about a drink?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not now. If I ever get out of this mess, I may get</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunk, but not now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have a cigar?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No! I never smoke. I find that the tobacco injures</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dclicate enamel of the teeth and once that is injured</seg><seg type="columnLine">decay sets in and your teeth are soon lost, never to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The banker dressed and Taine shaved and they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly finished when the door bell rang. It kept on ring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and finally the banker went to answer it himself. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing so, he stumbled over the butler. Only then did</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taine think of explaining to him that the poor fellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not dead but simply knocked out by a detective's</seg><seg type="columnLine">rough treatment. Immediately after that the three men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Biddle, Taine and the Surveyor, were in a taxi headed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for City Hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well?" said the Surveyor, a few minutes later, in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">large and orderly office, "what is the problem, and where</seg><seg type="columnLine">do I come in after losing my night's rest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You will get your share--later," answered the Banker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"For the time being, listen to this man and see if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">can help him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All I want you to do," chimed in the detective, "is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell me if you can recognize this map as a part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country around or near the Croton Water Shed." He</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a small folded piece of paper out of his inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket and handed it to the Surveyor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man looked at it, and then jumped up from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, crying:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't interrupt me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We won't!" said the Banker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't make any noise!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We won't!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must have perfect silence. I want to concentrate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must think!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly," said Taine, soothingly. Then in spite of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dread and anxiety, he took a pencil and pad of paper</seg><seg type="columnLine">off the desk and wrote:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   His mind is very delicate. He would never make a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> detective.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and handed it to Biddle, who read it, smiled and wrote:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nor a banker</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and passed it back. However, the man was really cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able in spite of his peculiarities, for after ten minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the greatest physical and mental agitation, he ran to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabinet, took out a large blue print on the scale of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch to the mile, spread it on the table, compared it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the small map Taine had handed him, and cried:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"There it is. I thought I remembered the place. Slept</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that old cabin several nights when we were survey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that part of the shed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is it hard to get to?" asked Taine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"No. There is a fairly good road within a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet but no one goes there. The whole area was bought</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the state and practically cleared of its population."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Let's start," said Taine, "and get there as fast as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's all the hurry?" asked the Surveyor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Banker told him in a few well chosen words.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After that it was a foot race to see which one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MENACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">405</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">get down to the waiting automobile first. In no time at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all they were tearing up Fifth Avenue, headed for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin in the woods. The Surveyor insisted on driv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in spite of the protests of the taxi-cab chauffeur.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Biddle, however, kept his head, and they went right back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the banker's house, where they changed cars for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven passenger Paige. They also picked up three</seg><seg type="columnLine">policemen, and then headed for the country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Banker's chauffeur was no mean driver himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with the Surveyor beside him to tell him just</seg><seg type="columnLine">where to turn, they had no trouble in averaging fifty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five miles an hour. There was no car trouble and no</seg><seg type="columnLine">delay and yet dawn was breaking as the car stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the woods and the Surveyor jumped out and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to run.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold on!" exclaimed Taine, catching him. "I am</seg><seg type="columnLine">in as great a hurry as you are, but I do not want'</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be killed. Those three men may be there ahead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us and if they are, they would not hesitate to shoot</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. Better go slow." His advice was followed, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin was deserted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door was padlocked but Taine had no trouble in</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening it. The party followed him inside. It was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little cabin in the woods, a very ordinary little cabin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a small stove and some shelves and a cot with</seg><seg type="columnLine">bedding on it: but in the center of the room were</seg><seg type="columnLine">twelve barrels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were ordinary flour barrels, Pillsbury flour</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrels with the firm's label neatly pasted on every</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrel, giving the exact brand of the flour and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of pounds. The men looked at each other and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they all looked at Taine. He looked at the Surveyor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure this is the place?" he asked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Positive!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then get me an ax or something and help me to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">the top off of one of these barrels. Fast! No time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to spend thinking about it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The top was soon off and they all crowded around</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pshaw!" said Biddle. "Just flour. Suppose we taste</seg><seg type="columnLine">it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He would have done so, had Taine not grabbed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand just in time. Taine told him in no uncertain lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guage just what kind of a fool he was, and as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth began to slip into the Banker's consciousness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that man grew pale and started to sweat. Then Taine</seg><seg type="columnLine">a3ked the Banker to come outside for a conference, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a result of which the chauffeur, the Surveyor, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">policeman and the Banker stai'ted off in the Paige.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taine and the other two policemen walked into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods and hid themselves. Telling the men to watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cabin, the detective started off through the woods.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a very few minutes he found just what he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">looking for, a meadow fairly free from brush and</seg><seg type="columnLine">weeds, large enough and smooth enough to make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good landing field for a plane, provided the aviator was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little more clever than the average. It was, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most, a hundred yards from the cabin. In the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were ruts in the grass which looked as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">a plane had landed there on a wet day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Taine went back to the policemen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FINALLY, after what seemed ages, a large truck</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up the road laden with twelve barrels and</seg><seg type="columnLine">several men. Behind was the Paige car. Taine in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spected these barrels, said they would do, and ordered</seg><seg type="columnLine">them carried very carefully into the cabin. The men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who carried the twelve barrels in, carried twelve bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rels out and back on the truck. When they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, the inside of the cabin looked just as it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the lock had been picked. Taine put the pad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lock on, gave the driver careful directions and started</seg><seg type="columnLine">him off with the truck. He then held a long confer-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ence with Biddle and started him back to New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">City with the three policemen and the Surveyor. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">then returned to his point of observation and thank-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully ate the lunch Biddle had brought him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the exception of a hawk who persistently</seg><seg type="columnLine">soared above him, Taine was alone. Not really alone</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he had abundant fears to keep him company. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">worried him most of all was the map. Suppose the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three white negroes had suspected his presence and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped a map on purpose? They might even have</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a special cabin fixed up to deceive him. While he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was locating the cabin on the map and waiting for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to put in an appearance, they might be scattering</seg><seg type="columnLine">the poison over the Croton waters. Was he wrong?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Would Providence permit him to be wrong?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Was he predestined to be the savior of New York or</seg><seg type="columnLine">face the world as a huge joke, an ignorant blunderer?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The afternoon wore wearily on, the setting sun sink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing silently on silvery spruce trees. Another hawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined the first in its aimless flight. No! Not a hawk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a plane!! This way!! Sinking, settling softly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">safely in the meadow. Taine smiled and rubbed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was safe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew he was safe when he saw three men come</seg><seg type="columnLine">running through the woods toward the cabin: he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">confident he was safe when he saw them unlock the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door and disappear through the doorway; he sighed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prayer of thanks to his Presbyterian God when he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">them appear carrying a barrel on an improvised</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretcher. Shortly after the distant buzz of a motor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was followed by the appearance of a plane over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">treetops. Taine left his station near the cabin and</seg><seg type="columnLine">circling through the woods gained a viewpoint of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meadow. One man, left behind, was building a fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">at either end of the field to serve as guides to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aviator as darkness came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The plane returned in the twilight. The men again</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran toward the cabin, and came back staggering under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weight of another barrel. The top was knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">off and its contents transferred to a hopper in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane. It was rather dark but Taine was able to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of what they were doing and guess at the rest.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After the departure of the machine, the man who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">left behind broke up the barrel and used the dry wood</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep the signal fires burning. The detective waited</seg><seg type="columnLine">till one more trip had been made, then scratched some</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves together, covered up as best he could, and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">asleep happy in his well earned contentment. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning when he awoke: everything seemed quiet but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he decided to inspect the meadow before leaving. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come just in time to see the plane return, pick</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the third man and start off again. He walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoughtfully to the cabin and was not at all surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find the door open and the room empty. The twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrels were gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This," said Taine to himself, "makes me believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">in predestination more than ever before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The country Taine found himself in was wooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and very sparsely settled. The only thing that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of was that he was in New York state. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">also afraid that he was hungry. Within an hour he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a slight idea that he really was hungry and this</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea rapidly grew till it took entire possession of him:</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as he was about to despair he came out on a hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">surfaced road bordering on a large lake. Greatly inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested, he walked to the shore and going down on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees carefully examined the stones and gravel washed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the little windwaves. There was a white scum</seg><seg type="columnLine">there; just the slightest trace. He put some on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger and tasted it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far down the road he saw smoke curling upward in</seg><seg type="columnLine">406</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the thin autumn air. That meant fire and fire might</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean food. He walked down the road and came to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">neat little bungalow. The man who came to the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">was soon identified as one of the water shed police.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was glad to furnish what he had in the way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">food; not much, but enough to keep Taine alive. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer to the inquiry, he said that there had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">several aeroplanes flying around the night before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By noon Taine was in New York city. Ordinarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was a neat little man but he was far from that as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he got off the train in the Grand Central Station. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">went at once to the Biddle home, where the butler ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitted him rapidly but with decided resentment, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was still nursing a swollen jaw. The San Fran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cisco man luxuriated in a long, hot bath, and a shave.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The banker had a clothing man and a haberdasher</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to the house and by the time Taine was through</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his nap, a completely new outfit was ready for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his use. A valet helped him dress, and served him a</seg><seg type="columnLine">very light lunch in his room. By dark Biddle ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rived and they had a conference in the library during</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the banker told the detective that the twelve</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrels were safe, in a dry place, and that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving a little supper that night at home to a few of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big men of the city and he wanted Taine to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">there and tell them about the events of the last few</seg><seg type="columnLine">days. The San Francisco man protested--said he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ought to start for the west--but the banker insisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and said that his guests were not to be disappointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that he had secured a dress suit for Taine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had sent a long telegram to Mrs. Taine, to the effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">that her husband was safe but would be too busy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">write for a few days. So Taine went up stairs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had his clothes changed again, and looked very much</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a society man when he came down to supper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten men sat down to supper and those men repre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented the wealth, culture and power of the Bast. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mayor was there and several business men, the Presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent of a railroad, the head of a great department</seg><seg type="columnLine">store and the private secretary of the Governor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the State. The dinner was well planned and suited</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taine, who was still hungry from his long hours of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fasting. After it was over and the servants were</seg><seg type="columnLine">dismissed and the doors closed, Biddle introduced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little western man and asked him to tell his story,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginning with the Center Internationale episode. Taine</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked without flourishes or oratory, just a plain state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of fact told by a plain man. When he finished,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took a small baking powder tin out of his pocket,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully took the lid off and placed the open can on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That," he said, "is a small sample of this new</seg><seg type="columnLine">poison these men were going to put in your drinking</seg><seg type="columnLine">water."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That looks harmless," said the Mayor." I fancy</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was all a joke. This probably is a novel way</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Biddle has of entertaining us after one of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">excellent meals."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Biddle looked at Mr. Taine. Everybody kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">still. Then Taine began:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">&lt;ct HAVE a little money, Mr. Mayor. Of course it is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A out west but Mr. Biddle will finance me. I bet</seg><seg type="columnLine">you one hundred thousand dollars that you will not</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink a glass of water with a little pinch of this drug</seg><seg type="columnLine">dissolved in it. I will bet you another hundred thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand that if you do drink it, you will turn black inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">of twenty-four hours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His Honor laughed nervously as he replied:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It would not be very dignified for me to make such</seg><seg type="columnLine">bets. You may be telling the truth, yet I am frank</seg><seg type="columnLine">to say that I cannot believe you till the thing is demon-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">strated. It is too fanciful, too much like a fairy tale."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At this the Governor's Secretary interrupted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have an idea. Up at Sing Sing, in the death</seg><seg type="columnLine">house, are eleven men waiting death in the electric</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair. I believe the Governor would think favorably</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pardoning some of them if they would drink some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this drug as an experiment. Suppose we go up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Albany right away and see him? We could take</seg><seg type="columnLine">some chemists and specialists with us to tell us what</seg><seg type="columnLine">actually happened."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I do not like that suggestion," said one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">business men. "No matter what happens, the men will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be set at liberty and they will talk. A rumor that such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a danger threatened New York will be almost as bad</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us as though it actually occurred. Now if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could only get some idiots! That is the very idea!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let's go over to Ward's Island to the Hospital for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Insane and see if we cannot get the Superintendent to</seg><seg type="columnLine">furnish us with material for the experiment?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No! A thousand times NO!!" thundered the Mayor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Such a thing would leak out--somebody would tell,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a dozen woman's clubs in the city would start to</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk about it. To them, those idiots would seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">precious. Every woman would say, 'What if they did</seg><seg type="columnLine">that to my hopeless child, entrusted to the care of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great city, and unable to defend himself? Suppose my</seg><seg type="columnLine">little one, once a baby in my arms, but touched by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">finger of God, so that he never grew to be anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a baby, was turned black to satisfy the curiosity</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a group of politicians and capitalists?' Use your</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagination and hear the women talking and then at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next election go to the polls prepared to see Tam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">many Hall wiped out of power. By the Holy Shade of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tweed I would rather drink the damned stuff myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">than to give it to a single ward of the State."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the table was a silent young man. All through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evening he had sat in a gloomy introspection.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Biddle had invited him because he was the junior</seg><seg type="columnLine">partner of the most powerful law firm in the city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His right hand, with fingers long and immaculate, lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">motionless on the white table cloth. His left hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped the stem of a Venetian goblet. During the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire discussion he had turned his face, expression-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, from one speaker to another. Right across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">table sat Taine and the little tin can was between</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. After the Governor's telegram was read, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gretting that he could not be present, but urging them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to solve the question once and for all, after the Mayor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had foolishly hinted that Taine was telling the tale in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the capacity of a commercial and professional enter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tainer, after seeing Taine's quiet rage and hearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the discussion it provoked, after all this the silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man stood up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen," he said. "I am convinced that Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taine is telling the truth as far as he can see it. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">believe a thing and to prove it are two different things.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I followed his story with a great deal of interest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as far as circumstantial evidence is concerned, he has</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved his case. You do not believe him because you</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not want to believe him. The whole situation seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible, so horrible that you do not dare to face</seg><seg type="columnLine">the facts. For thousands of years you have thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a white skin meant a white God. Tonight you</seg><seg type="columnLine">do not even dare to turn some white idiots black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yet, this is a matter of greatest importance to all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of you. If this happened, you captains of industry</seg><seg type="columnLine">would become paupers, you bankers would degenerate</seg><seg type="columnLine">into small town note-shavers, and the politicians of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greatest city in the western hemisphere would</seg><seg type="columnLine">start in to work for a living. You need the city to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep you where you are, and you know that it has to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a white city. Mr. Taine was right in feeling that</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MENAGE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">40?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the danger was as great as any that has ever threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened a people. He had the imagination to see how a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing like that would make New York a pariah among</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities of the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So far you are guessing.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">guests looked at Biddle as though they felt it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">his place to give the comedian his well deserved re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">buke.

She might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he were just a little bit colored--just a shade off</seg><seg type="columnLine">white like she is, but he turned black--like a piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">coal.

Their plan to im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">poverish the United States by flooding its banks with</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions of synthetic gold and then forcing the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">to change from a gold to a platinum standard had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulted in failure, and every nation in the world had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been furnished with a method of detecting their artifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cial gold.

Then had come their de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termination to inflict a crowning and humiliating in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jury on their enemies by turning eight million white</seg><seg type="columnLine">New Yorkers black overnight. That also had been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">costly and useless effort.

Finally, as a gift to the city, the Glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trust built a transborough driveway fifty feet wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the tops of houses, thus greatly facilitating inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urban traffic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not only in New York, but in all of the large</seg><seg type="columnLine">American cities, this use of glass was progressively</seg><seg type="columnLine">increasing. The rural districts, quick to see the many</seg><seg type="columnLine">benefits arising from such a cheap, yet durable, ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terial, adopted it even more extensively than did the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities. Accustomed to ordering merchandise by mail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they readily bought the new glass sections, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly put them together. The farmer was now living</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a glass house that was easily cleaned, vermin proof</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cheaper than any other kind of material or mode of</seg><seg type="columnLine">construction. In the South, the glass house was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">placing the hut of the plantation hand and of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor white.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Inside of twenty-five years, ninety per cent of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">population of the United States was spending at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">half their life under glass. For the last ten of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, the Glass Trust had ceased to invent new uses</seg><seg type="columnLine">for their products and devoted all their energy toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">selling large amounts at a low price and a small profit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While not claiming to be philanthropists, they at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that their firm had contributed largely to the eco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomic welfare and happiness of the nation. At least</seg><seg type="columnLine">they said so very modestly in their advertisements.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ruling minds of the United States were rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">well pleased with the progress the nation was making.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They felt that they had each contributed their share</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the prosperity, health and happiness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great republic. It is true that the wealth of the land</seg><seg type="columnLine">was concentrated in the hands of a few large trusts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but these used their power to aid and not to oppress.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Education, investigation, and prophylaxis were instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments used by them on a large scale. Every rich man</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave millions toward the endowment of a Foundation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Carnegie gave every little town a library, while Rocke-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feller freed the country from the dreaded hook-worm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were two great desires of every bright mind in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the States, to become rich, and to use that wealth in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hew service to humanity. Yet even the humanitarian</seg><seg type="columnLine">work was so systematized as to becomo painfully im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">personal. The individual was beginning to disappear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to reappear simply as a cog in a great machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, right in the midst of this happiness, came</seg><seg type="columnLine">disaster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came so insidiously, so quietly, so naturally and</seg><seg type="columnLine">universally that for many years it was not recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a threatening danger and a destructive agent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloomy horror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EARLY in the history of the country, asylums had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been erected for the care of the insane. At first</seg><seg type="columnLine">these were simply boarding houses which gave cus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">todial care to the inmates, clothed, fed and bedded</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. In 1900 the ability to diagnose was being de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloped in these hospitals. Ten years later active</seg><seg type="columnLine">treatment was begun for some types. By the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the World's War, the specialty of Neuro-p3ychiatry</seg><seg type="columnLine">was growing more rapidly than any other branch of</seg><seg type="columnLine">medical science. Institutions for the insane were no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer called Asylums, but State Hospitals for Mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">Diseases. The physicians were no longer called Head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">knockers, but Psychiatrists. The insane were consid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered wards of the state and each commonwealth vied</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the others in properly caring for these unfortu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nate people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the founding of the National Committee of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mental Hygiene, came the statistical study of insanity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At once certain interesting facts were disclosed. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">example, it was found that as many people became</seg><seg type="columnLine">insane every year in the United States as graduated</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the Universities, Colleges and Normal Schools.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That fact alone gave some people food for thought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then from all over the United States came the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plaint that the states could not build additional hos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitals fast enough to accommodate the increasing de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand. The yearly program of the American Psycho-</seg><seg type="columnLine">logical Society was occupied with the problem of pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vention of new cases of insanity in the years to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a proper care of those who were already insane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many investigators spent years in trying to cure these</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases but many more were working in the field of</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevention. Bills providing for the sterilization of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfit were passed in many states. More rigid laws</seg><seg type="columnLine">were passed regulating marriage. The increase in</seg><seg type="columnLine">insanity became like the weather, there was a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">talk about it, but not much could be done to correct it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In 1920 some states were caring for one insane per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son to every three hundred of its population. By 1930</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ratio all over the country was one in two hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred. At that time the burden seemed too great to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried indefinitely, but with newer methods of feeding</seg><seg type="columnLine">and increasing efficiency, every state was able to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead with the great charity. When five more years</seg><seg type="columnLine">had passed, the situation ceased to be a problem and</seg><seg type="columnLine">became a menace, a threatening disaster, for the ratio</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now one in fifty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not a family but had at least one member insane.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In some cases every individual, not only of a family,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but of a community had become insane. Unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">care for themselves, lacking even the elementary in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stincts of self-preservation, these people had to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">segregated and gathered together into large settle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments and fed, clothed, bedded, and treated by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">State. Yet, in spite of the tremendous burden, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country staggered on, in the hope that the wave of</seg><seg type="columnLine">insanity would pass by and that the complete isola-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of these mentally afflicted would absolutely pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vent the transmission of the disease in future gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was now no effort made to build new institu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions for these people. Instead large towns were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiscated, walled around with high wire fences and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned into concentration camps. Normal Schools, Col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leges, Churches and High Schools were turned into</seg><seg type="columnLine">hospitals for specific types of psychoses. It required</seg><seg type="columnLine">the combined effort of the sai e people to provide for</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MENACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">411</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the insane. Fortunately science had made it possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">to care for these in the most efficient manner. Whereas,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ward physician formerly had a maximum of three</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred patients, he was now caring for three</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the next three years, to be exact, in 1923, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">problem had become a national one, because one-half</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the population were incapacitated, on account of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their mental peculiarities. The United States army,</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular and reserves, had been mobilized to its full</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength and was used as guards, nurses and at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendants. In some parts of the nation, public work</seg><seg type="columnLine">and farming was done with various degrees of success</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the stronger of the male patients, while the less</seg><seg type="columnLine">afflicted females helped with the cooking and washing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leaders of the American Psychiatric Society</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the progress of this tidal wave with the great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est interest and intensive study, but finally had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the soul-sickening report to Congress that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not understand what was causing the great in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sanity epidemic, and consequently did not have the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest idea of how they could prevent it. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">stated that the insanity had little effect on the death</seg><seg type="columnLine">incident and that if these people were humanely</seg><seg type="columnLine">treated, the average length of institution life would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">about twenty years. They knew, though it was only</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitted behind closed doors and in a whisper, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if the increase continued for another ten years, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire nation would be mad with no one to care for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. A continent of insanity left without control</seg><seg type="columnLine">to follow the tortuous devices of their dementia! Per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps it would spread and the entire world would go</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild!!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The world feared this and enforced a rigid quaran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tine. The United States, weakened in man power and</seg><seg type="columnLine">barely able to finance the crushing burden, was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeble to protest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Something had to be done!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE arose in Congress a party who demanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the life in a humane manner, -of every person who</seg><seg type="columnLine">became insane, and who were already insane. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">argued, and it must be confessed that they had a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal of right on their side, that the time would come</seg><seg type="columnLine">when these victims of insanity would have to die from</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunger. It was still possible to make protein using</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmospheric nitrogen, to change cellulose into sugar,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make synthetic fat, but the time might come when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the laboratory worker would go crazy in his shop, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skilled mechanic become insane at his bench, the engi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neer hauling a train of food develop a psychosis at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the throttle. Would it not be better to kill them</seg><seg type="columnLine">humanely, rather than to wait for the time when,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacking the restraining influences of sanity, they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">rend each other like beasts and die in the swamps and</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains of hunger and cold? With the insane bur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">den off their shoulders, the sane population of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States might yet restore it to its former place</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a leader in the world. Now they had nothing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look forward to- but- the- end!!!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This party was bitterly opposed by another faction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Congress. They argued that even though the entire</seg><seg type="columnLine">nation went insane, even if their civilization perished</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the growing curse, still as long as a million, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred thousand, a hundred or one person remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">sane, it was the duty of that survivor of sanity to</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue caring for his unfortunate brothers. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was better for the nation to perish clean than to sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vive with an ineffaceable blot upon its manhood and</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor. It was not their fault that the entire country</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sick, but if in their panic they put one of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfortunates to death, then forever their names would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">go down in disgrace on the pages of history. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">press and pulpit, from Senator to the Mayor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smallest town came the cry echoing that command</seg><seg type="columnLine">given centuries before on Mount Sinai:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THOU SHALL NOT KILL!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet what was to be done?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All through 1938 they talked and thought and prayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in January, 1939, the dreaded news came. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">increase during the year had been so great, that now</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were two insane persons in the United States</seg><seg type="columnLine">for every sane person! Small wonder that the Sena-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors pleaded for the Psychiatric Death Bill.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It would have passed the next session of Congress</seg><seg type="columnLine">had not an humble worker in an obscure college of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the south, by name Howens of Spineville, made a</seg><seg type="columnLine">special trip to Washington at his own expense and</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, with a peculiar diffidence, the privilege of ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearing before the Committee on Insanity. They had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been bothered with all kinds of cranks but this man</seg><seg type="columnLine">was well provided with credentials and they gave him</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hearing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They met in one of the Senate rooms around a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">table. Professor Howens asked to be seated near the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle of the table so all could see and hear him. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table in front of him he placed a small Boston</seg><seg type="columnLine">bag. Just as soon as he started to talk, they identified</seg><seg type="columnLine">him as a college professor, for every few minutes he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would stop and ask them if they understood the mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter as far as he had gone. In fact, he began by say-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing that he was very much embarrassed, but if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could just imagine they were a group of his pupils, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do very well in his talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have been working on this for some years," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "and before I go on I want to give due credit</seg><seg type="columnLine">to three of my pupils who have been of the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">help to me for many years. Of course our college,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like all others, was turned into a hospital, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory smelled so that it never could be fixed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a dormitory and we just kept on using it. I and</seg><seg type="columnLine">my three pupils thought we might as well stay there</seg><seg type="columnLine">as anywhere else, and we really were fairly comfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able on army cots, eating synthetic food and once in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while one of our turtles. Of course I wanted to stay</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I never could make up my mind why the other three</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided to spend so many years with me; so, you must</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand that each of us contributed a part to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conclusions we reached.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hardner Gowers had been raised in the country and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had learned to use his eyes in the woods.

Still, she was a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">fine technician and was of great help to us and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we all thought a great deal of her, especially Gowers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we did not report her to the authorities; we simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">let her stay with us. The third student had spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">his four college years with the other two and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed the habit. Therefore, though he tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">leave us, he was so miserable when away, that he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and offered his services.

Then Cline woke up one day over his stool</seg><seg type="columnLine">and proposed that we make the wasps larger. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">woke us all up.

It gave us a thrill when one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these came sailing in one day with a large toad to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a cell. The eggs were like robin eggs.

It was easy then to</seg><seg type="columnLine">purify it, put it into smaller bulk, standardize the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dose.

These, as we know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">are vermin- and rat-proof. Once a year the medical</seg><seg type="columnLine">department of the Army can arrange to give each one</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hypodermic of the drug, diluted with a pint of nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal saline solution. Just as soon as the fifty, eighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">or one hundred million people are thus cared for, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy of the sane, released from the terrific burden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be directed toward the rehabilitation of the nation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A Board of Inquiry can serve in every state, and as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as a case of insanity is found to be hopeless, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">can be given a treatment and placed with the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cline has been working on some statistics and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his conclusions have been very interesting.

The other fact is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we have made a Simon-Binet examination of over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thousand of our sane citizens and found out that</seg><seg type="columnLine">what we suspected was the truth; they were all very</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior adults as far as the intelligence tests were</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned and they stayed sane no matter what kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of houses they lived in. As a matter of fact, prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically all we examined lived in glass houses. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that all this might be more than a coinci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence and wanted to advise you to have similar studies</seg><seg type="columnLine">made all over the United States.

The three co-workers of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Professor were sent for and their separate stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtained. While there was some attempt at keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">the details of the new idea a secret, still it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">long before every person of intelligence in the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States was talking about the plan proposed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Professor. The central committees sent for scientists</seg><seg type="columnLine">from every state, and when these men came to Wash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ington and talked to the four experimenters from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">South, it did not take long for them to be converted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The calm knowledge of the Professor, the scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability of Gowers, the superior attainments of Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heller and the profound silence of Cline, who simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat day after day without even thinking, impressed all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the investigators.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After some months, the various committees reported.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was nothing new in the glass that had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">used in the United States for the last twenty years.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was just like the glass that had always been used.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was practically no difference except in the quan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tities that were used. The scientists finally came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conclusion that there was, in the sun's rays, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">healthful property that was absolutely necessary to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental health of the human race. When men started</seg><seg type="columnLine">to live most of their lives with glass between them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the sun, these rays were blocked, and absorbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the glass in such amounts, that men became insane</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the want of them. Pediatricians told of the health-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful effect of sunlight in rickets, which effect was abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely absent when the sunlight was filtered through</seg><seg type="columnLine">window glass. The Senate called upon the Glass Trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">to see if by their help a kind of mental health glass</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be made, but it was discovered that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Glass Trust had gone out of business. This was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprising as in many of the countries industries had</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, partly from a lack of labor, partly because</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been no expansion of business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The conclusions of Professor Howens and his three</seg><seg type="columnLine">co-workers were substantiated by examinations all over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the country. Where people lived an outdoor life with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a total absence of glass, there was practically no insan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity. Where they lived under glass, all but the superior</seg><seg type="columnLine">adults became insane. The work was carried on as</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly as possible, but when the final reports were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for consideration by Congress, there were four</seg><seg type="columnLine">insane to every sane person in the country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They accepted the recommendation of the investi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gating committees. In fact, there was nothing else</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do. The Sleeping Bill was passed and signed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the President in one week. Within another week Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Howens was in charge of the chemical resources</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the nation. With the help of Gowers and Miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">Heller he soon started production of the sleeping drug</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a large scale. Even Cline woke up for a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">months and organized and initiated a huge card index</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was to record every insane person in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Work was rushed in every department of the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking. The army and navy and public health service</seg><seg type="columnLine">were called in for co-operation. Finally everything was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready for the transportation of the insane to the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">centers, the sleeping cities, where they were to enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">into their long rest. The day this work was started</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was estimated that there were one hundred and ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">million insane and one million sane people in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">States. Systematically they were brought to the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities, indexed, tagged, and given their dose of sleep-</seg><seg type="columnLine">drug. On their tag was written their final destination</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they were taken, sleeping, to their new homes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">laid in long rows in the glass houses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The work continued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no rest, no respite, no vacation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The order had gone forth that the work would stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it was completed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gradually it was accomplished, and the exhausted</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers laid down their pens, card indexes, and hypo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dermic needles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One hundred and ten million people were resting</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly free from worry and the need for food.

Nothing more</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to be done for one year, when each of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to be given another dose. The primary dose</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been so graduated that every sleeper would need</seg><seg type="columnLine">his second dose on January first of the next year. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was believed that sufficient workers could be trained in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interval so the hundred and ten million doses could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be given in one day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sane nation relaxed, but only for a short time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was work to be done, far more than even a mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lion superior adults could hope to accomplish. New</seg><seg type="columnLine">homes must be provided. The children of the insane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">deprived of their parents, must be cared for and reared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to healthy adult life. An entirely different system of</seg><seg type="columnLine">economics was necessary to promote the healthy in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dustrial growth of the nation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meantime the world looked on, waiting to see if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">late giant in the league of nations would die or sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vive.

There were several men dressed in uniform,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one little old man in tropical linens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The officers remained with the sailors but the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">old man started to walk up the beach toward the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman. They peered at each other. Suddenly the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe you are Ebony Kate?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I sure am-and are youse Master Taine?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. That is my name. Well, Kate, we are some</seg><seg type="columnLine">older than we were the last time we met. A good deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">of water has gone over the mill dam since then. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never did think I would find you, but here you are.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Can you take care of my friends and myself for a day</seg><seg type="columnLine">or so? We shall want some fresh water and some</seg><seg type="columnLine">fruit."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They walked back to the boat and Kate was intro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced to the officers as Madam Octavia, formerly of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Indo-China. Then they all went to the main bungalow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taine and the officers all kept one hand in a pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a gun, but their caution was unnecessary. Taine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, was uneasy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are your friends, Madam?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They are gone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I trust they are not dead."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah! No. Not dead, Sir, but just away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was interesting to note that she was now talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the best of English. Taine looked at her, wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing just what she really meant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So they are away? How well I remember the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">times. There were Count Sebastian and Marcus and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clever physician, Dr. Semon. We were young then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madam. I was living in San Francisco and every once</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a while your friends made it necessary for me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel. Life is different now in the United States.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">You would not recognize it. The changes in the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty years have been wonderful."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And your wife and children, are they well?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They were the last time I saw them. That was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">year ago. We have been cruising in the Pacific-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">for my health. I was beginning to grow old, Madam,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my wife insisted that I consult a Doctor, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that there was nothing wrong with me except that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had lost interest in life. He said that when a man</seg><seg type="columnLine">had solved all of his problems and solved all his diffi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">culties, he grew old. Then he said that what I needed</seg><seg type="columnLine">was some excitement and advised me to go back on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Secret Service. I talked it over with Mrs. Taine</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she suggested that I finish up my work of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty years ago and arrest or kill THE POWERFUL</seg><seg type="columnLine">ONES. Her idea was that so long as they were alive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobody in the United States would be really safe, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">just because we had not heard from them for so long,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no sign that they were dead or harmless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I thought there was something in what she said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I went to Washington. Almost everybody that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew there was dead. As far as New York City was</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned, that was just a place where millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepers were resting. The new city was upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hudson. I went there but all of my former friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">were gone, a few were insane and the rest dead. So I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought it all over and decided to see the President</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the United States. I told him the history of THE</seg><seg type="columnLine">POWERFUL ONES from the very beginning and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ended by accusing them of the wave of insanity that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had so nearly destroyed the nation. We had a hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">time finding all the old documents but I finally proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">every part of my story. Then I asked him for help</seg><seg type="columnLine">in locating those men, provided they were still alive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I guessed that they would be somewhere in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pacific. He believed me enough to finance the search</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I have been scouring the ocean for an unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">island. I heard rumors of such a place ruled over by</seg><seg type="columnLine">an old-fashioned Princess and here you are and here</seg><seg type="columnLine">I am."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And the rest are not here," said Ebony Kate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">. That was all she would say. The next day she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">equally non-committal. Taine had an idea that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men he was hunting were hiding on the island, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find them seemed rather hopeless. Meantime the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steamer was supplied with water and fruit and a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">live pigs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the third night, after supper, Taine announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">his intention of remaining ashore instead of returning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ship with the officers. The night was calm.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ebony Kate sat on the gallery fanning herself. Taine</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat watching her. Suddenly she stopped rocking and</seg><seg type="columnLine">said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Taine, what is senile? If you say that a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son is growing senile, what do you mean?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It means that you are growing old, the skin</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrinkles, the hair becomes white, your teeth fall out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">your memory becomes poor. You become a withered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">silly old hag."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Would you call me senile?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, indeed! You do not look a day over fifty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact, I thought that you were very well preserved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course you must be old but I never would call you</seg><seg type="columnLine">senile."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is kind of you to say it that way, Mr. Taine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just telling the truth, Kate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe you. I wish I could make up my mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">to talk to you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The wind was beginning to moan in the palm trees.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In spite of the breeze, it seemed to be growing much</seg><seg type="columnLine">warmer, almost hot. Taine wondered if it were going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to rain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">416</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go ahead and talk, if you want to, Kate," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe I will. You knew me when I was on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Barbary Coast in Frisco. I was keeping George then.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He would have starved many a day but for my help.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I often gave Marcus money and as for Dr. Semon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a time when he begged me to marry him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the early days of the adventure, I was the only</seg><seg type="columnLine">one who was on Easy Street. Of course when they</seg><seg type="columnLine">started to make the gold, I shared in their good times,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but at the same time I was of great help to them. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">held the group together and got all the Southern nig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gers to join us by my voodoo stuff. I was always true</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them, and you know there were times when I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have made my pile by giving them away to the Gov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernment. They lived an easy life and they were white</seg><seg type="columnLine">so long that I guess they forgot they were just black</seg><seg type="columnLine">folks like I was. We have been on the island a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time: they used to make trips and they never did ask</seg><seg type="columnLine">me to go. Guess they were ashamed of having a black</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman with them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They were back of that insanity stuff. Dr. Fland-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings gave them the idea and they put it through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Glass Trust without arousing any suspicion. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed--but they came close to' succeeding. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">you might have found out about it, but you never had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance to even get started. When they found out</seg><seg type="columnLine">how close they had come to success and yet how much</seg><seg type="columnLine">better things were because of their work, they were dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">couraged. Flandings made a special trip all through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the States and when he came back three years ago he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said that life was happier and healthier there than it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever was before, and that they had gotten rid of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">of our race. It was a white country for white people.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">That made them all feel sick, and then-my! But</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the wind is coming up."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't mind that--go on with your story," urged</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They decided to do something else- and I told</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">them not to- I thought they had better stop while</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the stopping was good-and Dr. Semon-lie used</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to say that he loved me- he says to George, 'Poor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">old Kate is growing senile.' That's what he said, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then they went ahead with their plans and one night</seg><seg type="columnLine">they all left, and that was three years ago and I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">not seen them since."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what did they plan to do?" demanded Taine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hain't no call to tell you all, but I'se gwine ter</seg><seg type="columnLine">do it." In her excitement the negress had lapsed into</seg><seg type="columnLine">her dialect.

It is too late for us to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">to San Francisco in time.

It was more of a tornado</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a storm and more of a typhoon than a tornado.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It caught the steamer and carried it to the coast of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Australia, a sorry wreck, with over half of the crew</seg><seg type="columnLine">lost. It carried away every house on the island and</seg><seg type="columnLine">every one of the servants. It rushed in a diabolical</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury over the island for half an hour, and then there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">came a death-like quiet. The full moon shone over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreckage and saw two people unconscious under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">timbers of the largest house--a white man and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">black woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ebony Kate and Taine did not die though they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather sore and miserable for a few days. They could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do nothing but make the best of things and they pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceeded to do so. They fixed a roof over a part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruins, gathered together what food supplies they could</seg><seg type="columnLine">find, and then settled down to housekeeping, with Taine</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the master and Ebony Kate as cook.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taine was miserable. Had it not been for his firm</seg><seg type="columnLine">belief in predestination, he would have been much more</seg><seg type="columnLine">depressed than he was. While not possessed of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the details, he was confident that on the first of Janu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ary one hundred and fifteen million raving maniacs</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be turned loose in his beloved country, all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">more desperate and depraved because of their long</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep. He was sure that it was going to happen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was nothing he could do to prevent it. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">meantime, he salvaged a revolver and some ammunition</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the wreckage and practiced target shooting. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">told Kate what he intended to do. On her knees, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">begged him not to:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are a Christian man, Mr. Taine. Please don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to your God with blood on yer hands."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Taine only laughed at her:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just like shooting so many rats, Kate. Those white</seg><seg type="columnLine">niggers have been the ruin of my country and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pest of my life. I do not want them to think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they have raised all this Hell and will not be punished</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it. I am going to hide when they come, and wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">till they start their bragging, and then I am going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">walk out and kill them--one, two, three, four, just</seg><seg type="columnLine">like I hit those cocoa nuts, and then you and I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait our chance and go back home."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing she could say had any effect on him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">January came and almost went. In fact, it was on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last day of January that a ship appeared on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon, came nearer, unloaded four men and several</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases of goods and then sailed away. The four men</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved to be George, Marcus and the two Doctors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They looked just about the same as when they left,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps a little older, but a thousand times happier.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In fact, they were exuberant with joy as they greeted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ebony Kate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We got them this time, Kate. We certainly did,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said George.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait till supper time and then we will open some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the champagne, and you can tell me all about it."</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were a little worried about the damage done</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the island and pitied the black woman on account</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her months of loneliness. They promised to take her</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Paris in a few months. The ship was going to stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">for them on the return trip and from now on they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were going to take life easy. She told them to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">their things away and get ready for the supper. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked the top off one of the crates and filled her</seg><seg type="columnLine">apron with canned goods, caviar, lobster and salad</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At five that evening the five of them sat down to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">supper. They were all in good spirits and the men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a few glasses of champagne, all wanted to talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once. Finally Ebony Kate said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Keep quiet. I's wanting to know what happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you all talk so's I can't understand head or tail</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it. George, you tell it, you'se got the bestest words."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It was like this," said George, "we went to France</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then across to the States. Didn't take long to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">them that we knew our stuff and we got government</seg><seg type="columnLine">jobs. We worked toward the laboratory end of it and</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow the men above us were always getting sick--</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE MENACE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">417</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that was good stuff you made for us, Kate; it didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">make them suspicious; just made them want a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacation--and every time one of them went away one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us was promoted. The beginning of last year we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were just about in charge of the manufacturing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">distribution end of the game, so we started in earnest</seg><seg type="columnLine">and without their knowing a thing about it, we made</seg><seg type="columnLine">about one hundred and twenty million doses of some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that was just about dynamite. It looked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sleeping drug, and it had the same chemical reac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions, but it was certainly different in its effect. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">last week we secretly destroyed all the records and</seg><seg type="columnLine">formulae and a lot of the most delicate machinery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then we rushed over to Vancouver and waited. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second of January, we got absolutely correct reports</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Seattle, one of the sleeping cities. One of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">watchmen stood it as long as he could and then beat it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Canada. The radio sent the Canadian papers lots</seg><seg type="columnLine">of detail. Every sleeping imbecile was just awake</seg><seg type="columnLine">and raising unadulterated Hell of every description.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We knew it wasn't any use to stay and since we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, we were naturally anxious to get our things</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the island and go to Paris for the rest of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">lives. We won, Kate! Of course we cannot tell you</seg><seg type="columnLine">every detail but it stands to reason that one million</seg><seg type="columnLine">sane people couldn't do much against over one hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fifteen maniacs. It took us over forty years to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreck that nation but we did it--and it is going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay wrecked."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So you all's gwine ter go ter Paris?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, just as soon as we can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gwine ter take me with yer?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, now, Kate, you see it's this way. You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good home here and we will always take care of you</seg><seg type="columnLine">and see that you do not want for anything. But at</seg><seg type="columnLine">your age you had better stay here and take things</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Think I am too old?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's like this, Kate," said Dr. Semon. "You have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been here so long, that it is just like home here and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you would not be happy anywhere else."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The black woman looked at the four white men at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the table with her. She knew that they were really</seg><seg type="columnLine">black--in more ways than one--she thought of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">white man who was really white waiting to kill them--</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had always treated her like a black woman, but</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">then he had always been kind to her- So she said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suppose we end the supper with a drink of</seg><seg type="columnLine">brandy?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She served it to them, and then Marcus proposed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">toast:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To our friends, the whites of the United States, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paradise, and may we never meet!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They drank it standing, and then they all sat down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Taine walked into the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They looked at him rather stupidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stand up and fight," he commanded.

Taine made arrangements to have all</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the natives carried to the nearest populated island. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">engaged passage for himself to British Columbia. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept himself as busy as he could, to keep his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady.

Villiers was the first to</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp the significance of Eden's words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God, do you mean--" he gasped hoarsely, "do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you mean to swing the earth off its orbit?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ah, thank God you have grasped it!" said Eden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and even as I gazed at him in horror, I realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">research had turned his brain, and that we were in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the presence of a madman. "Yes, I shall swing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth off its orbit. By means of my indirected beam--</seg><seg type="columnLine">disintegration waves, and of a process embodied in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this little machine, by which it can send waves con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly towards the sun even after it has set, just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">radio waves are hurled through the ether, I intend to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring this earth several million miles nearer the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As soon as I set this framework in motion our</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere will at once begin to become warmer. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">climate will become more bracing, more rarefied. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">luxurious vegetation will grow up everywhere. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolution of every man, woman and child in the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be affected. It will alter the ways of what we have</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to know as nature. It may even change the</seg><seg type="columnLine">length of our days and nights. It will certainly</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorten our years. We shall feel yeai-s younger. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">frames will become electrified in the buoyancy of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new atmosphere."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VILLIERS and I gazed at each other fearfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eden, for all his madness, was not a man to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">statements at random. Although we could not credit</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he had just told us, it was quite probable that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine might produce some extraordinary at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mospheric change over the earth, and it was our</seg><seg type="columnLine">duty, as sane men, to discover the power of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanism, and how dangerous it was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course it may take people several years to be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come accustomed to the atmospheric changes," went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Eden, "But afterwards--afterwards mankind will</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize what a great boon I shall have conferred upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">humanity."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what are you going to do?" I gasped in</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement, "How are you going to accomplish this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He held up his hand for silence. He might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been addressing a mass-multitude of the nations of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth, so impressive was his mein.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gaspard and Villiers, my friends," he said solemnly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"when I turn this lever with this key, the frame-</seg><seg type="columnLine">work will begin to revolve. From that moment on</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is danger. If this machine is not controlled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might mean that our proximity to the sun would</seg><seg type="columnLine">decrease to such an alarming extent that we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be absorbed in an all-pervading conflagration. I can</seg><seg type="columnLine">only conjecture as to .the proper moment when the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine must be stopped. Once we are swung off our</seg><seg type="columnLine">orbit, gravity may do anything to us. We scientists</seg><seg type="columnLine">must take risks--and I am willing to take this risk</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I believe is negligible. But, my friends," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">TEN DAYS TO LIVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">421</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">here he dropped his voice to the merest whisper, "this</seg><seg type="columnLine">is where I am going to put my trust in you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stared at us both wildly, as if challenging us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">contradict the plausibility of his statements. But we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were both silent, and I think that even sardonic Vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liers was awed by the magnitude of the conception.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This man Greely, Gaspard, whom you mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">just now," he dropped his voice again, and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him carefully, as if he expected to find lurking</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures in the shadows of the cave, "he is a common</seg><seg type="columnLine">working-man. He is a madman and a degenerate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He has tried to attack me several times while I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">working here. He has a delusion that I am planning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kill him. Absurd--if you wish, but it is his</seg><seg type="columnLine">delusion. And it is in my defence, my dear friends,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I wish you both to take a part. In case anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">happens to me, I wish you to smash this machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">before it is too late."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what do you mean by 'before it is too late?'"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Villiers inquired. And I could tell by the steely glint</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his usually lustreless eyes, that he was impressed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After five days it will be dangerous to let the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine run," Eden explained. "By that time I an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticipate that we shall be near enough to the sun to</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel some palpable atmospheric change."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Villiers and I glanced at each other again. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite clear that our dear friend Eden's mind had</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely gone. He was advancing upon us now</seg><seg type="columnLine">with book in hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Swear before me in God's name that you will destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">this machine if I am not here to look after it myself,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he commanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment we hesitated, but then, perceiving</seg><seg type="columnLine">that no harm, at any rate, could come from taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a meaningless oath, we each swore solemnly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After this little ceremony was over, Eden stooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly over the machine and touched the small handle</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the side. In a flash the framework began to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volve. Faster and faster it went, and as it re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volved, a soft humming sound, like the droning of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant bee, could be heard. After he had demonstrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">to us how easily the machine could be started, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">switched it off, and beckoned us back out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory and into the house above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No sooner had we emerged from the cellar, into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hallway again, than we were startled by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of a frantic scream coming from the direction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dining-room. Instinctively we rushed forward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the voice had been Phillipa's and from the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it we could all tell that she was terribly frightened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER II</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VILLIERS was the first to enter the room, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard him swear under his breath. When Eden</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I followed close behind him, a peculiar spec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacle met our gaze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Phillipa was cringing back against the wall, whilst</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing her, apparently engaged only in making the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most fearsome grimaces at her, stood the most re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsive man I had ever seen. I recognized him at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once as Greely, from the descriptions given me by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Villiers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Greely was a degenerate who frequented the vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lage inns, and slunk about the beach near the shore.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was while on one of these aimless excursions that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found the hole in the cliff leading to Eden's labora-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory. Eden had found him down there, examining the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine with great curiosity, about ten days before</seg><seg type="columnLine">our visit. Fortunately the man was in a half-crazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition, or he would undoubtedly have attacked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eden, who was no match for him in strength.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Greely had evidently entered the dining-room by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">way of the French windows, for one of these was</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide open, and the carpet and floor directly beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">it were soiled by the passage of someone's rough and</seg><seg type="columnLine">filthy boots. The man himself was a huge broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouldered giant, with an evil and bestial countenance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His face was hairy and pock-marked, and the vile,</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow eyes he turned on us as we entered the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">were full of base animal passion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Villiers, whose features became literally distorted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with cruelty when he was angry, stepped up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. I saw the passion die out of Greely's wicked</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, and a coward's fear replace it. He cringed away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Villiers, and yelped like a whipped cur.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I ain't done no harm, mister," he said in a whin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing tone." I only just come in to see if the lady</seg><seg type="columnLine">could spare a bite to eat. I ain't had a bite for three</seg><seg type="columnLine">days now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You lie," said Villiers quietly, and his voice was</seg><seg type="columnLine">like steel. "Get out of here--and never let me see</seg><seg type="columnLine">you again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man shrank back as if he had been struck.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Villiers' anger was terrible to witness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll go, mister," he whined. "I ain't done no harm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I'll go." And he began shuffling his way back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards towards the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If I ever catch you in here again--I'll kill you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">hissed Villiers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I watched Greely as he lumbered away across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawn towards the shrubbery bordering the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cliff. He turned before disappearing down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff side, and shook his fist at us. His face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">malignant with fiendish passion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Villiers turned towards where Phillipa stood, her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand on her heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I hope that he didn't frighten you, Miss Eden,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said courteously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She smiled at him nervously.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He came in so suddenly, I--I hadn't time to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">think," she replied, but I suspected that she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">more frightened of Villiers than she had been of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We all went out on the lawn after that, and Phil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lipa gave me her hand as I stood back for her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass safely through the French window. Her fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">were trembling, but they clung to mine in confidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I retained their pressure. Somehow I was glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">then that I was not capable of the cold ferocity Vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liers had shown in his treatment of the man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night I tossed and turned in my bed, troubled</seg><seg type="columnLine">by vague disquieting thoughts and premonitions. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness seemed to quiver with a sort of restlessness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I mused over the events of the day with some</seg><seg type="columnLine">misgiving. Could Eden really accomplish this stu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendous thing of which he boasted? What would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effect of bringing the earth nearer the sun? What</seg><seg type="columnLine">would happen, if, through some miscalculation on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">part, we were all precipitated for all eternity through</seg><seg type="columnLine">space? And then drowsily, I thought of Phillipa,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dearest of all women. And next, with a thrill of</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror, I remembered the hairy, pock-marked face of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greely, and the evil, hungry eyes he had cast upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">Phillipa. With such thoughts racing through my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind I fell into an uneasy slumber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was awakened, it seemed after an incredibly short</seg><seg type="columnLine">space of time, by the sensation of someone shaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">me fiercely' by the shoulders. I sat up in bed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed into the frantic eyes of Phillipa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her face was deathly pale, and her hair disordered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come-- come quickly," she cried. "There is some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one else in the house. My-- my brother heard, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he got up and went downstairs -- and they're fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">422</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. I heard him cry out. Please come-- you must</seg><seg type="columnLine">come!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God," I ejaculated, and half flinging on a bath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">robe, I ran down the dark corridor towards the room</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which Eden slept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But someone was already there before me. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">I gripped the handle of the door and flung it open, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to find a dark figure crouched over an inanimate</seg><seg type="columnLine">form on the floor. The figure turned in a flash at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my entrance, and I saw that it was Villiers. His face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was white and strained, and when he saw Phillipa, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">held out his hands on either side of him as if to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shield us from the sight of the lifeless thing on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take her away, Gaspard," he said hoarsely, "There's</seg><seg type="columnLine">something foul being done here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before I could prevent her, Phillipa had rushed for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, and the next instant was kneeling beside the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of her brother on the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">EDEN was quite dead. Of that there could be no</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt. His face was horribly distorted, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck was swollen from the pressure of powerful hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes were nearly starting out of his head, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole position of the body was indescribably hor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible. It was evident, however, that he had put up</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good fight against the intruder, for the room was</seg><seg type="columnLine">littered with clothes, and the dressing-table cloth had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been swept on the floor, carrying with it the mass of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bottles, brushes, and other personal paraphernalia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some minutes later I took Phillipa gently by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm, and led her away quite passively to her room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The shock had been so great that I do not think she</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized what was happening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go to bed, Miss Eden," I tried to comfort her</seg><seg type="columnLine">as best I could, "He's beyond anything we can do</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him now. You must leave it to Villiers and me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bring this murderer to justice."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went back to Villiers and the room of death. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was gazing out of the window, and down at the sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides of the ivy-covered walls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you see him?" I inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, it was Greely," he replied, without looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">round. "I burst open the door just as he was getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the window. I was too late to get him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can see from the ivy that he didn't waste any</seg><seg type="columnLine">time getting away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were both silent for a minute, and I believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were both thinking of Phillipa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Was any -- money or anything taken?" I ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he replied shortly, "You know that he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">come for that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were silent again, and then Villiers spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know, I was just thinking, this leaves</seg><seg type="columnLine">us in a deuce of a fix."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In what way? Do you mean Phillipa?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well -- no," he answered thoughtfully, "I wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking of her particularly, although, of course, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall see that everything is all right for her. Poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">old Eden," he mused, "I wonder if he was right about</seg><seg type="columnLine">that machine?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stared at him blankly for a minute, until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">full purport of his words became clear. And then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a flash, I realized what he meant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"You mean -- you mean --" I gasped, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped me short.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The machine," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instantly we must have thought of the same con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tingency, for I saw Villiers glance across the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">at me, and he must have seen the answering stare</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fear in my own eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll go," I said, sensing his thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wait," he cried, and before I could make a move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, he bent and covered the still form of our mutual</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend, Eden, with a sheet. "I will go with you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is nothing more we can do here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We hurried together through the spacious hallway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With feverish fingers we unlocked the door admitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to the stone steps. With beating hearts we ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the corridor leading to the cave where we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been shown the infernal machine only the night be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore. Hardly daring to think of what we should dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover, we flung open the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Except for the chemical apparatus, Bunsen burners</seg><seg type="columnLine">and test tubes, weird-shaped oblong bottles and basins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a mass of electrical material, the place was empty.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The machine had gone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The full consequence of what the theft of the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine might mean did not at once occur to me. I stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gaped at Villiers stupidly. The ticking of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch on my wrist came to my ears quite audibly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and far away in the night I could hear the thunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous rumble of some freight train. Then somehow or</seg><seg type="columnLine">other I managed to pull myself together, and managed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to force a laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Come," I remarked," we must look at this thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a common-sense way. I, for one, don't believe</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Eden could do what he claimed to be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. We both know that he was partially unbalanced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and anyway, the odds are that Greely will not know</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to start the machine. God wouldn't allow such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a thing to come to pass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw a grim, ironical smile hover for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Villiers' mirthless features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It would be interesting to see in just what a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world would take the news," he mused half aloud.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Just ten days to live, eh? You know, Gaspard, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a prophecy in that good Book of yours which</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're so fond of quoting, to the effect that although</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world shall never again be destroyed by flood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet there might be a possibility of its destruction</seg><seg type="columnLine">by fire."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have more faith than that in the goodness of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deity," I replied somewhat stiffly, for theology was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the basis of much disagreement between Villiers and</seg><seg type="columnLine">myself. "Anyway, to return to the immediate present,</seg><seg type="columnLine">what are we to do now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I suggest that we go to bed," my companion pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed imperturbably. "We can do nothing more to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night. And in the morning we can notify the police,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and have a look through the village for Greely. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has turned on the machine, and we are not able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find it, and if what Eden said about it was true--</seg><seg type="columnLine">then in less than ten days, the world is doomed. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, let's hope that Greely has not been indiscreet</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to hide it where we cannot find it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And with this grim jest on his lips, Villiers turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we made our way out of that chilly cave, and up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cellar steps to the hall again. I lay awake most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the night wondering what the morrow would bring</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth, and imagining that little, whirling machine re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volving steadily, almost noiselessly, and of the mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man Greely watching it ' in fascination whilst the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth hurtled madly through space, drawing nearer</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour by hour to that great fiery inferno that keeps</seg><seg type="columnLine">us all alive and moving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER III</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VILLIERS was up before me in the morning. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked at my door at a very early hour, fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed, and with his sour, sardonic features</seg><seg type="columnLine">kindled with a sort of weird animation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've been thinking out our position during the</seg><seg type="columnLine">TEN DAYS TO LIVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">423</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">night," he confided to me. "I'm going out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grounds to see if I can catch a glimpse of our friend</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greely. If I want your help, I'll call out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what do you think I'm going to do?" I ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected, "just hang about?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By no means," he replied, as if he had thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the whole scheme beforehand, "I want you to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">after Miss Eden. "I'm sure you are capable of doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, my dear Gaspard, far more thoroughy than I</seg><seg type="columnLine">am," he added with a smirk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, I did not deny it. I was as much in love</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Phillipa as I would ever be with anyone. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">me she would always be the dearest woman in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, and the thought that she might come to some</seg><seg type="columnLine">harm through negligence on our part, filled me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">righteous anxiety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't worry-- I shall guard her with my life,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I assured him, and he went away from me still</seg><seg type="columnLine">smirking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not see Phillipa until later in the day. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were dark rings around her eyes, and I knew that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been mourning for her brother. Nevertheless I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was determined to speak to her of my feelings for her</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the earliest possible moment, and to offer her both</seg><seg type="columnLine">my love and protection if she would marry me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In her presence I forgot all about the possibility of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that sinister little machine, which might be revolving</seg><seg type="columnLine">noiselessly in some secret nook in the village. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not until evening that my visions received a some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what rude jolt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were in the middle of May at that time, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was usual for the sun to set some time between</seg><seg type="columnLine">six and seven o'clock in the evening. That day had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a beautiful spring day, with summer's promise</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the air until late in the afternoon. I was sitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Phillipa in the grounds when suddenly a wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang up, which in half an hour reached the propor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions of a gale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It moaned and tore over the cliffs, tossing the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a thousand white-crested billows, beating with</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferocity against the walls of Eden's old house, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even uprooting a tree in the garden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Phillipa and I ran for shelter to the house, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood side by side gazing out of the window at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs of chaos. While we were standing there, Vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liers came up silently from behind, and remained there</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a minute without speaking. And as we three</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood there, a more than usually fierce gust of wind</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the house, shaking its old foundations, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving us the illusion perhaps, that the house rocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the earth trembled beneath our feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Illusion or no illusion, I know that the sensation</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so real that I turned round to Villiers and found</seg><seg type="columnLine">him ashen-faced, staring out of the window at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible landscape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My God!" he gasped. "Did you ever know such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a storm in May? It looks like the end of the world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the sea below the cliffs, came the mighty roar</seg><seg type="columnLine">of breakers crashing vainly against the chalk barriers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black clouds scurried across the sky, and quite sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly--in less than five minutes--the darkness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">night closed down on us. I glanced at my watch at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this juncture, and found that the time was only 4:45</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the afternoon. The sun had set two hours before</seg><seg type="columnLine">its appointed time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I know that my knees were trembling to such an</seg><seg type="columnLine">extent that I could hardly present a semblance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">normality to Phillipa. Fortunately she had left us</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortly after the darkness came upon us. To her this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing more than an unusually ferocious storm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But Villiers and I knew different. It was the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmation of our worst fears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We sat still in the semi-darkness for some minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">after she had gone. A single oil lamp flickered from a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rusty hook in the hall. I heard the hiss of Villiers'</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath through his teeth . . . Finally I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand the silence no longer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," I whispered, "what do you make of it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice came to me weirdly out of the gloom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Make of it! Doesn't it prove that friend Eden</seg><seg type="columnLine">was right for once?" he gasped hoarsely. "Greely, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his ignorance of the true functions of the machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">has set the thing going. Our only hope is to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and discover where he has hidden it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good God!" I groaned. "The thing seems impos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible. Perhaps it was only some sort of a cyclone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Such storms have visited the coast here before, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is there any storm in the world which would cause</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun to set a couple of hours ahead of time, Gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pard?" he observed sarcastically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was little sleep for us that night. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stilly darkness we searched all over the grounds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the beach for some sign of Greely. The orchard</seg><seg type="columnLine">was explored from top to bottom. The Italian rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden was searched from end to end. We peeped</seg><seg type="columnLine">into holes in the cliffside. The cave-like laboratory</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which Eden worked gave us no clues, for the floor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">although sandy in spots, was for the most part rocky</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to leave no trace of footprints.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was long past midnight when we gave up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">search. We were in the vicinity of the cave at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment, and I remember that Villiers led the way in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we both sat down on some sort of a packing-case</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gazed at each other blankly. Through the vent</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ceiling we could survey the sky. I could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the twinkling of several stars, and the tops of two</seg><seg type="columnLine">trees in the garden. There was a pigeon-house built</seg><seg type="columnLine">on one of these trees, and I fancied I could hear the</seg><seg type="columnLine">low cooing of one of the birds to its mate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then I thought of Phillipa, and I think I realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">then what an awful catastrophe this thing might</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring about. Here we were in this twentieth cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tury, with science making such rapid strides that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hard for the layman to keep abreast of its dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coveries, cornered by a little machine, which was gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erating a tremendous power against which all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">incantations and prayers of men were useless. I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">just see the whiteness of Villiers' face through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness, and it looked as though he were smiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Gaspard old friend," his voice came to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">weirdly out of the gloom, "we've done our best for</seg><seg type="columnLine">tonight. It looks as though it may be up to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Deity of yours to save the world after all. I wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">how people will take it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned on him sharply, for he was getting on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God will be merciful," I said. "Villiers, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">catastrophe will fetch more people back to religion</seg><seg type="columnLine">than all the preaching that has ever been done."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Superstitious fear, eh?" he mocked. "I think that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I, at any rate, shall die with a stiff upper lip."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I was such a coward myself that I did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt him. Afterwards I had cause to ponder his</seg><seg type="columnLine">words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The stars were still twinkling in the Heavens when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we parted--some of them' seemed to laugh at our help-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lessness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning I was aroused by the full force</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sun pouring through my open window. Feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing drowsy, but thinking, because of the high posi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">424</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the sun in the sky, that it must be getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">late, I raised myself lazily on one arm and looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">at my watch. It registered five o'clock.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Abruptly the awful realization of what it meant</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to me, and an overwhelming fear clutched at</seg><seg type="columnLine">my heart. Eden had been right, madman though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, and he had succeeded beyond his fondest dreams.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it might be, also, that he had inevitably con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">demned the world. There could no longer be any</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt about the possibility that his machine could</seg><seg type="columnLine">affect the earth's orbit. The short twilight and early</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunset of the night before, and now this early sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise and the sun's late position in the firmament, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmed my fears. The world was surely and unavoid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably being drawn towards the sun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 1 know that the first realization that the unbe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lievable was actually occurring, prostrated me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear. I sat up in bed and gazed like a madman at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ball of fire glowing so rosily in the sky. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of frenzied reaction came over me, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped out of bed and threw on my clothes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Villiers slept at the back of the house, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun had not yet disturbed him. I knocked at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, and receiving no reply, entered the room. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was asleep, and I had to shake him by the shoulders</seg><seg type="columnLine">to arouse him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you know what time it is?" I asked excitedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He blinked at me for a moment, and then looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of his windows at the shadow of the trees on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawn. Their silhouette was very short, and it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">obvious that the sun was nearly overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good Lord," he grinned, "why didn't you wake me?</seg><seg type="columnLine">I must have slept the clock round."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is now half past five in the morning," I said</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaningly, and going to the window I pulled aside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the curtain so that he might see more clearly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Half past five?" he repeated in a puzzled tone.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then realization came to him, just as it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to me. "Good God!" he said. Then, "The sun!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Look where it is."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly," I observed, and we were silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOW neither of us, as a matter of fact, could actu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ally see the sun. Villiers' room was at the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the house, as I have said, and my room, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced the cliffs, was in the front. But we could both</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize from the shadows on the lawn that the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be very nearly overhead. And even as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched, a new beam of light cut across the grass</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a needle point, and I saw Villiers' face go pale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's get down and see what the papers have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say," he remarked grimly. And suiting the action to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the word, he commenced to dress rapidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had to wait for an hour downstairs before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper boy arrived. He was only a lad, and when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw us both waiting for him on the doorstep, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced up at us fearfully as if expecting to receive</seg><seg type="columnLine">our verdict on this extraordinary state of affairs. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">young face was pale, and there were frightened lines</seg><seg type="columnLine">around his mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's it mean, mister?" he queried. "It ain't</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural--this here daylight. It's got 'em scared--even</seg><seg type="columnLine">up in the city."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind what it means," said Villiers gruffly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Give us the paper. And here's something for your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self," and he handed the boy some silver.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The paper was full of the peculiar storm which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ravaged the entire country the night before. Most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the papers would have gone to press too early to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">any mention of that morning's early sunrise. But all</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorts of weird opinions were advanced to account for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the previous evening's disturbances, and even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astronomers were scared out of their usual calm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SUN CHANGES ITS SPOTS.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Storm of Unparalleled Fury Wrecks Country.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Accompanied by Terrifying Darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     London:--A ninety-mile-an-hour gale accom-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   panied by a moaning sound and a heavy downpour</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   of rain swept over the entire country last night,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   uprooting trees, lifting the roofs off farm-houses,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   and doing untold damages to the early crops.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      From several centres come stories of near es-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    capes from death, and in many places people are</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    homeless as a result of one of the worst storms</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    ever experienced in England. The curious part</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    of the storm, however, was the swift darkness</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    which descended in its wake. The whole country</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    lay in pitch darkness before five o'clock, and the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    storm had died away just as quickly as it had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    come.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      Various explanations are forthcoming from as-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    tronomers on last night's cyclonic display. One</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    of the most feasible explanations comes from Sir</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    Philip Sims, who is well known as the famous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    discoverer of Sims' Comet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      "Curious outbursts of flame on the sun's sur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    face, usually known as sun spots, are known to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    have a direct bearing on atmospheric conditions on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    the earth," says Sir Philip. "It is probable that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    the position of one of these vast bodies of molten</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    material has changed on the sun's surface, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    that last night's severe storm was caused by at-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    mospheric disturbances which could be attributed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    to this change."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sounds all right, doesn't it?" Villiers said sar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">donically, as we read this short account together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a lot more about the storm, and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">theories were advanced, bringing in shadows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds, and other things to account for the sudden</seg><seg type="columnLine">darkness. After that morning's extraordinary sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise, there was little doubt that the entire press of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world would be making comments on the phe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nomena by the evening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Villiers and I had a long talk that morning, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided that it was our bounden duty to the world to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the fact of Eden's experiments known to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. We decided that we would wait until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow to see if anything further transpired, and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">by that time we had not found the machine, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmospheric conditions still showed signs of reacting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Eden's machine, we would go together to the Prime</seg><seg type="columnLine">Minister and demand that he publish the facts for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the benefit of the world at large, or deal with it in</seg><seg type="columnLine">whatever manner he thought fit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "According to Eden," Villiers calculated grimly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"we still have seven or eight days in which to enjoy</seg><seg type="columnLine">the carnal luxuries of this life. And the world was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made in seven days, friend Gaspard, Eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went up to London that morning, while I spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day with Phillipa. That day I broke the news</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her very gently. She was worried, poor child, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I do not think that she fully realized what I meant.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The police had been around the grounds on the look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out for Greely. They had been in the house, also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">asking her questions about poor Eden's life and habits.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I assured them, as well as I could, that so far as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was aware, he hadn't an enemy in the world. I fur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nished them also with a vivid description of Greely.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But of course we had told them nothing of the ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine, or of the effect it was exerting on the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even at that very moment. We intended to keep this</seg><seg type="columnLine">a secret as long as it was humanly possible to do so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">TEN DAYS TO LIVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">425</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That day was the first day of the great heat. By</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight o'clock, when normally the sun should just be</seg><seg type="columnLine">comfortably launched on its daily round, the heat was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweltering. The policemen took ofE their coats, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fat inspector was visibly perturbed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was dark at three o'clock, and a great hush</seg><seg type="columnLine">had settled over the countryside. It was as if the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole of nature was aware of the approach of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown, but all-powerful cataclysm. The voices of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the birds were silent, and the wind dropped, and only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a faint, lazy lapping murmur came from the sea be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the cliffs. But as I passed the two trees in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden above the cave, I heard the persistent coo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooing of the pigeons from the pigeon hatch, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered why they were not frightened like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest of nature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VILLIERS had not returned from the Metropolis</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the evening papers were out. I had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">opportunity, therefore, to glance through these before</seg><seg type="columnLine">he brought back more precise news from the city.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The papers, as I had predicted, commented fully on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the early sunrise and sunset. Frantic headlines in</seg><seg type="columnLine">enormous black type featured the news on the front</seg><seg type="columnLine">pages of many of the more sensational journals, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the columns of the conservative dailies were</seg><seg type="columnLine">alive with wild and improbable conjectures. The di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versity of opinion as to the cause of the different</seg><seg type="columnLine">phenomena was astounding. One paper advanced the</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory that the excessive radio-activity of the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere was responsible for some of the signs wit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nessed. It might be possible, as this paper pointed out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the millions of radio waves which were daily</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled through the air had in some way or other</seg><seg type="columnLine">split up the component parts of the atmosphere, thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">preventing the earth from turning on its axis at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper speed and so defying the gravity of the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">solar system. This theory was followed up by other</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers, which advocated the seizure of all transmit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting stations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The theory of sun spots, at first advanced by Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philip Sims, was also referred to impressively, espe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cially by the more conservative papers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The New York Wire, in an edito.rial on the subject</seg><seg type="columnLine">written by an astronomer of note, sounded a note of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerful optimism:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     New York:--The present atmospheric disturb-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   ances can, and in all probability will be attributed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   to gigantic derangements on the solar surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Rifts in the sun's envelope, popularly known as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   sun spots, are known to produce climatic changes</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   on the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of the more irrational theories advanced were</seg><seg type="columnLine">manifestly absurd, and not worthy of serious con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sideration. Someone advanced the idea that the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being screened from the earth by the nebulous</seg><seg type="columnLine">tail of a comet. It was clear that every part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth's surface must be affected in a sense identically</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the changes. From all over Europe, America, Asia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from South Africa came reports of early dark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness and an astonishingly short day. From the north-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ernmost point of Norway came an interesting bit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">nows. In that Arctic region, where the sun brooded</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a frozen landscape for three months at a time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unprecedented thaw had set in. Everywhere the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice was cracking, and in some cases immense bergs</seg><seg type="columnLine">had split into many pieces, making the sea very dan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gerous for ships in the vicinity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Villiers returned from London about seven o'clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">that evening. His usually mocking expression had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished, and his features showed signs of weariness</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strain. Quite clearly he was alarmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Any luck?" was his first query, almost as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw me. And as I shook my head, I saw his face</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've looked everywhere, and the village has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">thoroughly searched," I reported, "Phillipa and I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">over every room in the house. We ransacked Eden's</seg><seg type="columnLine">study, but we found no information of any value to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. Evidently Eden was determined that his secret</seg><seg type="columnLine">should die with him.

"That</seg><seg type="columnLine">is one of the unfortunate things about science--it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">absolutely ruthless to those who make mistakes or</seg><seg type="columnLine">take liberties with it. I have never seen the city in</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a state of commotion, Gaspard. Business is prac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tically at a standstill. And so soon in our little pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gram!

I gasped, "It's the truth."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We may as well face it," he went on. "Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">can save us now unless we discover either Greely or</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine. As a matter of fact, Greely is bound to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come out some time in the near future, no matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he may be hiding. The heat will compel him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to show himself. But I don't believe he will identify</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine as the cause of all this disturbance. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">is just as likely to let that run on until the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">&lt;*TT7hat else is happening in the city?"

And he laughed aloud this time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop laughing, for goodness sake!" I cried sharp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. I was surprised that he got on my nerves so</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily. "We've got to act now, and act quickly. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall all go up to London tomorrow, and make this</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing known to the Premier.

All</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the world people started up from their beds to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the brilliant rays of the sun flooding their bed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rooms with light, when normally everything should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been in darkness and hushed in sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Villiers and I were up as soon as the light came;</seg><seg type="columnLine">we witnessed one of the most awe-inspiring sunrises</seg><seg type="columnLine">it has ever been my lot to see.

If one watched steadily one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see it moving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It had been decided that we should take Phillipa</seg><seg type="columnLine">with us to the Metropolis for safety's sake, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we should all visit the Premier together. Accord-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly the three of us packed ourselves into Eden's</seg><seg type="columnLine">car, and in half an hour we were rushing through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the suburbs of London.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here we saw the first signs of the universal panic</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was to follow later as more effects of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">catastrophe continued to make themselves felt. Most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the shops and stores were closed. In one place</seg><seg type="columnLine">we saw an enormous line of people jostling each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their efforts to get into a bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Turning to religion, eh?" Villiers smirked back at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me from his seat at the front of the car. "Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">you believe it, old man. A short life and a merry one</seg><seg type="columnLine">for all of us now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't apprehend for a moment that we have any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing really to fear," I replied, and Phillipa by my</seg><seg type="columnLine">side pressed my hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I smiled down at her, and as I met the trusting</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze of her eyes, I prayed that I should be able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">act out my part in this affair like a man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was quite evident, as we approached the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gested traffic centres of the city, that a spirited effort</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being made to keep things going in as normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">a manner as possible. I even found a sort of grim</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction in watching the unhurried antics of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">traffic policeman, directing the mass of automobiles</seg><seg type="columnLine">at one particularly massed section. I envied this man</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sang-froid, and wondered morbidly what he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be doing seven days later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The heat was now almost unbearable, and it be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came clear to me that, . although Eden had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">specified directly in what manner the danger would lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we approached the sun too closely, in four or five</seg><seg type="columnLine">days we should have reached a stage where an all-con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suming conflagration would be inevitable. I shuddered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE seemed to be some sort of disorderly crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging round the railing of the Premier's resi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence. We parked our car around the corner under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shadow of the Cenbtaph to the Unknown Soldier.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had they all died in vairi?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had almost to fight our way through this mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of people before we came face to face with two burly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and perspiring policemen guarding the entrance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Premier's door. I clung to Phillipa, who was white</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the lips and evidently greatly frightened, whilst</seg><seg type="columnLine">Villiers went ahead. I heard his arresting voice ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">out even above the babel of shouting about us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We've got to see the Premier," I heard him cry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It is on vitally important business."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's what they all say, mister," grinned back one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the policemen. "I guess your business is no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">important than Sir Philip Sims', who's in with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Premier now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The great astronomer?" queried Villiers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's him," assented the officer, "And, by golly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">-we certainly need to have the weather cleared up!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Well, that's what I'm here to do," announced Vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liers confidently, and he pushed the astonished officer</seg><seg type="columnLine">to one side. "If you resist me, it will be at your</seg><seg type="columnLine">own personal risk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">' The two guardians of the peace exchanged glances.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Apparently they both decided that Villiers was bluffing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They closed up together, prepared to contest his en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trance. But the solution of the problem was in other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands than their own. The mob, upon hearing Vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liers' words, surged forward. Phillipa and I found</seg><seg type="columnLine">purselves on the crest of an irresistible wave of hu-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">manity. I saw the figures of the two policemen melt</seg><seg type="columnLine">away in the rush. The door of the residence burst</seg><seg type="columnLine">open suddenly, and I had a hurried glimpse of the^</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrified face of a man-servant. Then someone seized</seg><seg type="columnLine">my arm in a grip of iron, and I found myself, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Phillipa still clinging to me, in a dark hallway. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">door banged somehow behind us, and the faint tumultu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous murmur of the surging mob came faintly to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">ears from the outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I noticed then that Villiers was arguing with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scared-looking menial in the passage ahead of us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a moment or two, he turned round to us and</seg><seg type="columnLine">beckoned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Premier will'see us right away," he whispered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"And Sir Philip Sims will be there as well. We shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">get an expert opinion on our declaration."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am not able to analyze my feelings clearly at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fateful moment when the door ahead of us opened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitting us to the presence of the man who guided</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nation's destinies. I recognized him immediately.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was short of stature, but well-built. He had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bald head and a very wrinkled face. His eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">grey and kindly, but very keen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the particular moment we entered, he looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">worried. There were ominous wrinkles on his fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. Seated opposite him was a small, fat man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hooked nose. This man wore a pince-nez, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew him immediately to be Sir Philip Sims, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">recently gained much publicity, on account of his dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covery of the celebrated Sims' Comet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The great astronomer glanced at us somewhat super-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ciliously as we faced him. I suppose he was wonder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing by what right ignorant laymen like ourselves were</seg><seg type="columnLine">admitted to a conference of such vital importance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But we were soon to startle him out of his shell of</seg><seg type="columnLine">reserve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Premier rose to his feet as he caught sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Phillipa, and motioned us all to take a seat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am informed, gentlemen," he began in a soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice, "that you wish to see me on important business</seg><seg type="columnLine">relevant to the present inexplicable atmospheric dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbance?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Villiers rose to his feet, and whatever his short-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comings may have been, he certainly always had that</seg><seg type="columnLine">indescribable knack for facing any crisis in a calm and</seg><seg type="columnLine">collected manner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My friends and I have information, sir, which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the utmost importance to the whole world," he said</seg><seg type="columnLine">solemnly. "As you are aware, a great change has</seg><seg type="columnLine">come over the earth. During the last couple of days</seg><seg type="columnLine">the length of our days and of our nights have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">shortened. As Sir Philip Sims must have conjec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured, this might be due to a sudden unprecedented</seg><seg type="columnLine">reduction in the earth's orbit around the sun. Our</seg><seg type="columnLine">very periodicity 'is changing every minute in rela-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to the universe around us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He paused dramatically, and I can still see the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comprehending expression on the face of the Premier</seg><seg type="columnLine">and of the great astronomer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My friends here--may I introduce Mr. Gaspard</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Miss Eden--and I have authoritative information</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to what may be causing this unexampled condition</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this very moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Three days ago Edward Eden, one of my best</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends and a remarkable scientist, whose works on</seg><seg type="columnLine">electro-magnetic activity you must have read, sir,</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed us a machine he had perfected, by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which he hoped to be able to modify the climatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions of the earth. This machine was designed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to bring the earth nearer to the sun--in other words</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shorten the earth's orbit round the sun.

Villiers continued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Three days ago, on the night he revealed this</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine to us, Mr. Eden was brutally murdered by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">half-crazed tramp. Eden had kept the machine in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory, which he had had fitted up in a natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave carved out by the sea's action on the chalk cliffs</seg><seg type="columnLine">centuries before. He told us that this tramp knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whereabouts of the machine, and that if anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">happened to him, we were to guard the machine--</seg><seg type="columnLine">with our lives. When we visited the cave as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we discovered our friend had been killed, we found</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the machine had disappeared. The day before</seg><seg type="columnLine">yesterday, as you must undoubtedly be aware, the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluence of this machine began to be felt. This is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third day, sir, and as Sir Philip will be able to in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">form you, we shall probably approach the solar body</seg><seg type="columnLine">more rapidly as time goes on until we reach a point</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we shall be drawn very suddenly, within its</seg><seg type="columnLine">influence."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">VILLIERS sat down rather abruptly, and I saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir Philip Sims was impressed in spite of him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self. The Premier sat with hunched shoulders, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head sunk on his chest. Such a catastrophe as this</seg><seg type="columnLine">threatened to be, was entirely outside the province of</seg><seg type="columnLine">statesmanship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is to be done, Sir Philip?" he asked finally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If what Mr. Villiers tells us is true, there is</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing to do but to find the machine," replied Sir</seg><seg type="columnLine">Philip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Premier raised his head. From without, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">roar of a great crowd shouting could be heard faintly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How long do you think we have, Sir Philip, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore--before the end?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Eden calculated that within seven days we should</seg><seg type="columnLine">be subjected to unbearable heat, sir," said Villiers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But then there is no sure way of calculating, Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Villiers," spoke up Sir Philip, "because the earth no</seg><seg type="columnLine">longer conforms to any fixed standards.

I should like to watch their reactions to this</seg><seg type="columnLine">news, and get the results down on paper as a record,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even as Sir Philip says--for our successors."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think that your reactions would both be ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">normal, gentlemen," said the Premier. "Might I be</seg><seg type="columnLine">permitted to ask this lady her opinion?" he added,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowing to Phillipa.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The poor girl went as white as a sheet, and my</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart went out to her.

"You were noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing but an innocent onlooker--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somehow, at that moment, the absurdity of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole argument struck me. Here we were, four men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one girl, bickering over trifles of no importance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whilst the most stupendous danger that ever threatened</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth was rushing upon us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let us tell the people at once," I said, "It is only</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair to them.

Our car was still standing in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shadow of the Cenotaph, and it was at this spot that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Villiers and I bade each other farewell. Before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">parted, we each made a solemn promise to meet in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eden's cave once again before the end.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In three days' time or less, the heat will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">428</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">driven all people underground," I prophesied morbid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly.

And then, his sardonic smile breaking out</seg><seg type="columnLine">all over his face, he extended his hand and gripped</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine. "I wish you the best of luck, old man."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then he was gone, and Phillipa and I were</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. I took the wheel of the car and sped out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vast Metropolis, with its myriads of living dead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and out into the comparative freshness of the country.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But even here a hot breeze fanned our faces as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the City behind us, and presently I brought the</seg><seg type="columnLine">car to a standstill. I turned to the girl, so still and</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent by my side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Darling," I whispered, "will you marry me, now?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw my answer in her eyes, and put my arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">around her and held her very close to me. And even</seg><seg type="columnLine">while we sat there, a chill rustling, like the gaunt</seg><seg type="columnLine">herald of death, swept through the trees and grass.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sun sank suddenly, without warning, behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But I knew that in a few brief hours it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise again, and with awful majesty, grip the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth in its fiery mantle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOW that I try to record the events subsequent</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the forecasting of the calamity by the press</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world, I find myself strangely bewildered</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to what actually did transpire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Phillipa and I were married the next day by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">perspiring and very much frightened minister, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought us quite mad.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had five and a half hours of darkness before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun rose again, and this time, although the evil</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not yet upon us, its actuality could no longer be</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubted. When the truth was broadcast in the papers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the ordinary affairs of men were discarded. Every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one joined in a growing discussion as to the possi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bility of the oncoming catastrophe. The ordinary hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man intelligence still refused to credit the truth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">such impending danger.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whilst a large majority were sceptical, there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">some who from the start became panic-stricken. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried to sell their businesses. All the big factories</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut down. Heat made it impossible to continue their</seg><seg type="columnLine">operation. A riotous spending of money was appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ent everywhere.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first signs of universal lamentation, horror, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">panic came on the morrow, with the first sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain. Evidently we had already come within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun's influence, although the mass of the earth must</seg><seg type="columnLine">still have been tending to draw away from the solar</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravitatio lal pull, for some component in the air dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared, Inaking the atmosphere dry and unpleasant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and causing an irritation in the throat and breast</seg><seg type="columnLine">whenever one took a breath. A wild fury came over</seg><seg type="columnLine">all men. All that was bestial, all that was cowardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and craven, and conversely, all that was pure and fine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made itself manifest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the morning of that eventful day I was awakened</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the rays of the sun pouring in at my window. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was conscious at once of an unpleasant closeness in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air. My skin was dry and my head ached. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear the racing blood pulsing through my sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem, and I realized that my blood pressure must be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">abnormally high. I was very thirsty and jumped out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bed to get a drink.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was at that moment that the increasing magni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tude of the sun was brought home to me. It faced</seg><seg type="columnLine">us now like a vast sea of flame, stretching like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curve of a rainbow from end to end of the horizon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With unspeakable horror clutching at my breast I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a huge flickering, giving the illusion of clouds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke passing in front of a bright light, obscured its</seg><seg type="columnLine">face partly from us. A wild terror possessed me, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ran, like the coward I was, back into my bedroom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gazed frantically down at the sleeping figure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Phillipa, my wife. I ground my teeth in helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury, as I noted the quick unhealthy rise and fall of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her bosom, the flushed look on her face, and the dry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of her skin. For the first time in many years I</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell on my knees, as millions of others were doing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time, and besought God to avert this calamity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a couple of hours the heat became unbearable in</seg><seg type="columnLine">our room. I carried all the available food and water</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could find, down into Eden's cave, the place where</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eden had first show Villiers and me the infernal</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine which was now causing all the trouble. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cooler there than anywhere else, the only out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">let being through the opening in the roof, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we could just see the tops of the two trees in'</seg><seg type="columnLine">the garden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One thing I had noted on my way past the windows</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the dining-room overlooking the lawn and garden.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was the wild luxuriance of foliage which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst out upon every growing thing. The leaves were</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully out upon every tree. The grass was partially</seg><seg type="columnLine">withered. Small growing weeds made their appearance</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the walls, on flower pots, and even through crevices</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the stone walls and courtyard. Also the air was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with flies of all sorts, and lice and insects in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fested every room on the ground floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We spent the greater part of the day in the cave,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the earth cracked and yawned above us. I ven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured out after sunset, as the sun had finished its now</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost headlong descent below the horizon. I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly prostrated by the high temperature. A vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">billowy cloud of smoke hung over the fields about a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile to our left, and a sudden premonition warned me</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the proximity of fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I recollected, however, that if there was any fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">of fire, Phillipa and I were in the safest possible place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the smoke and flames would pass over us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During the night, a long line of automobiles, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lamps twinkling like speckled eyes through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">veil of smoke and darkness, roared along the highway</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the house. They carried people from the Metrop-</seg><seg type="columnLine">olis, who were fleeing to the country, where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagined they would find some sort of shelter from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next day witnessed our first sight of death.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The carcasses of small birds lay on the withered</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. Unmentionable orgies took place on the streets</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in the country meadows. We heard later that</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was rioting in the Metropolis. Streets were</seg><seg type="columnLine">set on fire. The looting of food shops and grocery</seg><seg type="columnLine">stores was universal. Crime and iniquity held their</seg><seg type="columnLine">grim sway over all. The Churches also were filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">to capacity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THROUGHOUT that awful time Phillipa and I sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">side by side in Eden's cave; There was both</seg><seg type="columnLine">faith and confidence in the quietness of her eyes, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I found much solace in her presence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't believe God will allow such a thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen, dear," she remarked quietly that afternoon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">TEN DAYS TO LIVE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">429</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"There is too much goodness in the world for Him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to wish to destroy it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While I was near her, I felt reassured. But when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was alone for a moment I had a dire foreboding. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of Villiers' ironical face, and I could not for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the day we were out together on one of our nu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merous explorations through the slums, when he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">quoted rather aptly, pointing out the terrible living</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions of some of the people--"If God loved us</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, He wouldn't have made so many of us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the morning of the fourth day, I knew that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end could not be far off. The magnitude and glory of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun was chimerical. From one end of the Heavens</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the other, it stretched, a molten hell of blinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame. During the night, Phillipa and I had crawled</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of our cave for a minute to gape, amazed, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marvelous spectacle of Venus and Mercury, the former</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming with an intense white light in the Heavens,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as large as our own Moon usually appeared to us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The latter lay well down on the horizon, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">made invisible to us as the sun rose, on account of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">proximity to the solar body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the very early morning (if it can be called morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing) of the fourth day, an indistinct roaring sound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like the "voice of many waters" became audible. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaves were withered off the trees, and all animal life</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be extinct. Not a sound could be heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the ground above us. Only from the pigeon</seg><seg type="columnLine">house came a persistent cooing sound, which, had I</seg><seg type="columnLine">been mentally alert, I would have recognized at once</seg><seg type="columnLine">for what it really was. But my senses were half</seg><seg type="columnLine">dazed, and I had long ago given up any hope of locat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the machine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some tivo hours after the sun rose on that day, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard a muffled sound from the stone stairway lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down the passage into our retreat. Hastily re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">assuring Phillipa, I advanced cautiously towards the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wooden door admitting us to the passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was Villiers.' He had kept his promise. But at</seg><seg type="columnLine">what a cost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I did not recognize him immediately, for in three</seg><seg type="columnLine">days, his hair had turned entirely white. He seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin and emaciated to the point of dissolution. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes glowed with the wild fear of a soul in mortal</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror of the Unknown. His clothes were torn and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smeared with blood. He gave a feeble cackle when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw me, and then collapsed like a sack of bones on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sandy floor of the cave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick, dear, water," I gasped to Phillipa, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a cup and filled it from our precious store. Sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porting his head upon her lap, she dipped her hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">kerchief into the fluid and squeezed it between his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sucked at it like a madman, and half way through</seg><seg type="columnLine">it I saw him stop, and catch hold of her hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God bless you," he mumbled, and I saw Phillipa</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn away. It was the first time I had ever heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">Villiers use the name of the Deity to express the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">which was within him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later on he told us of what was happening in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Metropolis. On the first day, as has been mentioned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all business ceased. On the second day looting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rioting broke out, and all thoughts of law and order</seg><seg type="columnLine">were flung to the winds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gaspard," he said, clinging to my arm, "I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen people do things, which I pictured as possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">only in my wildest dreams. The downright goodness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of some people--there were people dying every moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">to save others pain and misery. I would never have</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed that human nature was so sound fundamen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tally. And the Churches--they're full all the time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He smiled grimly to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You were right, Gaspard old friend," he choked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gripping my hand, "you were right after all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE sun sank in a blaze of glory. Two hours after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards, we crawled out into the open. Even then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ground was so scorched that we could scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear the heat through our shoes. Tremendous clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of smoke obscured the view of everything around us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The roaring sound had grown in volume, so that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">became a persistent and terrifying drone. From end</seg><seg type="columnLine">to end of the horizon there blazed an ominous flicker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of red.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tonight will be the last night," Villiers remarked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I realized that moment that never in this world</seg><seg type="columnLine">would he lose his ironical sense of humor. "It seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">funny to think that we'll all be dead by this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomorrow, doesn't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you think that the end will be sudden?" I in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired, much in the same tone that I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked him to pass the sugar two weeks ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I think," he replied, after a minute's cogitation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"that unless we collide with something before tomor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row morning, there will be a universal conflagration</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . My God, won't the heat be awful?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We looked round and became silent as Phillipa ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached. She came up to us both and laid a soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand on our shoulders. Overnight Phillipa, the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, had become Phillipa, the woman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dear men," she said, "you have both been very</seg><seg type="columnLine">good to me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We talked for a little while then, and afterwards</seg><seg type="columnLine">descended below to make our peace with the Almighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the dawn came. It was while we were descend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the stairs from the hallway to the corridor lead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the cave that Villiers slipped, and fractured a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone in his leg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We made him as comfortable as we could, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in great pain, and groaned for much of the night.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a while he went off into a feverish doze.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The minutes dragged by, and the dawn must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been very near. I think Phillipa and I realized this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for we drew closer together, and I put my arms round</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. Presently she dozed, too, but I remained nervous-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly alert, and found myself staring insanely at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleft through the dome of the ceiling, watching . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">watching for the first signs of sunrise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I gazed I think that my mind must have wan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered, for extraordinary thoughts and even visions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as they say come to a man in the throes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowning, assailed me. I thought of the antiquity of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this old world of ours, and of the immense time--</seg><seg type="columnLine">scientists say that it is ten million years--which went</seg><seg type="columnLine">into its evolution. Even of the solar system, I knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth to be a minor member. Compared with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stellar universe we were only an ulta-microscopic</seg><seg type="columnLine">speck. The composition of our lithosphere told a story</seg><seg type="columnLine">of unremitting change. We were always changing and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it might even be possible that this would be the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">great change of all--that we were to become in some</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious way, affiliated with the sun--to become</seg><seg type="columnLine">literally Sun-Gods. For since the very beginning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our being, the sun had been with us, working on our</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface. In the misty dimness of the pre-cambrian era,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun had shone down upon the sea-plants, sponges,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and worms which formed the sole inhabitants of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth at that time. And so through the palaeozoic era,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the humble crustacea, first land plants and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sects appeared; when during the Silurian era fishes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and amphibia made their appearance; when reptiles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">provided with rocks by the carboniferous era, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">menced to crawl; when birds and flowering plants were</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to exist through the Jurassic and Cretaceous</seg><seg type="columnLine">430</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES QUARTERLY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">periods; and when Mammalia commenced to multiply</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . through all these eras, through many millions</seg><seg type="columnLine">of years, the sun had done its faithful duty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For, by the light of the sun, those changes were ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complished which enabled life to evolute. And there</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be no doubt that the first man, primitive crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture though he must have been, sunned himself in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gentle solar heat, and afterwards worshipped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">source of much life and light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PERHAPS, as all these thoughts flashed through my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, I realized that we were not meant to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">snuffed out of existence like this. The sun's job was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not yet finished. Science, working hand in hand with</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth, had many more things to accomplish . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">And even while I was dreaming thus, a pale, fiery tint</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot across the sky. It was the last of the day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that moment also my eyes became rivetted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">amazement on the Heavens above me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As I said before, I could see the tops of two trees</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my recumbent position in the cave. One of</seg><seg type="columnLine">these trees, the one on which the pigeon cote was</seg><seg type="columnLine">built, seemed to be swaying dangerously. It was as</seg><seg type="columnLine">if something or somebody were attempting to climb</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the trunk, but had not the strength to do so.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While I was staring at this, I became suddenly aware</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I could still hear the faint persistent cooing of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pigeons within. It was not exactly a cooing, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">now as I listened more closely, it began to resemble</seg><seg type="columnLine">a low humming sound, a low drone, like the buzzing</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a giant bee.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">In a flash ... I knew! It was the humming</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . it was the buzzing--for I knew that no crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture could live in that terrific heat--it was the dron-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of machinery. In that cote, up that tree was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hidden the machine, the machine that could save the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gripped Phillipa in a clasp of iron. She opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes in terror, and shrank away from such ve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hemence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "God give me strength, Phillipa," I gasped, for it</seg><seg type="columnLine">had become suddenly very hot. "Fve got to climb</seg><seg type="columnLine">that tree."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw the frantic look of incredulity on her face</seg><seg type="columnLine">change to something else. She thought I was a mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dear heart," I whispered, for my breath was wheez-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from me in my excitement, "I'm not mad. You've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to help me climb that tree. The machine is in</seg><seg type="columnLine">that tree."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw scepticism wrestling with conviction in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes. And then I saw that conviction had won. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose to her feet and we rushed giddily together to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wards the stairs leading up to the hallway. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">then we both stopped together, petrified, frozen to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot with terror. For facing us from the doorway,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leering at us diabolically with bloodshot eyes, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greely--Greely the madman, murderer of Eden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Phillipa shrank back with a scream of horror. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood, with beating heart, and faced the madman. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that he would have a maniac's strength, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">my feeble efforts against his would be useless. I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never been robust at the best of times, and this man's</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength would now be equal to two men. My only</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope lay in Villiers' steely wiriness. And Villiers lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a broken leg--helpless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Phillipa's scream had aroused him, and he had raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself on one arm, and was trying to scare Greely</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his terrible eyes. But the man was too demented</seg><seg type="columnLine">now to be frightened by anything less than brute</seg><seg type="columnLine">force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I've got you- now--all of you," he shrieked in de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">moniacal fury. "You thought you had me--but I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got the lot of you now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Villiers, old man," I said in as natural a tone as</seg><seg type="columnLine">I could muster. "I have discovered that the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">is in the pigeon house up the tree. Phillipa will help</seg><seg type="columnLine">you climb while I head him off from the doorway. Try</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slip through when I engage him, and I will keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">him down here if I can."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I saw Phillipa, out of the corner of my eye, for I</seg><seg type="columnLine">never stopped watching Greely, cross over to Villiers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he groaned as she helped him to his feet. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I sprang blindly at Greely and felt for his throat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as we closed, I knew that his maniac's</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength would be too much for me. To and fro we</seg><seg type="columnLine">swayed. He forced me back on the floor, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">great fetid hands tore at my throat. But I saw Vil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liers and Phillipa slip through the doorway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I had Greely's shaggy hair in both hands now, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I held on to it with all my might. I felt it rip and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tear as it came out in handfuls. But still I held on</seg><seg type="columnLine">with all my strength, for upon my grip depended the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate of the entire world ... I held on until my</seg><seg type="columnLine">sight grew dim, and until little sparks of light danced</seg><seg type="columnLine">before my eyes, and a vast humming filled my ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . preceding oblivion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SUBCONSCIOUSLY I knew that the sun had risen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the hand of the Almighty was upon us!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Across the sky from horizon to horizon, for the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time in the history of the world, the vast aura of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaseous flame which girdles the sun, could be seen.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But still, for some marvelous reason, the earth con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinued to pull away from the sun, so that if the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the machine was throttled, there was a chance that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we should swing very rapidly back into our orbit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An unbearable heat burst upon us. ' Perspiration</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst out upon me. My body grew limp, and so did</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of my adversary. A furious delirium possessed</seg><seg type="columnLine">me' as I heard the sound of the beating of my own</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. I caught a glimpse through a red mist of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">black figure swaying backwards and forwards on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of the tree outside the cave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> . . . Suddenly Greely was thrown violently from</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Like a catapult he was precipitated against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocky walls of the cave, and I heard his skull crack</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a nut. A cataclysmic convulsion shook the earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">â¢The ground beneath my feet trembled, and I heard a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great moaning like the rush of a mighty wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Sick and giddy, I turned my eyes towards the ceil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. I saw that the pigeon cote had been battered</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, and that a torn and shapeless thing, oddly like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">figure of a man, hung from the tangled tatter of glit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering bulbs and globes suspended from the tree . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">Villiers had fulfilled his last great trust faithfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">. . . And I knew also that we were saved . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved! And I fainted away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When I came to, I was still lying on the floor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cave. A great quiet surrounded me, but above,</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the vent in the dome of the ceiling, I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear a rushing, dripping sound. It was raining out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, and it continued to rain for three whole days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Somehow I managed to stagger up those steps and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fetch Phillipa's inert body into the dryness of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cave.

Keep it up. I note</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is not quite as far behind time as the first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I believe you will soon catch up, and get all</seg><seg type="columnLine">editions of it out on time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Following is in discussion of the contents of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first (Winter) edition:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The best story, to my young mind was "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Moon of Doom"; it certainly was an aid to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">vocabulary, and there was not a dry moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its reading. Best of luck to Mr. Bell. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">story had just about the right length for a tale</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its kind, I think. The science in its was excel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent, especially the treatment of the atmospheric</seg><seg type="columnLine">cone between the moon and earth. But how would</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moon's approach to the earth cause the latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">to speed up on its axis? I think the increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">tidal drag would cause the opposite effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When the Sleeper Wakes" came, in a closo</seg><seg type="columnLine">second; Mr. Wells was at his best in it. The idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Moving Ways must certainly be very good,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since a number of your other authors have fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> â¢'The Atomic Riddle" was a great help in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">chemistry. (I'm taking it at the Senior High,</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, and it brushed up my knowledge of atomic</seg><seg type="columnLine">characteristics and structure.)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Golden Vapor" was a little drawn out</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the action, but it seemed to _ fit in anyway.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While the purpose of the hero is the same ps</seg><seg type="columnLine">in "Radio Mates," the treatment is entirely dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Puzzle Duel" and "The Terrors of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Upper Air" were btfh intensely interesting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now, ye second edition falls under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hatchet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The best story in it, and the best story I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">read since "The Moon Pool" is "The Second</seg><seg type="columnLine">Swarm" of Mr. Schlossel. It is a distinct de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parture from the ordinary stories of that kind.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For this reason it seems much more plausible</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the other stories I have read of the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">type. The bringing in of music made it entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautiful, for I sense a close connection between</seg><seg type="columnLine">music and the thoughts. The last two motifs</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the overture to ''William Tell" seem to fit</seg><seg type="columnLine">in particularly well here, especially the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the last. You have heard these, I am cer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain, and a little listening on the phonograph wÂ«H</seg><seg type="columnLine">bear out what I mean. Again I wish to commend</seg><seg type="columnLine">the author. Long live Mr. Schlossel I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A Modern Atlantis" was a close runner-up. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be the most likely story of all of them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The idea of releasing protons for the purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">has not been ventured upon by any other author</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my knowledge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The Vibrntor of Death" came next as an ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sorbing short story. The paragraph on the effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rapid vibration on the heart was tho best fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of the story in my estimation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now, "The Nth Man" of Mr. Flint. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">an entirely original piece, although I expected</seg><seg type="columnLine">it to be somewhat like Mr. Wertenbaker's ''The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man From the Atom," but it was entirely dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent. Hero arc a few questions on certain fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures of Mr. Flint's story:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Mr. Pendleton Â£"The Nth Man") reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">a weight of a few hundred tons, how was he</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, to obtain his supply of chemicals for sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taining the glandular stimulus causing his pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">digious growth? A probable answer might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">that these chemicals were cheap and common. Also,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he becamc a few miles in height, wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice bccomo proportionately low in pitch so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it would sound not like ordinary speaking as</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard through an amplifier, but like a scries of</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific bursts of thunder, with no intelligible</seg><seg type="columnLine">words? But enough of that. It is sufficient to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say that the story beats any I have read for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time, and it is due for many more readings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mr. Vcrrill's "The King of the Monkey Men"</seg><seg type="columnLine">was better than many of his stories, even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">it resembled "Through the Crater's Rim" some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">what.
