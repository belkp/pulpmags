Since I became a grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, I worked a year on the section at $1.10</seg><seg type="columnLine">per day, but my railroad life terminated in</seg><seg type="columnLine">1894, as a result of the Pullman strike.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There is as much difference between riding</seg><seg type="columnLine">on a locomotive and in a passenger-coach as</seg><seg type="columnLine">there is between a saddle horse and an auto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobile.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly jumped with delight at the thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">not going out on her, but my relief was short-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived, for in about fifteen minutes the call-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy knocked at the door and said that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">train was being held an hour, and that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">regular man had decided to lay off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The danger really was ahead of me all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, which explains why I did not feel re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved even after the other fellow had report-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed.

Three generations of escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the wholesome physical stimulus of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">anvil and the plow had dwarfed his body</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sharpened his wits more than "goff," on</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand, and bulldog pipes filled with over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rented tobacco, on the other, could counter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">act in one generation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Filled with the petty prejudices of school</seg><seg type="columnLine">and campus, he was now being badly upset</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the stirring, practical applications of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurrying life about him.

It might take some</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambling, but it could be done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The order was even then being shoved</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the shops. It called for half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">widely divergent types, from switch-engines</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a Mallet articulated compound; but, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">regularly as clockwork, four engines were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being shoved out into the world each day. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked William Dalton, the chief consulting</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineer, how this rush order could be filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">so readily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Saving Time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Half the work was already done before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the order came in," he replied. " They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to take our standardized types, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">saved two-thirds of the time. As soon as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">order arrived it was possible to turn the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the shops directly over to it. Time is</seg><seg type="columnLine">consumed not only in the actual construction</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the engines, but in planning them out on</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper. If conditions on all railroads were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same, so that they could all use a limited</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of established models, the manufac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture of locomotives would be as quick and</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy as the movement of one machine. As it</seg><seg type="columnLine">is, however, every railroad has particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">conditions to meet and presents certain speci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fications. To meet these requirements an</seg><seg type="columnLine">engineering department of 500 men is neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary. We have filed away in our library</seg><seg type="columnLine">over 100,000 variations in the types of en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gines.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Sometimes the variations are small, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times great, but a locomotive is such a per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fectly balanced structure that a change in</seg><seg type="columnLine">any part means the readjustment of the whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">locomotive. Our ordinary orders require</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">weeks of figuring before the work begins,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and in some cases the plans for a locomotive</seg><seg type="columnLine">remain months in the- drafting-room be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore they are turned over to the shops. When</seg><seg type="columnLine">C. J. Mellin evolved the first big Mallet that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ever built, he figured on it steadily for</seg><seg type="columnLine">five months before he was able to get the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper adjustment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " When he had finished he had found a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to distribute the weight evenly between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward and the rear drivers. But, when a</seg><seg type="columnLine">railroad orders Mallets and asks for changes</seg><seg type="columnLine">here and there, it is necessary to figure the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole engine in its every part to bring that</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight distribution just right."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He led the way into a big room where</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of his staff were at work over desks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">figuring sizes, weight, and strength.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Those men," he said, " are all laying out</seg><seg type="columnLine">an engine. Each of the three hundred in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this room has a share in it, and the thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all are constantly centered on the final</seg><seg type="columnLine">result.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Outside in the shops you will find the</seg><seg type="columnLine">counterpart of each one of these men, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be a hammer, machine, or forge. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">man in this room must make his part fit into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole to meet the exact requirements of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the engineer in charge of the work. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same way the product of each hammer, ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chine, and forge must be exactly right when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it arrives at the assembling-floor where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">engines are put together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In a hurry order this half of the work</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been done. It probably took months of</seg><seg type="columnLine">figuring to arrive at the model used, but it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">all on record. To start the work it is only</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessary to send out the blue-prints to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shop and the order-books to the purchasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">agents. That is why we can make locomo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tives while you wait."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But, since this preliminary work is essen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tial, I stopped to learn how it was done be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore following the rush order in its rapid</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress through the shops.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Plans and Specifications.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Orders are all received through the New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York office, and are forwarded immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the engineering department at Schenectady,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which plans the work for the ten separate</seg><seg type="columnLine">shops operated by the company. With each</seg><seg type="columnLine">order comes specifications made by the rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">road, and it is very seldom that two railroads</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the same demands. Three things de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cide the size and form: the grades on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">road, the speed required, and the weight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trains the locomotives will have to haul.</seg><seg type="columnLine">LOCOMOTIVES WHILE YOU WAIT.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">407</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Orders of any size are rarely- all for one</seg><seg type="columnLine">type of engine. In an order for thirty loco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">motives there will probably be five or six</seg><seg type="columnLine">different styles, and, in the case of each, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">far as the engineering department's labor is</seg><seg type="columnLine">concerned, there is as much work, as if each</seg><seg type="columnLine">style were a distinct order by itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each requires an entirely separate set of</seg><seg type="columnLine">figures. Roughly, the chief points covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">are. the weight of the engine, the diameter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cylinders, the stroke of the piston, the size</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wheels that can go with these specifi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cations, and the boiler capacity to furnish</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam for cylinders of that size.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Each set of these figures must bear an ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">act relation to all the others, and no one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them can be absolutely determined upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the start. The only fixed considerations</seg><seg type="columnLine">are the physical features of the railroad for</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the engine is intended. These cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">be changed. The grades must be coped with,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the railroad has determined on the size</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trains and the speed at which it expects</seg><seg type="columnLine">•them to travel.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In making this nice adjustment, and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same time getting all the power and speed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the railroad requires, there is always the</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger of putting too great a weight on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">axles. Aside from this, the ei\gineers always</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeed in meeting the specifications, but to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do so requires a corps of high-priced con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sulting engineers. Whenever an order comes</seg><seg type="columnLine">in requiring a variation in type, Dalton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their chief, assigns to one of them the duty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of arriving at the desired end as best he can.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This happened in the case of the first big</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mallet referred to.

Under the strong light shining down</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bodies are distorted and dwarfed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is hard to believe that they are menjnaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast iron. Even later, after the strange in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluence of the light on the dust has gone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the castings arrive at the assembling-</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, they bring back vividly the picture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their origin, and seem hardly to have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">made by human hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All that was gigantic in those two sheds</seg><seg type="columnLine">becomes but a background, however, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment you step into the boiler-shed. Scat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered thickly over the whole extensive floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface lie hundreds of boilers in every stage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of construction, from the solid sheets of steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the completed structures, with the hoods</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, tubes fitted, and fire-boxes attached, wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to receive their numberless fittings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">In the Boiler-Shed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The impression you get is that of a vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">collection of shells of some prehistoric lobster</seg><seg type="columnLine">bigger than a mammoth, and that ruled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land and sea. If the billets of steel and iron</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave a sense of power derived from the earth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">these huge boiler-shells increase it a hundred-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fold.

Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">I began to realize that I was in a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate corner than I had at first imagined.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was evidently a burglar who had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper tools, for the lamp was one of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, round - shaped affairs that have an</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric attachment and throw a small pierc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing bull's-eye light as steadily as a ray of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the darkness, I could feel my assail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ant.

It was a sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear voice--a voice that I had not heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">before.

It was evident</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he had been running fast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What you got to say, Len," said the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marshal, addressing the newcomer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe this man--and furthermore, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a fellow riding down the pike at a pret-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty fast gait just a while ago.

The marshal lost no time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">making his escape. He rushed over to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own home, and, in the early dawn, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">was now just breaking, he could see that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">white mare, which usually had the run of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small corral, was missing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I gave as good a description of the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">as I could, and he was immediately recog-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nized by Clawson. Then a posse was formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the bunch set out in the early morning</seg><seg type="columnLine">light to run down the robber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They followed the road as far as the near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est village--a distance of six miles--only to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find the marshal's mare, foam-flecked and</seg><seg type="columnLine">panting, standing by the roadside. Nobody</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that village had heard anything of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">robbery or seen the man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only reason that could be given for</seg><seg type="columnLine">his escape was that he had arrived in time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch a freight that was just pulling out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They brought the mare home and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">marshal was satisfied as to my innocence.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But I could only think of the nine dollars</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had gone and wondered why fate had</seg><seg type="columnLine">willed to treat me so harshly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clawson, instead of turning me out on a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold world, gave me a job in his kitchen</seg><seg type="columnLine">" till something better turned up," as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">put it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I took the place gladly, for I was strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">and willing. But the work was of the filthi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est nature imaginable.

I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">always wanted to go to San Francisco, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I learned that I could get a tourist's ticket</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the California city for the sum of eighteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clawson was paying me the joyful wage</seg><seg type="columnLine">of three dollars a week, and I figured that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I held onto the job assiduously for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">period of three months, I would save up</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to buy the ticket to San Francisco</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a new suit of store clothes, so as to arrive</seg><seg type="columnLine">there looking somewhat respectable. Once I</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck that wonderful Western metropolis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought, I could get a start and make a</seg><seg type="columnLine">future.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> T worked as carefully as a man knew how.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I scrubbed the floors of Clawson's hotel as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had never been scrubbed before.

In other words, suspension</seg><seg type="columnLine">by record instead of actual suspension. The record</seg><seg type="columnLine">is in the form of demerits, and the system as a whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">is very similar to the form of discipline employed in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the public schools. To simplify: When a road</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally decides to inaugurate the Brown system, every</seg><seg type="columnLine">employee has his past offenses forgiven and every</seg><seg type="columnLine">employee affected by the system starts with what is</seg><seg type="columnLine">called a "perfect" record.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If a breach of rule should occur, the offending</seg><seg type="columnLine">party, after investigation, is penalized with a num-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber of demerit marks on his record equal to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravity of the case. For instance, leaving a termi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nal without examining to note whether the tender-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tank contained water, might result in five demerits</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the engineer's record, if a subsequent delay en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sued. Running by a train standing at a station on</seg><seg type="columnLine">a double-track road might be punished by ten de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">merits, and so on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Brown system does not extend to shopmen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but includes practically every one in the train serv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice on the roads where it is employed. As a rule,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the record contains fifty demerits the man is</seg><seg type="columnLine">warned, and when one hundred demerits are in evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence he is dismissed from the service. The sys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tem is also retroactive, as every year with clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">records effaces so many demerits--say six or even</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten--and thus the incentive is afforded for a man to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">wipe out previous bad marks. By this elimination</seg><seg type="columnLine">process it is possible to return to a "clear" rec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ord, but it is not possible to return to a "perfect"</seg><seg type="columnLine">record, as the latter is one which has never had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark set against it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Brown system, of which the above is the gen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eral outline, has been extensively employed by rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads of this country.

He lost his</seg><seg type="columnLine">temper, made overtures to fight his baiters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">frothed at the mouth, grew hectic with rage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had other symptoms of disintegration,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all of which was greeted with " Whoop!

That would be eight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">een times the horse-power of the heaviest</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the New York Central's new electric loco-</seg><seg type="columnLine">motives, which are among the most powerful</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their kind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Her Great Speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for the speed with which this vast mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">of steel will travel, it is built to make twen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty-one knots an hour, which is the equivalent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of about twenty-four miles. But it is ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected by the authorities that it will exceed</seg><seg type="columnLine">this speed, just as the North Dakota did</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she actually developed 22.25 knots.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps the Florida, which is designed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be three knots faster than her predecessor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">may develop up to twenty-five knots an hour,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would mean the equivalent of twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nine or thirty miles. When one considers</seg><seg type="columnLine">that such a great weight is being propelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">through a very dense medium--water--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparison of speed between a battle-ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a locomotive is not so greatly to the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage of the battle-ship, after all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These comparisons will add interest to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">story of the putting together of such a huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass of steel and iron as the Florida. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was an undertaking that could have been ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complished at only a very few places in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. In some respects it was similar to</seg><seg type="columnLine">assembling the parts of a great locomotive,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though it took over a year to do it, and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quired a much more expensive plant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps the most crucial moment was</seg><seg type="columnLine">when this terrific mass slid down her mam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moth tracks into the water at the Brooklyn</seg><seg type="columnLine">Navy-Yard «pn May 12. From the very out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">set, those vital seconds had to be considered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nowadays, the launching of a great ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">has to be figured out completely, long before</seg><seg type="columnLine">a single rivet is driven home, just as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tractive effort and weight on the drivers of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">locomotive are known before a dollar is laid</seg><seg type="columnLine">out on her. Every contingency must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">guarded against, for the sagging of an inch</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this critical moment would endanger, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">not ruin, the ship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE GREATEST BATTLE-SHIP IN THE WORLD.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">433</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Therefore, first of all, the ground under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Florida was made as solid as that under</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sky-scraper, or the great new terminals of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the New York Central or Pennsylvania, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">New York. This was accomplished by dri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ving in heavy piling, and the use of plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of concrete and masonry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  On this base the keel-blocks were laid at</seg><seg type="columnLine">intervals of three or four feet, rising at what</seg><seg type="columnLine">a railroad man would consider a frightful</seg><seg type="columnLine">grade from the water's edge--thirty-five feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in less than six hundred. That brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bow, which pointed inshore, high up in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air. The keel-plates were laid upon these</seg><seg type="columnLine">keel-blocks, together with the parts immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately connected with them, like a great back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Next the giant steel frames and ribs</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemingly sprouted out from the keel over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night.

The air</seg><seg type="columnLine">resounded with a rat-tat-tat of pneumatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammers and the clink of bolts, as strip after</seg><seg type="columnLine">strip of steel was hoisted and fitted into</seg><seg type="columnLine">plape under the direction of the naval con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Forts Within a Fort.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gigantic traveling cranes, two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, which carried on this work were oper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ated along an aerial cantilever viaduct in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the open air, just as they are in a locomotive</seg><seg type="columnLine">or car shop. These great carriers had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoisting capacity that would enable them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pick up an ordinary locomotive and run</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with it, perhaps toss it in the sea at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sliore-end of the ship-yard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  To the ribs the binding ties of the bulk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads were riveted--the deck beams, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">various other parts. The heavy, red-painted</seg><seg type="columnLine">.steel plates of the hull, each lettered and</seg><seg type="columnLine">numbered, were swung, one by one, to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">appointed positions, sheathing this skeleton</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a skin of steel with almost magical quick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tremendous castings--such as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stem that gives shape to the prow, the stern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">post which carries the rudder, and the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peller-struts--were lifted into place and</seg><seg type="columnLine">riveted. Every one was as carefully tested</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the plates that go in to a boiler; they may</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to resist an even greater pressure some</seg><seg type="columnLine">day when one of those twelve-inch projec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiles come in a head-on collision.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Meanwhile, the double bottom was laid,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   4	RR</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the great bulkheads built up, and the many</seg><seg type="columnLine">compartments of the ship constructed. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the mass itself, like a tower, each turret</seg><seg type="columnLine">foundation rose upward to the level of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck.

Like all beginners at his trade,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had had an inordinate desire to adjust the</seg><seg type="columnLine">instrument when he first came to Hansen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but after Williams had come on duty three</seg><seg type="columnLine">mornings in succession to find every instru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment entirely out of any sensible adjustment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had cautioned Anderson rather sharply</seg><seg type="columnLine">about monkeying with the adjustment. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the weather was fast making them heavy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Anderson final]}- ventured to monkey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and succeeded in making it sound much</seg><seg type="columnLine">clearer.

Then he noticed it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiet. He tried to adjust that as he had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one upon which he was working. He tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulling it up, he tried turning it down: he</seg><seg type="columnLine">tried the magnets close; he tried them back;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in spite of all his efforts he couldn't make</seg><seg type="columnLine">it work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Yes, it's open, I guess," he said to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, and turned to the neglected wire at</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the chief was waiting.

The instruments chattered away</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowsily, the rain fell outside and streamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the window-pane, and soon William</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dobbs Anderson was nodding in his chair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By and by he slumped down on his folded</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms on the table and was fast asleep.

He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear the instruments as they pounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.

He tried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">shout to them to answer up, but try as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might he could not make a sound. Then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumped to his feet to go out and tell them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The movement woke him, and he found him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self back in the station at Hansen. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">one was calling HN steadily and persistently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He reached over and answered up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "93 coming yet?" was the query.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you sure they haven't passed?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Yes, sir."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When they come, give them the siding.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Be sure you don't let them get away from</seg><seg type="columnLine">you.

Anderson repeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">and got his " O. K." He noticed the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">order was directed to first No. 12 at Madison,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first station west of Hansen, a distance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">about twelve miles.

Then Latham, when he saw that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was nearing this fill, called the engineer's</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to some blue prints, and the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gineer, thinking that he would see this por-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of the track on his return, gave his at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tention to the prints.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Frank pulled her wide open and sailed</seg><seg type="columnLine">across that fill as though he had a solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock - ballasted track under him.

The value of rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roads as a medium of commercial communication</seg><seg type="columnLine">has not escaped the sagacity of Dr. Young.

The flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail, or tramroad, consists of cast-iron plates about</seg><seg type="columnLine">three feet long, four inches broad, and half an</seg><seg type="columnLine">inch or one inch thick, with a flattened or turned-</seg><seg type="columnLine">up edge on the inside to guide the wheels of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carriage. These plates rest at each end of stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleepers three hundred and four hunched weight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sunk into the earth, and they are joined into each</seg><seg type="columnLine">other so as to form a continuous horizontal path-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way. These, of course, are double, and the dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance between the opposite rails is from three to</seg><seg type="columnLine">four feet and a half, according to the breadth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the car or wagon to be employed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">      When wrought iron is used (which is found to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> be equally cheap, with cast metal, and greatly pref-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> erable in many respects), the bars are made of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> smaller size, of a wedge shape, and twelve or eight-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> een feet long, but they are supported by sleepers</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> at the distance of every three feet.

Then, quite as if the stumbling stran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger had no further interest for her, she turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">her glance out the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McMillin paused for a second, overcome</seg><seg type="columnLine">with surprise, then, with uncertainty and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fusion written large on his face, he went on</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the car.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gertrude breathed a long sigh.

Perhaps, she felt the mastery</seg><seg type="columnLine">that reached out and sought to claim her, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">steeled herself against it because she feared</seg><seg type="columnLine">its strength and charm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Tell me about--him," he directed when</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You tell me first where you are going,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she fenced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That doesn't matter," he replied; "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll tell.

It was Hiltz, all right,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he's suffering more right now than he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would behind the bars. He'll either kill him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self or get reckless and come back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A sudden recollection swept over me after</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had finished. I straightened in my chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The day before I sailed," I put in, "I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a man watching me in a little cafe near</seg><seg type="columnLine">the park. When I looked at him, I knew I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen him somewhere before. All the time</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was eating I was thinking like mad. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">it came to me. I got up and walked over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his table. ' You're Singleton, aren't you? ' I</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, holding out my hand. He stared at</seg><seg type="columnLine">me emptily, although his cheeks went very</seg><seg type="columnLine">white. ' You're mistaken in the party,' he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came back quickly. ' My name's Living-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone ! ' "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And you think it was Singleton?" It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the stranger who asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I was somewhat doubtful then, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after his denial, but I'm positive of it now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was tanned and smooth-faced, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't hide his eyes. He was once the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mayor of our city. Got into some graft deal</seg><seg type="columnLine">or other, and skipped."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The captain laughed shortly. " You run</seg><seg type="columnLine">across them all over. The woods are full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE LURE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">491</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">them. That makes me think of another fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low--John Warwick. Wonder I never came</seg><seg type="columnLine">across him. Maybe I did, though, and didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">recognize him. He's on the islands."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " And what was his offense? " The stran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger seemed interested. "Insurance deals?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No." The captain shook his head slow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, and appeared to be groping in the past</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the memory. "No; he was a pilot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Used to bring in the ships from the outer ha-r-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bor. One Sunday he brought in an excursion-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">you or me had a little kid on that boat--or a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wife--I'm thinking we'd forget and--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I interrupted. " But you said it was foggy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It might not have been neglect. We ought to</seg><seg type="columnLine">give him consideration, don't you think?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">The captain's big hand slapped to his knee.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" Warwick was drunk--dead drunk! " he</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I drew my feet down from the coil of rope.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A. puff of wind came from somewhere, bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ging the awning above us. I stared medita-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">" WARWICK WAS DRUNK--DEAD DRUNK!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">boat and ran it on some rocks. It was a lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle bit foggy, but that shouldn't have made</seg><seg type="columnLine">much difference to an old hand like Warwick.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anyhow, the boat went down, and half a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred were drowned. Warwick dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of sight, and everybody thought he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">drowned, too. Then one day a mate of mine</seg><seg type="columnLine">said he had talked with him in Honolulu.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Every time I'm in the town I keep my eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">peeled for him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " And what's the feeling against him at</seg><seg type="columnLine">home?" the stranger questioned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, as a general thing, we don't jump</seg><seg type="columnLine">at conclusions. But it was a pretty hard blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">for some of the people. It was about as big</seg><seg type="columnLine">a crime as a man can commit, I'm thinking.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I suppose if he was to step ashore to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day there'd be something like a lynching.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The law's good enough in its way, but if</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tively across the white space, where a lamp</seg><seg type="columnLine">glowed amidship. Far up, toward the cabin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a door opened and shut, and a bar of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot obliquely over the deck. In another mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment the wireless operator came down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">addressed the captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Just picked up a message from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gladola, two days out from home. She'll be</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our radius for the next hour or so. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">said you wanted to speak to her."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Quite right." The captain lifted himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">erect. " You'll excuse me, gentlemen? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They walked away, the coatless, white-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shirted operator in the lead. I watched them</seg><seg type="columnLine">subconsciously, until the door opened and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slammed. Then the stranger moved in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chair, and spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " What do you think of this Warwick? " he</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">492</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I believe if he loved the city as you fel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lows seem to, he'd risk coming back."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I received no answer. Then curiously I</seg><seg type="columnLine">resumed:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what do you suppose would be his</seg><seg type="columnLine">greates't concern, once he left the island?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Capture? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't think so." The stranger spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">so queerly that I turned about in my chair.</seg><seg type="columnLine">" He would be fearful that he would not see</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city, after all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not see it? " I echoed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Yes." The man got to his feet, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tossed away the remaining part of -his ciga-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rette. I waited expectantly for him to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, but he did not. He stood for the inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">val, gazing far out over the black water, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, without another word, turned and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked up the deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The following day passed monotonously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it was at supper that I first caught sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the stranger. He appeared very nervous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and did not seem at all anxious to talk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You'll see home in the morning," I said</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopefully, as we were passing out. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he looked at me, and for the first time I no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticed how vague and dead his eyes were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I--hope so," he struggled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We foimd our chairs again, but somehow</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt no inclination to smoke. The air was</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely oppressive, and. seemed to fairly</seg><seg type="columnLine">choke one. The evening sky, too, took on an</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual pallor, I thought, and the long, un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">even waves that rocked away toward the hori-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zon were very high, very oily, and black.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " What time--are we due to-morrow ? " the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranger's voice broke into the hush.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Early. Some time about nine o'clock, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">should judge." And then, after a pause: " I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suppose the city will be changed--since you</seg><seg type="columnLine">last saw it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was surprised to find, his fingers on my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I hope not," he faltered. " I--hope not.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I want to see it -- just like when I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. I don't want to see a single thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed." His fingers tightened. "Heav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ens!" he breathed heavily. "To see the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old city again; to walk the street^, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowds; to hear all the old familiar voices,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to see the old familiar buildings--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings I have watched rise up from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vacant wastes; to feel the breeze from off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bay; to watch the ferries--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His voice trailed into a whisper, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear him breathe like a man who has</seg><seg type="columnLine">run a long distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dumbly I realized how he must have felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">and how inadequate his words were to ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">press it. And later, when I sought my state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room, I pondered deeply over the man's in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fatuation for his mother city, wondering what</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiar mysterious power it possessed to so</seg><seg type="columnLine">enslave its children.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was a long time in getting to sleep, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">my room was like an oven. Above me, on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shelf, droned an electric fan, but the air it</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred was stale and lifeless. However, aft-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er « time, I must have dozed off, for abruptly</seg><seg type="columnLine">my eyes snapped open, and I found the day-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light streaming in through the window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I dressed, and went out on deck. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">the possible exception of the watch, no one</seg><seg type="columnLine">was about. I paced up and down for a time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then, rooting my very feet to the deck, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the ship's operator leap grotesquely out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the cabin and lurch toward me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His face was pasty, and his eyes, staring</seg><seg type="columnLine">from tlicir sockets, were as hard and fixed as</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass. He was clad only in his pajamas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For love of Heaven!" he choked, as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">neared me. " I just picked up the first coast</seg><seg type="columnLine">wireless. .-The city--" He fumbled desper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately at his throat. And while he stood there</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasping I saw the figure of the stranger</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbing the short stairs toward us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Go on! Go on! " I urged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " The city--was destroyed--by'earthquake</seg><seg type="columnLine">--this morning!" the operator stammered</seg><seg type="columnLine">" She's in flames--burning--burning--abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely 110 hope left! Everything's gone! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With horror-stricken eyes, I saw the stran-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ger grope blindly for the hand-rail, choke</seg><seg type="columnLine">out something like a scream, and then crumple</seg><seg type="columnLine">limply to the deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stunned, yet retaining possession of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses, I managed to call one of the watch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and togedier we bore the unconscious man</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to his stateroom. With a queer lump in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my throat, I saw that his berth had not been</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After I had hurriedly bathed his head in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some cold water and unloosened his clothes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he finally came back to the world again. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">mumbled incoherently to himself, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">glassy eyes stared emptily at the ceiling.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " All--gone!

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He sat up rigidly, as if my words had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">a needle in his flesh, and instinctively I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I will be a man," he returned huskily--</seg><seg type="columnLine">" I will be a man.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaned against the rail of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, and watched the vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">cloud of smoke growing larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more terrifying, spread-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing from horizon to horizon</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a black pall. The cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain rushed back and forth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shouting incoherent orders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the white-faced, silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">crew obeyed mechanically.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While we were creeping in</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the dim shore -- for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the captain had announced</seg><seg type="columnLine">his intention of landing at the first conve-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nient dock inside the harbor -- and I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">huddled against the side of the pilot-house</seg><seg type="columnLine">in order to keep free from the suffocating</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke, I felt a hand on my arm, and, peer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing around, found Warwick beside me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " They're dying--dying," he mumbled over</seg><seg type="columnLine">and over like an automaton, and pointing</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his outstretched arm. "They're dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">--burning--all my people--all my city!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the smoke lifted a trifle, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship pushed her nose into a deserted dock,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warwick gave a cry and leaped from my side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I called to him frantically, but he kept on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unheeding. What sudden impulse guided</seg><seg type="columnLine">me I could not tell, but without a second</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought I followed him. He did not wait</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the plank to be lowered, but, climbing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rail like a cat, leaped upon the roof of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dock-shed, and dropped nimbly to the ground.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like a man possessed, I followed him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now that we were upon solid ground, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught up with him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where are you going?"

Father and daughter are badly injured. Pierre</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes them to his tent, but the old Indian is so seriously hurt that he dies, and Pierre is left with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl on his hands. A half-breed and an Indian appear at the camp. This half-breed, Simon, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the husband of Anne Marie's sister, but who, through his brutality, has killed his wife, is in love</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the girl, and tries to make Pierre give her up. This Pierre refuses to do, and the girl and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">scheme to escape in the canoe. It seems impossible, and, finally, Anne Marie, whose injuries are</seg><seg type="columnLine">very painful, endeavors to make Simon swear on the grave of her father that he will protect her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">take her to the home of her cousin, Antoine. Simon promises, but refuses to swear. He insults</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pierre, and a fight ensues, in which Pierre succeeds in felling the half-breed and, with the help of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl, binds him. Anne Marie, after damaging Simon's canoe in such a way that it will take some</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours to mend, helps Pierre and the Indian to pack their canoe, and she and Pierre start up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river, leaving the Indian to return and release Simon.

Anne Marie develops a high fever</seg><seg type="columnLine">which promises to delay the two in camp for some time.

With</seg><seg type="columnLine">the usual look around, to see that nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been forgotten, he took it up and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, followed by the girl who was carrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stove, and by Paddy, who was always at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anne Marie's heels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The way lay through a bit of fir and</seg><seg type="columnLine">spruce growth, emerging into an alder cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered bit, and then leading along shore, over</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hard rocky place where the footing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">none too secure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the left the water was boiling, a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">caldron of wild tearing waves splitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">thunderously against the jagged rocks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then smoothing down into great tourniquets</seg><seg type="columnLine">that deepened and filled up again at in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tervals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a grand sight, and for a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pierre stood on a rock protruding from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bank. He then took a long step to reach</seg><seg type="columnLine">another stone, but this moved under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight and he made a violent effort to gain</seg><seg type="columnLine">his footing farther on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He reached it but with the toe of his boot</seg><seg type="columnLine">and slipped, and in a moment the weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon his shoulders had borne him with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash into the wild water.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl shrieked as she saw him fall, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran down as fast as she could. She saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">him swept in the swirl of rough waters. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">canoe had fallen away from him and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">made an effort to grasp it, but it was whirled</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of his reach.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He struck for the shore, but the crushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of the water bore him under several</seg><seg type="columnLine">times. He came up gasping, but full of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight, and with a magnificent sweep of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strong arms neared the shore. A wave lifted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him like a feather and beat him down upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rock, and his bod}' seemed to become sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly limp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few yards farther down he was carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the branches of a big fir that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen in the water, with its roots still fast</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the bank.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anne Marie leaped upon the trunk and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped him by his coat-collar, pulling him</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with a strength that was marvelous to</seg><seg type="columnLine">behold. He helped himself a little, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally the two made their way to the bank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he sat under a tree, dazed, with blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">flowing from a big cut upon his forehead.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nearly a fair knock-out," he muttered;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and then, suddenly, the matter of greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">import came uppermost in his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Where's the canoe? " he cried, his voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">torn with anxiety.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Farther down, out in the rapids, the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">A HEART OF THE NORTH.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">505</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">craft had been jammed at the bow between</seg><seg type="columnLine">two rocks, and the sweep of the current was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forcing the stern around. They watched it</seg><seg type="columnLine">with beating hearts, for it was like a living</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that fought for its life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the roaring of the waters they heard</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing, but could imagine that it cracked</seg><seg type="columnLine">and moaned like a thing in pain. Gradually</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stern twisted around, farther and farther,</seg><seg type="columnLine">still resisting, and suddenly something gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">way, and the canoe broke in the middle, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a flash became a misshapen object, a mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">carcass, a few ribs of which were sticking</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of the water, which in a few minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">would complete its work of destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pierre had not felt the hurt he had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived. He was not even aware that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shivering witii the cold and with the shock</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his nerves. He merely sat there, looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the sad wreck out in the boiling river, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">significance of the accident gradually dawn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " How'll we get back now? " he asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">despondently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he sat there the girl stood before him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mopping his bloody forehead with the red</seg><seg type="columnLine">handkerchief she had taken from around her</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck. She had remained silent, and even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wreck of the canoe had taken her attention</seg><seg type="columnLine">for but a moment. She was looking at him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thankful that his life was saved, sorrowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was hurt, full of a deep concern for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Suddenly tears came in her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It is my fault," she said. " Perhaps we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have shot it from the other shore."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He looked at the wild water and shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head. Then his eyes fell upon her and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw her tears, and at once the sturdy</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength of his forefathers came back to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Never mind, ma petite," he said, " we</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have been drowned."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stopped to pat the dog's head. Paddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had his forefeet upon his knee, and was lick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Come," said Anne Marie, " we must light</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fire and get dry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He followed her, casting another look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bit of wreckage still jammed between two</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocks, and they quickly made their way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where all their baggage lay piled up, ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">for embarkation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had to open one of the bags to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">for matches, for the few Pierre had in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pockets were soaked. His teeth were chat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tering with the cold, but he took the ax and</seg><seg type="columnLine">chopped lustily. A great fire was soon burn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and its heat was grateful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stood before it, warming himself, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl sought out his few spare clothes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">While he put them on she boiled water for</seg><seg type="columnLine">tea and busied herself making camp. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">did it more rapidly than he could have man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In her hands the little ax hastily fashioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent-pegs, and before the kettle boiled their</seg><seg type="columnLine">little silken home was erected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It pleased her to wait upon him, and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">attentions were grateful. He sat down by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fire, with one of the blankets wrapped</seg><seg type="columnLine">around him. The wet clothes were hanging</seg><seg type="columnLine">on poles just near enough to the fire to dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">without burning. The scalding hot cup of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tea she handed him comforted him greatly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His hat had disappeared in the river, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">around his brow he wore the handkerchief</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which Anne Marie had stanched the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleeding.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She attempted to lift one of the heavy bags</seg><seg type="columnLine">within the tent, and gave a little cry of pain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It awakened him out of the sort of apathy</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which he had momentarily fallen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Don't move those bags, Anne Marie.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're not strong enough for that sort of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing yet."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I want to help," she answered sadly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You've helped enough, Ou - memeou.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You're a better fellow in the woods than</seg><seg type="columnLine">most men I've traveled with.

The ordinary</seg><seg type="columnLine">details of life must be attended to, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">meal had to be made ready.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Don't bother," he said.

I do not want to be despised."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You're a wonder, Ou-memeou. Please</seg><seg type="columnLine">yourself; but if you get sick again, don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">blame me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was laughing then; and she laughed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">50(3</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">too, for she was happy to see him himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " I'll have a great story to tell my friends,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he declared, " after I get back to stones and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brick."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She did not quite understand the latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of his sentence; but the mention of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">return to his friends seemed to hurt some</seg><seg type="columnLine">little sensitive fiber within her heart, for she</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit her lip and turned away quietly. Yes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would get away from this land of hers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to men and women of another world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she would see him no more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet it all seemed distant, like the death</seg><seg type="columnLine">that comes to all, or the end of the world</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had heard predicted. It saddened her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but gave no acute pain; it was one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard things of life, like the frost-bites of</seg><seg type="columnLine">winter and the hunger of barren places, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be endured when they come, a part of exist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For the rest of the day she turned her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands to every bit of work she could find to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. He wanted to get away, and she .would</seg><seg type="columnLine">help to the utmost; she owed 'him pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly all the kindness and gentleness she</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever met with, and was anxious to repay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At one time she was sewing rabbit-skins</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, and Paddy came up to her. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">master had wandered away in the woods to</seg><seg type="columnLine">set snares.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She took the dog's rough head in her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands, and put his cold nose against her</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheek.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You will go with him, Paddy, and I will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be all alone," she said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But the dog only wagged his stumpy tail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, hearing his master's footsteps, ran away</seg><seg type="columnLine">to him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As it began to grow dark, she spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> '' There are people waiting for you where</seg><seg type="columnLine">you live?" she inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Why, yes, my father and mother," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, " and I'm afraid they'll lie rather anx-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ious before they see me again."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " No wife and little children? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Why, no--I'm not married," he laughed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This seemed to cheer her up, for some rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son that she did not fathom, since, strange to</seg><seg type="columnLine">say, the idea had not at all materialized it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self in her mind that this man could ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">lielong to her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All that she knew was that she was happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his presence, and that his going away</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be a miserable ending tc a life that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her, was full of an ineffable charm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had both avoided the problem of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">future, but it had to be solved. They could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not remain where they were, and some means</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of travel had to be devised. As they sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the tent, with the little stove burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerfully, Pierre lit his pipe and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ask questions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Can we build another canoe, Anne Ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rie? I suppose you know how? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Yes, I know; but there is no birch-bark-</seg><seg type="columnLine">large enough in this part of the country.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And it should be the bark of spring-time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Then^ what are we to do? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " If we had birch-bark it would take near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly two weeks," she replied. " We have no</seg><seg type="columnLine">couteau croche, nothing but the ax and two</seg><seg type="columnLine">knives. We must make a raft."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A raft--just the thing! We will float</seg><seg type="columnLine">down."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Hard work," she continued. " We must</seg><seg type="columnLine">make a new one at every portage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True," he answered. "We have enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to carry without pulling logs over all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carries."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We can shoot no rapids," she continued,</seg><seg type="columnLine">" and we must land before we get to the-head</seg><seg type="columnLine">of most portages."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, they're nearly all near swift water,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he assented. "It's lucky I got that meat."</seg><seg type="columnLine">The young man was restless before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept that night. He realized the difficulties</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a rafting trip down the river, with the cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">weather coming on, and the food question</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming important again. When he awoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the morning, the girl was already out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tent, cooking breakfast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had a bite to eat, hurriedly, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pierre went to look for suitable trees, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked out dead ones that would float light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that were not decayed. -There were plenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them, and he cut lengths of about twenty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five feet, and carried them to the shore.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took him a great deal longer to make his</seg><seg type="columnLine">raft than he had expected. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">auger to bore holes with in order to peg</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross-pieces, and he puzzled for some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the best way to fasten the logs solidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">together.	--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He split a young birch and made six pieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">about seven feet long, of which he passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">three under his logs, at right angles with</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, while three were placed over them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All that was necessary was to fasten the pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">truding ends strongly together. To do this</seg><seg type="columnLine">he cut long strips from the caribou hide</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had been kept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The morning was well advanced before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clumsy craft, about six feet wide and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-five feet long, was completed. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the meanwhile Anne Marie had made a big</seg><seg type="columnLine">paddle with his hunting knife, and had cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">a couple of poles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A HEART OF</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NORTH.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">507</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During all this time he had been working</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to his knees in the water and felt the cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">keenly. He then went to work to load his</seg><seg type="columnLine">raft, feeling somewhat uncertain as to whether</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be buoyant enough, but found that</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the equipment and provisions, besides</seg><seg type="columnLine">their combined weight, did not sink it too</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It bothered him to think that this job would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to be repeated at every portage and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">many bits of rapid water that could easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been shot in the canoe, but would prove</seg><seg type="columnLine">too shallow or too rocky for the raft. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">practise the others might be.built more easily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but again he might not always find the right</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of trees at hand, or shallow w'ater in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which to w'ork.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His activities once aroused, however, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily became sanguine, and felt quite cheer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful when they started. The food question</seg><seg type="columnLine">bothered him only a little. Anne Marie could</seg><seg type="columnLine">set snares for rabbits and catch fish while he</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked at his rafts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew he could not count on any more</seg><seg type="columnLine">big game, excepting by the greatest luck. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be scarcer as they traveled farther</seg><seg type="columnLine">south. Well, it was one more experience,</seg><seg type="columnLine">another fight to be waged, and he did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubt for a moment that he w'ould win.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The waterproof ground cloth had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched over the middle of the raft and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dunnage piled upon it. Paddy ran from one</seg><seg type="columnLine">end to the other, enjoying a method of travel</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gave him so much freedom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They floated down easily, though slowly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Anne Marie constantly watched and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed out the places w'here the current was</seg><seg type="columnLine">softest. It w'as of little use to try and</seg><seg type="columnLine">propel the raft, for the greatest exertion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pole and paddle made apparently little dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference in their speed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sometimes they had to observe the shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully to see that they were progressing at</seg><seg type="columnLine">all, and then, with swifter w'ater, the raft</seg><seg type="columnLine">would go faster for a while, and Pierre could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not help thinking how rapidly they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have traveled in the canoe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " It's slow work, Anne Marie," he called</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the girl, who w'as sitting forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " We travel," she answered. " We are not</seg><seg type="columnLine">standing still.

He was compelled to sit down under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tent while Anne Marie made tea and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He fell asleep as soon as he had eaten,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feeling quite played out, but awoke soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an awful pain in his neck and back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and during the remainder of the night he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept no more.

It</seg><seg type="columnLine">soothed the pain to some extent, but after a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while it was as bad as ever, and he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly bear it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Why don't you take some of die medicine</seg><seg type="columnLine">you gave me to make me sleep when I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bad pain in my side ?

But</seg><seg type="columnLine">he realized the absurdity of the thought.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the provisions were there under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tent.

But when he tried to move one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his arms there was a terrible aching in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, and the hand dropped down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are awake," she said.

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was impatient and restless and spoke</seg><seg type="columnLine">roughly, as if she had been at fault.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You may still be too sore to go on to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">morrow," she ventured.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't care--I'll go to-morrow; but just</seg><seg type="columnLine">now I simply can't move.

" I'm sorry I said that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Impulsively she knelt by him, and lifting</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of his hands in her own, she stroked it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if he had been a child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are too good," she said. "It is my</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to work for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some reason he could not explain, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him feel uncomfortable; but her sym-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pathy was good, and comforted him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Did you catch any fish ?

She brought him some boiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">fish and a cup of tea. He enjoyed the hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink, and tried to eat a little, but he had no</seg><seg type="columnLine">taste for food.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That day was desperately long and slow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Anne Marie went out again several times to</seg><seg type="columnLine">look at her lines and to set rabbit-snares, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she never remained away long; and when-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever she returned he was pleased to see her</seg><seg type="columnLine">and glad of her presence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On the next day he was quite unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">move. The girl rubbed his neck and shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders, and sat by him most of the time, sew-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing skins together or mending clothes. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">liked to have her there, to talk to him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait on him; and whenever she went away,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even for a short time, he longed for her com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panionship. Several times he became grumpy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and impatient, but she did not appear to</seg><seg type="columnLine">notice it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Five days in all passed away before he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to move about, and then he determined</seg><seg type="columnLine">to start at once. The weather had become</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear and cold, and winter was announcing</seg><seg type="columnLine">its near arrival. He took his ax, and went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">work to make logs for the raft, but had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop before he had half cut down a dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">spruce whose top rested on some birches upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it had fallen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anne Marie quietly took the ax from him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he sat down, feeling piteously weak and</seg><seg type="columnLine">disabled. After she had made the logs he</seg><seg type="columnLine">arose again to help her take them down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water's edge. He remembered how, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">week before, he had swung them upon his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder and carried them so easily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the girl's help, she doing most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the work, he managed to get three of them to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shore and then sat down, exhausted. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">persisted, however, but it took till evening to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get the raft made. Anne Marie went up to</seg><seg type="columnLine">her knees in the water to tie the crosspieces</seg><seg type="columnLine">together. He had angrily forbidden her to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do so, but she came to him and placed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand on his shoulder, and smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are the sick one now," she asserted</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently. " I am well and strong, and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to this life than you. Please let me</seg><seg type="columnLine">work."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had jumped in the water without wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for his consent, and tied her knots more</seg><seg type="columnLine">strongly and deftly than he had done. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened the raft solidly to the shore, ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the next day's journey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they started, their load.was in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creased by a few pounds of smoked fish and</seg><seg type="columnLine">some rabbits. The next carry was not very</seg><seg type="columnLine">far away, and when they landed Pierre found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself unable to carry heavy loads. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles of his head and neck resented the la-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bor demanded of them. Twenty-five or thir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ty pounds was all that he could manage at a</seg><seg type="columnLine">time. Anne Marie took his tump-line with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out heeding his protests, lifted full a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">510</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">dred pounds to her broad little back, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked off with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is too much for you," he objected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I have had much rest," she replied.

As</seg><seg type="columnLine">she walked on, bent under her load, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">fancied that if this man had always been</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her the labor would have been light</seg><seg type="columnLine">and easy, its weariness nothing when shared</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him, when rewarded by a word from</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. This kind of idea, frequent with her</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, was yet shapeless and unformed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Principally she was like Paddy, conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">merely of present happiness; but, unlike him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she w'as made uneasy by the knowledge that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would not last, and a chilly feeling would</seg><seg type="columnLine">strike through her heart, and the load upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">her back then seemed to crush her in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At" the lower end of the carry a small</seg><seg type="columnLine">stream entered the river, and they had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get across it to find trees for a new raft. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was quite deep and turbulent as a result of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the recent rains, and they had to travel up its</seg><seg type="columnLine">banks for some time before they found a</seg><seg type="columnLine">place where they could get over it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It took them over two hours to get all their</seg><seg type="columnLine">things across and back again to the main</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore. They had more trouble in making</seg><seg type="columnLine">this raft than they had experienced before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suitable trees were rather far apart, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">shore lent itself but poorly to the building</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their craft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had to keep the logs together by</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinking poles a couple of yards out into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river-bed, as the current threatened to carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">them away. It was a hard job to tie on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crosspieces. After this was done the bag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gage had to be taken down a slippery bank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where their feet sank deeply in greasy blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">clay.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a mile after they started they went at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good pace, and then they reached a place</seg><seg type="columnLine">where there were several islands, and entered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a tortuous channel between two of them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After going a hundred yards, they found</seg><seg type="columnLine">the passage barred by a huge tree that had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fallen across it. As soon as they saw it they</seg><seg type="columnLine">dug their poles in the bottom of the river, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop their headway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tree was too large to make it practical</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cut it in the middle, and they had to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">back against the current to find another way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The water was rather deep, and, though not</seg><seg type="columnLine">very swift, it took them a long time and</seg><seg type="columnLine">much strenuous labor to push their clumsy</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship up-stream until they reached another</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When they stopped, they were both quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhausted, and glad, indeed, to sit on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">raft again and direct its course with poles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and paddles down the unending river, every</seg><seg type="columnLine">fall and rapid of which had become an enemy</seg><seg type="columnLine">to their progress, instead of a thing of beauty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That night, when they stopped, they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">only managed to make about seven miles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was radier discouraging.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " At this rate it will take us till Christ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mas," said Pierre rather gloomily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " We will have ice and heavy snow long</seg><seg type="columnLine">before that," replied Anne Marie.

The weather had be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come stormy, and during all that time they</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived night and day in wet clothes. Several</seg><seg type="columnLine">light flurries of snow had betokened the need</seg><seg type="columnLine">for haste. Everything was saturated, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cepting die contents of the waterproof bags.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had to build several rafts, while at</seg><seg type="columnLine">other times they could unfasten the logs and</seg><seg type="columnLine">float them over shoals and tie them together</seg><seg type="columnLine">again lower down. They passed long ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panses of barren land, abandoned by beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and birds, and this dreariness corroded</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pierre's soul. But the girl, though usually</seg><seg type="columnLine">grave and taciturn, always stood by him, do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her work with such courage that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not help admiring her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt that she had become a splendid</seg><seg type="columnLine">pal, and, prompted by an affectionate nature,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the young man's conduct toward her daily</seg><seg type="columnLine">became more friendly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He always called her Ou-memeou, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">translated the word in French and addressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">her as Tourterelle. Often, while standing up</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the raft, and discussing the all-important</seg><seg type="columnLine">A HEART OF</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE NORTH.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">511</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of where the deepest water was ahead,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand would rest upon her shoulder for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute, as she pointed to some spot on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Slowly, unconsciously, he began to feel that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be sorry to end the trip. As a</seg><seg type="columnLine">journey it certainly was beastly hard; but</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a keen enjoyment in the presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that girl, and in the fact that he realized</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was becoming, under some subtle influ-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence, a stronger and better man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If she had only been of his race he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have taken her to his heart, with all her</seg><seg type="columnLine">poverty and ignorance of his world, of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">world to which he still was tied, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">bound him with conventions too strong to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">severed. He sometimes spoke of his life in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cities, and Ou-memeou seemed always</seg><seg type="columnLine">eager to hear about it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I should like to see such places," she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">once, " but it must be very dreadful to be al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ways away from laughing waters and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the song that comes out of the woodland."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You would die, Tourterelle," he an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered, " if you were caged in a city.

I cannot tell why,</seg><seg type="columnLine">except that my people live there."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he pondered long over this in silence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they floated on the river, and the question</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept on recurring, and at times he felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he knew not really why. Whether the blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Farquhar's wife beckoned to him, or real</seg><seg type="columnLine">love was preparing him, or the glory of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wilderness appealed to him, he could not tell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew that the girl's cjuery was daily be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming harder to answer, and gradually he</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that one bond was becoming looser, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">that another was tightening around him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just as the flood carried them down, so he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be upon a current that led away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his old life, not toward wealth or ease,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but toward something else--greater, stronger,</seg><seg type="columnLine">better suited to the thews and sinews of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">real man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although they had long sleeps and a suf-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ficiency of food, they became haggard and</seg><seg type="columnLine">worn with the weary grind of it all. Anne</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marie now did her full share of all the work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it seemed to tire her less than her com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At any rate, she did not seem as exhausted</seg><seg type="columnLine">when night came. Pierre became used to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea of her working so hard, and 'was glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have her attend to the dreary labor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooking and cleaning the few dishes they had.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The flour-bag was very low now, and they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cooked no more bread. Sodden pancakes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made in the frying-pan, were more filling and</seg><seg type="columnLine">easier to prepare. They hardly caught any</seg><seg type="columnLine">fish, and the rabbits seemed few and far be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween, though they set snares nearly every</seg><seg type="columnLine">night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Paddy was dispirited. He had grown thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and lanky, although he had always received</seg><seg type="columnLine">his full share of food. Never did he seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">now to bark for the very joy of living, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">formerly. His rather discriminating appetite</seg><seg type="columnLine">had given way to a wolfish hunger for any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing that could possibly be eaten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The two sometimes remained nearly the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole day without speaking. The hardship</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it all had deprived the man of none of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his pluck; but his endurance was sapped to</seg><seg type="columnLine">some extent, and he went ahead doggedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Along some portions of the river they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make paths for themselves, where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">dared not trust a raft in the rapids that would</seg><seg type="columnLine">so easily have borne a canoe, knowing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the striking of a single boulder would mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">the loss of all the provisions, and possibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own death. On such occasions Anne</seg><seg type="columnLine">Marie always went first.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She had an instinct that always enabled</seg><seg type="columnLine">her to select the easiest going. But the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">was seldom even fair. There were stretches</seg><seg type="columnLine">of swamp in which they sank to their knees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tangles of trees harvested by the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">north winds, and burnt lands so covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with an abomination of low growth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">charred fallen trunks that it took them hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">at times to make a few hundred yards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These dreadful journeys had to be repeat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed until dicir whole equipment was transport-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed. Little by little they had discarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything that was not absolutely necessary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " There's no use in lugging these steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">traps, Anne Marie," he had said. " I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">they're about all you own in the world, but,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all, they're not worth much. I'll get</seg><seg type="columnLine">you others when we get to Lac 9t. Jean."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anne Marie had flung away the traps, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pierre had thrown away most of his ammu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nition and fishing tackle. His little mirror</seg><seg type="columnLine">went, also his shaving things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally they reached a place only about</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten miles above where the Peribonka, ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">king a graceful sweep, allows some of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters to run off to the left and fill Lake</seg><seg type="columnLine">T schotagama.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's a way down the lake and into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a river, all the way to Chicoutimi, I under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand," said Pierre.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " If the wind was right we could sail a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">raft down through the lake," said the girl,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"but the river is small and bad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                             f</seg><seg type="columnLine">512</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I suppose we had better keep on</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the Peribonka," he replied. "We'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">l&gt;e all right when we get down to the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">falls. There we can get provisions, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">after that we can float down to the mouth</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the river and get a steamer, or find</seg><seg type="columnLine">horses."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "From here, with a light canoe, we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">go down in two days or a little over," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I'd give five hundred dollars for one, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">say thank you," he asserted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> November had come, and the next day</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was quite a fall of snow. For an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">or two it came down quite heavily, a dry</seg><seg type="columnLine">feather)' cloud that whirled thickly over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the"m, so that they could see but a short dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance ahead, and which, after it passed off,</seg><seg type="columnLine">left the mantle of winter upon the ground.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pierre thought of the joys of boyhood</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the first coming of snow spoke of win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter sports. It would send him to- the loft</seg><seg type="columnLine">where skates, toboggans, and snow-shoes had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been put away during the summer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But this time, when the downy flakes</seg><seg type="columnLine">first came, he had stared at the girl, sha-</seg><seg type="columnLine">king his head, and she had looked at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had gone through so much, and now</seg><seg type="columnLine">this seemed like another obstacle rising up</seg><seg type="columnLine">before them, a harbinger of cold they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ill prepared to meet, of ice that might inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fere with their journey, and, perhaps, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunger whose pangs they might soon have</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing left to appease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're in for it," he said?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " We must spare a day or two and fix</seg><seg type="columnLine">things for cold weather," she answered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Between them they had a double blanket</seg><seg type="columnLine">and four single ones, and Anne Marie went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work with Pierre's knife and cut out some</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces with which she Mnade rough mitts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The provisions had dwindled enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">permit of their being packed in two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the waterproof bags, with their little spare</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This left two empty ones; in which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a slit in the bottom and armholes at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sides. They could be drawh over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head like pouches and would keep out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water and wind. But this left a lot of stiff</seg><seg type="columnLine">unyielding material around the neck, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the girl cut some of it away and did a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of clever sewing. What was left of the cari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bou hide, ill-prepared though it was, served</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make two pair of mocassins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This took nearly a whole day, for Pierre</seg><seg type="columnLine">could give but little help. The waterproof</seg><seg type="columnLine">bags worn over their clothing would keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bodies warm, but the arms would suf-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fer, and so they attached sleeves made of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blanketing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   In the evening, and all that night, the cold</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">increased, and in the morning it was freez-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing hard. They had to break ice near the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shore to get away, and the water froze on ■</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the poles and covered the raft with ice, wher-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ever it splashed upon it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was a very sudden coming of winter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weather. If this cold were to last *he river</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would soon freeze over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Pierre noticed that the girl was less well-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">protected than she should have been. Her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">winter clothing had been lost in the wreck</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of her canoe, and she possessed but a thin</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">woolen skirt. A large piece of the blanket</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that had already been cut into was left, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he insisted that she should make a pair of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trousers for herself out of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">She worked while they floated down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">•river, and in the evening when they landed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">By early morning she had finished a rough</seg><seg type="columnLine">garment. The stove going at night, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep them comfortable in the tent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They reached Lake Tschotagama before</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dark, and Pierre pushed the raft out of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strong current, turned to the left and en-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tered the narrow opening into the lake. On</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the right side there is a little bluff, twenty-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">five or thirty feet high, upon which they de-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cided to camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  This was the usual limit of tourists' jour-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">neys up the river, and they found plenty of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">traces of former occupancy. A large tree</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">had been broadly blazed, and some names</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were penciled upon the white wood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It seemed "like getting in touch again with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">civilization to find that these men from New</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">York and other big cities had been fishing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">there, unless several empty whisky bottles</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">strewn around the site of the camp had in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">terfered with this pursuit. But Pierre felt</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">disgruntled to think that if he had a canoe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he could easily have been down to the first</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">falls in two days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A survey of the remaining provisions left</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him somewhat anxious. They would last,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the present rate, perhaps eight or nine</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">days more, although there was a good deal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of tea. There were ten falls below Lake</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tschotagama, besides some rapids over</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">which they would not be able to take a raft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Each one of these meant the building of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">new craft, and they had discovered that on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">an average they could not make more than</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one a day and do any traveling also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  If the river were to freeze over they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would have to walk. This would be easier</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and faster than rafting if the ice should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">A HEART OF THE NORTH.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">513</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">solid, but they knew that it would take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long time to make it fit to bear their weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">for long distances, though it would interfere .</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the raft.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wherever the water was rapid they would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to walk alongshore, for in such places</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ice would not make till late in winter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they had their supper under the tent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that evening, Pierre suggested that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">might have to tighten their belts before they</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached their destination, but Anne Marie</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrugged her shoulders, declaring she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">often gone hungry, and diat it did not mat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter so long as one did not die.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young man could not help admiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">her. She was made of a stuff that differed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every way from the material out of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greater part of the women of civilization</seg><seg type="columnLine">were built. Suffering, hunger, cold, hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">toil, all these were accepted by her as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural incidents of life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was pleasant and helpful, appearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to have no ambitions and no desires that</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be easily satisfied. She was strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">and willing, and seemed to be grateful for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smallest thing that was done for her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her intelligence was undeveloped along</seg><seg type="columnLine">most lines that formerly he had deemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">essential, but what a companion she was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the woods Ay, she was a fit mate for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man!	&gt;</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the fitful light of the little stove he</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at her.

It did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">appear to him that he had ever studied them</seg><seg type="columnLine">before.

They</seg><seg type="columnLine">worked a long time to clear it, but unsuccess-</seg><seg type="columnLine">full}-, and had to walk to the shore through</seg><seg type="columnLine">seven or eight inches of water, their heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">loads making their feet sink deep in the sand.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nearer land they came to ice, through which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they often broke; but, as there were only a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few inches of water, they got no wetter than</seg><seg type="columnLine">they already were. Pierre had carried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dog, fearing that a prolonged ice-water bath</seg><seg type="columnLine">might injure it. He left him on shore with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Anne Marie, and returned for the rest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">things. rWhen he got back, there was no more</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensation in his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anne Marie had lighted a fire, and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">took off their moccasins and rubbed their feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">with snow. Pierre was slightly frost-bitten.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He suffered keen pain by the time he put on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his spare stockings and shoes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After having tea and a little of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">precious meat, they started to make their way</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the shore. The snow was soft and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">so deep as to make the walking very trouble-</seg><seg type="columnLine">some, excepting in little drifts. All their lug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gage was now contained in two packs. Pierre</seg><seg type="columnLine">carried about sixty pounds, and Anne Marie</seg><seg type="columnLine">little less. Their progress was twice impeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">by streams they had to cross; and, after get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting over them, they came to a high bank run-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning parallel with the river, up which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a hard climb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " If we could only find a place with lots of</seg><seg type="columnLine">game," said Pierre, "we could wait till the</seg><seg type="columnLine">river froze hard and walk on it as often as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible. Then we'd make good time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No game here," said the girl, "except a</seg><seg type="columnLine">few rabbits and partridges."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the morning it was still very cold. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lakes must all be freezing over, but the swift</seg><seg type="columnLine">rivers took longer. One of Pierre's feet hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a good deal, but he paid little atten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion to it. The bad going and the constant</seg><seg type="columnLine">changes of direction in order to avoid rocks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">windfalls, and deep gullies wore into the soul</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the tump-line ground itself into his fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At times it seemed as if they were in a vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">prison, from which they sought to escape with</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball and chain tied to their feet. Their loads</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground them down into the hard surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pierre's muscles now resisted the wear and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tear of the labor well, and he only felt sore</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tired, as often before; but there was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mental strain, due to the uncertainty of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, to the consciousness of insufficient prog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ress, of scanty food, of the thought of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiety of the old people at home, who knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">not where he was, as he had only said he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going in the Lake St. John country for a trip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> These trains of thought came from time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, and made things worse. Anne Marie,</seg><seg type="columnLine">by common consent, was the pathfinder, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he trod behind her, in a quiet, weary, yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">plucky, way. His senses were merely dull</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the stupid grind of it all. But he never</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the first to call for a rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At what seemed to be very regular inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vals she would stop and lean her pack upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fallen tree, or a boulder, without taking the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tump-line from her forehead, and, usually in</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence, they would wait a while, until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain seemed to have left their strained mus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cles.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Yet the}- knew it would return as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they lifted their loads again. During these</seg><seg type="columnLine">stops Pierre generally lit his pipe, but some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times he felt too tired to smoke. He had an</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense amount of reserve force and pluck</seg><seg type="columnLine">left, but his fairly easy life had never made</seg><seg type="columnLine">such demands upon him before. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">never really known what it was to bend his</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles day in and day out to a strenuous</seg><seg type="columnLine">task, and to take it up again and again with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out surcease.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ou-memeou was not .more effective than he,</seg><seg type="columnLine">excepting in that her greater knowledge of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">woods made her his superior in traveling. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her the work was not so irksome. It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">life she knew, the only life she had ever known</seg><seg type="columnLine">--harder at one time than at another, but such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as was necessary, indispensable, and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which none of her people escaped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From morning till night the hours of toil</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on, each interrupted by a couple of short</seg><seg type="columnLine">rests. Apparently impassable places would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be reached, and they would consult in a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sometimes they dropped their packs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">explored; but nearly always the girl discov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered the best way around the obstruction.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This sort of thing gave their heads and backs</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rest, yet was unwelcome. It kept them</seg><seg type="columnLine">back; it interfered with the grinding toil that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all, constantly brought them nearer to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their destination. They were seldom in sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the river, as there was hardly ever any fair</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking along the sliore. But the girl's sense</seg><seg type="columnLine">of direction was never at fault.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first Pierre argued with her at times,</seg><seg type="columnLine">A HEART OF THE NORTH.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">515</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and insisted that she was mistaken; but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">always turned out that she was right, and after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a while he entrusted the whole matter to her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ljlindly following her grimly and uncomplain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly, his mind often occupied with triviali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ties which somehow lessened the toil.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Toward evening, when they began to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">of making camp, he reckoned that they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been traveling for nine hours. The actual</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking had taken perhaps seven of these, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rests, including a midday stop for lunch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">would account for two.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If they had been going in a straight line,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would have covered about fourteen miles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he thought of all the turns they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">made around obstructions of many kinds, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">feared it could not be more than ten.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just then they came out upon the shore</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, and Anne Marie looked intently, seek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to recognize the place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a moment she said she knew where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">were.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " How far have we gone, Anne Marie? " he</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquired.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " About eight miles, reckoning the course</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the river," she answered. " We are not far</seg><seg type="columnLine">from McLeod's portage."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew she must be right, and that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace had really been very slow, with their big</seg><seg type="columnLine">loads and the dreadful country they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">traversed. He was too tired to feel more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slight disappointment. They threw down</seg><seg type="columnLine">their packs and made camp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The three birds were skinned. They were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not very fat, and hardly made a meal for two</seg><seg type="columnLine">people and a dog. More food had to lie added</seg><seg type="columnLine">from their store, yet it was a saving for which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they felt grateful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sky was leaden, and promised more</seg><seg type="columnLine">snow, but the fire was cheerful and comfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as they sat close to it, and life did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem so very dreadful just then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hard work and the cold had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">them ravenous, and now, with full stomachs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a hot fire before them, they sat in a semi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torpor that was pleasant. With his old pipe</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his mouth, Pierre again looked upon ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">istence as-a thing worth being blessed with.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had followed the girl, who now sat con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentedly by him, the whole day long, allow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing her to lead, realizing that in the woods</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was his superior. Considering her smaller</seg><seg type="columnLine">size and weaker muscular power, she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing the better part of the work.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This interest in her was constantly growing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yes, he admired her. She was becoming an</seg><seg type="columnLine">object of more intense thought to him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">every day's journey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">,	(T o b e c</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  He caught himself staring at her several</seg><seg type="columnLine">times, and this apparently made her uneasy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for she kept her eyes cast down, in silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  During the night there was another heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">snowfall, and when they started again the</seg><seg type="columnLine">walking was worse than ever. But they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleased to see that the river was freezing over</seg><seg type="columnLine">more solidly. This could easily be seen in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spots where the surface had been swept clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the wind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  They ventured out upon it cautiously, step-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping gingerly through the snow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " It is pretty strong," said Pierre. " I sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose we ought to pray for colder weather to</seg><seg type="columnLine">enable us to travel on the ice.

By</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time they were at the whistling-post he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was using a little steam again just to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving. He stopped on die yard limits,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistled, and then trundled slowly down to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the red flag, where a hostler from the round-</seg><seg type="columnLine">house waited for the engine. As he got</seg><seg type="columnLine">down from the cab, he said to this man:</seg><seg type="columnLine">" This air's dead.

If ever any man ought to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked up, you certainly should be."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wright felt very good over this. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure of his fireman. Nothing now could bar</seg><seg type="columnLine">his promotion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up at headquarters, where he hurried to</seg><seg type="columnLine">check in, half a dozen officials were wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to congratulate him. They looked at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chalky white dulness which settles under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eyes of a man who endures a long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremendous strain, and they pretended that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been scared half to death all the way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They conducted themselves generally like</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who are very proud to patronize. Wright</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not overfond of this business. As soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he could do it decently, he got away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That afternoon, instead of waiting for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">run back, as he had a right to, he got leave</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went home on the first passenger-train.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He wanted to tell his wife and babies all</seg><seg type="columnLine">about what had happened, for their approval</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the kind he could accept. Besides, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher pay of the better job now certain</seg><seg type="columnLine">would open long vistas of better things for</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. He wanted them to know at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was long after midnight when he let</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself into the flat; but, just the same, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy and the girl woke up with their mother,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all three of them got out of their beds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made him tell the story of the run again</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again, until he was quite sure that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not only a very great man, but the hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piest one in all the town.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of the foolish things he did the next</seg><seg type="columnLine">morning, as soon as he could find shopkeepers</seg><seg type="columnLine">astir, it is as well to say little. He bought</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the books that his son would never read,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the trinkets for which his wife had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">the slightest use or wish, and all the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">imaginably meaningless gimcracks for which</seg><seg type="columnLine">his little girl could find neither name nor</seg><seg type="columnLine">purpose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">540</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he made them happy, anyhow; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in doing this he spent--on credit, of course</seg><seg type="columnLine">--considerably more than the pay coming to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About ten o'clock the telephone rang for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to answer a call from headquarters.

He held hi?</seg><seg type="columnLine">head high. It is to be feared that he held</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself just a trifle too straight. But then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, he did have a right to feel a bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">chest}-.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On entering the sanctum sanctorum he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat surprised to see several persons</seg><seg type="columnLine">who were not usually to be found there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the first place, besides the despatcher</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the superintendent and the master me-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chanic, there was Miller. What business</seg><seg type="columnLine">could Miller halve?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The question bothered him not a little.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Now that he remembered it, he had a grudge</seg><seg type="columnLine">against this engineer for that sneering smile.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps Miller was to be reduced to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he wondered about his fireman, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was also in the room; but, reflecting that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">man had a share in the run, he was glad</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were going to honor him also. He de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided that the very large and severe gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who looked at every one just as a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinist looks at bolts and nuts must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the general manager.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The despatcher nodded gravely at him, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">no one else made a sign of recognition.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This did not seem the proper beginning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ceremony for promotion; but as his was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">exceptional case, he thought, perhaps, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the methods might be exceptional.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Wright," the despatcher said, " what</seg><seg type="columnLine">were you doing between the time you left me</seg><seg type="columnLine">night before last and leaving-time?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, if the engineer had been alone with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his questioner he would have answered that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been hiding in the sheds for fear of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slow order: but, in the hearing of these</seg><seg type="columnLine">other men, such an explanation seemed silly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He shifted uneasily on his feet, and an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swered: "Why, jist a loafin' around in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheds. That was all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You are sure you were not doing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing ? " It was the superintendent who</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The superintendent was a stout man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a stubby nose and an air of vast importance.</seg><seg type="columnLine">People grew angry at him without knowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">why.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wright answered him sharply: " I suppose</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ought to know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " But you don't suppose other people do,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eh ?

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, I suppose you were not afraid of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the run," the official admitted; "but, plain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly, you were nervous about something. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">did you come skulking up to your engine at</seg><seg type="columnLine">just the last second, and then, after releasing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air-brakes, throw them on again, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you already had your high-ball ? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wright hesitated. It was clear now that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fireman had come straight back and told N</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that awkward manipulation of the air at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the start. This explained Miller's presence,</seg><seg type="columnLine">also.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Deciding that it was unwise to quarrel, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">against two, in the presence of superiors who</seg><seg type="columnLine">weighed evidence just like other people, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply answered: "Well, I may have been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mite nervous."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Did you tell this man who was firing for</seg><seg type="columnLine">you that the bushing around the air-valve</seg><seg type="columnLine">stem had worked loose?"

Very</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly he asked: "My man, did you really .</seg><seg type="columnLine">throw off your air; then throw it on again;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then off a second time, after you had your</seg><seg type="columnLine">signal to be under way?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I did.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt that I should have given you a slow</seg><seg type="columnLine">order.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I looked round a few minutes after you</seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped out of the office that night, intending</seg><seg type="columnLine">to consult with you as to the propriety of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">slow order. Your fear that you might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go on without one seems, however, to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced you to the foolishly desperate thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">you did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now, we have known you to be a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">and faithful employee, and fairly skilful;</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, while there is no proper*excuse for such</seg><seg type="columnLine">an act as yours, we are going to give you an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other chance. After a thirty-day lay off, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">may report for duty. We will then do our</seg><seg type="columnLine">best for you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wright stood petrified in his astonishment</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this outlandish vagary from the lips of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sane and responsible man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he began laughing; but as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">laughed he saw that they exchanged most sig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nificant glances.

I'm not much on</seg><seg type="columnLine">argyin' points, but I'd like to have some o'</seg><seg type="columnLine">ye answer me that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You might not need an answer if you</seg><seg type="columnLine">would admit that we know the facts," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">master mechanic snapped; "but, since you</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't admit them, I'll explain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " After you fixed the air-brake, it was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately out of commission. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be, either, until the loose piece of packing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">worked into the right spot in the air-pipe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Naturally, just like any other man who could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do such a trick, you reasoned that it wouid</seg><seg type="columnLine">be unwise to discover trouble until it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparent to your fireman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Knowing as you did that at any moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">your deliverance from schedule speed might</seg><seg type="columnLine">take place through the gradual working of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clog of packing, you could drive to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">very limit. You would drive to the very</seg><seg type="columnLine">limit, too, because that would very likely</seg><seg type="columnLine">cover your tracks."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Say!"' Wright demanded fiercely. "What"</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of a frame-up is this? I'll punch some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body's head for this."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Punch your own!

The notion, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">view of his own undoubted facts, seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">tenable. He smiled foolishly, like a candi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">date who has just ridden the goat, and then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a waiting candidate, he waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My man," said the despatcher quietly,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">" we are now done with you.

He went outside then and wandered in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the yards for two hours, but he found no</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend, nor any clue to cheer him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At length, he came back to the office and</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down on the bench opposite the bulletin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">board.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A new notice posted there caught his eye.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was his suspension for thirty days.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, all this was so preposterous that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined on immediately setting things</seg><seg type="columnLine">right, regardless of consequences.

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was something so meaning in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">tone and manner that it bespoke real desper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The despatcher stared at him for a full</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute.

He sham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled out of the room.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Three days later, when he was able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring himself back to headquarters, he dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered that his name had been taken from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bulletin-board.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stumbled over to his pigeonhole in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">engineers' rack on the wall. He fished out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it a thin, yellow envelope. His fingers</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook so diat he could barely tear the paper;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but, at length, he succeeded. A check for</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the money due him from the company</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluttered in his grasp, but the certainty of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">discharge was what the bit of paper really</seg><seg type="columnLine">conveyed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Discharge, when a man has every right to</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect promotion, is, of course, heart-break-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing; but discharge under suspicion is even</seg><seg type="columnLine">a more terrible matter. This is especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">true when the unfortunate has spent liis prime</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fitting himself for a work from which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">least suspicioned are always jealously ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded. Wright's knees shook under him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he left the place.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He walked slowly down through the sheds</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the network of tracks beyond which,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a mile distant, the roundhouse lay long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">low in smoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miller, sauntering, met him and smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">that same triumphantly sneering smile which</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to sav, " You will try, but you will</seg><seg type="columnLine">fail."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wright understood die whole matter now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was clear that this old rascal, fearing re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirement to the- lower pay of a less important</seg><seg type="columnLine">run, had in some way engineered diis whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was disposed to knock him down and</seg><seg type="columnLine">half kill him right there; still, he reflected</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was the loss of his job, and not Mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler's hand in it, diat was likely to ruin him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So he grinned as affably as he could, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other fact was that, by taking out the bush-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing around the air - valve stem, one might</seg><seg type="columnLine">loosen the packing and crowd it down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pipe with the blade of a pocket-knife.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He knew now just what had been done,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just when it had been accomplished and how</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and, also, who was responsible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But next day, when lie came back, every</seg><seg type="columnLine">one laughed at him. After a long time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned that the despatcher and the others</seg><seg type="columnLine">had discharged him because they thought he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had tampered with the air in order to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">his run appears the more marvelous; and, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was a thing that really he might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">done, too -- had he thought of it -- he wa's</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck with a kind of helpless notion that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">somehow, this business fitted him so closely</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lie would never get rid of it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nevertheless, he hung around the yards</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the roundhouse. There was nothing else</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though he had become quite hopeless,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as a man does when he dreams that facts</seg><seg type="columnLine">are not as enduring as the hills, he still tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to plan some coup. After four days he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cided on one. Then he went down to head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters, and, finding Miller, said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I got next to it. And what happened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me is a goin' to happen to the very feller</seg><seg type="columnLine">that done me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miller hurried into the despatcher's office.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wright got out of the building as quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he could. Hiding himself behind a pile</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trunks, he peeped, and presently saw Mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ler and the despatcher come out and look</seg><seg type="columnLine">around as if they searched for some one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the despatcher laughed and made</seg><seg type="columnLine">signs at Miller, like a father when he thinks</seg><seg type="columnLine">the imagination of the son has been playing</seg><seg type="columnLine">him tricks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Go off," Wright heard the official advise,</seg><seg type="columnLine">" and soak your head.

At the far end of the sheds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, he came boldly out and said:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Now I have you! "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of replying, Miller jumped side-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wise and hurried down through the yards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wright smiled, and sat down at the end of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shed. Until he had seen Miller vanish</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the smoke-cloud of the roundhouse, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not stir. Then he got up and ran down</seg><seg type="columnLine">there as fast as he could. He lurked along</seg><seg type="columnLine">from stall to stall until he came to that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which stood the engine for the mail run</seg><seg type="columnLine">that night.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sure enough, Miller was sitting up in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cab just as if it were about leaving-time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Two or three wipers were gathered round the</seg><seg type="columnLine">footboard. They were trying to find out</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he was doing. When he would not an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer, they advised him to look at his watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and see if it were five hours fast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wright sat down outside.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After two hours it was six o'clock, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the day wipers were leaving for the night;</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the night force came stringing in with</seg><seg type="columnLine">their lunch-baskets on their arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wright saw Miller get down out of the cab</seg><seg type="columnLine">and start as if to come toward him. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he showed himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miller fell back, and began asking a greasy</seg><seg type="columnLine">helper for a bit of supper; but the helper</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to know why an engineer needed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have his meals carried to him when he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">off duty, and, receiving no explanation, kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">his bread and cheese.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Wright continued to sit at the door like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrier at a rat-hole.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When nine-forty o'clock came, Miller</seg><seg type="columnLine">crawled out of his cab and, calling a hostler,</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered him to take the engine up to the sta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion.

"Do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you reckon I'm goin' up there jist to walk</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, an' you a goin'? Well, I guess not!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whoever heard of such a thing ? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> No one had. A half-dozen of his fellows</seg><seg type="columnLine">had now gathered round him, and they took</seg><seg type="columnLine">his part.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miller, when he saw he must, backed die</seg><seg type="columnLine">engine slowly out upon the switch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Just as the footboard was passing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stall-door, Wright swung himself up and in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the cab.

" Is not Glen Streyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">an agent of Mr. W'arrington's?

There was a faint ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression of anxiety on Erskine's face, there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore, as he asked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  " Is Glen Streyer on this train ?

If Streyer had boarded the train</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Tyrcone, he doubtless had learned of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold-up of the Cascade flier, and that a type-</seg><seg type="columnLine">writer box had been taken from the Dale</seg><seg type="columnLine">Express car. Was it not probable that, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore leaving Chicago, the detective had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clue that had caused him to follow this box,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather than Montresor?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the duty-bound engineer, or the fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, he might have learned that the men</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had held up the Cascade Limited flier</seg><seg type="columnLine">had left the train at Tyrcone. In that event</seg><seg type="columnLine">it would be easy for him to infer that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fugitives had planned to take the West Coast</seg><seg type="columnLine">Express at that point. Was it not more like-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly that he was after the men whom he be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved to have the box in their possession,</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that he should have been diverted from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ids quest by the pursuit of Montresor?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, it seemed to Erskine that it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, rather than - Montresor, who had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">most to fear from this redoubtable detective</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had"boaTded the train. In the stateroom</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which he now was standing were the suit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases containing the prize he had struggled</seg><seg type="columnLine">so determinedly to win.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whether Glen Streyer sought him or Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tresor, the result was likely to be the same.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montresor's trail and his led to the state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room in which now sat the sister of Joseph</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warrington, the man who was suspected of</seg><seg type="columnLine">having taken the missing bonds from' the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place in which they belonged. And within</seg><seg type="columnLine">two feet of where Louise Warrington was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sitting were the missing bonds themselves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Appreciating the danger to which he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be exposed by traveling with the bonds, Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tresor had sent them by express.

Montresor had alighted at Tyr-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cone, and he probably was in a posidon to</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell whether or not the story of the robbery of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the express-car had reached the ears of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other passengers, or those of the men em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ployed in and around the station.

" Erskine</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, at length.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "To conceal me here until I shall be able</seg><seg type="columnLine">to leave the train," replied the desperate</seg><seg type="columnLine">man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No--no!" gasped Louise, rising.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But--by Heaven--I'll stay!" the Eng-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lishman muttered fiercely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, as he spoke, Erskine saw the glint of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a revolver in his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a flash the Altoona man had thrown</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself upon the unwelcome intruder. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fro the strong men swayed, but the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerved fugitive soon yielded to Erskine's su-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perior strength. After wrenching the revolver</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the hand of his adversary, Erskine</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced him to his knees.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The struggle ceased. The shriek of fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had issued from the lips of Mrs. War-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rington had been smothered by the hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">which her daughter continued to hold over</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mouth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Erskine, white-faced and grim, leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower over his adversary.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, Montresor--are you done?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">muttered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Englishman struggled weakly, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">WITHOUT LIGHTS.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">563</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">liis. chin sank upon his breast- For a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment the two men were motionless. Erskine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his gaze resting on the bowed head of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kneeling man, was thinking quickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louise and her mother were watching both</seg><seg type="columnLine">of diem, with horror-stricken eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " And now there is nothing to prevent me</seg><seg type="columnLine">from delivering you into the custody of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Streyer," Erskine said; then, after a pause,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he added: " But if you will do one thing I</seg><seg type="columnLine">will give you one more chance to run for it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I will not follow you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Montresor looke up surlily. Erskine</seg><seg type="columnLine">went on:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, I will let you go, if, in the presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">of diese ladies, you tell me what you did with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body of Joseph Warrington--after you</seg><seg type="columnLine">killed him."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still grasping the wrists of the beaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, Erskine felt him shudder. An expres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion of great fear settled on his face, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be on the verge of collapse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Speak!" Erskine commanded roughly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Which is it to be--confession or arrest?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " If I tell you, you will keep your word--</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will let me go ?

"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The eyes of the vanquished man flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">angrily. " I have told you all I promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell," he said hoarsely.

" Go,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Montresor rose weakly to his feet. " You</seg><seg type="columnLine">will not follow me?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No. I will not cause you to be followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">until to-morrow. Clear out."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Englishman's trembling fingers fum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bled with die lock and knob, then the door</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened and he passed out stealthily. Scarce-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly had the door closed behind him, when,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a little despairing cry, Mrs. Warrington</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell swooning to the seat from which she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">risen. To the elder woman's condition, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, the daughter gave no heed. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">look of bewilderment on her features, she</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stepped to Erskine and laid a hand on one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Why did you do this ? " she asked him</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathlessly. " Why did you let him go? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Half unconsciously, he took her hand in</seg><seg type="columnLine">both of his. " I let him go because it must</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be known that he was with us in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">room," he said. " I let him go because the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bonds we have been seeking are there, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Streyer must not find them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And, as he spoke, he nodded toward where</seg><seg type="columnLine">his two suit-cases stood where he had placed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them on the floor. The expression of bewil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derment on die features of Louise grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeper. Following the direction of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance, she gave a little start. For the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">time since she had returned to the stateroom</seg><seg type="columnLine">she saw the cases of which he had spoken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She turned to him again. " You--you</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean that you have found them--the bonds</seg><seg type="columnLine">that--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Yes, Miss Warrington, I have found</seg><seg type="columnLine">them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She looked at him incredulously at first,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then the light of a great happiness overspread</seg><seg type="columnLine">her face. A moment later she was in tears,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and, swaying slightly, she turned from him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Erskine was about to speak when, from</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside the stateroom door, came the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a loud, hoarse cry, which was immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed by a revolver-shot. Into one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pockets of his coat he had dropped the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">volver he had taken from Montresor, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers now closed around this as he glanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direction of the door. For several mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments all was still, then a second shot rang</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Erskine's ears, and there suddenly flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">across his mind the thought that the voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that of Barney McGrane!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quickly disengaging himself from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp of the now terrified Louise, the younj;</seg><seg type="columnLine">man rushed to the door and threw it open.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The odor of gunpowder entered his nostrils,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and from the car came the half-smothered</seg><seg type="columnLine">exclamations of the startled occupants of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curtained berths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moving forward cautiously, Erskine came</seg><seg type="columnLine">at last to.the vestibule. There, on one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">platforms, he saw the prostrate figure of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">man--motionless and with up-turned face--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a face he never had looked upon before!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blood was flowing from a wound in the mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dle of the forehead, and, as lie looked, Er-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skine knew the man was dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Who is he?" whispered a masculine</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Erskine shook his head. But he believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie knew. Deeper and deeper into his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">sank the consciousness of the fact that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">564</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAILROAD MAN'S MAGAZINE.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">lifeless form at his feet was none other than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body of Glen Streyer. the famous Chicago</seg><seg type="columnLine">detective!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Erskine and the passengers who.were</seg><seg type="columnLine">now crowding in behind him had little time</seg><seg type="columnLine">to meditate upon the identity of the man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay before them. All were startled by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound of a second shot which came to them</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the rear of the last car--another sleeper</seg><seg type="columnLine">--on the train.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As those around him shrank back, Erskine</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressed forward. Hurrying into the rear car,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie ran along the aisle. Once or twice he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into collision with persons who, in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">act of rising, had allowed their heads or feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">to protrude from the sides of their berths, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did not stop.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last, gripping his revolver, he came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rear platform of the car. It was empty,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the train was speeding at what he judged</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a rate of fifty miles an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For only a moment did the Altoona man</seg><seg type="columnLine">hesitate. A glance showed him that one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side doors was open. This was sufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell the tale, and, with outstretched hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he glanced up toward the bell-cord.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was vibrating in a manner that plain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly showed that another hand was jerking at</seg><seg type="columnLine">it furiously. The locomotive whistled, there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a hissing of air-pipes and a succession</seg><seg type="columnLine">of jolts, and the train slowed down.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the little party that accompanied the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conductor and a brakeman, who jogged back</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the track, was Erskine. He made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt, however, to outdistance his compan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ions, for he reasoned that, under the circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances, it would be unwise for him to expose</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to the view of a dying man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But by and by the conductor halted sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly, and the lanterns they carried hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">ominously over something they had found</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the track. Advancing cautiously, Er-</seg><seg type="columnLine">skine saw two human figures lying together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were men, and one, moving weakly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be trying to tighten his grip on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the collar of the other.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the man who moved Erskine recognized</seg><seg type="columnLine">his friend, the Irishman. The man whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted neck indicated that he \yould never</seg><seg type="columnLine">move again of his own volition was Mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tresor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " He done it," the Irishman was saying</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakly. " He snatched a derringer from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket and shot the other feller what told</seg><seg type="columnLine">liini he was wanted. It ain't the first man</seg><seg type="columnLine">he killed, neither, for--"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the conductor bent lower over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speaker, the Irishman, coughing violently,</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a vain attempt to rise. Erskine, mov-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing closer, saw that his lips and chin were</seg><seg type="columnLine">flecked with blood.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's dead, ain't he?" McGrane asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly, turning to the corpse that lay beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Yes, he's dead," the conductor answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravely.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Irishman was about to speak again,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when, seeing Erskine, he motioned to him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw nearer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " Is everything all right, sir? " he asked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the Altoona man knelt down beside him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " All right, Barney--if we can get you out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this," Erskine replied in a shaking voice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McGrane shook his head. " It's no use,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sir," he said resignedly. " I told you 'tweren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">no use in prayin' for the jumps to stop. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">just kept cornin' and a cornin' till they got</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in the end. But Miss--Miss Warrington</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't believe that me and you did that thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">we was a talkin' about, does she, sir? "</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Barney; the whole truth is known</seg><seg type="columnLine">to her now. She understands."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " I knew she would. And now it looks as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though there weren't no more for me to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">or say."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " You must brace up, Barney, while we</seg><seg type="columnLine">get you back to the car."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> " 'Tain't 110 use, sir--'tain't no use.

Thither he had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">his way, all unobserved, more than five hours</seg><seg type="columnLine">before.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beside him were a dark lantern and two</seg><seg type="columnLine">packages, wrapped in brown paper, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">WITHOUT LIGHTS.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">              'N</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">565</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">contained the bonds he had taken from his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">father's train. One of his thumbs, thrust</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into a pocket of his vest, touched a folded</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">paper that lay within. The paper was a leaf</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">torn from the Old Testament Book of Prov-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">erbs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Many thoughts occupied the young man's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mind as he crouched there alone. For two</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">days he had traveled eastward .with Louise</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and her mother; and, though all of them</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">were moving solemnly in the shadow of a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">series of appalling tragedies, there had been</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">moments when the young man was conscious</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of sensations that were more pleasurable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than any he ever had experienced before. A</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beautiful young woman, looking to him as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her protector, had given him a full measure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of her confidence--a confidence that had an-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nihilated all his darker doubts and fears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It was a strange story that Louise had told</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">him, but he believed it all. It was at the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">home of one of the leaders of Chicago society</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">1 that she had first met Charles Montresor,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and it was explained to her that he was the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">son of a distinguished English nobleman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Despite his cleverness and other personal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">attractions, however, she had not been alto-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gether favorably impressed by his manifest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">attempts to win her favor. It was not until</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he became a close companion of her brother</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that she began to think better of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It was from Montresor, who posed as a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">man of wealth, that she first had learned that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her brother was in serious trouble. Prior to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this Montresor had twice proposed marriage</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to her, but each time she had told him that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">she found it impossible to reciprocate his af-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fection.	J</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  When, however, he told her that her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">brother, whom she loved more than any one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">else in all the world, was suspected of add-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing crime to his long list of indiscretions, she,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">flinging her own discretion to the winds, had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gone to Mr. Stanwood, the treasurer of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">company, and one of the enemies of her</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">father, for corroboration of the story. Stan-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">wood, pitying her distress, had told her only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that certain bonds were missing from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">office in which her brother was employed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   He had assured her, however, that Joseph</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">still was above suspicion. But Louise was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">not to be deceived. Suspecting that the sit-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">uation was more serious than Stanwood had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">represented it to be, she guardedly questioned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">her father concerning the missing bonds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">This had been the general manager's ground</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">for suspecting that she had obtained the in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">formation from her brother's friend, Mon-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tresor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Andrew W'arrington, as the result of care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful inquiries concerning the young English-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, had learned that, for some strange rea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son, he seemed to have no fixed place of</seg><seg type="columnLine">habitation, and that he practically had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">disowned by his English relatives. More</seg><seg type="columnLine">than this, he was reputed to be a card sharp,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and no longer found himself a welcome guest</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Chicago clubs which he had been wont</seg><seg type="columnLine">to frequent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Accordingly, the old man had directed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">daughter to cut him from her list of ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quaintances. This she would have been quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing to do had it not been for the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">she had begun to depend on Montresor to aid</seg><seg type="columnLine">her in an attempt to shield Joseph from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">disaster he had invited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her mother, who idolized her son, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louise's only confidante.

Montresor, disowned</seg><seg type="columnLine">by his family, was nothing more than a mere</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortune-seeker. Louise Warrington was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one of the most beautiful women in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Chicago society, but her father was reputed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be a millionaire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Attracted, therefore, no less' by her finan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cial prospects than by her personal qualities,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dashing young soldier of fortune was de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined to make her his wife.

One thing was certain, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, the bonds speedily found their way into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Montresor's possession--probably as a result</seg><seg type="columnLine">of die Englishman's promise to raise money</seg><seg type="columnLine">on them secretly--a sum sufficient to enable</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joseph to continue his reckless course of</seg><seg type="columnLine">speculation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Though it was certain that Montresor had</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least two confederates, who were more or</seg><seg type="columnLine">less informed concerning his relations witli</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joseph Warrington and the stolen bonds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">these men, being involved in the murder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">die son of Andrew Warrington, were scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">likely to speak of the affair to any one. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips of Montresor were sealed forever, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">before his death he had succeeded in taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">the life of Glen Streyer, the only man outside</seg><seg type="columnLine">the conspiracy who had appeared to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned the truth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Barney McGrane, attracted by the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the shot that had killed Streyer, had start-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ed in pursuit of the Englishman, and had</seg><seg type="columnLine">grappled with him until both had fallen from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the train; and thus the only person who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">informed concerning all of Erskine's move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments on the night the Cascade flier was</seg><seg type="columnLine">held up was also silenced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The only persons who now were in pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">session of facts that were likely to result in</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious trouble for Erskine, or a revelation of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the taking of stolen property from the Dale</seg><seg type="columnLine">Express-car, were the young man's father and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fireman.

The only comfort the young</seg><seg type="columnLine">man found in his review of the adventure lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the fact that his father appeared not to</seg><seg type="columnLine">have reported that he had seen the unmasked</seg><seg type="columnLine">faces of the men who had held up his train.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Neither did it appear that the fireman had</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoken.
