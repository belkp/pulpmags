            <seg type="columnLine"> Like most of his kind when m the open,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the man was hesitant, trembling, ready to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">him. He was armed with shield and bow</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> The three obeyed. They set off after the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Dyak, and he disclosed a runway they had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not previously seen, a winding, closely over-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">grown trail between walls of green, and ap-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">parently little used. Lawton brought up</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">all had readjusted itself, and he lost his un-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">easiness at once. In the course of the ensu-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Now they came to a steep hillside, rather</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">open of trees but thickly cloaked by giant</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">among these the trail zigzagged as it worked</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to the crest of the hill. To one of these</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sharp turns the little Dyak warrior trotted</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sharply, wheeled and was hidden from sight.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Behind him followed the Bugi and the two</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">bearers. As Lawton came to the turn, he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">heard a sharp cry from the men. He halted,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">peered forward, saved himself at the very</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">brink of a ragged and lightly covered pit.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Into this the three men had fallen headlong,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">From the pit rose a sharp medley of voices,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and then the Bugi tracker came into sight,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">climbing on the other two. He came head</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and shoulders out of the pit, scrambling.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Then from the trees leaped a sharp twang</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and the man fell back with an arrow trans-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He flung up his rifle, waited, eyes flitting</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">among the giant ferns. From his right</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">came a slight sound, and he whirled. As he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">soared a net. It fell about him fairly and</seg>

        <ab><seg type="columnLine">Adventure</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">rifle in the frantic but vain endeavor to clear</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">himself and then struggled as the net closed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about him. After a minute he relaxed, hav-</seg>

        </ab>
        
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Half a dozen little Dyaks poured down</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">around him. They looked in at the pit edge</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and laughed, then surrounded the captive</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Then, like a flash of light, Lawton moved.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He had been resting, preparing desperately,</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> They were already hurling themselves</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">A club sent him staggering, yet he whirled</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and opened fire, the heavy reports of the pis-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The others leaped into the brush and van-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">picked up his rifle, went to the edge of the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> A spear whistled, passing between his arm</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">So they meant to kill him, now that they</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">through his arm, and as the rifle fell he stag-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gered from the shock. An arrow hung there,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">barbed head gripped to the bone. He seized</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">if fiercely and tore it loose, despite the sick-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Another. He looked down and saw two of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">darted to the edge of the pit. The</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">flinging up his arms, fell a victim among his</seg>

        </ab>

            <seg type="columnLine"> The others learned caution. They came</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the owner struck it with a short wooden ba-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ton. The sound lifted, sharp and reverber-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">throat. The striker stared at him, then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whirled about and about like a stricken cat,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">clawing at one armpit. The other two Dy-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">out from the thicket of ferns and they fell</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">forward and lay quiet beside the one who</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had held the bell, and who lay gasping out</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his life. The bell-striker now stood motion-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">less, feeling the place under his armpit where</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the poisoned dart had gone in. He was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">doomed, and he did not even stir as the shots</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rang out, but stood wailing, hopeless.</seg>
