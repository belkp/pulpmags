HHE blood-red, five-pointed stars </p><p>emblazoned on the warm yellow </p><p>r	bows of the seven birch-bark</p><p> canoes which skirted Lake Su-</p><p>perior’s north shore advertised the fleet as </p><p>a Hudson’s Bay Company brigade. The </p><p>predominancy of James Bay Crees among </p><p>the crews told that the brigade was fresh from </p><p>one of the bay posts—in all probability </p><p>Moose Factory and that the route of travel </p><p>had been up the Moose and Missinaibie </p><p>Rivers, across the Height of Land and down </p><p>the Michipicoten to the broad and restless </p><p>bosom of Superior itself. </p><p> Also, the magnificence of the leading canoe</p><p>and the elaborate costumes of its occupants </p><p>proclaimed it a Factor’s craft. A splendid </p><p>six-fathom canoe, molded, sewn and gum- </p><p>med by master aborigine hands, it glided </p><p>lightly as foam under the urge of half a dozen </p><p>Indian paddlers, bowsman, steersman, two </p><p>middlemen paired forward, two paired aft. </p><p> In the bow fluttered the crimson flag of the</p><p>Ancient and Honorable Company. From </p><p>the stern streamed a long gonfalon of the </p><p>same shade, crisping and crackling in the wind </p><p>and slapping its pennant-like tip with a re- </p><p>sounding smack upon the passing wave crests. </p><p> From the paddle shafts blew streamers of.</p><p>gaudy wool, and these flying gleams of color </p><p>mingled with the glint of bright-beaded moc- </p><p>casins, red and blue leggings, flaming belts </p><p>and scarfs, brilliant fillets bound about the </p><p>black-haired heads carrying still more bril- </p><p>liant feathers, long, graceful plumes dyed in </p><p>violent colors, which slanted back on the </p><p>wearers’ shoulders and marked them as </p><p>trusted canoemen of a Factor. </p><p> The Factor himself, a young man com-</p><p>pared to the aging priest who shared his</p><p>place amidships, half sat, half reclined upon </p><p>a rich robe of snow-white ermine-skin.

His lower limbs were clothed in </p><p>short trousers of creamy deerskin tanned </p><p>soft and pliable as chamois and meeting Sum- </p><p>mer moccasins of the same material, high-cut </p><p>above the calf like Winter shoe-packs. </p><p> A massive frame he possessed and possessed</p><p>it proudly. Rugged like the neck was the head </p><p>that rose above it, the clean-shaven, well- </p><p>rounded jaw hollowed above the chin, the </p><p>mouth full and firm, nose straight and spa- </p><p>ciously nostriled for the big lungs, cheek- </p><p>bones high and well-fleshed, hollowing the </p><p>face again in front of the small close-set ears. </p><p> Hair short-cropped and clean of scalp, his</p><p>head was covered with a cap of soft amber </p><p>leather, the visor peak of which shaded his </p><p>gray eyes from the sun. Calm, self-reliant, </p><p>determined, yet with the flash of the youthful </p><p>spirit in them tempered by a wealth of ex- </p><p>perience, the eyes looked ahead over Su- </p><p>perior’s rollers toward the rock-ramparted, </p><p>spruce-sentineled shore, and his voice when </p><p>he spoke belied nothing of the masterfulness </p><p>of his frame, his face or his eye. </p><p> It was a deep voice, strong and resonant,</p><p>thrilling with a peculiar timbre which be- </p><p>trayed the fact that he was accustomed to </p><p>read aloud from books or perhaps make </p><p>oration to gatherings of traders and tribes. </p><p>It was the voice of one in authority, one who </p><p>supremely commands, decrees the law. </p><p> “Look, Father Andrews,” he exulted, ex-</p><p>tending a powerful brown, mobile hand, </p><p>“yonder is our island. It hides the bay be- </p><p>hind. Eugene Drummond will meet us in </p><p>Grande Portage to-night, and to-morrow we </p><p>shall be well 011 our way to our new district.” </p><p> “But are you sure your voyageur will not</p><p>fail you, Carlisle?” hazarded Father Andrews. </p><p> “Eugene never fails me,” declared Carlisle</p><p>with a shake of his head. “Last Fall when I </p><p>got news of my transfer this Summer from </p><p>Moose Factory to Cumberland House and </p><p>sent him in to spy out the land, 1 gave him </p><p>especial warning to be at Grande Portage </p><p>not later than July the ninth. 1 told him 1 </p><p>would reach there today, the ninth, on my </p><p>way to Cumberland House, and he was </p><p>under orders to lead the brigade on. No, he </p><p>will not fail!” </p><p> With a swing of his body he twisted his</p><p>head and nodded to his Ojibway steersman. </p><p> “The channel, Missowa!” he directed in</p><p>the Ojibway dialect. </p><p> “Ae, Factor,” returned Missowa who was</p><p>standing up to his work in the high-curved </p><p>stern. And in a different, guttural lone he </p><p>added the laconic word—“Canoe!” </p><p> “So?” demanded Carlisle, sitting erect to</p><p>stare under his hand. “Maybe it’s the Iro- </p><p>quois Indian who passed without seeing us as </p><p>we ate dinner down the shore.” </p><p> “No Iroquois,” decided the Ojibway steers-</p><p>man. “No Indian. White man. A man of </p><p>the French Company.” </p><p> “A Northwest Fur Company man, eh?</p><p>Yes, Missowa, yes—I believe you are right.” </p><p>For now he saw it was indeed the North- </p><p>west Fur Company’s livery that the approach- </p><p>ing paddler wore, a Northwest canoe he </p><p>paddled out through the molten wash of gold </p><p>that the westering sun spilled over the high </p><p>wooded mainland ridge where the Pigeon </p><p>River brawled down to Superior. </p><p> Like a Northwest voyageur passing out of</p><p>Grande Portage Bay upon the customary </p><p>evening fishing excursion the canoeman drift- </p><p>ed, his slender paddle stirring the golden wash </p><p>and gilding itself therein, his glistening yellow </p><p>craft slanting like a shaft of sunshine from</p><p>roller crest to roller trough and back again. </p><p> But once outside the channel where the</p><p>tree-crowned island which hid the bay </p><p>screened him from sight of any one on shore, </p><p>Carlisle noted a change in his attitude. </p><p>From the casual pose of a fisherman he sud- </p><p>denly threw himself into the pose of one who </p><p>runs a race, and paddling viciously, bore like </p><p>a surf-rider down upon the Factor’s craft. </p><p> Every time he retrieved his paddle after</p><p>the plunge he caused it to touch the lake sur- </p><p>face with a vicious forward poke which sent </p><p>the spray spattering like shot against his </p><p>canoe bow where the letters N. W. were </p><p>smeared in black pitch. The smear seemed </p><p>to annoy him, and at every splash the Factor </p><p>could hear him growl low in his throat. </p><p>Ambush </p><p>\ </p><p>5 </p><p> “Certainement,” he reiterated, “I change</p><p>you soon. I change you soon!” </p><p>TWENTY feet away, and still </p><p>in mid-career, he whirled his prow </p><p>with one flick of his paddle on to the </p><p>nose of a cross-sea, and there he poised spec- </p><p>tacularly, balancing with superb skill the </p><p>while he threw the tasseled cap from his head </p><p>into the canoe-bottom and followed it with </p><p>the red shirt stripped from his tody. Naked </p><p>to the waist around which buckskin trousers </p><p>were loosely belted, he stood silhouetted </p><p>against the flaming disk of the sun, his short, </p><p>squat, powerful body, tanned to a smoky </p><p>bronze, shining dull-red. </p><p> All the time his expressive hands gesticu-</p><p>lated. His volatile face, tanned like his </p><p>body, creased itself in a cunning grin so that </p><p>the milk-white teeth gleamed, the thin nos- </p><p>trils quivered, the cold-black eyes danced. </p><p>The grin became a chuckle, and he tossed his </p><p>head from side to side, streaming his raven </p><p>hair this way and that in wild disorder on the </p><p>whistling wind. </p><p> “Eh, w’at you t’ink, camarades?” he salut-</p><p>ed as he stamped upon the discarded shirt. </p><p> “Drummond!” ejaculated Carlisle and</p><p>Missowa in one breath. </p><p> “Oui,” laughed the voyageur, “an’ glad to</p><p>be rid of dat disguise! Once I scrape dat </p><p>diable pitch off ma bows an’ paint dem wit’ </p><p>de crimson star, I feel happy again.” </p><p>Carlisle glanced aside at the priest with a </p><p>quiet smile of vindication. </p><p> “I told you, Father, that Eugene would</p><p>not fail me,” he reminded. </p><p> “Aye, Paul,” nodded Andrews, “and may</p><p>all your subjects always be as faithful!” </p><p> The Factor turned back to Eugene Drum-</p><p>mond. </p><p> “But why did you not wait in Grande</p><p>Portage as I ordered?” he demanded. “Why </p><p>are you in that disguise and why have you </p><p>come down the lake to meet me?”</p><p> “De Nor’westaires close Grande Portage,”</p><p>announced Drummond, with a dramatic </p><p>sweep of his arm. “Nobody goes troo— </p><p>Hudson’s Bay men, Free-Traders, nor any- </p><p>body else.” </p><p> Something like an imprecation rumbled in</p><p>Carlisle’s throat. A wave of anger suffused </p><p>and darkened the sun-bronze of his face, and </p><p>his gray eyes widened, glinting hard. </p><p> “They would try that?” he blurted in a</p><p>voice so heavy that it was almost a bellow. </p><p>“They would dare?” </p><p> “Dey have dared,” assured the voyageur.</p><p>“Dey claim her as Nor’west ground. Ba </p><p>gar, Factor, dis beeg fight dat t’reatens so </p><p>long, she’s come at last. All troo de Sas- </p><p>katchewan w’ere you sent me spyin’ I be see </p><p>de signs.” </p><p> “What about our trade on the Saskatche-</p><p>wan now?” </p><p> “It’s wan long report, an’ I’m have to</p><p>geeve you de figures ashore, but to spik her </p><p>brief, I’m find de Nor’westaires be winnin’ </p><p>our trade. Oui, and dere’s anodder winnin’ </p><p>more dan us or de Nor’westaires.” </p><p> “A Free-Trader, eh?”</p><p> “Certainement, wan American frontiers-</p><p>man named Ralph Wayne.” </p><p> The six-fathom canoe gave a violent lurch.</p><p>Father Andrews had started suddenly, and </p><p>even as Carlisle gazed at him in mild surprise </p><p>the priest viciously smote the palm of his </p><p>left gauntlet down the back of his right. </p><p> “A mosquito under your glove, eh, Father?”</p><p>the Factor bantered, angry gravity disap- </p><p>pearing from his face under the impulse of </p><p>whimsical laughter. “It takes more than </p><p>canvas to stop those whining bloodsuckers.” </p><p>The priest answered nothing, but while he </p><p>rubbed his hand Eugene Drummond gazed </p><p>keenly at him across the twenty-foot water </p><p>gap. For Andrews had been a mystery to </p><p>Drummond ever since the first time he had </p><p>set eyes on him. That was twenty-one </p><p>years before when the priest had drifted up </p><p>Lake Huron into Fort Michillimackinac in </p><p>charge of the nine-year-old boy, Paul Carlisle. </p><p>The boy’s father, so Andrews gave it out, was</p><p>an English officer, Captain Charles Carlisle </p><p>of Butler’s Rangers, stationed at Niagara, </p><p>who had been killed in Butler’s raid upon the </p><p>Wyoming Valley and who, being a widower, </p><p>had left the boy in his charge. </p><p> That was all Eugene Drummond knew</p><p>of the history of either of the two, and the </p><p>passing of twenty-one years had not increased </p><p>his knowledge very much. True, he had seen </p><p>young Paul schooled, given entrance as a clerk </p><p>into the service of the great company, advanc- </p><p>ed little by little, transferred for a period to </p><p>England where he managed the London fur </p><p>sales and at the same time dipped into the </p><p>higher learning, and finally made Factor of </p><p>the important James Bay post of Moose </p><p>Factory whence he was now moved to be lord </p><p>of Cumberland House on the Saskatchewan. </p><p> Although Andrews was his companion and</p><p>guardian through it all, and Eugene Drum- </p><p>mond was in almost constant contact with </p><p>6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>them in the Hudson’s Bay Company’s ser- </p><p>vice, the voyageur had never solved the </p><p>intangible mystery that he fancied surrounded </p><p>the priest. Never in those twenty-one years </p><p>had Drummond fairly seen the man Andrews, </p><p>his figure or his face. </p><p> Always he looked upon a gown that</p><p>seemed to him to shroud and to conceal, upon </p><p>head-gear that was something of a mask. </p><p>Now, in Summer, it was the heavy dun cowl </p><p>and the thick mosquito veil. In Winter it </p><p>was the dun cowl and a fur-fringed, helmet- </p><p>like hood on his capote that proved just as </p><p>impenetrable. </p><p> Drummond always imagined that if An-</p><p>drews but dropped the mask his mystery </p><p>would dissolve, and the suspended possibility </p><p>continually fretted and irritated him. Mon </p><p>Dieu, why could not the man be human like </p><p>the rest of these large-thewed, tangible </p><p>Northmen? He was tired of watching an </p><p>elusive ghost flitting about in a black gown. </p><p>And why le tdiable had Andrews started and </p><p>lurched the canoe just now? </p><p> Was it because of a mosquito-bite or was</p><p>it because he, Eugene, had voiced the name </p><p>of Ralph Wayne? The voyageur determined </p><p>to watch and see, but as he went on to speak </p><p>further of the Free-Trader, his shrewd dark </p><p>eyes could read nothing, for the priest now </p><p>sat impassive, still rubbing lightly the thumb </p><p>of his left gauntlet along the back of his right. </p><p> “Dis man Wayne is de great powaire in</p><p>dat West,” elucidated Eugene, “an’ he be </p><p>built wan stronghold Fort Wayne to defend </p><p>hees district. He be de mightiest of de in- </p><p>dependents, de leader of dem all, an’ he be </p><p>de enemy, as mooch as de Nor’westaires, dat </p><p>we have to fight an’ absorb.” </p><p> Carlisle, listening, nodded ponderously, his</p><p>face clouded, his forehead ridged in a frown, </p><p>as if he weighed the voyageur’s news within </p><p>liimself and found it of heavy portent. His </p><p>nod was a sign of complete understanding and </p><p>an intimation for Eugene to go on. </p><p> “So as well as to warn you about Grande</p><p>Portage bein’ closed I be come out to tell you </p><p>of dis man Wayne. He be beeg menace to </p><p>de Nor’westaires, joost lak us, an’ dey’re</p><p>goin’ to light an’ absorb heem-queeck.” </p><p> “How quick?” demanded the Factor.</p><p> “Dis night. I sign on wit’ de Nor’west-</p><p>aires an’ wear deir clothes to get de infor- </p><p>mation, an’ I’m come down from de West </p><p>wit’ wan Lake Wimiipeg brigade. We pass </p><p>Wayne dis mornin’ on de Pigeon River. He </p><p>be on hees way to Montreal wit’ hees sea- </p><p>son’s furs. He make de Portage dis evenin’. </p><p>He ain’t know she’s closed. </p><p> “De Nor’westaires tell heem w’en he come</p><p>in, an’ den dey’re goin’ absorb heem on de </p><p>spot. An’ dat ain’t de worst, eider. Hees </p><p>daughter Joan Wayne be travelin’ wit’ </p><p>heem to Montreal an’ de Nor’west partners </p><p>goin’ seize her along wit’ her father. Wan </p><p>of de partners has hees eye on her dis long </p><p>taim, so dey tell me in de post.” </p><p> “Which partner?” Carlisle’s words slipped</p><p>forth, sharp as slitting steel. </p><p> “Richelieu!”</p><p> “Then this thing’s serious, Eugene,”</p><p>declared the Factor, “and it means that you </p><p>and I have to get into Grande Portage this </p><p>afternoon. We must meet Wayne’s brigade </p><p>at the other end of the Portage and warn him </p><p>and his daughter. We must do il for trade </p><p>and other reasons. You have your disguise </p><p>all ready. We’ll go ashore and fashion </p><p>mine.” </p><p> “Ba gar,” cried Drummond with a gri-</p><p>mace, “I’m t’ink I’m done wit’ dose diablc </p><p>trappings, but she’s de good cause an’ in de </p><p>good cause I’m glad to wear dem leetle </p><p>longaire. An’ you, Factor, I’m t'ink mebbe </p><p>you pick wan off de lake!” </p><p> He pointed straight down the north</p><p>shore. </p><p> “You see wan Iroquois Indian paddle in</p><p>to Grande Portage dis afternoon? Ver' </p><p>well, dat’s de guide of de Montreal mail </p><p>canoe. De courier send heem ahead de </p><p>last few miles to report de mail coinin’. </p><p>An’ I’m know she’s coinin’ soon, for yon- </p><p>daire’s paddles flashin’ lak loons’ wings off </p><p>de Temple Rock.” </p><p>THE Hudson’s Bay brigade lay</p><p>fairly in the sun glare streaming like </p><p>a path of gold across the heaving lake </p><p>swells. The sun itself was at their backs as </p><p>they all stared in the indicated direction, </p><p>and they could see without being readily </p><p>seen. </p><p> “By heavens, you’re right!” exclaimed</p><p>Carlisle. “It surely is the Montreal canoe. </p><p>I take your hint, Drummond. It is as the </p><p>courier I shall go in. Missowa,” command- </p><p>ing the Ojibway steersman, “lie in the </p><p>shelter of yon small island. We can not be </p><p>seen there, and there it does not matter to </p><p>us whether the Northwester takes the inside </p><p>or the outside passage. Eugene, fall in with </p><p>the other craft behind.” </p><p> At a spoken word from Missowa the port</p><p>Ambush </p><p>7 </p><p>paddlers dipped a strong forward stroke. </p><p>The starboard paddlers hung with a back- </p><p>water stroke as strong. The Factor’s craft </p><p>swung in a choppy half-circle and slanted off </p><p>for the lee of the island round the bouldered </p><p>point where the big rollers broke in a white </p><p>smother. Drummond, turning in behind </p><p>with the six smaller canoes, greeted the </p><p>motley crowd which filled them four men </p><p>to each craft, with a knowing grin. </p><p> James Bay Crees the Indians were, to-</p><p>gether with Ojibways and an occasional </p><p>Chippewa, all trusted post runners and </p><p>trippers of the company and all personally </p><p>known to the voyageur. Known likewise </p><p>were the white men, Hampton the younger </p><p>son of an English squire, Jarvis the street </p><p>arab picked up from the pavements of Lon- </p><p>don and in the service as a clerk, Wells the </p><p>country youth from a South-of-England </p><p>shire, Garry and Lea the two hardy Scots </p><p>from Inverness and Cromarty and the hardier </p><p>Highlander Lewis from the savage Hebrides. </p><p> Although Eugene had not seen any of them</p><p>for nearly eight months he recognized every </p><p>member of the brigade at a glance. Greatly </p><p>his volatile nature longed to hail each by </p><p>his familiar name and pass with each a fitting </p><p>and peculiar jest, but the Montreal canoe </p><p>was approaching and silence was the order </p><p>from Carlisle. </p><p> Not long had they to lie in ambush behind</p><p>the concealing island. Presently arose a </p><p>sound of water thrown from a pail upon the </p><p>lake surface in spaced gushes—the splash of </p><p>careless paddles. </p><p> “Line them out, Missowa!” Carlisle com-</p><p>manded in a whisper. </p><p> Like magic the eight canoes slipped from</p><p>concealment and, bow to stem throughout </p><p>the line, totally barred the channel passage </p><p>which the Northwest courier was taking for </p><p>smoother water. His two Iroquois canoe- </p><p>men brought up the craft suddenly with </p><p>bending paddle shafts and foaming blades, </p><p>while the courier himself, a swarthy-skinned </p><p>Frenchman, half arose in amazement from </p><p>amidships, either hand upon the gunwales. </p><p> “I am Bertand, Northwest mail courier</p><p>from Montreal,” he began in French, “and </p><p>you are-” </p><p> “Of Hudson’s Bay, as you see,” smiled</p><p>Carlisle, answering him in his own tongue. </p><p> “And you want?” &gt; •</p><p> “Your letters, your clothes and your</p><p>canoe. The letters will go on safely to </p><p>Grande Portage. Your clothes and canoe, </p><p>the same or better, will be returned to you. </p><p>Meanwhile you test quietly on shore here. </p><p>Do you agree?” </p><p> The courier’s eyes ran over the line, and</p><p>he shrugged his shoulders in resignation. </p><p> “But yes,”*he agreed, “because I am no</p><p>fool, especially in the face of superior num- </p><p>bers.” </p><p> “Very well,” nodded Carlisle, and waved</p><p>the Northwester’s Indian paddlers inshore. </p><p> “Eugene,” he directed, “put on your shirt</p><p>and cap and slip back as you came. It is </p><p>best for us to go in separately, and besides, </p><p>I leave it to you to get the Iroquois guide </p><p>who arrived this afternoon out of my way </p><p>when I come. Do it any way you can, but </p><p>be sure to get rid of him short of bludgeon- </p><p>ing him. I’ll waste no time other than to </p><p>arrive at a decent interval after you.” </p><p> “And I, Eugene,” put in Father Andrews</p><p>abruptly, “shall drift in alone a little ahead </p><p>of Paul.” </p><p> Taken unawares, the voyageur exclaimed</p><p>loudly in his French tongue and darted </p><p>Andrews another of those sharp wondering </p><p>looks with which he was wont to regard the </p><p>priest. Par Dieu, here was that mystery </p><p>again! What le diable, he demanded of </p><p>himself, did a priest want in mixing in such </p><p>affairs? </p><p> And even Carlisle regarded Andrews with</p><p>grave astonishment. </p><p> “You had better not risk it, Father,” he</p><p>advised. “You know there will be danger </p><p>in the business.” </p><p> “For you,” admitted Andrews, “but not</p><p>for me! Why should the Northwesters</p><p>bother their heads about a lone priest? </p><p>Does my breed not watch at birth of North- </p><p>westers and Hudson’s Bay men alike, min- </p><p>ister to their living needs alike and bury </p><p>them alike at death? I shall surely go, for </p><p>I have in mind what Eugene said about the </p><p>girl.” </p><p>CHAPTER II </p><p>GRANDE PORTAGE </p><p>DRESSED in the Montreal courier’s </p><p>clothes, the cheap black cotton shirt, </p><p>travel-soiled mackinaw trousers and cow- </p><p>hide moccasins, his face and hands stained </p><p>with herbs to a swarthy shade and his head </p><p>covered with a battered blue felt hat pulled </p><p>well down over his eyes, Carlisle sat </p><p>amidships in the courier’s canoe, the brown </p><p>8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>canvas, leather-bound mail-sack between </p><p>his knees as the craft rounded the island </p><p>which screened Grande Portage Bay. </p><p> Their own brilliant and picturesque cos-</p><p>tumes discarded for the drab gear of the </p><p>Iroquois canoemen, Missowa the Ojibway </p><p>steersman and Waseyawin the Cree bows- </p><p>man stoically paddled him in with their short </p><p>quick strokes. The canoe nosed into the </p><p>channel, a mile and one-quarter wide, and </p><p>the wilderness post broke suddenly upon his </p><p>vision. </p><p> On his left hand lay the sheltering island</p><p>with its rubble of great gnarled boulders </p><p>littering the beach, its long sloping point </p><p>sheering up and its rampart of bush stand- </p><p>ing solid above. On his right spread the </p><p>amphitheater of the bay, a crescent sweep of </p><p>shallow water, delicate green in color and </p><p>clear as air, edged by a low flat shore which </p><p>was backed in turn by terraced Laurentian </p><p>hills. </p><p> Tier upon tier they rose, the lowest three</p><p>hundred feet in height, the highest over one </p><p>thousand, covered with crowding forest of </p><p>birch and spruce and pine, thrusting out </p><p>virgin arms to embrace the lesser island. </p><p> Walling the back of the level shore land</p><p>and curving westward into the lake rose a </p><p>natural barrier, a forty-foot cliff of rock. </p><p>Along the eastern side foamed a small </p><p>stream, and hard by the stream the post </p><p>buildings crouched in the clearing. Under </p><p>the first hill tier they huddled, surrounded </p><p>by cedar palisades eighteen feet in height. </p><p> Tent villages and Indian cabins, spiraled</p><p>with the smoke of many fires, dotted the </p><p>eastern bank of the stream, while on the </p><p>meadows and terraces farther back grazed </p><p>cattle brought up the lakes in large boats </p><p>or driven overland by wood trails from St. </p><p>Paul on the Mississippi. </p><p> Over the bouldered channel-bottom, dis-</p><p>tinctly seen through the intensely clear </p><p>water, over the pebbled reach farther in- </p><p>shore Carlisle’s craft drove straight for a </p><p>long canoe pier whereon he glimpsed many </p><p>men at work loading or unloading canoes. </p><p>As he approached he noted that the pier was</p><p>built so as to form a canoe harbor. Fash- </p><p>ioned of great square-timbered crib-work, </p><p>spiked with iron, its foundation heavily </p><p>stone-weighted to hold it in the bay, it </p><p>was formed by two arms. </p><p> The long western arm or shoreway streaked</p><p>out from the curving sand beach into </p><p>the bay, meeting at an angle the short </p><p>eastern or harbor arm which extended but </p><p>half’-way back to land. Thus with only </p><p>a narrow water gate for entrance was en- </p><p>closed a canoe harbor which was safe for </p><p>fragile crafts in any storm. </p><p> Though only a slight swell disturbed the</p><p>channel outside, the harbor inside was </p><p>calmer still. It lay like a mill-pond parting </p><p>to Carlisle’s rippling bows as he passed the </p><p>fur sloop Otter, lashed to the pier just out- </p><p>side the water, and the arm of the pier it- </p><p>self, his eyes following the curving bilge of </p><p>the sloop from water-line to keel and marking </p><p>the bottom-most timbers of the crib-work </p><p>weed-grown in the clear green depths. Who </p><p>had built the old pier he did not know, for </p><p>here he touched upon ancient ground. </p><p> Perhaps, he thought, it was the wanderer</p><p>Dulhut who first of all established Grande </p><p>Portage post in 1670. Perhaps it was the </p><p>later adventurer Lanove who rebuilt Dul- </p><p>hut’s post in 1717. Or, again, it might have </p><p>been any one of the swarm of French and </p><p>Scotch traders who, after the fall of Quebec </p><p>to the English in 1759, pushed their trading </p><p>places along the Great Lakes to Detroit, </p><p>Michillimackinac, the Sault, the Kamin- </p><p>istiquia River and finally to Grande Portage </p><p>at the mouth of the Pigeon. </p><p> Later, and before Carlisle was born,</p><p>English traders foregathered there, and a </p><p>score of fur lords competed, bickered and </p><p>fought to finally amalgamate into the North- </p><p>west Fur Company with the avowed inten- </p><p>tion of slowly but surely sweeping the </p><p>Hudson’s Bay Company from the continent. </p><p>How well the Northwesters were succeed- </p><p>ing in this his own generation Carlisle </p><p>realized was'known only to a few like him- </p><p>self who occupied high posts in the service, </p><p>and his whole being thrilled at the trust </p><p>imposed on this few by the older corporation </p><p>when it commissioned them to throw down </p><p>the gage of decisive battle. </p><p> No ordinary routine incident was his</p><p>transfer from Moose Factory to Cumber- </p><p>land House but the first move in a mighty </p><p>struggle which could mean for his company </p><p>only one of two things: conquest or cession. </p><p>And how desperate must be that struggle </p><p>was borne in upon him by the plain truth </p><p>that here at the very outset he was setting </p><p>foot into a stronghold of his enemies almost </p><p>single-handed. _ </p><p> Enemies! His gray eyes lightened with</p><p>the anticipative gleam of conflict, but </p><p>abruptly came remembrance of the courier </p><p>Ambush </p><p>9 </p><p>rSle he had assumed and he motioned his </p><p>two pseudo Iroquois canoemen to work him </p><p>in against the crib. </p><p> A pause in the toil and a shout from the</p><p>toilers greeted him. All along the pier </p><p>within reach of his hand were tied the big </p><p>Rabiscaw freight canoes from Montreal, and </p><p>the men who worked them through the </p><p>Ottawa and French Rivers and the lake </p><p>route to Grande Portage were the ones un- </p><p>loading the cargoes they had brought: </p><p>arms and ammunition; knives, axes, blan- </p><p>kets; cottons from the looms of far Man- </p><p>chester, gaudy handkerchiefs of silk and </p><p>cotton; rope and twine, fishing nets and </p><p>lines; copper kettles and other cooking uten- </p><p>sils; beads and mirrors; kegs of rum; car- </p><p>rot tobacco, twist tobacco; tea, flour, sugar </p><p>—articles of food and trade in endless variety. </p><p> And the men themselves Carlisle recog-</p><p>nized as the giant Pork Eaters famed on the </p><p>trail, French voyageurs off the Ottawa River </p><p>and the parishes around, Iroquois Indians, </p><p>Caughnawaga Indians, fierce, untamed. </p><p>They yelled shrilly, the white men dancing </p><p>joyously at the arrival of the mail, but </p><p>Carlisle gave no answer other than to shake </p><p>the pouch suggestively as his canoe glided </p><p>close in at the end of the shoreway. There </p><p>he leaped out and, his two canoeman stalk- </p><p>ing at his back, strode across the flat and </p><p>in through the open gate of the palisade. </p><p>Leaving Missowa and Waseyawin in the </p><p>yard, he went on to the main warehouse </p><p>where he knew he would find the post- </p><p>keeper in charge. </p><p> With his blood leaping in his body he</p><p>stepped over the threshold, for he knew also </p><p>whom he would see sitting there. If his </p><p>disguise deceived David Thompson he was </p><p>safe to go where he willed in Grande Portage. </p><p> He had full confidence in his masquerade,</p><p>but at the same time the knowledge that </p><p>this was a critical test keyed him to severest </p><p>tension, poised his physical being for a dash </p><p>to escape 'if his confidence should not be </p><p>instantly justified. He carried the mail- </p><p>sack on his shoulder as he passed between the </p><p>door-jambs, shooting a glance under the sack </p><p>and his curved arm, seeking out the keeper. </p><p>AT SIGHT of a little office railed off </p><p>from the general warehouse, Car- </p><p>lisle’s fibers thrilled again, for be- </p><p>hind it he beheld Thompson, as ever astron- </p><p>omer and explorer rather than fur-trader, </p><p>poring over his maps and plans. </p><p> At the swish of the courier’s moccasins he</p><p>looked up. </p><p> “Ha! Art here then,” he nodded, hisWelsh</p><p>origin betraying itself in his speech. “Tuh </p><p>guide reported ’ee some hours ago. Put thy </p><p>sack down there. Whilst make tuh entry.” </p><p> As Thompson drew forward the journal</p><p>of the Post, Carlisle silently expelled a deep </p><p>breath. Thompson had passed him! Thomp- </p><p>son who for thirteen years had served in </p><p>the Hudson’s Bay Company with him, who </p><p>had lived the routine post life or taken the </p><p>far trail with him. Thompson with whom </p><p>he had built Manchester House and Win- </p><p>tered among the Indians and sojourned at </p><p>Samuel Heame’s old post, Cumberland </p><p>House, which was now to be his own. </p><p> Thompson with whom he had parted</p><p>regretfully when, on being ordered by Colen, </p><p>Factor at York Factory, to do less survey- </p><p>ing and get more trade returns, Thompson </p><p>had left the service in a heat and gone </p><p>over to the Northwest Company to under- </p><p>take a journey of discovery that shamed </p><p>Colen and all the Hudson’s Bay. How </p><p>Carlisle envied him and his new company </p><p>that feat—the survey west from Grande </p><p>Portage to Lakes Winnipeg and Winnipe- </p><p>gosis, south on the Assiniboine to the Souris, </p><p>across the plains to the Mandan villages </p><p>on the Missouri; thence to the Assiniboine </p><p>again, down to the Red River, across to the </p><p>Mississippi’s headwaters, northwest to Du- </p><p>luth on Lake Superior, ’round Superior’s </p><p>shore-line to the Sault and home once more </p><p>to Grande Portage. </p><p> Four thousand miles of virgin wilderness</p><p>mapped in ten months and to be fur-farmed </p><p>on the basis of the mapping by the North- </p><p>westers! The magnitude of it was astound- </p><p>ing, the attendant loss to the Hudson’s Bay </p><p>Company colossal. Holding his company’s </p><p>honor as he held his own, it hurt Carlisle </p><p>keenly to think that his former friend and </p><p>the company’s former servant had been </p><p>the cause. </p><p> But of Carlisle’s state of feeling Thomp-</p><p>son realized nothing. It was to his mind </p><p>the Montreal mail-courier who stood be- </p><p>fore him, and he dipped his pen in the pot of </p><p>brown ink. Carlisle, leaning sidewise </p><p>against the grill, his elbow on the mail- </p><p>pouch so that his big arm hid most of his </p><p>face, waited with a renewal of his trepida- </p><p>tion, the other entries of the journal, written </p><p>in the fine, cramped hand he knew so well, </p><p>dancing before his eyes. But in a moment </p><p>10 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Thompson finished recording the mail- </p><p>courier’s arrival and closed the book. </p><p> “Art free now,” he announced. “Thou</p><p>wilt rest four days. Then ’ee wilt start back </p><p>for Montreal.” </p><p> Carlisle flopped his battered hat-brim</p><p>in a nod of comprehension, swung on his </p><p>moccasined heels and passed out without a </p><p>word to where Missowa and Waseyawin </p><p>awaited him. </p><p> “The order is to start back for Montreal</p><p>in four days,” he informed them with a </p><p>grim smile. “In the meantime we are free </p><p>to amuse ourselves.” </p><p> “Good,” grunted Waseyawin in Cree.</p><p>“It is well for us to have that knowledge if </p><p>any man should ask.” </p><p> “Yes,” nodded Carlisle, “and now we</p><p>must get over the Portage as fast as we </p><p>can. Have you seen Eug— Ha! Yonder’s </p><p>his red shirt at the gateway. Come and </p><p>we’ll see how things stand.” </p><p> Carlisle and Drummond met casually</p><p>outside the palisade, exchanging brief </p><p>greetings and passing the news of the trail </p><p>after the custom of Northmen meeting as </p><p>strangers, then, still talking carelessly, </p><p>strolled off up the path which led to Port </p><p>Charlotte on the Pigeon’s bank. </p><p> Not till they were completely out of sight</p><p>of the post did they drop their careless pose, </p><p>and not till then did the Cree and the Ojib- </p><p>way who had been loitering behind presume </p><p>to catch up with them. </p><p> “What about the Iroquois guide?” Car-</p><p>lisle demanded abruptly of Drummond. </p><p> “He be served wit’ extra rum for hees</p><p>news of the mail cornin’, an’ I’m see dat </p><p>he get lee tie more w’en I come back,” </p><p>chuckled Eugene. “Mon Dieu—dancin’ </p><p>drunk—ain’t trouble you!” </p><p> “And Father Andrews?”</p><p> “He be gone on ahead,” informed Eugene.</p><p>“He ver’ mooch afraid you be delayed some-</p><p>how at de post, an’ he t’ink in dat case it </p><p>best for heem to go on to meet dem.” </p><p> “Then let us hurry up and join him!”</p><p>exclaimed Carlisle feverishly. “I want to </p><p>be there when Wayne and his girl arrive. </p><p>You lead off, Eugene.” </p><p> With the woodsman’s lope, swift though</p><p>easy, the lope that never tires, never varies, </p><p>Drummond led off, Carlisle at his heels, the </p><p>two Indians swaying lithely in the rear. </p><p>The Portage was nine miles in all, and for </p><p>the first half-dozen miles they climbed a </p><p>stiff grade, dropping into hundred-foot </p><p>gulches and clambering out again, fording </p><p>small creeks or thumping over them on </p><p>roughly timbered bridges, threading swampy </p><p>beaver meadows on paths of corduroy. </p><p> Then they topped the loftiest ridge</p><p>whence the land rolled down in gentle con- </p><p>volutions to the brink of the river three </p><p>miles away. Through the heart of a mag- </p><p>nificent pinery, speckled here and there </p><p>along the creeks with birch and poplar, </p><p>Carlisle and his companions ran upon a </p><p>trail the like of which was not to be found </p><p>upon the continent. It was the connecting </p><p>route between the Great Lakes and the vast </p><p>West beyond. </p><p> Below Port Charlotte the Pigeon River</p><p>ran wild, plunging in great cascades, un- </p><p>navigable by even the hardiest voyageurs. </p><p>There was no following it to its mouth, so </p><p>brigades from the West unloaded here and </p><p>packed over the nine-mile carry to Grande </p><p>Portage on Superior’s open water. </p><p> Every bale of fur gathered by the North-</p><p>westers in that gigantic wilderness from </p><p>Lake Superior on the east to the Pacific on </p><p>the west, from the Mississippi’s headwaters </p><p>on the south to the Arctic Ocean on the </p><p>north was freighted here by the Northmen’s </p><p>canoes and carried across on their backs. </p><p>Likewise all the supplies for that immensity </p><p>of river, lake, forest, mountain, plain and </p><p>barren, every pound of food and article of </p><p>trade, brought to Grande Portage by the </p><p>Rabiscaw canoes of Montreal, went across </p><p>in the opposite direction upon the same </p><p>muscled backs. </p><p> All along the rugged, twisting trail Car-</p><p>lisle and the others met or passed them in</p><p>the act, huge Northmen from the Pays </p><p>d’en Haut, Pork Eaters, Caughnawagas and </p><p>Iroquois from the Ottawa, monstrously </p><p>back-laden, working in the pack-straps in </p><p>relays, setting down their burdens every </p><p>thousand yards and breathing themselves as </p><p>they retraced their steps for more. </p><p> Packing for the glory of the packer and</p><p>a Spanish dollar a hundred pounds, they </p><p>sweated and toiled, coming and going, dot- </p><p>ting the up grade and the down and hiving </p><p>thickly ’round the Port Charlotte landing </p><p>where Carlisle and his three men came out </p><p>on the river. </p><p> “Ba gar, we be none too soon,” panted</p><p>Drummond in a low voice. “Yondaire’s </p><p>Ralph Wayne’s brigade.” </p><p> He pointed toward the mid-current of</p><p>the Pigeon, and Carlisle glimpsed half a </p><p>Ambush </p><p>ii </p><p>dozen canoes swerving in for the landing. </p><p> “And there’s Father Andrews close by the</p><p>water’s edge!” exclaimed Carlisle. “Slow </p><p>down to a walk and scatter out a little. </p><p>And we’d better take packs as we go. </p><p>Load up with anything handy and drop </p><p>where 1 drop mine.” </p><p> FROM the spot where the last relay</p><p>had deposited the loads bound west- </p><p>ward over the Portage they took up </p><p>bundles and sacks of provisions and, bent </p><p>under them as if they were regular burden </p><p>bearers, shuffled down through the crowd of </p><p>Northwesters on the river bank. Carlisle </p><p>dropped his pack directly behind the priest, </p><p>and the others following suit, they all </p><p>straightened up, stretching their arms in </p><p>the air, pretending to breathe themselves </p><p>as they idly watched the incoming brigade. </p><p> “We’re here, Father,” Carlisle whispered at</p><p>Andrews’s back, “and so is the Free-Trader, </p><p>I see. Are you going to tell him or shall I?” </p><p>“I must, Paul,” returned Andrews in a </p><p>voice of intense gravity. “It may seem </p><p>strange to you, but neither Wayne nor his </p><p>daughter must know your real name—yet. </p><p>You may wonder, but I tell you in all faith </p><p>it must be so. It is important—more, it is </p><p>vital to your interests and Wayne’s as well!” </p><p>“I must be to him a courier? That is, </p><p>for the present?” </p><p> “Yes. You believe me when I say it is</p><p>imperative?” </p><p> “Of course, Father. You know I have</p><p>faith in your slightest word.” </p><p> “All right, let me do the talking. The</p><p>canoes are almost in.” </p><p> The prow of the foremost craft all but</p><p>grazed the landing, then swung broadside </p><p>in to it under skilful paddle-strokes. From </p><p>amidships a man of fifty-five or so, clad in </p><p>buckskin garments unornamented except </p><p>for the customary fringes, stepped cleanly </p><p>out upon the shore. Carlisle, scrutinizing </p><p>him eagerly, was struck by his great height. </p><p>Although the Hudson’s Bay Factor himself </p><p>stood fully six feet, this man topped him </p><p>by four inches, and the impression of height</p><p>was intensified by his lanky erectness. </p><p> Clean-flanked, sloping-shouldered, long-</p><p>armed, he seemed to poise in the air rather </p><p>than to stand upon his battered moccasins. </p><p>His head was bare, and from it the brown </p><p>hair, luxuriant in spite of his advancing </p><p>years, ran down in waves and curls almost </p><p>to his shoulders. His face was darkened by </p><p>exposure to a mahogany shade in which the </p><p>only high lights that showed were the golden </p><p>flash of odd-colored eyes, eyes between a </p><p>fawn and a green hue, and the sheen of the </p><p>copper-colored mustache which swept down </p><p>in long heavy curves over the grim mouth. </p><p> Every inch a frontiersman, Carlisle sensed</p><p>about him that greatness of spirit which </p><p>ineffaceably dings to those who have dared </p><p>the wilderness in all its immensity, all its </p><p>ruthlessness, all its cruelty, who have dared </p><p>it and conquered and inevitably in the con- </p><p>quering brought the depths of their natures </p><p>to the surface. Even while Carlisle swiftly </p><p>appraised him, he stooped with agility one </p><p>hand on the canoe gunwale, the other held </p><p>toward his daughter to steady her as she </p><p>disembarked. </p><p> Out upon the landing she leaped beside</p><p>him, and although her head scarcely reached </p><p>to his shoulder Carlisle recognized in her </p><p>swelling-hipped, full-bosomed figure the </p><p>erect, agile, supple poise of her father. </p><p>It showed in the curve and grace of her </p><p>ankles and calves, encased in elk-skin moc- </p><p>casins and revealed by the short gray wool </p><p>canoe skirt she wore. It showed, too, in the </p><p>straight arms, whose swell of forearm and </p><p>upper arm but enhanced the direct line of </p><p>her limbs. </p><p> But her looks, he knew, she must have</p><p>inherited from her mother. For here was no </p><p>skin of swarthy shade or mahogany tan. </p><p>Fair as Northland snows was the face re- </p><p>vealed as she threw back the veil of mos- </p><p>quito netting ’round her head. Indeed, so </p><p>pallid shone her complexion in contrast </p><p>with her father’s, that it seemed to be wanly </p><p>bleached, and her hair, yellow, wheaten, </p><p>and spun-gold all in one—like the mingling </p><p>hues of birchen leaves in Autumn—seemed, </p><p>against his brown hanging curls, to be like- </p><p>wise bleached. </p><p> But Carlisle was aware that the art of</p><p>bleaching did not extend north to latitude </p><p>fifty-four, and besides, the glow and sheen </p><p>of both skin and hair told that they were </p><p>natural, as natural as the lake-blue laughing </p><p>eyes or the spray of crimson which tinged </p><p>her cheeks at either side of the delicately </p><p>chiseled nose. </p><p>“GRANDE PORTAGE at last, </p><p>father!” she exclaimed, laughing so </p><p>that her red lips parted whimsically, </p><p>poutingly over splendid teeth. “It is good </p><p>to get the canoe cramps out!” </p><p>12 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Yes, Joan,” nodded her father, a smile</p><p>cracking the grim mohogany of his face, </p><p>“it’s been a long day. But here’s a nine- </p><p>mile walk to stretch your legs.” </p><p> “You’ve come far then; I take it,” put</p><p>in Father Andrews rising from the bundle </p><p>upon which he sat and extending his hand </p><p>to the frontiersman. </p><p> “From Fort Wayne on Sturgeon Lake,”</p><p>replied the other, returning his grip. “I’m </p><p>Ralph Wayne the Free-Trader, and this is </p><p>my daugher Joan. We’re bound to Mon- </p><p>treal. And you, I see by your netting, have </p><p>followed the mosquito-pestered trail too. </p><p>Where are you bound, Father?” </p><p> “But here,” responded the priest, turning</p><p>his head to see that none of the North- </p><p>westers were in hearing and speaking in a </p><p>lower voice. “I am Father Andrews, and </p><p>I’ve come with a warning. Richelieu and </p><p>his partners have closed the Portage as </p><p>private ground. They will seize you at the </p><p>post. The partners want your trade, I </p><p>understand, and Richelieu—well,” with a </p><p>nod aside at Joan, “Richelieu wants some- </p><p>thing else.” </p><p> Into the fawn-green eyes in the mahogany</p><p>gloom of Wayne’s face blazed a light like the </p><p>flare of lightning in a murky cloud. In- </p><p>stinctively his hand fell upon Joan’s arm in </p><p>a protecting gesture, his tall frame straight- </p><p>ened another inch, and his sweeping mus- </p><p>taches began to quiver as a precursor of </p><p>violent speech. </p><p> But Andrews was quick to forestall him.</p><p>“Be careful,” the priest warned hurriedly, </p><p>“be very careful. These Northwesters all </p><p>know what is going to happen to you, but </p><p>don’t precipitate it by letting them know </p><p>that you know. Is there any chance of </p><p>your getting back up the Pigeon by a swift </p><p>dash now? Are there any of their fleets </p><p>afloat?” </p><p> “Two of their Winnipegosis brigades</p><p>behind me,” rasped Wayne in a voice </p><p>virulent with bitterness and rage. “If </p><p>things are as you say, they’ll be notified </p><p>too. There’s no chance to pass them.” </p><p>“Then there is nothing left to do but try</p><p>for escape at the Superior end,” decided </p><p>Andrews. “You won’t be able to count on </p><p>your own men, since they’ll be watched or </p><p>overpowered, but you may count on me and </p><p>these four behind me: the courier, the voya- </p><p>geur and the two Indians. Trust them as </p><p>you would me!” </p><p> “Thank God for your kindness and your</p><p>warning, Father!” breathed Wayne, turning </p><p>in the middle of his words as if from some </p><p>trivial conversation to loudly order his men </p><p>to lift the canoes and adjust the fur bales in </p><p>tump lines for packing over to Grande Por- </p><p>tage. “Thank God for it, I say, on account </p><p>of my girl. If we can manage to get her </p><p>safely through, for the rest I do not care.” </p><p>“But I do, father,” declared Joan in a </p><p>tremulous voice. “If I get through, you </p><p>must too.' Otherwise I don’t want to.” </p><p> And as the white men of Wayne’s brigade,</p><p>men of the Mississippi, men of the Missouri, </p><p>men of the Red—independent-spirited ad- </p><p>venturers like himself—together with his </p><p>Crees and Chippewayans, shuffled off under </p><p>their burdens of canoes and furs on the up- </p><p>grade from Port Charlotte, the girl flashed </p><p>a glance at the four whom Father Andrews </p><p>had named as to be trusted. </p><p> “Tell me,” she urged intensely, with the</p><p>painful desire of one who will know the </p><p>worst, “is there any real chance of getting </p><p>through?” </p><p> Her beseeching eyes went past Drum-</p><p>mond, past Missowa and Waseyawin as </p><p>if the magnetic personality of Carlisle, hid- </p><p>den though it was, drew them to himself, </p><p>and for the first time since he had assumed </p><p>the courier’s disguise the Factor silently </p><p>cursed his masquerade. </p><p> “By heavens yes, a real chance,” he</p><p>swore fervently, “for rather than see harm </p><p>come to you, I myself will sheathe a knife </p><p>in Richelieu’s heart!” </p><p>CHAPTER III </p><p>AN INTERRUPTED MARRIAGE SACRAMENT </p><p>CARLISLE and his men running empty- </p><p>handed had loped over the Portage in a </p><p>little better than an hour, but it was more </p><p>than a two-hours’ walk back for the laden</p><p>brigade, and the laggard Summer dark came </p><p>down as they neared the post. All the way </p><p>across the two groups had kept well sepa- </p><p>rated so as not to invite the notice or arouse </p><p>the suspicions of the trooping Northwesters </p><p>who at the end of their day’s work were </p><p>flocking back to Grande Portage, and in the </p><p>ordinary routine of superintending the pack- </p><p>ing, Ralph Wayne had managed to let each </p><p>member of his brigade know what to expect. </p><p> That no Northwester attempted to mo-</p><p>lest them yet or even speak to them further </p><p>than to pass the customary greetings of the </p><p>Ambush </p><p>13 </p><p>trail did not make them any easier in mind, </p><p>for it was plain that throughout every mile </p><p>of the nine they were unostentatiously kept </p><p>under vigilance. One large body straggled </p><p>ahead of them, one behind them upon the </p><p>winding path, and when they reached the </p><p>square of the palisades they became aware </p><p>that there were crowds of men as a pre- </p><p>ventive of flight between them and the </p><p>open beach. </p><p> Instinctively the two groups which policy</p><p>had kept separate now united against a </p><p>common menace. Carlisle gradually worked </p><p>his way to the head of the line, close to </p><p>Joan Wayne, while Eugene Drummond, </p><p>Missowa and Waseyawin glided silently at </p><p>his back. Hard at their heels came the </p><p>Free-Trader and the priest, themselves </p><p>trailed by the thirty-odd brigade men </p><p>bunching together under their packs of fur. </p><p> As they passed into the stockade a ribald</p><p>clamor greeted them, sounds of men singing </p><p>and shouting and roaring with laughter, all </p><p>sharply punctuated by the explosive pop- </p><p>ping of corks and the crash of a shattered </p><p>wine-glass on hard boards. The babel rose </p><p>from a big residence building which they </p><p>were skirting, and as Carlisle, the girl and </p><p>the rest came into line with its row of open, </p><p>lighted windows the brilliant scene within </p><p>the dark-walled building flashed vividly </p><p>upon their eyes. </p><p> Under flaring hanging lamps ’round many</p><p>feasting tables, spread up and down the long </p><p>hall, were gathered together one hundred or </p><p>more officers of the Northwest Company, </p><p>interpreters, guides, clerks, Wintering part- </p><p>ners from the West meeting here the execu- </p><p>tive partners from the East, the most ag- </p><p>gressive of the thirty-five lords of Beaver </p><p>Hall. </p><p> Among the rows of faces Carlisle glimpsed</p><p>many known to him, MacGillivray and </p><p>Sager from Fond du Lac, Todd from Fort des </p><p>Prairies, James McKenzie, Grant, McTav- </p><p>ish and McLeod from English River and </p><p>the Athabasca, McKay from the Swamp </p><p>Country, Roderick McKenzie and the rest </p><p>of his cronies from Montreal and lastly, </p><p>Simon Richelieu, black-bearded of face, ram- </p><p>rod-like of figure, resplendent in the uniform</p><p>of a French colonel, reckless, voluble, ad- </p><p>dressing half a dozen different persons at </p><p>the same moment. </p><p> There they sat noisily devouring such</p><p>epicurean marvels as bison’s hump, moose’s </p><p>nose, beaver’s tail, wassailing in the finest </p><p>Italian, French and Spanish wines and </p><p>flinging their souls out in laughter and song. </p><p>But even as those outside gazed and passed </p><p>the windows, the clamor stilled with strange </p><p>abruptness. It was evident that a mes- </p><p>senger had entered and spoken, that Wayne’s </p><p>unostentatious warders upon the Portage </p><p>had communicated with their roistering </p><p>overlords. The company rose in a body </p><p>and, Simon Richelieu in the lead, poured out </p><p>upon the steps and sand terrace of the </p><p>building. </p><p> Richelieu stood upon the outer step, the</p><p>lamplight falling upon his gay uniform, </p><p>laughing like a sardonic devil in his black </p><p>beard and bowing his ramrod body from the </p><p>hips. </p><p> “Welcome, Ralph Wayne!” he chuckled.</p><p>“Welcome, Mademoiselle Joan. The sup- </p><p>per is ready. Mon Dim, but I thought you </p><p>were never coming!” </p><p> “The devil!” exclaimed Wayne, startled</p><p>in spite of forewarning. “What does this </p><p>pleasantry mean?” </p><p> “I’ll tell you,” spat Richelieu, the iron in</p><p>him showing up through his levity as he </p><p>shoved his brutal, domineering face into </p><p>Wayne’s. “I’ll tell you, Ralph. ^ For sev- </p><p>eral years we have tried to buy jTour trade, </p><p>which you switch in secret to the Hudson’s </p><p>Bay-” </p><p> “You lie, Richelieu!” thundered Wayne.</p><p> Richelieu, his face contorted, doubled up</p><p>his arm as if to strike but with a glance at </p><p>the girl thought better of it and flung out his </p><p>open hand with a dramatic snap of the </p><p>fingers. </p><p> “There! But I will have the Indian</p><p>whippers whip that out of your hide in the </p><p>post cellars to-night!” </p><p> “No, no, Colonel,” cut in the voice of</p><p>David Thompson who arrived suddenly out</p><p>of nowhere and the dark, “wilt have no </p><p>whipping in my post whilst I am keeper.” </p><p> “Ciel, Thompson, but your tongue is</p><p>ready! If it were not that we need your </p><p>map-making I would have you drafted for </p><p>that.” </p><p> “But I knows ’ee do need tuh maps,”</p><p>nodded Thompson. “So wilst have no </p><p>whippin in tuh cellars. Besides, would </p><p>break tuh wine bottles.” </p><p> “Well spoken, whatever, Dawy,” grinned</p><p>James McKenzie, while the company roared </p><p>and Richelieu, himself catching the con- </p><p>tagion, relaxed into laughter again at the </p><p>public criticism of his own habits. </p><p>14 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Thompson, for that thrust I forgive you,</p><p>and Ralph Wayne escapes,” he chortled. </p><p>“Are you not glad, Ralph? As I was say- </p><p>ing, we need your trade, and so because it is </p><p>easier to take you here than at Fort Wayne </p><p>we do so. Also because Mademoiselle Joan </p><p>would as usual flout me there I take her here </p><p>where there is no flouting. Understand me? </p><p>Hola—couriers, voyageurs, metis all—seize </p><p>them!” </p><p>INSTANTLY Carlisle’s arms were </p><p>’round Joan Wayne, making show of </p><p>seizing her before any one else could </p><p>touch her. And swift as he, Eugene Drum- </p><p>mond, Missowa and Waseyawin laid rough </p><p>hands on Wayne and held him fast. Seeing </p><p>the principals apparently in the grasp of </p><p>their own men, the rest of the Northwesters </p><p>pounced in a body upon Wayne’s laden </p><p>brigade, and before they could drop their </p><p>canoes and packs their arms were gripped </p><p>from either side by many hands. </p><p> “Off to the cellars with the canoemen,”</p><p>ordered Richelieu, and pushing, fighting, </p><p>cursing, making vain efforts to break from </p><p>the grip of so many hands, Wayne’s brigade </p><p>swayed out into the dark. </p><p> “Now, Ralph Wayne, come and eat sup-</p><p>per with me, you and Mademoiselle Joan, </p><p>and see if a full stomach and a bottle of good </p><p>wine will make you change your mind. If </p><p>you show sense, you may come back to my </p><p>Sturgeon Lake post with Joan and me. If </p><p>you do not show sense, you will go to join </p><p>your men in the cellars while Joan goes back </p><p>alone with me.” </p><p> The moment he heard the words, Father</p><p>Andrews pushed through the crowd past his </p><p>friends, elbowing his way to the front. </p><p> “Richelieu is half drunk,” he whispered to</p><p>them as he went. “They are all half drunk </p><p>—all but Thompson. Mark my speech and </p><p>follow my move!” </p><p> “Moil Dieul” exclaimed Richelieu, star-</p><p>ing at Andrews in surprise. “Who is this? </p><p>But wait. I remember now. You are the </p><p>Jesuit missionary who asked a night’s shel- </p><p>ter at the post.” He gave Andrews a </p><p>friendly hand. “Donald McKay spoke of</p><p>you this afternoon, but I did not catch the </p><p>name.” </p><p> “An'rews!”</p><p> “Par Dial, yes! I know more of that</p><p>name than you think perhaps. How dis- </p><p>courteous of me not to have inquired better. </p><p>A famous name, Father, and a herald of </p><p>deeds. I have heard of you for years. You </p><p>go among the men of the rival Hudson’s </p><p>Bay, too, eh?” </p><p> “Chiefly to bury them,” answered An-</p><p>drews gravely. </p><p> “Ho! Ho! You are a wit, Father. I</p><p>had heard that. You must join us in the </p><p>meal. You must sit at my table with </p><p>Mademoiselle and her father. Comments </p><p>Was there anything else you wanted?” </p><p> “I just wanted to ask about the maiden,”</p><p>parleyed the priest, calmly turning to Joan </p><p>Wayne. “It occurred to me that she may </p><p>not be willing to have you carry her off like a </p><p>buccaneer to your Sturgeon Lake post.” </p><p>“Ah! Mademoiselle is, Father, only she </p><p>does not know that she is.” </p><p>“I only know,” flashed Joan with a hate </p><p>and passion in her voice that bit like flame, </p><p>“that as sure as you put out one finger to </p><p>touch me, you will feel a knife in your heart.” </p><p>But Richelieu roared in ridicule. </p><p> “Ciel, listen to that!” he pooh-poohed.</p><p>“What a death from gentle hands! And, </p><p>par Dieu, I believe it would be worth it. </p><p>Would it not, Father Andrews? Name of a </p><p>name, yes! I do not care to remember the </p><p>number of months she has driven me crazy </p><p>with her coy refusals and her floutings. </p><p>And is she a mate to hide away or be </p><p>ashamed of? </p><p> “Diable, just look at her there—just look!</p><p>But come, my stomach’s hungering for my </p><p>unfinished supper, and I can’t wait much </p><p>longer. Come, Father; come all!” </p><p> “But it is not right for casual travelers to</p><p>take up space at your tables to the exclu- </p><p>sion of your own men who have worked hard </p><p>all day,” demurred Andrews to gain time. </p><p>“Here are packers whom I see to be raven- </p><p>ous for their meal, and I who have cause to</p><p>know something of hunger will keep no man </p><p>waiting while I eat in his place.” </p><p> “These do not eat with the officers,”</p><p>Richelieu pointed out, “and they do not all </p><p>eat at once. Neither is their fare what ours </p><p>is, although at the same time it is good </p><p>enough for them.” </p><p> “For them?” echoed Andrews. “Are we</p><p>all not dwellers in the wilderness together? </p><p>And is one man not as good as another? </p><p>Richelieu, I have heard of you, even as you </p><p>have heard of me, and I know you are no </p><p>niggard. Therefore I ask a favor. It is a </p><p>special occasion, so let these men eat at once </p><p>with us and eat of the best you have. When </p><p>strangers come, men keep an open board.” </p><p>Ambush </p><p>15 </p><p> “Mon Dieu, no, I am no niggard,” Rich-</p><p>elieu boasted pompously. “I grudge them </p><p>nothing, Father, for they serve me well, and </p><p>they shall have what you say and all that you </p><p>say. Only, none of the Grande Portage </p><p>buildings will hold one-tenth of their </p><p>number.” </p><p> “True, yet the stockade ground here will</p><p>hold them all,” suggested Andrews, craftily </p><p>straining for the point he wished to gain. </p><p>“And it is lighted like day with the canoe- </p><p>men’s fires on yonder beach. Have canoe- </p><p>men and all gather here to eat and let every </p><p>man of your company see for himself how </p><p>fair a mate sits at your table.” </p><p> “del, but you have spoken it, Father!”</p><p>cried Richelieu, swallowing the bait offered </p><p>to his conceit, to his love of pomp and dis- </p><p>play. “Thompson, send out the word to </p><p>the beach for them all to gather within the </p><p>stockades. They can sit on the steps and </p><p>the sand terrace, and I will have them </p><p>served with food and wine where they sit.” </p><p> Thompson himself strode out of the stock-</p><p>ade ground and moved amid the mob across </p><p>the level sand beach toward the shoreway of </p><p>the long canoe pier. At his word the canoe- </p><p>men, leaving their fires with joyous whoops </p><p>over their good fortune, surged up the beach </p><p>and into the stockade ground. </p><p> “Just when Richelieu turns to lead us in—</p><p>run for the sloop!” was all Andrews had op- </p><p>portunity to whisper to Carlisle who, under </p><p>Richelieu’s watchful eye, still had Joan by </p><p>the arms. </p><p> Carlisle passed the whisper to Eugene</p><p>Drummond, Missowa and Waseyawin who </p><p>likewise had their hands upon the Free- </p><p>Trader, and they all felt their tense nerves </p><p>thrill vibrantly as the last of the mob of </p><p>canoemen came in through the gateway. </p><p>It required only a slight shifting of their </p><p>gaze to mark the eastern cribwork of the </p><p>old canoe pier where the fur sloop Otter, </p><p>empty after its run to the Falls of St. Mary, </p><p>lightly rubbed its rail against the timbers. </p><p> The harbor water within the angle of the</p><p>pier and also the curve of the sand beach </p><p>nearer at hand were lined with canoes. The</p><p>beach itself, starred with scores of camp- </p><p>fires sending their crimson flares across the </p><p>lake, was deserted as Andrews had schemed. </p><p> Here, stamping on the sand terrace,</p><p>climbing on the steps were the men who had </p><p>peopled it, eleven hundred and twenty en- </p><p>rolled canoemen—thirty-six brigades—the </p><p>total strength of the Northwest Company’s </p><p>boatmen drawn from the world’s outposts </p><p>and massed together in one spot, three hun- </p><p>dred and fifty Rabiscaw paddlers of Mon- </p><p>treal, in company with all the countless In- </p><p>dians of the district gathered for the yearly </p><p>trade, the carousal and the carnival. </p><p> Never had Carlisle gazed on so weird and</p><p>motley a horde of Northmen and Indians </p><p>and nowhere else on the continent could </p><p>Richelieu have marshaled such a retinue. </p><p>For these men Canada and the Atlantic </p><p>States were only faint memories somewhere </p><p>East. The Church for them was an im- </p><p>pression fainter still. No man-made law </p><p>had they ever seen forged farther than the </p><p>Sault. </p><p> They drew breath in an unclaimed land,</p><p>and rum and bedlam rioted in their hearts. </p><p>Only their fear of Richelieu postponed </p><p>their songs and their brawls as they jostled </p><p>up for their unexpected feast, and in the </p><p>moment of their silence, Richelieu raised his </p><p>voice from the threshold of his dining hall. </p><p> “Ho! Northmen from the Pays d’en</p><p>Haut, and you Rabiscaw paddlers from </p><p>Montreal,” he smirked. “Voild! Here is a </p><p>priest with a kind heart, and on his thought- </p><p>ful suggestion I-” </p><p> The snoring surge of waters swiftly</p><p>cloven, a triumphal yell out of the lake- </p><p>ward dark, the thump of a quickly-wielded </p><p>paddle upon a canoe gunwale interrupted </p><p>Richelieu, and the next instant a lone birch- </p><p>bark craft tore through the water gate of the </p><p>pier and spilled its single occupant upon the </p><p>beach outside the stockade. </p><p> “Who in the devil are you?” bellowed</p><p>Richelieu, glaring truculently as the in- </p><p>truder bounded in through the open gateway </p><p>and drove like a wedge up the jammed steps. </p><p> “Bertand—Montreal mail courier—way-</p><p>laid—just escaped from the Hudson’s Bay</p><p>men’s camp down the north shore,” panted </p><p>the courier in French, his furtive eyes, filled </p><p>with the streaming lamplight, scanning </p><p>them over. “And there,” leveling an excited </p><p>finger at Carlisle, “is their Factor wearing </p><p>my very clothes!” </p><p>CARLISLE, his left hand keeping </p><p>its hold on the arm of Joan Wayne, </p><p>launched his mighty body forward. </p><p>His right foot shot into Bertand’s chest, his </p><p>right fist into the black beard of Richelieu, </p><p>and both men, catapulted back off the </p><p>steps, went rolling down the sand terrace </p><p>among the massed men. </p><p>i6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Swift as he struck he wheeled with the</p><p>girl, to find that his companions had been </p><p>equally quick. As one man they had </p><p>vaulted over the railing of the steps, sheer </p><p>over the heads of the crowd sitting on the </p><p>terrace beneath, knocking flat a dozen in </p><p>the outer rank who stood directly in the </p><p>way. </p><p> Before they had fairly landed, Carlisle,</p><p>gathering Joan in his arms, leaped after </p><p>them. He alighted ankle-deep in the sand, </p><p>plowing a furrow for yards in the loose, </p><p>sugary grains, and without halting his im- </p><p>petus plunged for the opening in the stock- </p><p>ade. </p><p> With a yell of exultation his five com-</p><p>rades clanged it behind him and dropped </p><p>the bar in place on the outside just as the </p><p>roaring avalanche of Northmen brought up </p><p>against it. Then like fleeing deer they were </p><p>across the beach, out on the pier and into the </p><p>fur sloop Otter, Missowa and Waseyawin </p><p>severing the hempen hawsers with their </p><p>sheath knives, Drummond kicking loose the </p><p>tiller and Wayne and the priest running up </p><p>the big mainsail with a jerk. </p><p> The breeze had shifted at dark. It now</p><p>blew steadily from the south, snoring in </p><p>through the channel, and like a live, pal- </p><p>pitant thing the vessel responded to its </p><p>urge. They could see Richelieu’s horde of </p><p>Northmen climbing the eighteen-foot pali- </p><p>sades and dropping to the ground outside, </p><p>but before these could reach the water’s </p><p>edge the mainsail tightened with a clatter of </p><p>blocks, the boom uprose and the Otter heeled </p><p>over as she left the pier. </p><p> Ashore reigned bedlam, pandemonium,</p><p>all the vast motley crowd shuttling crazily </p><p>in the light of scores of fires, shouting, ex- </p><p>plaining, commanding and countermanding. </p><p>Northwest officers were dashing out on the </p><p>pier, yelling directions as they ran, McTav- </p><p>ish, MacGillivray and Todd in the lead, and </p><p>fragments of their shouts rang stridently on </p><p>the ears of those in the boat upon the </p><p>channel. </p><p> “-, off in the sloop!” McTavish was</p><p>roaring. “Launch the canoes and stop</p><p>them!” </p><p> “Condemned scoundrels, those four—”</p><p>it was the shrill declamation of Todd—“and </p><p>the rascally priest as well!” </p><p> And, loudest of all, the bull moose call of</p><p>MacGillivray demanding of his partner— </p><p> “Sager, Sager, where in perdition are our</p><p>Fond du Lac brigades?” </p><p> Into the huge Rabiscaw canoes they were</p><p>madly urging the crews, all clamoring at </p><p>once and spurred by the curses of Richelieu </p><p>who with the Montreal mail-courier, Ber- </p><p>tand, was running here and there like a mad- </p><p>man, his uniform all dirty and his black </p><p>beard filled with sticky sand as he spat </p><p>forth French, English, Cree and Chippe- </p><p>wayan in one breath. </p><p> But the Rabiscaws, even though manned</p><p>by twenty paddles, could not beat the </p><p>wind. The Otter, already in mid-channel, </p><p>maintained her lead, rounded the island and </p><p>tore like a racing yacht down the rugged </p><p>loom of the north shore. </p><p> “Out of the desert into the mirage, as the</p><p>Western saying goes!” breathed Joan, all </p><p>her suspense and anxiety of the last few </p><p>minutes finding an expressiqn in a hysterical </p><p>laugh. </p><p> “Yes,” bantered Carlisle, “you were pris-</p><p>oners of the Northwesters. Now you are </p><p>prisoners of the Hudson’s Bay—with every </p><p>prospect of improved treatment. We’ll </p><p>pick up my brigade at their camp down </p><p>here and go on to the mouth of the Ka- </p><p>ministiquia.” </p><p> “So it’s not a courier I have to thank</p><p>after all but a Factor,” she marveled whim- </p><p>sically. “And your men were in the mas- </p><p>querade, too!” </p><p> “As it happened,” he admitted. “Drum-</p><p>mond, at the tiller yonder, gave us warning </p><p>on the lake, and it all worked out as you </p><p>saw. Andrews was a marvel.” </p><p> “He was that,” put in Wayne warmly,</p><p>“not to speak of yourself. I am not the </p><p>man to forget such a service. To what post </p><p>do you belong?” </p><p> “Lately to Moose Factory but to Cum-</p><p>berland House when I reach there.” </p><p> “The devil! The Factor to fight us, eh?</p><p>And your name?” </p><p> “Carlisle.”</p><p> With an animal-like snarl Wayne let go</p><p>the jib halyard and snatched the sheath </p><p>knife from the belt of Missowa by his side. </p><p>His face under the weak starlight was a </p><p>veritable blaze of ferocity, and his fawn- </p><p>green eyes shone like the eyes of a lynx as </p><p>he lunged at Carlisle with the long steel </p><p>blade. </p><p> “Stop, man, wait!” appealed Andrews,</p><p>leaping as Wayne lunged. </p><p> But quick as was the priest to spring,</p><p>Joan was quicker. She launched herself </p><p>between her father and Carlisle, her hands </p><p>Ambush </p><p>17 </p><p>upon Wayne’s striking arm, her whole </p><p>weight bearing down upon it like a leaden clog. </p><p> “Father, you are mad!” she shrieked.</p><p>“He has just saved us from Richelieu. </p><p>You’re forgetting the wilderness code. You </p><p>can’t touch him.” </p><p> For a moment they swayed thus in the</p><p>careening sloop under the reeling stars, Car- </p><p>lisle grimly amazed, vaguely angered, poised </p><p>for resistance, Wayne suddenly frozen still </p><p>in his fury, moving nothing but his fawn- </p><p>green eyes in continual shift from the Factor </p><p>to the beseeching girl on his arm. Then the </p><p>Free-Trader’s body relaxed with a sound like </p><p>a groan as he allowed Joan to wrest the </p><p>knife from his fingers and push him down to </p><p>his seat. </p><p>“No, you’re right, girl,” he mumbled. </p><p>“It’s the code. I can’t touch him—yet!” </p><p> Carlisle also sat down.</p><p> “By heavens,” he sneered, sensing noth-</p><p>ing but bitter trade antagonism, “I like </p><p>your knife-edged gratitude!” </p><p> But Eugene Drummond, replacing the</p><p>long sweep he had unshipped to crash down </p><p>upon the Free-Trader’s head from behind, </p><p>sensed something deeper. It was the diable </p><p>mystery he had always sensed! Here it </p><p>was darker than ever. Andrews knew of it. </p><p>Wayne knew of it. The Factor did not </p><p>know. That was plain. </p><p> Eugene shook his raven hair this way and</p><p>that and swore darkly into the driving </p><p>wind as he brought the Otter back on her </p><p>course. </p><p> For, mm Dieu, had he not seen enough</p><p>to know that between the names Wayne </p><p>and Carlisle there was hate or fear or </p><p>wrong, blood-feud or crime or worse? </p><p>CHAPTER IV </p><p>AMBUSCADE </p><p>THEIR weapons in their hands, the Hud- </p><p>son’s Bay men started up from their </p><p>camp on the north shore as Drummond</p><p>steered the Otter in, half a dozen hands let </p><p>go the sheets and Carlisle himself sprang </p><p>out into their midst. </p><p> “By a’ the wilderness gods, Factor, what’s</p><p>happened noo?” cried Lewis. “Why are </p><p>ye back? Who are yer prisoners? An’ </p><p>what in the de’il are ye daein’ wi’ the North- </p><p>westers’ sloop? I kenned at first it was a </p><p>drunken crew 0’ the French Company led </p><p>by yon slippery courier Bertand!” </p><p>2 </p><p> “I’m back, Lewis,” laughed Carlisle,</p><p>“because Richelieu and his partners are in </p><p>too great force at Grande Portage and the </p><p>Kaministiquia is the only other route into </p><p>the West. These with me are Ralph Wayne, </p><p>the Sturgeon Lake Free-Trader, and his </p><p>daughter Joan who thought the Hudson’s </p><p>Bay Company men better warders than </p><p>the Northwesters. And we stole the sloop </p><p>in order to escape. We’ll beach it some- </p><p>where up the Kaministiquia. I have to </p><p>get into the Pays d’en Haut with all speed. </p><p>Things have come to a head now on the </p><p>Saskatchewan.” </p><p> “Shades o’ Rupert, ye are sayin’ so, Fac-</p><p>tor?” blurted Lewis, nodding to Wayne </p><p>and doffing his Glengarry cap to Joan. </p><p>“Tae a heid?” </p><p> “Yes, to a head,” repeated Carlisle, “and</p><p>the quicker I am on the ground the better. </p><p>Who let Bertand the courier away?” </p><p> “Yon hound o’ a Chippewa, Cotameg!</p><p>Cotameg was his warder, ye ken, an’ he </p><p>dozed lang enough tae let the courier roll </p><p>ower tae the mosquito smudge an’ burn the </p><p>thongs frae his wrists an’ ankles.” </p><p> “Fine him three months’ pay,” was Car-</p><p>lisle’s swift judgment. “If the like happens </p><p>again, he leaves the service. Understand, </p><p>Lewis? Now strike camp at once!” </p><p> The Otter took them all aboard, men,</p><p>dunnage and canoes, and bore away for the </p><p>mouth of the Kaministiquia River. Before </p><p>daylight they made it, tacked about in the </p><p>face of a strong head wind and through the </p><p>dark ran unseen past the sleeping North- </p><p>west post. On up the river they scudded </p><p>till with the first streak of dawn the Otter </p><p>grounded in rapid-broken shallows.</p><p> Carlisle leaped out and caught his gear</p><p>bag tossed from the hands of Drummond. </p><p> “Eugene,” he ordered, “have the canoes</p><p>loaded and all ready to go on while I get </p><p>rid of these courier’s clothes.” </p><p> He disappeared into a thicket up the</p><p>shore and in a few minutes appeared again, </p><p>the swarthy stain washed from his face and </p><p>hands, the battered, blue felt hat, cheap </p><p>cotton shirt and trousers gone. He was his </p><p>old self once more, clad in his cap of soft </p><p>amber leather, rich blanket-coat, deerskin </p><p>knickerbockers and high-cut moccasins, and </p><p>with the assumption of his own garments he </p><p>had immediately assumed the greater ex- </p><p>clusiveness of his rank. </p><p> Above all others in the brigade he loomed</p><p>large on the conception, calm, self-reliant, </p><p>i8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>determined, the reckless impulse of youth </p><p>within him curbed by an ancient wisdom, </p><p>his whole personality, manner, speech, in- </p><p>vested with unostentatious dignity, sur- </p><p>charged with irrevocable authority. </p><p> As he walked down to the shallows where</p><p>Joan Wayne and her father awaited the </p><p>preparations of the brigade, the girl gave </p><p>an involuntary exclamation. She had ex- </p><p>pected some change in his appearance but </p><p>not such a change as this. </p><p> Great as was the difference between the</p><p>status of courier and Factor, just so great </p><p>was the difference she saw, and the spray of </p><p>red in her cheeks deepened and ran riot as she </p><p>remembered the grip of his arms ’round her in </p><p>Grande Portage and the ring of his voice as </p><p>he swore he would save her from Richelieu. </p><p> But her father at her side was in no such</p><p>pleasant attitude of mind. Joan, glancing </p><p>at him, saw his face working with an emo- </p><p>tion that was nothing less than terrible. </p><p> “Charlie Carlisle!” he was reiterating in</p><p>a low, snarling tone. “Charlie Carlisle all </p><p>over again!” </p><p> “Paul Carlisle, father!” corrected Joan,</p><p>laying a hand on his arm to quiet him. </p><p>“Paul, I heard Father Andrews call him. </p><p>Be calm, won’t you? He’s our enemy in </p><p>trade only, and why should you make it </p><p>such a bitter personal hate?” </p><p> “You don’t know what you are talking</p><p>about, girl,” growled Wayne, “you don’t </p><p>know. By the Doom—the image of his </p><p>father before him!” </p><p> Wayne’s hand went to his waist, clutching</p><p>for the weapon that was not there. As his </p><p>fingers fumbled helplessly, he seemed to re- </p><p>member his present plight and with a curse </p><p>abruptly turned his back. </p><p> “All ready, Eugene?” called Carlisle</p><p>cheerfully. </p><p> “Oui, Factor,” assured Drummond,</p><p>sweeping an expressive hand over the fleet. </p><p>“All ready for start. I be got to double oop </p><p>two crews in dese canoes on account dose</p><p>crafts Fadder Andrews an’ Bertand left on </p><p>Grande Portage.” </p><p>WITH Garry as steersman, Eugene </p><p>himself had taken charge of one of </p><p>these canoes, the second in the line, </p><p>where from its bow he could command the </p><p>whole brigade, and the fact that in so short </p><p>a time every bit of dunnage was trimmed for </p><p>balance, every paddler in his proper posi- </p><p>tion, bespoke his keen efficiency. </p><p> Behind him, one in charge of each separ-</p><p>ate craft, were the three white men, Lewis, </p><p>Hampton and Lea. Ahead of him floated </p><p>the splendid six-fathom canoe of the Fac- </p><p>tor, lipping a flat rock in the shallows, wait- </p><p>ing for its owner, its crimson flag and gon- </p><p>falon crackling as before, the gay woolen </p><p>streamers blowing from the paddle shafts </p><p>and the paddlers themselves poised in their </p><p>bright costumes of gaily-decorated mocca- </p><p>sins, leggings, sashes, fillets and plumes. </p><p> And gayest of all posed Waseyawin and</p><p>Missowa, standing in the high, curved bow </p><p>and stern, their common disguises thrown </p><p>aside to let the wilderness world know their </p><p>rank as bowsman and steersman. </p><p> Carlisle’s eye glistened with pride as he</p><p>glanced them over, but with only a momen- </p><p>tary dwelling his gaze passed on to Wayne </p><p>and his daughter. </p><p> “Now it comes to your decision,” he</p><p>spoke bluntly yet in the spirit of earnest </p><p>friendliness. “I can double up another </p><p>crew and spare you a canoe to go on to </p><p>Montreal as you intended. You may walk </p><p>down the bank to the Kaministiquia post. </p><p>Or you may come back with me to Cumber- </p><p>land House. In the first two cases you go </p><p>freely. In the third case you will be in cus- </p><p>tody.” </p><p> Wayne’s eyes held Carlisle’s with a blaz-</p><p>ing gleam. His whole intense being seemed </p><p>to leap out in that bitter gaze, leaving his </p><p>lips no mission in speech, and it was Joan, </p><p>tremulous and fearful of his wrath, who </p><p>hastily answered for him. </p><p> “There is no use in our going on to Mon-</p><p>treal,” she pointed out. “The furs are gone </p><p>—a sixty thousand-dollar cargo. Besides, </p><p>neither I nor my father wants to risk going </p><p>into Northwest headquarters after what</p><p>happened at Grande Portage. You know </p><p>that.” </p><p> “Yes, I judged so,” nodded Carlisle.</p><p>“Then it’s the Kaministiquia post or Cum- </p><p>berland House. And I hope it’s Cumber- </p><p>land House. You see, white women are so </p><p>scarce in this land that a man does not meet </p><p>and part with them lightly. Good heavens! </p><p>I spent four years in London, and there was </p><p>a woman there for every square rod of the </p><p>city. </p><p> “I’ve lived seventeen years in wilderness</p><p>posts and in all that time seen very few. </p><p>Do you understand? It’s made me appre- </p><p>ciate them wonderfully, and somehow, now </p><p>when I look at you, I’m—I’m—well, </p><p>Ambush </p><p>19 </p><p>frankly, I’m glad that I’ve seen but few!” </p><p> Joan flushed at his patent warmth.</p><p> “But it’s for my father to say,” she</p><p>evaded in confusion. </p><p> “It’s Cumberland House,” cut in Wayne</p><p>suddenly finding speech and taking Car- </p><p>lisle’s option as if he had heard nothing </p><p>that intervened. “Condemnation! Why </p><p>should we rot in the Kaministiquia post? </p><p>We will go back to our own district, Joan, </p><p>the district they would wrest from us, and </p><p>there, by the Doom, they’ll see who does </p><p>the wresting!” </p><p> “You’ll give parole?” asked the Factor,</p><p>ignoring the threat. </p><p> “No,” thundered Wayne. “Put a guard</p><p>on us and keep us if you can!” </p><p> “Very well,” nodded Carlisle grimly, “my</p><p>eyes will be guard enough.” </p><p> He took a step aside to where Father</p><p>Andrews waited silently on the bank. </p><p> “A strange, violent man, Father—yes,</p><p>and bitter as gall against the Hudson’s </p><p>Bay!” he whispered. “If it were not for </p><p>the girl’s sake, I would give him back some </p><p>of his own medicine. She interests me </p><p>greatly. So will you pair amidships with </p><p>Wayne, then? The girl and I will sit be- </p><p>hind you.” </p><p> “As you like Paul,” agreed the priest,</p><p>taking the indicated place. “I am glad </p><p>you have your temper under control. There </p><p>is no gam in letting it slip.” </p><p> Carlisle gave Joan his hand as she</p><p>stepped in, but when he motioned the Free- </p><p>Trader to follow, the latter drew back de- </p><p>fiantly. </p><p> “I ride in the next,” he growled. “I will</p><p>not ride with you. Though you’ve put me </p><p>under the code, my hands still itch for the </p><p>Ojibways’ knives.” </p><p> “All right, if you feel like that,” assented</p><p>the Factor. </p><p> He waved Wayne aboard Drummond’s</p><p>craft. </p><p> “Eugene,” he enjoined, “he is under</p><p>your eye!” </p><p> Then he stepped into his own canoe,</p><p>meeting with a good-humored laugh Joan’s </p><p>deprecatory face. Rendered ashamed, as </p><p>well as alarmed, by her father’s fresh defi- </p><p>ance, she had remained standing, perturbed, </p><p>uncertain as to the outcome of the verbal </p><p>clash. Now quite naturally they sat down </p><p>together upon the rich ermine robe, and </p><p>the brigade shot up the Kaministiquia. </p><p> In the wake of La Verendrye whose prow</p><p>had first cut these waters in 1731 they </p><p>went, and as the silence of the forest en- </p><p>veloped them Eugene Drummond’s clear </p><p>tenor struck up an air to time the paddles </p><p>of his canoemen. </p><p> All day and half the night the fleet wound</p><p>up the rock-walled, spruce-hedged Kamin- </p><p>istiqua to its source, Lake Shebandowan, </p><p>across golden Shebandowan, over jeweled </p><p>Lake Kashaboyes toward the range of gran- </p><p>ite which hurled the Western waters back </p><p>to Winnipeg. </p><p> The setting sun did not drop behind the</p><p>gray crags of the range till nine in the even- </p><p>ing, and then the orange-rose afterglow' </p><p>burned its witch-light for an hour more. </p><p>But abruptly as the orange-rose turned </p><p>saffron stalked the jealous dark, and night </p><p>and the brigade camped together upon the </p><p>crest of the Superior Divide. </p><p> At morning they left the Height of Land</p><p>behind them, and like the flash of their pad- </p><p>dles the days went by as they plunged </p><p>down the western slope of the watershed </p><p>through Lac des Mille Isles, the Seine </p><p>River, Rainy Lake, Rainy River and Lake </p><p>of the Woods. All the way by paddle, pole </p><p>and portage Eugene Drummond pitched </p><p>the canoe song for his gay-souled voyageurs. </p><p> Ralph Wayne’s glowering hate grew</p><p>darker as he hit upon no opportunity to </p><p>escape, and the strangely-begun intimacy </p><p>between Joan and Carlisle blossomed and </p><p>thrived at a pace that set her father to </p><p>brooding. Stately figures upon the vast </p><p>tapestry of forest verdure they passed with</p><p>no untoward incident until after leaving </p><p>Lake of the Woods. </p><p>THEN as they rounded a bend of </p><p>the Winnipeg River some miles </p><p>above Lac du Bonnet, Waseyawin </p><p>uttered a cry of warning from the bow of </p><p>the Factor’s flying canoe. Instantly Mis- </p><p>sowa and the middlemen caught it. Their </p><p>blades back-watered with a gurgling roar, </p><p>and the prow of the craft brought up within </p><p>ten feet of a chaos of dead tamarack trunks </p><p>which choked the stream. </p><p> “A windfall, eh?” cried Father Andrews.'</p><p>“That was a close thing, Paul.” </p><p> “No—no windfall!” declared Carlisle,</p><p>standing up to see better. “Look at the </p><p>ax marks on the butts. It’s a barricade. </p><p>Missowa, Waseyawin—back! Back, Drum- </p><p>mond—quick!” </p><p> But hard on his words and before the</p><p>20 </p><p>Ac venture </p><p>brigade had time to swing about came the </p><p>chug-chug of axes behind them. A score of </p><p>dead birches swayed out from the bushy </p><p>margin and crashed into the river in an </p><p>impassable tangle of crossed trunks and in- </p><p>terwoven branches. And out upon the </p><p>barricades before and behind poured over </p><p>one hundred Northwesters, the choppers </p><p>with their bright-bladed axes still in hand, </p><p>the others with long-barreled rifles trained </p><p>on the Hudson’s Bay brigade. </p><p> Carlisle recognized on the instant James</p><p>and Roderick McKenzie, McLeod and Mc- </p><p>Dougall with their returning Athabasca </p><p>brigades, and Richelieu with his Sturgeon </p><p>Lake brigade, all apparently bound into </p><p>the Pays d’en Haut. </p><p> “Mon Dieu, Carlisle, but I have you</p><p>trapped now!” roared Richelieu. “You and </p><p>Ralph Wayne and mademoiselle and your </p><p>renegade priest!” </p><p> “Yes, Carlisle,” guffawed Roderick Mc-</p><p>Kenzie. “I had thought you too good a </p><p>woodsman to put your head into a deadfall </p><p>like that!” _ </p><p> “Never mind your tongue play, you two,”</p><p>the impetuous McLeod cut in on them. </p><p>“Take these men prisoners, lift their arms, </p><p>clear yon barricade and let’s be on our </p><p>way!” </p><p> “In my own good time, McLeod,” bul-</p><p>lied Richelieu. “Neither you nor an}' </p><p>other man can hurry me. You see. Carlisle, </p><p>you’ve tried the patience of McLeod and </p><p>"the others. The Pigeon River route into </p><p>the Lake of the Woods is faster than the </p><p>Kaministiquia route and, par Dieu, we’ve </p><p>waited for you here longer than we’ve liked. </p><p>Comprenez-voHS? Do you surrender </p><p>quietly?” </p><p> Carlisle, sweating in the sun-heat off the</p><p>river which seemed suddenly to have grown </p><p>more intense, cast swift, calculating glances </p><p>to right, to left, and behind. </p><p> “Surrender?” he echoed, trying to gain</p><p>time by parleying and all the while seeking </p><p>for some means of apparently impossible </p><p>escape. “What under heaven do you</p><p>Northwesters set yourselves up to be? </p><p>Even though your claim to Grande Portage </p><p>holds good—and t tell you bluntly that it </p><p>doesn’t—this is not Grande Portage. This </p><p>is the Winnipeg—the West, and I want to </p><p>ask you by what right you stop any traveler </p><p>on Winnipeg waters?” </p><p> “By the right of might, m’sieu’,” an-</p><p>swered Richelieu insolently. “We have our </p><p>secret service also, and we know your mis- </p><p>sion into the Saskatchewan. Ciel, do you </p><p>think I am fool enough to let you go on to </p><p>Sturgeon Lake when I have the chance to </p><p>cut you off here? It was my plan to take </p><p>you at Grande Portage, but there was a </p><p>slip. I lost track of you for a little—until </p><p>the courier Bertand exposed you. </p><p> “Diable, I have not forgotten your mas-</p><p>querade, nor the blow you gave me. For </p><p>everything you will answer toute suite, Car- </p><p>lisle—oui, and mademoiselle will come back </p><p>where she belongs.” </p><p> Through every word of Richelieu’s tirade,</p><p>Carlisle felt his "face fairly crisping with the </p><p>increasing heat. He put his feeling down </p><p>to the well-nigh unbearable suspense of the </p><p>moment and to the fact that they lay mo- </p><p>tionless upon the sun-refracting water in </p><p>windless air held stagnant by the forested </p><p>shores. But as Richelieu finished his bold </p><p>prophecy, a sharp tang, permeating the </p><p>heat wave, stung Carlisle’s sensitive nostrils. </p><p> “Smoke!” he exclaimed hoarsely to the</p><p>others in the canoe. “Is that another trick </p><p>of these curs?” </p><p> McDougall, up on the loftiest log of the</p><p>barricade, caught the tang at the same mo- </p><p>ment. He whirled suddenly to face down- </p><p>stream. </p><p> “Holy Dog-Ribs,” he shouted. “Look—</p><p>Richelieu, look! The whole forest’s on fire!” </p><p>McDougall pointed aghast where, not </p><p>over five hundred yards away, as far ’round </p><p>the river bend as he could see, a black pall </p><p>rolled up above the tamarack tops along </p><p>both banks and shooting flames darted like </p><p>red, horned devils between the dark trunks. </p><p> “Diablement,” Richelieu swore. “Some</p><p>of your careless whelps have dropped match </p><p>or pipe, McDougall! Run, everybody, run!</p><p>In canoes and up-stream! And, mon Dieu, </p><p>paddle for your cursed lives!” </p><p> He himself led the rout before the charg-</p><p>ing flames, plunging headlong from the bar- </p><p>ricade into the thicket of green where they </p><p>had hidden their canoes when they arranged </p><p>the ambuscade. Like madmen the hundred </p><p>of them ripped and tore through the growth, </p><p>bending, chopping, trampling down ob- </p><p>structing saplings and shoving their crafts </p><p>afloat above the upper barricade. </p><p> “Name of a name, come on,” yelled</p><p>Richelieu, as the paddles foamed away. </p><p>“Carlisle — Wayne — Joan chere — all you </p><p>there, hola! Follow us. It’s your only </p><p>chance.” </p><p>Ambush </p><p>21 </p><p> “What do you think, Drummond?”</p><p>snapped Carlisle feverishly. “Follow and </p><p>be captured or try to run through the fire?” </p><p> “Ba gar,” breathed his brigade leader,</p><p>"she’s so hot I’m t’ink we burn to cinder. </p><p>Still de smoke she seem to start close. Mab- </p><p>be I be take wan look an’ see. If de rivaire </p><p>be smokin’ for miles we nevaire do it. If </p><p>she’s shallow fire mebbe we make de dash.” </p><p> In an attempt to gage the depth of the</p><p>conflagration Eugene leaped out upon the </p><p>barricade, but as he thrust a bronzed face </p><p>over the topmost trunk, another face was </p><p>thrust into his from the other side, a brown- </p><p>bearded, long-jawed plainsman’s face, </p><p>weather wrinkled and alkali seared, the yel- </p><p>lowed teeth jarred apart in a triumphant </p><p>grin. </p><p> “Mason!” exclaimed Joan Wayne in an</p><p>odd high-pitched tone. </p><p> “By the Doom—yes, Mason!” echoed her</p><p>father. </p><p> And Carlisle, Drummond, Andrews, Mis-</p><p>sowa and Waseyawin suddenly remem- </p><p>bered him, one of the Missouri men, </p><p>Wayne’s brigade leader, whom they had </p><p>last seen in the grip of the Northwesters as </p><p>they dragged him and his companions off </p><p>to the cellars of Grande Portage. </p><p> “Come on,” implored Mason frantically.</p><p>“My pardners fired her back a bit to skeer </p><p>them cusses off. ’Twas the only sartin way </p><p>we seen. Come on. Ye kin run through </p><p>her!” </p><p> The Missourian had an ax in his hand,</p><p>and even while he implored he brought it </p><p>into play upon the up-thrusting branches </p><p>of the barricading trees, slashing a three- </p><p>foot passageway down to the water level. </p><p> There was neither time nor need to cut</p><p>the floating trunks. At a command from </p><p>Carlisle the whole brigade swarmed out </p><p>upon them, the six canoes were whipped </p><p>from the water, passed through the gap and </p><p>launched on the other side. </p><p> “All aboard!” shouted Carlisle. “Now</p><p>—wet blankets on your heads and paddle </p><p>like very demons!” </p><p> He swiftly set the example, soaking a</p><p>blanket overside and drawing it as a pro- </p><p>tecting canopy over the girl, the priest and </p><p>himself. </p><p> “That’s the trick!” approved Mason who</p><p>had tumbled in beside Wayne in Drum- </p><p>mond’s canoe. “ ’Twould be a turrible sin </p><p>to scorch yon ha-ar of Joan’s. It’s a short </p><p>run, boys, but hot as Hades!” </p><p>FLYING down-stream into the face </p><p>of the flame, the heat struck them </p><p>with magnified force, like a searing </p><p>furnace blast. Either bank was a moving </p><p>wall of fire, sputtering and shrieking in a </p><p>medley of impish voices: flare of dry leaves, </p><p>crackle of underbrush, sizzle of green pine- </p><p>needles, pop of resinous knots, crash of </p><p>half-consumed stubs and the patter, plop </p><p>and hiss of embers ceaselessly raining upon </p><p>shore rocks and river surface. </p><p> And all these lesser voices blended as</p><p>separate notes into a symphony of vast </p><p>volume, of awesome power, the Gargantuan </p><p>roar of the fire giant bellowing a thunder- </p><p>ous diapason. </p><p> Carlisle felt the blanket on his head</p><p>grow warm and commence to steam. He </p><p>breathed in gasps in the stifling heat and </p><p>smoke, the blood pounding so hard in his </p><p>head as to make him dizzy. He wondered </p><p>if Joan would faint in that inferno, and he </p><p>blindly put out his hand toward her to re- </p><p>assure himself. His fingers touched and </p><p>closed on hers, burning fever-hot beneath </p><p>the blanket folds. </p><p> “A moment more and we’ll be through,</p><p>Joan,” he cheered. </p><p> Joan had one hand covering her mouth</p><p>as an additional safeguard against the </p><p>smoke, but her fingers tightened on his </p><p>in answer, and the grip sent a fierce thrill </p><p>through his frame. </p><p> “The devil!” boomed the cavernous voice</p><p>of Lewis somewhere behind. “We’re gaein’ </p><p>doon!” </p><p> At the cry Carlisle threw back a corner</p><p>of the blanket in time to see Lewis’ canoe</p><p>disappear suddenly, leaving its four occu- </p><p>pant swimming with the current. The ter- </p><p>rific heat had melted the pitch on the birch- </p><p>bark seams, letting in the water as into a </p><p>sieve. </p><p> “Gae on,” Lewis urged. “Dinna stop</p><p>for us. It’s muckle cooler swimmin’.” </p><p> Before the man of the Hebrides and his</p><p>Indians had taken a dozen strokes in the </p><p>water, down went Hampton’s canoe, and </p><p>twelve heads now dotted the river surface, </p><p>diving, reappearing and diving again to </p><p>escape the blistering breath of the flames. </p><p>Lea’s craft, waterlogged and careening, </p><p>promised to follow suit, but Drummond’s </p><p>heavily-laden canoe still flew like an arrow, </p><p>and the Factor’s canoe ahead, likewise </p><p>heavily-laden so that its seams lay mainly </p><p>under water, traveled as yet unharmed. </p><p>22 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Flying canoes and racing fireline were</p><p>meeting at tremendous speed, but as if the </p><p>fireline were standing still, the faster crea- </p><p>tures of the forest broke from cover and </p><p>passed the whizzing canoes. Like scurry- </p><p>ing Autumnal leaves the lesser birds flew </p><p>through the rolling smoke pall. </p><p> Wedges of geese and ducks drove by on</p><p>whistling wings. Coveys of partridges </p><p>flushed with a drum-like roaring. Palpitant </p><p>hares spurned the ground in fear-mad </p><p>leaps. Squirrels, chattering, demented, </p><p>hurled themselves across the latticework </p><p>of branches. The lordly caribou, antlers </p><p>back and noses outstreched, crashed up- </p><p>stream like bombshells through the forest </p><p>growth. </p><p> Amid a demoniacal tumult of earth and</p><p>air they struck the fireline. A mass of blaz- </p><p>ing limbs whirled down and lodged on the </p><p>bow of the Factor’s canoe. Like tinder </p><p>the dry birch-bark flared up, but Waseya- </p><p>win, bare-handed, cast the burning debris </p><p>off and with a scoop of his paddle dashed </p><p>a gallon of water on the flaring bow. </p><p> The blaze sputtered out with a malig-</p><p>nant hiss. The Cree dug in his blade, and </p><p>the next moment the craft leaped out of </p><p>the seething inferno into a strangely-quiet </p><p>reach of stream where the smoking, ash- </p><p>filmed ground lay white as snow and the </p><p>blackened trees slid by like specters wink- </p><p>ing red-hot eyes at every puff of wind. </p><p>CHAPTER V </p><p>THE ILIAD OF THE FOREST </p><p>“ TOAN, are you burned at all?” demanded </p><p>J Carlisle, throwing the half -charred </p><p>blanket aside. “Scorched even? Hair—face </p><p>—hands?” </p><p> The girl drew the sweet, smokeless air</p><p>into her lungs with a gasp. </p><p> “No, Paul, no,” she assured him. “The</p><p>flames never touched me. Are you all </p><p>right—and my father and Father Andrews </p><p>and the rest?” </p><p> “All safe, apparently! There’ll be singed</p><p>heads and blis.tered skins for a while, but </p><p>everybody’s come through fine.” </p><p> “Aye,” murmured Father Andrews, “they</p><p>have—by the grace of God.” </p><p> “And Mason,” supplemented Wayne</p><p>from Drummond’s canoe behind. </p><p> “By Jove, yes, by grace of Mason too!”</p><p>Carlisle lauded. “If it hadn’t been for </p><p>Mason we might not have tried to run the </p><p>gantlet.” </p><p> “That’s what I was thar fer, to give ye</p><p>the word,” grinned Mason. “Ye see, they </p><p>had a celebrashun fer the McKenzies, </p><p>McLeod, McDougall and Richelieu when </p><p>they left Grande Portage fer the Athabasky. </p><p>Everybody got roarin’ drunk, and some- </p><p>body left the bar off the door of our cellar. </p><p> “Thompson dropped a word about ye git-</p><p>tin’ away, Wayne, with Hudson’s Bay men </p><p>bound into the Saskatchewan, so on course </p><p>we got out of the cellar at dark and stole </p><p>canoes, rifles and grub to last and follered </p><p>them drunk cusses up the Pigeon. We </p><p>figgered yer party’d come in by the Kamin- </p><p>istiquia, and we soon seen Richelieu fig- </p><p>gered so too. They traveled like hell-fire, </p><p>aimin’ to head ye off and git to the Winni- </p><p>peg River first. </p><p> “They done it all right and barricaded her</p><p>and lay by fer two days, and when they </p><p>bushwhacked ye jist now we had to chase </p><p>them with fire. She’ll heel them miles back </p><p>to the Pechilaux and Red Sand Rivers </p><p>cornin’ in on either bank. She’ll stop thar, </p><p>I calkilate. Hullo! Thar’s my men on the </p><p>shore. Time too, fer this cussed canoe’s </p><p>goin’ down.” </p><p> Lea’s craft had already gone. Drum-</p><p>mond’s settled by the river margin amid all </p><p>the swimmers from the other crafts, and all </p><p>pulled themselves out dripping upon the </p><p>ashy shore where waited Wayne’s men of </p><p>the Mississippi, men of the Missouri, men </p><p>of the Red, along with his Stony Crees and </p><p>Chippewayans. </p><p> Wayne stamped the water off as he made</p><p>his way along the bank to the Factor’s </p><p>canoe, still sound and strong, where it lay </p><p>grazing the river rocks.</p><p> “Well,” he laughed grimly, his fawn-</p><p>green eyes glowing into Carlisle’s where the </p><p>latter sat amidships, “fire is always a man’s </p><p>friend if it’s properly used, and I guess it’s </p><p>my friend right here.” </p><p> “You mean-”</p><p> “Of course I mean that. I’m the Big</p><p>Chief now, and it’s my turn to powwow. </p><p>Your crew of six have their arms left. The </p><p>arms of all the other crews are at the Winni- </p><p>peg’s bottom. You can’t stand up against </p><p>my thirty-two armed men. So tell your </p><p>paddlers to step out with their hands up!” </p><p> “Wikl Wik!” Carlisle yelled sharply to</p><p>his crew. </p><p> Swift as lightning they dipped their</p><p>Ambush </p><p>23 </p><p>paddles in a terrific drive. The great </p><p>canoe leaped its own length like a spurred </p><p>horse and sheered off into mid-river. </p><p> “Stop!” Wayne bellowed. “Rapide des</p><p>Boisfranc’s just below. You can’t run it. </p><p>It’s never been run. By the Doom, before </p><p>you’ll drown my girl I’ll-” </p><p> He broke off to snatch a rifle from the</p><p>hands of the nearest man and level it at the </p><p>canoe. </p><p> “Carlisle—stop! Stop, or I’ll shoot you</p><p>like a skunk!” </p><p> But at the menace of the rifle muzzle Joan</p><p>sitting on Carlisle’s left hand, sprang up as a </p><p>shield between. </p><p> “Father, don’t fire,” she implored. “You</p><p>forget—you forget!” </p><p> “I forget nothing. Sit down, girl—sit</p><p>down, I say.” </p><p> Joan did not sit down, but a lurch of the</p><p>canoe in the eddies set her swaying so that </p><p>Carlisle pulled her down. The action put </p><p>their bodies out of line where they sat, and </p><p>instantly Wayne’s rifle cracked. Carlisle </p><p>heard the rip of the puncturing ball through </p><p>the canoe from side to side above the water- </p><p>line, and at the same moment he felt a solid </p><p>blow, like the thud of a stone, on his left </p><p>leg below the knee. </p><p> Blankly surprised, he looked down, to see</p><p>the calf of his high-cut deerskin moccasin </p><p>punctured from side to side as neatly as the </p><p>birch-bark skin of the canoe. Blood was </p><p>spreading over his leg and trickling down </p><p>the creamy deerskin to his ankle. Hastily </p><p>he thrust the wounded limb under a dun- </p><p>nage bag before Joan should see. </p><p> Missowa twisted the stern and flung the</p><p>craft cleanly across the river bend so that </p><p>a rock shoulder intercepted Wayne’s line of </p><p>fire. They were round the bend, swinging </p><p>into the grip of the powerful, tugging cur- </p><p>rent writhing down to Rapide des Boisfranc. </p><p> Wayne’s Free-Traders had hidden their</p><p>own canoes in the forest below the rapid, </p><p>ready for hasty flight when they crept up </p><p>the shore to spoil Richelieu’s ambuscade. </p><p>Now those in the racing Factor’s canoe </p><p>could hear them clamoring as they crashed </p><p>along over the mile portage in a vain at- </p><p>tempt to overtake the craft before it could </p><p>reach white water. </p><p> “Oh, my father shouldn’t have fired that</p><p>way,” censured Joan, still unaware of </p><p>Carlisle’s wound, “for he might have killed </p><p>you, Paul! He’s not himself. I swear he’s </p><p>not himself. He’s mad with an enmity I’ve </p><p>never seen him hold before—with a hate </p><p>that’s quite beyond me!” </p><p> “I know,” nodded Carlisle, turning a</p><p>grimace of pain into a smile, “and you see </p><p>how impossible it was for me to let myself be </p><p>taken prisoner. I’m sorry, Joan, to have to </p><p>hurl you through these infernal rapids, but </p><p>it can’t be helped now. We can’t stop to </p><p>land you. You’ll have to hold on tightly </p><p>and keep your weight as low as possible. </p><p>Now, take your grip. Yonder’s white </p><p>water ahead!” </p><p>WITH terrific speed they were </p><p>shooting down the black, ominous </p><p>surges at the head of the rapids, </p><p>surges twisting and writhing like a brood of </p><p>mighty pythons between the crowding walls </p><p>of rock. Fast as the river ran, the craft </p><p>was running faster, flung bodily ahead of the </p><p>mad current by the desperate paddles of </p><p>Waseyawin, Missowa and the four middle </p><p>men. </p><p> Not for an instant might they allow the</p><p>river’s velocity to approximate the canoe’s </p><p>velocity, because in that instant control </p><p>would be lost to their blades and disaster </p><p>ensue. </p><p> Half a dozen canoe lengths from the foam-</p><p>ing snarl of white water the bowsman, </p><p>Waseyawin, gave a high-pitched yell as a </p><p>signal. At his cry the tremendous speed of </p><p>the paddle strokes abruptly doubled till it </p><p>seemed some deep magic and not the skill </p><p>of men which plied blades that the quick eye </p><p>could scarcely follow. </p><p> The canoe was fairly torn from the suck</p><p>of the dark water and launched like a </p><p>meteor through the white. Waseyawin</p><p>gave another yell. As one man the four </p><p>middlemen shipped paddles, leaving Wase- </p><p>yawin and Missowa, standing at bow and </p><p>stern, to twist the huge craft this way or that. </p><p> Waseyawin, eyes focused on the moil</p><p>below, read the river as white men read a </p><p>book, and ever his high-pitched yells split </p><p>the tumult of the waters, drifting back to </p><p>Missowa in the stern, telegraphing him what </p><p>lay ahead—tossing billow, seething white </p><p>water, angry eddy, treacherous cross current, </p><p>fountained spray that marked the jagged </p><p>rock or shallow foam that masked the </p><p>sunken boulder. </p><p> Through a mist of flying drops they</p><p>rocked over the edge of the cascade proper </p><p>and plunged sheer down a milk-white chute </p><p>as steep as a flight of stairs. </p><p>24 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Nerved as she was by her father’s training</p><p>against all Northland menaces, Joan felt her </p><p>spirit quaking at the sickening drop. Nau- </p><p>sea dulled her senses. Terror gripped her </p><p>heart. She shrank from the roaring brutal </p><p>maw of the river, shrank from its slaver and </p><p>fangs, pressing tremblingly closer and closer </p><p>to Carlisle. </p><p> “My God—my God,” she quavered as</p><p>they struck the base swells of the cascade </p><p>with a tearing sound like the ripping of a </p><p>thousand yards of silk, “are we gone, </p><p>Paul?” </p><p> “No, Joan, we’re all right,” Carlisle</p><p>soothed. “We’ll go through. If I hadn’t </p><p>full faith in my Indians, do you think I would </p><p>have risked it with you?” </p><p> He loosened his grip and like a child he</p><p>drew her shrinking body into the hollow of </p><p>his arms. </p><p> “I wouldn’t have risked it, Joan,” he de-</p><p>clared. “I haven’t found you that long to </p><p>lose you so soon. Don’t you understand, </p><p>girl? Can’t you realize what finding you </p><p>back there at Grande Portage has meant to </p><p>me?” </p><p> The frightened face upturned to his, the</p><p>face blanched of its customary color, lost </p><p>the rigidity of terror, grew mellow, warm, </p><p>sprayed with its crimson again, and her eyes </p><p>deepened under some potent emotion to an </p><p>amethyst shade. In the grip of the colos- </p><p>sal elemental forces, heaving through a boil- </p><p>ing caldron on the edge of death, her </p><p>feminine finesse that under other circum- </p><p>stances would have kept him at bay, tan- </p><p>talized, in doubt, was torn away and to her </p><p>lips of no denial, Carlisle on wild impulse </p><p>suddenly pressed his own. </p><p> A barrel of water shipped over the bow</p><p>when the canoe buried its nose in the grand </p><p>swell drenched them both as it rolled from </p><p>end to end. </p><p> “Bail!” Carlisle commanded the middle-</p><p>men. </p><p> With a mighty trembling the canoe shook</p><p>itself free and, aided by the increased buoy-</p><p>ancy as the shipped water was flung out, </p><p>rose upon the silver-gray backs of the </p><p>swells, tobogganed down a series of fluid ter- </p><p>races and shot between two madly-gyrating </p><p>whirlpools studded with stump-like rocks. </p><p> Once more Waseyawin uttered a violent</p><p>yell. The four paddles of the middlemen </p><p>came down into the swirl, and though the </p><p>giant tentacles of the twin maelstroms </p><p>gripped and tore at the craft like the arms </p><p>of a gigantic devil-fish, the added impetus </p><p>carried them through. </p><p> They were in the leaping, lashing billows</p><p>near the end of the rapids. A few more </p><p>strokes meant calmer water, but squarely </p><p>in the path showed a half-sunken boulder, </p><p>round, wave-worn, dark-green in color, </p><p>standing like some Titan warrior of old </p><p>taking upon his bruised face the eternal </p><p>hammering of the river! </p><p> Swiftly Waseyawin jabbed his paddle</p><p>deep under the bow to swing wide, but the </p><p>already strained paddle snapped like a dead </p><p>branch in his hands. The head of the canoe </p><p>swerved back toward the rock. Missowa </p><p>the steersman, taking the opposite stroke </p><p>to Waseyawin’s, in the pivotal shift, could </p><p>not throw the stern ’round far enough to </p><p>clear, and before the middleman behind </p><p>Waseyawin could hand him his paddle in </p><p>place of the broken one, the craft reared </p><p>upon the boulder. </p><p> A grating sound ran along the bottom,</p><p>and the thin birch-bark heaved in the cen- </p><p>ter. All in a flash they lodged, whirled </p><p>half-way ’round, were spewed off, to bring </p><p>up with a drifting smash among a litter of </p><p>granite blocks lying like thrown dice in the </p><p>shore shallows. The canoe pitched on its </p><p>side, spilling its occupants headforemost </p><p>into the rubble-filled pools, and the first </p><p>ones out of the tangle were Waseyawin and </p><p>Missowa. </p><p> Crying to their middlemen to salve the</p><p>canoe, packs and arms, they rushed to the </p><p>aid of the whites. Father Andrews, in </p><p>water to his waist and weighted by his </p><p>soaked cassock, was slowly making his way </p><p>ashore. Carlisle lay motionless in a foot of </p><p>water, his head upon a stone, with Joan </p><p>bending over him. </p><p> “He’s stunned,” she gasped as Missowa</p><p>and Waseyawin reached her. “See the </p><p>bruise there on his temple? His leg is hurt </p><p>and bleeding as well. Carry him ashore </p><p>quickly.” </p><p> For answer Missowa whipped the gay</p><p>sash from his waist over her mouth, while </p><p>Waseyawin seized her wrists and tied them </p><p>behind her back with the fillet from his </p><p>head. </p><p> “Be quick, my Cree brother,” urged</p><p>Missowa, deftly knotting the gag. “The </p><p>Free-Trading men must not find us here.” </p><p> He pushed the girl up the bank in Wase-</p><p>yawin’s charge and, exerting all his lithe </p><p>strength, raised the limp form of the Factor </p><p>Ambush </p><p>2 5 </p><p>and followed. Father Andrews splashed </p><p>out on his heels, and after the priest ran the </p><p>four middlemen, carrying the arms and </p><p>packs and rent canoe upon their heads. </p><p> They left no dripping water trail if any</p><p>one should search, for the rocks for yards </p><p>around were wet with the spray of the </p><p>rapids, and once off the rocks they staggered </p><p>up the granite bed of a little spring that </p><p>trickled the length of a deep ravine. </p><p>rAT THE head of the ravine they </p><p>clambered over lichened stones, </p><p>dank moss carpets and beds of fern </p><p>is green as chrysoprase. Through the </p><p>'loom of the pines, treading soundless as </p><p>'hosts upon the fallen needles, they passed </p><p>md came out on rolling ground forested </p><p>with silvery birch. </p><p> They had worked over half a mile from</p><p>the river, and in a tiny clearing Missowa let </p><p>down his burden upon a bed of dry leaves. </p><p>Waseyawin pushed Joan to a seat upon a </p><p>mossy rock beside and, taking a rifle from </p><p>the middlemen who crowded up, glided back </p><p>to keep watch upon the river. </p><p> Father Andrews seized one of the packs</p><p>and from it extracted the medicine kit he </p><p>was accustomed to carry in his ministering </p><p>among the Indians. It contained a flat tin </p><p>llask full of brandy, and, using the screw- </p><p>cap, the priest poured a few spoonfuls be- </p><p>tween Carlisle’s lips and began to chafe him </p><p>while Missowa cut away the water-soaked, </p><p>blood-stained moccasin from his leg. </p><p> “A flesh wound,” announced the Ojibway</p><p>unemotionally, baring the calf and manipu- </p><p>lating the leg to feel for a break. The </p><p>bones are sound.” </p><p> “That’s good!” Andrews exclaimed. “I</p><p>was afraid the jagged rocks had broken it </p><p>clean.” </p><p> “But, Ayumeaookemou (priest), it was</p><p>not the rocks.” </p><p> “Ah-hah! What then?”</p><p> “It was the Free-Trader’s bullet, and had</p><p>it not been for the twist of my paddle, it</p><p>would have been through the Factor’s </p><p>heart!” </p><p> Father Andrews gave a startled exclama-</p><p>tion. His eyes met Missowa’s, fell to the </p><p>bullet-torn limb and then shifted quickly </p><p>to Joan’s face. He and Missowa had been </p><p>talking in Cree, but he realized all at once </p><p>that she understood the language. She </p><p>could not speak for the sash over her </p><p>mouth, yet into her eyes flooded a silent </p><p>eloquence, surprise, commiseration, anxiety </p><p>—yes, something deeper, Andrews thought! </p><p> She rose from the rock. One of the mid-</p><p>dlemen made as if to stop her, but the priest </p><p>shook his head, and she came and stood be- </p><p>hind while they worked upon Carlisle. For </p><p>nearly an hour they persisted before he </p><p>showed signs of returning consciousness. </p><p>Missowa had the leg bathed, the bullet-rip </p><p>rinsed with pure water from a spring near-by, </p><p>poulticed with healing balsam gum, brought </p><p>from the ridge beyond the clearing, and all </p><p>neatly bandaged before the Factor’s eyes </p><p>opened. </p><p> When they did open upon the mask-like</p><p>mosquito veil of the priest, upon Missowa’s </p><p>swarthy face with the surface lights in the </p><p>black eyes gleaming in solicitation almost </p><p>akin to tenderness, upon Joan standing there </p><p>in her gag and bonds, Carlisle felt himself </p><p>still in the nightmare of the canoe smash. </p><p> “Wha—at—what under the—” he began</p><p>in shaky syllables. </p><p> “Don’t talk too loud,” warned Father</p><p>Andrews. “We’re hidden here from the </p><p>Free-Traders, and voices carry far in the </p><p>forest.” </p><p> “The Free-Traders are gone,” spoke the</p><p>voice of Waseyawin who glided like a wraith </p><p>out of the gloom of the pines. “They came </p><p>searching at the foot at the rapids. They </p><p>found all our paddles, the nose-cloth of the </p><p>Golden Daughter and one pack that was </p><p>washed away. It was the nose-cloth that </p><p>set Shining Horns to weeping.” </p><p> “They think the canoe sunk and all of us</p><p>drowned?” demanded Carlisle. </p><p> “So,” answered Waseyawin. “The grief</p><p>of Shining Horns was terrible to see. I</p><p>think he would have cast himself into the </p><p>whirlpool had not others led him away. </p><p>They dared not wait long, these others, for </p><p>fear of the French Company’s men behind. </p><p>They went on with our own men as pris- </p><p>oners in their canoes, and it is well they </p><p>went, because Black-beard and his followers </p><p>came after. I waited to see if that would </p><p>come to pass before I left my watch.” </p><p> “Your eyes are good, my Cree brother,”</p><p>eulogized Missowa, “even as good as your </p><p>paddle in white water. Now that Shining </p><p>Horns and his men are gone Golden Daugh- </p><p>ter may be freed.” </p><p> With deft hands the Ojibway unknotted</p><p>the sash and whipped it back on his waist, </p><p>at the same time handing Waseyawin the </p><p>fillet for his head. </p><p>26 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Oh, my poor father!” cried Joan, tears</p><p>in her eyes. “He’ll be half-crazed. And </p><p>Richelieu may catch him yet upon the </p><p>river.” </p><p> “How much start had he, Andrews?”</p><p>asked Carlisle. </p><p> “About an hour,” informed the priest.</p><p>“Then Richelieu won’t catch him, Joan,” </p><p>decided the Factor. “Once warned,Wayne </p><p>is not the man to be overtaken. He’ll have </p><p>a scouting craft out behind his brigade. If </p><p>hostile canoes are reported, he can leave the </p><p>rive* the same as we did. So don’t worry. </p><p>Your father will be safe, all right, and we’ll </p><p>bring you back to him as sound as ever at </p><p>Sturgeon Lake.” </p><p> “But yourself, Paul,” she burst out, im-</p><p>petuously dropping to her knees beside him, </p><p>“your own hurts-” </p><p> “I’m all right,” checked Carlisle with a</p><p>smile. “There’s nothing the matter with </p><p>me but a good headache and a gash in the </p><p>leg that a spiked branch might have made.” </p><p>“Yet how can you forgive me my father’s </p><p>intent?” </p><p> “You know why, don’t you?” he mur-</p><p>mured so low. that the others could not </p><p>hear. “Besides, he fired out of desperate </p><p>fear for you, as any one—as I myself would </p><p>have done. Don’t you worry, girl, but </p><p>hurry and dry your clothes. The Indians </p><p>will have a shelter ready for you in a few </p><p>minutes. Missowa, Waseyawin,” address- </p><p>ing his familiars, “bid the middlemen make </p><p>three bough camps and small fires in front </p><p>that will not smoke above the tree-tops. </p><p>Also gather and cook the evening meal.” </p><p>Very soon the shelters were ready and </p><p>occupied, one by each of the three whites, </p><p>shelters consisting simply of circles of </p><p>forked saplings thrust into the ground like </p><p>teepee poles, overlaid with balsam boughs </p><p>and floored with the same. In the opening </p><p>glowed heaps of charred fragments taken </p><p>from blackened tree trunks and stumps, the </p><p>remains of former forest fires. </p><p> In the central space of the clearing Wase-</p><p>yawin had kindled another cooking fire.</p><p>Missowa had taken the middlemen off to set </p><p>a length of gill net in the river and hunt the </p><p>evergreens for grouse. Presently these re- </p><p>turned with both finned and feathered game, </p><p>several giant trout and pickerel and half a </p><p>dozen partridges knocked from their roosts </p><p>by sticks. </p><p> The delicious odor of crisping fish, of</p><p>broiling partridge, of baking bannocks, of </p><p>simmering tea filled the camp space, drifting </p><p>tantalizingly upon the evening breeze. </p><p>With magical celerity a home-like atmo- </p><p>sphere had been created in the midst of the </p><p>wilderness, and the tiny clearing hard by the </p><p>pine gloom and walled ’round with the </p><p>creeping dusk took on the well-defined air of </p><p>ancient use. </p><p> Lying in their shelters the whites ate their</p><p>meal while they dried their steaming clothes, </p><p>and once they were done with the serving </p><p>the canoemen squatted by themselves, </p><p>bending over the kettles and pots of the cen- </p><p>tral fire, their red-bronze frames and </p><p>swarthy faces touched carmine by the </p><p>flamelight. Hungrily they ate and lighted </p><p>their pipes, Missowa delaying long enough </p><p>to bring Carlisle’s own pipe to his teepee. </p><p> “Here is dry tobacco, Factor,” he an-</p><p>nounced, “and the steel that makes the fire </p><p>(flint and steel).” </p><p> “Put them there,” directed Carlisle, “and,</p><p>Missowa, have the middlemen whittle out </p><p>new paddles, weaving woolen streamers for </p><p>them from the ball of wool you will find in </p><p>the packs. Also, see that the canoe is </p><p>mended with care. We start on at </p><p>dawn.” </p><p> When the Ojibway had gone back to the</p><p>fire to set the middlemen at their tasks, </p><p>Carlisle filled and lighted his pipe, ecstatic- </p><p>ally savoring the tobacco’s perfume and the </p><p>other camp fragrances that stole so fa- </p><p>miliarly into his nostrils, the supper scent, </p><p>the pungent wood smoke, the spice of bal- </p><p>sam and pine, the resinous pitch the In- </p><p>dians were melting, the steam of human </p><p>garments. </p><p> For it was ever at such moments as these</p><p>that the incomparable thrill of the life in the </p><p>wild rushed over him in a surge of joy so </p><p>fierce as to be akin to pain. Here men</p><p>lived, he exulted! Here was no cramped, </p><p>purposeless existence, no desk-bound slavery </p><p>such as he had come to visualize in his four </p><p>years of London. This was the epic life, </p><p>the Homeric essay, the Iliad of the forest! </p><p> Dreamily his eyes and his soul and his</p><p>senses lapsed, and before he was aware his </p><p>hand slipped limply from his pipe and the </p><p>pipe fell from his lips. The night crept on. </p><p>The young moon showed for a little over the </p><p>balsam ridge, bathing the forest like a radiant </p><p>mist, glowing through the latticed branches, </p><p>checkering each clearing in silver and black, </p><p>overlaying the ghostly birch trunks with </p><p>luminous pearl. </p><p>Ambush </p><p>27 </p><p>THE transient light filtered </p><p>through Carlisle’s bough shelter, </p><p>touched his face, and receded again </p><p>as the moon set behind the ridge. But </p><p>neither moonrise nor moonset served to </p><p>waken him. Still he dozed, till the slight </p><p>scuffle of a moccasin stirred him. </p><p> Yet, true to his woodsman’s instinct, he</p><p>stirred inwardly, not outwardly, giving no </p><p>muscular response to the impression from </p><p>without till he should have sensed whether </p><p>friend or enemy wore the scuffling mocca- </p><p>sins. His body retained its immobility. </p><p>Only his eyelids parted, almost impercept- </p><p>ibly, till he could glimpse the fire-lit en- </p><p>trance where his mosquito smudge flared and </p><p>smoked and hissed its defiance to the </p><p>whining pests. </p><p> Then he saw in their dainty materialism</p><p>the moccasins that had wakened him, two </p><p>tiny creations of elkskin, like Cinderella </p><p>slippers of the forest, so small that they </p><p>could have walked upon his outstretched </p><p>palms. They revealed the identity of his </p><p>visitor. None but Joan wore such fairy </p><p>footgear. </p><p> He shifted his furtive gaze upward, to</p><p>see her swelling-hipped, full-bosomed figure </p><p>silhouetted in the ochre glow. He could </p><p>mark the wonderful fairness of her skin, the </p><p>sparkle of the lake-blue eyes, the shimmer </p><p>of her hair that gleamed like a frosted web </p><p>of fine gold threads with every flare of the </p><p>smudge. </p><p> “Paul, how does your wound feel now?”</p><p>she asked. </p><p> Some sudden, unaccountable whim kept</p><p>Carlisle silent. </p><p> Hesitatingly Joan stepped over to where</p><p>he lay upon the balsam boughs. He seemed </p><p>asleep, his eyelids closed. In the dim light </p><p>of the interior she noted the bandage upon </p><p>his stockinged leg and the discoloration of </p><p>the bruise upon his temple, and a flood of </p><p>mingled feeling rushed over her. </p><p> All in an instant she was swept and</p><p>shaken by the romantic glamor of their first </p><p>meeting that eventful night at Grande</p><p>Portage, by the sweet companionship of </p><p>their days of wilderness travel, by the pas- </p><p>sionate unbaring of Carlisle’s heart in the </p><p>wild dash through the Rapide des Boisfranc. </p><p> Standing over him, her own heart beat in a</p><p>tumult, and though her intellect flashed a </p><p>vague warning of restraint, it could not </p><p>curb the impulsive surge of her emotion. </p><p>Swiftly she stooped, pressed her warm bps </p><p>to Carlisle’s lips and fled back on silent </p><p>winged feet to her own tent. </p><p> His fibers all a-throb, Carlisle opened his</p><p>eyes. Instinctively his arms went out, but </p><p>Joan had vanished too quickly. Like a4 </p><p>wood nymph she had come and like a wood </p><p>nymph she had gone, too ethereal for the </p><p>human grasping. </p><p> All Carlisle’s arms encircled was the</p><p>empty air. All his wide-open eyes saw was </p><p>the stoic Indians mending the six-fathom </p><p>canoe. It lay 011 its side by the fire, one </p><p>gunwale propped up with sticks, the yellow </p><p>bark shining deep orange under the magic </p><p>flames. </p><p> Over the rents Missowa and Waseyawin</p><p>were fitting strips of canvas while the mid- </p><p>dlemen poured on the resinous pitch. A </p><p>study in red, yellow’, bronze, crimson, um- </p><p>ber and orange they worked, ringed ’round </p><p>by the velvet band of the forest starred here </p><p>and there with the prying eyes of the watch- </p><p>ers of the wild. </p><p> Carlisle followed the shift of the eyes un-</p><p>consciously, and by the eyes and the scurry- </p><p>ings among the leaves he read the identity </p><p>of each—a darting weasel or mink, a timid </p><p>doe with her fawn, a porcupine running a </p><p>log, a pack of full-bellied harmless wolves </p><p>worming like dogs toward the fascinating </p><p>glare. </p><p> And in the trees above he read analogous</p><p>sounds, the feathered wild things of the air </p><p>going abroad with their kin of the earth, the </p><p>plaintive whippoorwill, the rasping night </p><p>hawk, the hooting owl on its noiseless pin- </p><p>ions. All the wilderness had awakened </p><p>with the moonset. The susurrus of the pine </p><p>sang overhead like passing winds, and </p><p>winds themselves, arising no one knew how, </p><p>dying no one knew where, came and went </p><p>like unseen hosts on the march.</p><p> Beaver slapped their pistol-like warnings</p><p>in the ponds below the balsam ridge. Bull </p><p>moose called from the thickets beside. </p><p>Never for a moment was the night-world </p><p>still. Yet, buoying all these noises, Car- </p><p>lisle sensed an underswell of silence, the </p><p>poise of the lonely land, passive, brooding, </p><p>Nirvanic, the voiceless spirit of the North </p><p>itself lying mute in its ambush, waiting to </p><p>spring upon men in the unguarded moment </p><p>of their weakness! </p><p> The pale-yellow stars in the purple sky</p><p>seemed planets appointed to another sphere, </p><p>and the only gleam which showed in the </p><p>dark, austere immensity of the earth itself </p><p>28 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>was the fitful sweep of the aurora above the </p><p>trees on the ridge and the phosphorescent </p><p>smear of organic gases waving over the black </p><p>muck marsh beneath. Carlisle gazed at </p><p>the pyrotechnic display till too prolonged </p><p>gazing began to produce internal flashes in </p><p>his brain and he dropped his head for </p><p>sleep. </p><p> All the rest of the camp slumbered save</p><p>Missowa and Waseyawin, who before turn- </p><p>ing in with their fellows were sitting a mo- </p><p>ment by the fire pointing with the stems of </p><p>their pipes at the aurora and the will-o'-the- </p><p>wisps. They were talking in hissing, gurg- </p><p>ling, lisping Cree, and the trend of their </p><p>speech was the last sound to reach Carlisle’s </p><p>drowsy ears. </p><p> “Behold, my Cree brother,” spoke Mis-</p><p>sowa, “there are the Spirit Lights in their </p><p>Summer garb, the souls of our forefathers </p><p>rushing rank on rank into battle. For the </p><p>dead die not, Waseyawin, but live to hunt </p><p>and fish and fight again even as you and I </p><p>shall do. Their robes of light and flashing </p><p>spears are but signs for their children and </p><p>their children’s children here in the forest </p><p>below.” </p><p> “Ae, Missowa,” nodded the Cree, “signs</p><p>that we will follow when our last camp-fire is </p><p>burned. But these others,” indicating the </p><p>dancing, incandescent will-o’-the-wisps,“we </p><p>do not follow. For they, my Ojibway </p><p>brother, are the lures of our enemies, of </p><p>Shining Horns and his men. They think us </p><p>at the bottom of the whirlpools, and these </p><p>lights they have put out by magic to lead </p><p>our drowned souls astray!” </p><p>CHAPTER VI </p><p>THE DEAD ARISE </p><p>THREE hundred miles of headland- </p><p>broken, island-studded gale-thrashed, </p><p>roller-raped Winnipeg lay behind, one hun- </p><p>dred and more of the sinuous Saskatchewan, </p><p>and at last through the long twilight of a </p><p>Northern evening Cumberland House </p><p>loomed up on Pine Island Lake, the western </p><p>arm of the Sturgeon. </p><p> July had run out upon Lake Winnipeg</p><p>where head winds held them behind shel- </p><p>tering points, where erratic squalls beached </p><p>them upon stormy lee shores, where rain- </p><p>choked gales flailed them upon barren islets, </p><p>smothering any attempt at fire, leveling! any </p><p>attempt at shelter, roaring and ramping for </p><p>five days at a stretch. It was the first week </p><p>of August and the end of Carlisle’s long </p><p>journey from James Bay. </p><p> The end, and how familiar an end! His</p><p>mind turned back to the time when he had </p><p>sojourned here with Thompson long years </p><p>before, planning and executing for the day </p><p>of undisputed supremacy of the Hudson’s </p><p>Bay Company, and his blood leaped as he </p><p>glimpsed the well-remembered log post </p><p>buildings, the stout stockade, the tall flag- </p><p>staff with the blood-red banner of his cor- </p><p>poration flapping from its tip. </p><p> All about the stockade straggled Indian</p><p>teepees of the tribes come in to trade. The </p><p>smoke of many teepee fires spiraled through </p><p>the dusk and a babel of noises rose from the </p><p>camps, the guttural jargon of the hunters </p><p>and squaws, laughter of the maidens, wails </p><p>of papooses, shrieks of children at play, </p><p>barking of mongrel dogs. </p><p> Suddenly these noises stilled! Men lin-</p><p>ing the stockade, standing upon the firing </p><p>steps and leaning over the palisades, had </p><p>caught sight of Carlisle’s huge canoe. A </p><p>voice commanded silence, and then with a </p><p>surge a loud cheer burst from whites and </p><p>Indians alike. </p><p> They recognized even in the dusk the</p><p>Hudson’s Bay flag in the canoe bow, the </p><p>long gonfalon in the stern, the gaudy cos- </p><p>tumes, woolen streamers, slanting feathers </p><p>that graced the canoemen of a Factor. </p><p>Here, then, was the new overlord they ex- </p><p>pected—here was Carlisle of far Moose </p><p>Factory! </p><p> The gate swung open swiftly, and a bare-</p><p>headed, swarthy-skinned, heavily-built half- </p><p>breed came forward. Cree blood showed in </p><p>his eyes and feature casting, and by these </p><p>signs as well as by the description Eugene </p><p>Drummond had given of him Carlisle im- </p><p>mediately recognized him as Henry Galt, </p><p>the chief trader who had been left in charge </p><p>of the post awaiting his taking it over. </p><p> Son of one of the earlier white adventurers</p><p>who had married among the Crees, Drum- </p><p>mond had said, and now as he advanced </p><p>with long stalking strides he spoke a salu- </p><p>tation in Cree. </p><p> “Welcome, Factor,” he greeted respect-</p><p>fully, glancing the rest over with his black </p><p>eyes but seeming not to see any other than </p><p>his superior as he glanced. “You have had </p><p>a hard journey I read.” </p><p> “True, Galt, a hard one,” returned Car-</p><p>lisle. “Through fire and flood on the rivers </p><p>Ambush </p><p>29 </p><p>and storm on the lakes. But we are here at </p><p>last.” </p><p> “Ae, you are here, and it is good that your</p><p>flag should float.” </p><p> With his own hands, Galt took the stream-</p><p>ing gonfalon from the stern of the canoe. </p><p>It was soiled with river water, ripped by </p><p>snags, scorched from the breath of forest </p><p>fire, but these scars on the silk but lent it </p><p>greater prestige. Proudly the chief trader </p><p>carried it into the stockade ground, and </p><p>ordered the post banner lowered. Quickly </p><p>he fastened the gonfalon on and bade the </p><p>Indians haul away on the halyard. </p><p>AS HE emerged again the two ban- </p><p>ners rose to the staff tip, Com- </p><p>pany’s flag and Factor’s flag flying </p><p>side by side. Another cheer rang from the </p><p>palisade, and as Galt waved his hand the </p><p>guns up-pointed and blazed in salute. </p><p> “Factor,” spoke the chief trader in the</p><p>oratorical manner of his mother’s people, </p><p>“I hand you over the post.” </p><p> Carlisle drew himself up proudly upon the</p><p>shore. The flesh wound in his leg had </p><p>practically healed. He stood straight and </p><p>strong. </p><p> “I take it from good hands, Galt,” he ac-</p><p>cepted. “You I choose to retain as my </p><p>chief trader. Eugene Drummond is my </p><p>brigade leader, and it is news of Drummond </p><p>I want to hear now. Have you seen any- </p><p>thing of him?” </p><p> “Three days ago Drummond came, he</p><p>and other Hudson’s Bay men I did not know, </p><p>as prisoners among the crews of Wayne the </p><p>Free-Trader. I had orders not to bother </p><p>anybody till you came. I knew something </p><p>had gone wrong, but I obeyed my orders.” </p><p>An exclamation of joy burst from Joan. </p><p>She seized Carlisle’s arm with a little </p><p>hysterical laugh, though the tears were in </p><p>her eyes. </p><p> “He is here, Paul—he is here!” she ex-</p><p>ulted. “Richelieu didn’t catch him after </p><p>all. But I was so fearful, even though you </p><p>were so sure!”</p><p> “Yes, it’s good news for you,” smiled</p><p>Carlisle. “I thought Richelieu could hardly </p><p>match him for woodcraft. And Richelieu </p><p>himself, Galt,” addressing his chief trader </p><p>again, “what about him?” </p><p> “Four days ago the Northwester came,”</p><p>answered Galt pointing where a scarce half- </p><p>mile away Richelieu’s post flying the North- </p><p>west flag showed vaguely in the deepening </p><p>dusk. “In June he took the Sturgeon Lake </p><p>brigades down to Grande Portage with furs. </p><p>Now he comes with the Winter supplies.” </p><p> “I know,” Carlisle laughed grimly. “I</p><p>met him myself at Grande Portage, also on </p><p>the way into the Pays d’en Haut. And he </p><p>arrived first, eh? A day ahead! You hear </p><p>that, Joan? Your father gave Richelieu </p><p>the slip by leaving the river as I imagined.” </p><p>“Yes, yes, but take me to him at once,” </p><p>Joan pleaded. “You know he thinks I’m </p><p>dead.” </p><p> “In a moment,” assented Carlisle. “Galt,</p><p>order the men of the post to stand to their </p><p>arms in case of trouble and you yourself go </p><p>on and give the peace sign at Fort Wayne. </p><p>I’ll take my crew as bodyguard although I </p><p>don’t suppose that is hardly necessary. </p><p>Ha—you, Father Andrews! Like an un- </p><p>grateful boy I was almost forgetting you. </p><p>Go on inside, Father, and take the freedom </p><p>of Cumberland House till I come back.” </p><p>“No, Paul, I’ll go with you,” decided the </p><p>priest. “I like to be by your side in case of </p><p>trouble to add my influence to your own.” </p><p>“All right then, Father! Go ahead, Galt!” </p><p>Wayne’s post stood as close to Cumber- </p><p>land House as Richelieu’s. It, too, was less </p><p>than half a mile away, although, close as the </p><p>posts were together, it was no mystery that </p><p>Carlisle had never seen Joan till he set eyes </p><p>on her at Grande Portage. </p><p> It was many years since he was here with</p><p>Thompson, and Wayne at that time was es- </p><p>tablishing other posts on the Saskatche- </p><p>wan’s branches in territory far removed </p><p>from Pine Island Lake. His Pine Island </p><p>Lake post, only a trader’s cabin in the be- </p><p>ginning, had grown as his trade grew, and he </p><p>had added to it piece by piece, warehouse, </p><p>fur house, spacious dwelling-house, all of </p><p>logs, till his independent post under the </p><p>Free-Trade flag was as large as that of either</p><p>the Hudson’s Bay Company’s or the North- </p><p>westers’. </p><p> Only lately had he deemed it necessary to</p><p>protect it in any material sense, increasing </p><p>friction with both companies compelling </p><p>the erection of the palisade against which </p><p>Galt now hammered. </p><p> “Who’s that?” demanded the gatekeeper,</p><p>peering through the gloom. “You, Galt? </p><p>What d’ye want?” </p><p> But Galt, his open palm held out in the</p><p>peace sign, was forestalled by the eager, </p><p>excited Joan. </p><p> “Open the gate, Murdock, open the gate!”</p><p>STS </p><p>30 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>she commanded peremptorily. “It’s Joan. </p><p>I want my father. These men are friends. </p><p>Open quickly.” </p><p> Like a man who sees the dead arise the</p><p>gatekeeper obeyed, and Joan brushed </p><p>rapidly past him, rushing at the head of the </p><p>others, leading them through the yard </p><p>toward the dwelling-house. </p><p> The rough benches upon the long veranda</p><p>across the house front were empty, but the </p><p>door stood open, a yellow square of lamp- </p><p>light eddied through and through with blue </p><p>tobacco smoke, and in the frame of the door- </p><p>way as in a painted picture they could see a </p><p>group of men inside, Wayne, Mason and </p><p>others lounging in chairs about a big table, </p><p>confefring over papers, smoking long black </p><p>pipes. </p><p> Joan sprang over the veranda and framed</p><p>herself in the doorway. </p><p> Carlisle at her shoulder saw the faces of</p><p>the men inside distorted by a colossal amaze- </p><p>ment, incredulity, and darkened by the sud- </p><p>den shadow of superstition which their wil- </p><p>derness natures could never wholly flout. </p><p>He saw Mason’s brown-bearded, long- </p><p>jawed face tilted back, the cigar poised in </p><p>his hand, his yellowed teeth jarred apart, </p><p>not in triumphant grin as he had seen it </p><p>once before but in speechless gape. </p><p> Wayne himself, his cigar dropping on to</p><p>the table, had risen from his chair to his great </p><p>height, his features as impassive as carved </p><p>mahogany but his fawn-green eyes blazing </p><p>like molten disks. Such a look in any liv- </p><p>ing eyes Carlisle had never seen. It ap- </p><p>proached most nearly the vision of the seer, </p><p>the prophet, the vision that seems to pierce </p><p>the gray rime of earthly things and behold </p><p>the secret realms of another world. </p><p> “Verna! Verna!” he articulated in a</p><p>whisper. </p><p> “No, no, father, I am not my mother’s</p><p>ghost!” declared Joan, crying full-voiced, </p><p>leaping full-blooded across the floor. “I </p><p>am Joan, and I am not at the bottom of </p><p>Rapide des Boisfranc. Oh, my dear—my </p><p>dear, I’m sorry I’ve made you grieve!”</p><p> She was in his arms, impulsive, palpitant,</p><p>moving, her wheaten hair mingled with his </p><p>brown curls, her cheek pressing his like a </p><p>rose petal lying upon an Autumn-browned </p><p>leaf. Abruptly Wayne’s grim strength </p><p>went from him. He trembled like the slim </p><p>poplars on the w.nd-blown Saskatchewan </p><p>hills and sagged back into his chair, his </p><p>daughter on his knee. </p><p> “By the Doom, girl—by—the—Doom!”</p><p>was all he could mutter. </p><p> “See, I’m a prisoner of war, father!” she</p><p>laughed gaily. “And I’ve come for ex- </p><p>change. You’re to give Paul his twenty- </p><p>five men in place of me. Am I not worth it? </p><p>Besides, I’ve promised him you would.” </p><p>“Paul—Paul,” stammered Wayne in be- </p><p>wilderment, “who-” </p><p>THEN his eyes followed Joan’s </p><p>laughing ones to rest upon Carlisle </p><p>gazing down the table length upon </p><p>him. Though the Factor and the rest had </p><p>entered on Joan’s heels, Wayne saw him for </p><p>the first time. </p><p> He had seen nothing before but the femi-</p><p>nine vision of his dead, living again in his </p><p>daughter’s image, and now he leaped vio- </p><p>lently to his feet once more, pushing Joan </p><p>aside into his chair as he leaped. </p><p> Carlisle saw that his eyes had their earthly</p><p>focus back, bitter, implacable, savage, and </p><p>in them he faced the terrible, lightning- </p><p>like blaze of passion he knew so well. </p><p> “You, Carlisle,” choked Wayne, “you</p><p>dragged my girl by the brink of hell through </p><p>those rapids and you dare to come and </p><p>stand in my post afterward—you cursed </p><p>spit of your drunken English father!” </p><p> “Stop right there, Wayne!”.warned Car-</p><p>lisle, a wave of red anger surging over his </p><p>own face. “For your daughter’s sake I’ve </p><p>taken a good deal of defiance from you. </p><p>For her sake maybe I’ll take a lot more. I </p><p>can’t say. But don’t touch my father’s </p><p>honor with that reckless tongue of yours!” </p><p>“Touch his honor? I’ll touch his very </p><p>bones in his grave and make them writhe in </p><p>shame! You saw her there in the doorway </p><p>—Joan? That was Verna—her mother— </p><p>all rose and golden.</p><p> “That was how I saw her last the day of</p><p>Major Butler’s raid on the Wyoming. The </p><p>day his Rangers—the cursed lusting hounds </p><p>—came by, under Captain Charles Carlisle </p><p>and Carlisle—the vilest hound of them all— </p><p>struck her down in my own house while I </p><p>was away!” </p><p> “You lie, Wayne! You lie abominably,</p><p>devilishly! None but armed men were </p><p>killed in that raid.” </p><p> “So the ignorant tale-makers tell, but we</p><p>who went through the fire and slaughter </p><p>know better. We who lost our homes and </p><p>our loved ones have memories that nothing </p><p>can efface!” </p><p>Ambush </p><p>31 </p><p> “Andrews, Andrews,” groaned Carlisle,</p><p>his face whitened to an ashy shade under </p><p>his bronze, “tell him he lies! You knew my </p><p>father. You were his friend, and my </p><p>guardian. Tell him he lies!” </p><p> “May God forgive me, Paul, but I can’t,”</p><p>murmured the priest, catching him by the </p><p>arm. “I know nothing but what Wayne </p><p>has said and that the raid was made in </p><p>liquor. Liquored men are madmen and </p><p>their brains do not know what their hands </p><p>are doing.” </p><p> “And you knew, Andrews? And you</p><p>never told me? But, high heaven, he was </p><p>my father, my father!” </p><p> Reiterating the words, Carlisle stood</p><p>gazing wildly across the table at Joan, star- </p><p>ing into a face as pale as his own, into eyes </p><p>as wide-set with anguish. </p><p> “And you, Joan, you knew—” he began.</p><p>“Only the—the—truth, Paul,” Joan cried. </p><p>“My father never told me whose hand was </p><p>in it.” </p><p> “There was no need,” snarled Wayne, “no</p><p>need till now! Am I a liar, then, Carlisle? </p><p>If you think so, go and ask Richelieu. I </p><p>have no love for him at this late date, but he </p><p>was once our friend, for he was as dashing </p><p>an officer as one would find anywhere in </p><p>those days. </p><p> “Simon Richelieu was a nineteen-year-old</p><p>lieutenant then, officering what local force </p><p>we had, and he was the one who took me </p><p>home and showed me the crumpled, bleed- </p><p>ing, breathless thing that war makes of </p><p>woman! And, a few hours before, I had </p><p>left her all rose and golden! By heaven, </p><p>go and ask Richelieu, I tell you! He saw!” </p><p>“I—will—not,” panted Carlisle in a pas- </p><p>sion of despair. “One word of Richelieu’s </p><p>corroboration and I would kill him!” </p><p> “By the Doom, you hold a tarnished</p><p>honor brightly! It’s well Charlie Carlisle </p><p>fell on the Wyoming. It would have been </p><p>better for yourself if you had never lived. </p><p>When I drifted North from my homeless </p><p>valley with my girl of four I swore an oath </p><p>against the Carlisle breed, and by the grave</p><p>that lies southward on Wyoming waters I </p><p>will keep it! Now, go back to your post, </p><p>Carlisle. Joan’s word is mine. Mason </p><p>will hand you over your twenty-five men.” </p><p>The petrified Missourian sprang into life </p><p>again, but the Factor did not move. He re- </p><p>mained staring stupidly at Joan till the </p><p>priest drew him toward the door. Missowa, </p><p>Waseyawin and the four middlemen crossed </p><p>the veranda ahead like gliding shadows, and </p><p>like gliding shadows they mingled in the </p><p>yard with Mason’s muster of the aston- </p><p>ished Hudson’s Bay prisoners—Drummond, </p><p>Lewis, Garry, Lea, Hampton, Jarvis, Wells, </p><p>the James Bay Crees, Ojibways, Chippewas. </p><p> But of these Carlisle took no note. He</p><p>walked unseeing, urged by the priest’s hand </p><p>across the dark yard. </p><p> “Andrews,” he burst out as they passed</p><p>through the gate, “did my father know the </p><p>district he was raiding?” </p><p> “Yes, Paul.”</p><p> “The people?”</p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “The house?”</p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “Oh, my God—her?”</p><p> “Yes. I can’t lie to you. You know I</p><p>can’t!” </p><p> “Did my father love her?” he blurted</p><p>harshly. “For heaven’s sake, tell me if he </p><p>loved her?” </p><p> “Yes, he loved her,” declared Andrews in</p><p>a broken voice. “That much I know. </p><p>When your mother died in the Niagara post, </p><p>Paul, his was a lonely life. He loved Verna </p><p>Miller! Aye, and so did the stripling </p><p>Richelieu, though Wayne won her from </p><p>them both!” </p><p> Like lightning the significance of Andrews’</p><p>words flashed home to Carlisle as he stum- </p><p>bled along the rough shore of Pine Island </p><p>Lake toward Cumberland House. Before </p><p>him was more than the competition of three </p><p>rival trading companies, more than the</p><p>essay at empire of three rival corporations. </p><p> He was plunged into the tense struggle of</p><p>souls in combat, all the wrongs of another </p><p>generation crying for their righting, with </p><p>the very spirits of the dead arising from the </p><p>grave to claim that righting. </p><p>CHAPTER VII </p><p>TRADE WAR </p><p>CJITTING around the counter of Galt’s </p><p>^ trading-room at morning, the Hud- </p><p>son’s Bay officers leaped swiftly to their </p><p>feet as Carlisle came in. All the sleepless </p><p>night he had shut himself up in his council- </p><p>room, and now they hung upon his decision </p><p>concerning the course to be pursued against </p><p>Northwesters and Free-Traders alike. </p><p> “Is it war, Factor?” they chorused</p><p>eagerly. </p><p>32 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> The marks of sleeplessness and inner</p><p>conflict showed upon Carlisle, pallor of skin </p><p>under his bronze, dark circles around his </p><p>eyes, a weariness in the gray eyes them- </p><p>selves, but he nodded with his grim smile. </p><p> “It’s war,” he announced, “perhaps in</p><p>all its bitter phases but a trade war first of </p><p>all. It starts today, this morning, on the </p><p>minute, and I’ve work cut out for each of </p><p>you to do.” </p><p> A murmur of approbation stirred the</p><p>group. It was what they hungered for, </p><p>action, strategy, blows, no doubt, in the </p><p>end. </p><p> Carlisle took a map from his pocket and</p><p>spread it open on the counter. </p><p> “Look,” he urged, pointing, “get the sit-</p><p>uation fixed in your minds! Richelieu’s </p><p>post was the first post on Sturgeon Lake. </p><p>Tom and Joe Frobisher built it in 1772, </p><p>and it was built in defiance of the Hudson’s </p><p>Bay Company’s charter. </p><p> “That it has passed, since the amalga-</p><p>mation of the Montreal traders as the North- </p><p>west Company, into Richelieu’s hands does </p><p>not alter that fact. It’s trading where the </p><p>Hudson’s Bay Company alone has the right </p><p>to trade. Sam Hearne came up the Church- </p><p>ill in 1774 and masked it with this post, </p><p>Fort Cumberland, but competition hasn’t </p><p>killed it—yet. </p><p> “Then, years after, Wayne buffaloed his</p><p>way in—a second poacher. Now, men, </p><p>this Cumberland District is the district of </p><p>the West. Who holds the Cumberland </p><p>District holds the Saskatchewan, and who </p><p>holds the Saskatchewan holds the West. </p><p>You understand me?” </p><p> “Oui,” nodded Drummond emphatically,</p><p>speaking for them all, “dey understand dat </p><p>all right.” </p><p> “So did our sleeping overlords on James</p><p>Bay when they woke up,” Carlisle went on. </p><p>“That’s why they sent Hearne up here. </p><p>That’s why they hurried other men in to </p><p>build other forts, a perfect network of them </p><p>from Hudson’s Bay to the Rockies, from</p><p>Athabasca Lake to the headwaters of the </p><p>Missouri. </p><p> “Those forts will hold the West only if</p><p>Cumberland House holds Sturgeon Lake. </p><p>Because, you see, the Saskatchewan is the </p><p>great highway from the Rockies, and Stur- </p><p>geon Lake commands the water lanes to it </p><p>jn the east, the west and the north. There’s </p><p>the point. It’s the connection of the North- </p><p>ern lakes and rivers here with the Church- </p><p>ill River that gives this place its strategic </p><p>importance.” </p><p> “Losh, yes, Factor,” spoke Garry, “and</p><p>what wass it you would be asking us to do?” </p><p> “I’ll tell you in a moment. I just want</p><p>to emphasize the danger. You know the </p><p>strength of the Northwesters, and I can tell </p><p>you in all confidence that the Government </p><p>of Canada is pitted through and through </p><p>with Northwest adherents. Where they </p><p>are not actually shareholders in the com- </p><p>pany, they are in close relationship with </p><p>shareholders. </p><p> “The Hudson’s Bay Company is powerful</p><p>in the Government ranks in England, but </p><p>it is the Northwest Company which wields </p><p>that power here. If we lose our grip, the </p><p>Hudson’s Bay Company may as well sur- </p><p>render its charter.” </p><p> “The teevil!” exclaimed Lea, astounded,</p><p>while all the men, suddenly smitten by the </p><p>magnitude of their undertaking, exchanged </p><p>glances of wonder. </p><p> “Into the hands of the Northwesters it</p><p>will go,” Carlisle declared. “And, without </p><p>our opposition in the field, they will not be </p><p>long in swallowing up the Free-Traders.” </p><p> “Yer don’t mean to s’y, Factor, that the</p><p>Northwesters ’11 stand supreme, do ye?” </p><p>burst out Jarvis, the Cockney clerk. </p><p>“Blimey if the men that’s fought under the </p><p>H. B. C. flag so long could stand that, ye </p><p>know. And, s’elp me, wot is the territory </p><p>of our charter? Ayn’t it all the ground </p><p>drained by the rivers wot run into Hudson’s </p><p>B’y?” </p><p> “Yes,” smiled the Factor, “but that ter-</p><p>ritory is tremendously big and vague, and </p><p>its boundaries have never been properly</p><p>defined. I have private information that </p><p>the Northwesters will soon send an expedi- </p><p>tion over the Rockies to the Pacific. The </p><p>headwaters of the Saskatchewan are by no </p><p>means the limits of their ambitions, and </p><p>besides, the Free-Trade movement is to be </p><p>feared as much as the Northwest advance. </p><p> “You know yourselves that Wayne has</p><p>independent traders planted all over the </p><p>West in his different posts. If both the </p><p>Hudson’s Bay and Northwest Companies </p><p>go down in a death-grapple the Free-Traders </p><p>will step in and gather all the spoils of the </p><p>West. Three strong companies are reach- </p><p>ing out for it, and I tell you in all serious- </p><p>ness, men, that two of those companies </p><p>have to be smashed before another Sum- </p><p>mer.” </p><p>Ambush </p><p>33 </p><p> “Then to the Dowl wi’ the Free-Traders</p><p>and the Northwesters alike!” cried Hampton </p><p>belligerently. “Our own territory be given </p><p>us by old charter. Us corned out here under </p><p>our company’s flag, an’ we ban’t going to </p><p>see un fall, I can assure ’e. You’m counting </p><p>on we, I reckon, Factor, to hold un feet while </p><p>you’m breaking un heads ope.” </p><p> “That’s it, Hampton,” laughed Carlisle.</p><p>“You five men must hold my lines of com- </p><p>munication. That’s why I brought you in. </p><p>Our posts in the Norway House and York </p><p>Districts have complete control. That </p><p>makes everything safe from Lake Winnipeg </p><p>to Hudson’s Bay, but between here and </p><p>Lake Winnipeg you must hold the lines as </p><p>I	say.</p><p> “Galt and Drummond I keep by me, of</p><p>course. Lea goes to the Nepowin, Lewis to </p><p>the Pas, Garry to Moose Lake, Hampton to </p><p>Chimawawin, Jarvis to Grand Rapids. You </p><p>will keep your territory clear of interlopers, </p><p>pay any price to get its trade and await </p><p>further orders from me. </p><p> “The Summer ship from England will</p><p>reach James Bay any day now, and the </p><p>moment she arrives York boats are coming </p><p>up the Hayes River from York Factory with </p><p>reserve supplies of food and trade goods. </p><p>You will hold these boats in relays at Grand </p><p>Rapids, Chimawawin and the Pas until I </p><p>send for them. That’s all, men. You </p><p>start at once. Galt and Drummond will </p><p>pick you out small canoes, outfits and </p><p>paddlers.” </p><p>IN FIVE minutes the fleet was </p><p>afloat. No man other than those </p><p>Carlisle had addressed had been told </p><p>its mission or its destination, but conjecture </p><p>ran rife through Cumberland House. The </p><p>whites hazarded shrewd guesses concerning </p><p>the Factor’s plans, while the Indian tribes </p><p>herded on the shore, jabbering and pointing </p><p>at the canoes till they disappeared. From </p><p>the doorway of Galt’s trading-room Carlisle </p><p>watched them go, and he had no misgivings </p><p>as he watched. </p><p> He knew his men, their abilities, limita-</p><p>tions, merits and demerits as he knew his</p><p>own, and even after they were gone he saw </p><p>them still on his mental vision—Garry, the </p><p>man of Inverness with his short, broad body, </p><p>flaming red beard and whimsical face; Lea, </p><p>the Cromarty youth with the brown hand- </p><p>someness of the tall, young Highlander; </p><p>Hampton, ruddy, fleshy, with his atmos- </p><p>3 </p><p>phere of the freshly-turned peat soil and </p><p>his Devon speech; Jarvis, a bunch of wires </p><p>and nerves reeling off his Cockney slang; </p><p>and Lewis, aged, mountainous-framed, gray- </p><p>haired and gray-bearded, craggy-featured </p><p>as the Hebrides he hailed from. </p><p> They were all picked men, tried in the</p><p>Company’s service. Carlisle had chosen </p><p>them out of many on the Bay, and he knew </p><p>they would not fail him. Wells, the South- </p><p>of-England stripling he had chosen for a </p><p>different kind of work, that of secret service, </p><p>and him he now sent out in another direc- </p><p>tion. </p><p> His destination was the Seepanock Chan-</p><p>nel, a short water lane connecting the </p><p>Saskatchewan and its tributary the Carrot </p><p>where they flowed almost parallel for a </p><p>space. His mission was to establish a </p><p>Winter camp there and scout along it to </p><p>prevent the possible attempt of down-com- </p><p>ing brigades of rival traders to avoid Pine </p><p>Island Lake and reach the Saskatchewan </p><p>again far to the east of it. </p><p> As the crowd on the shore broke up with</p><p>the passing of the canoes, Carlisle wheeled </p><p>back to Galt’s counter. </p><p> “Let me see your day-book, Galt,” he</p><p>requested. </p><p> He turned up the last entered page, the</p><p>page of recent trade and scanned the entries </p><p>with a practised eye. </p><p> Upon the yellow leaves of the well-</p><p>thumbed book the entries ran thus: </p><p>Son-of-the-Stars 10 beaver........10 skins ($5.00) </p><p>Amiska........ 5 skunk......... 2 skins ($1.00) </p><p>Running Moose.. 1 common red </p><p>fox.......... 1 skin ($0.50) </p><p>2 otter.......... 8 skins ($4.00) </p><p>Makwa........ 1 prime red fox.... 6 skins ($3.00) </p><p>1 cross do....... 7 skins ($3.50) </p><p>1 black do.......12 skins ($6.00) </p><p> The unit value was a beaver skin, chosen</p><p>as something concrete that the Indian mind </p><p>could comprehend in default of mathematics </p><p>and currency tokens, and though the unit </p><p>fluctuated in value with different posts it </p><p>was worth, on the average, fifty cents. To </p><p>the Indian his more valuable pelts were </p><p>simply his beaver skin multiplied as many </p><p>times as the post trader decreed. </p><p> In the entries Carlisle gazed upon he</p><p>found few of the costlier skins, in fact few </p><p>of any kind of skins, and he knew the reason. </p><p>These were but the feelers, the first light skins </p><p>of barter. Ever slow to bargain and anx- </p><p>ious to obtain the greatest price for their </p><p>34 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>catch, the hunters delayed, awaiting the </p><p>coming of the new Factor in the hope that </p><p>they might profit more. </p><p> But the amount of that profit they had</p><p>never imagined even in their rosiest dreams, </p><p>for now Carlisle tapped the day-book and </p><p>gave Galt the chief trader a hitherto un- </p><p>heard-of schedule of prices. </p><p> “Double it, Galt,” he ordered. “One</p><p>beaver is worth two skins. Send out the </p><p>word among our Indians and see that some </p><p>of our Indians mingle with Wayne’s and </p><p>Richelieu’s to carry the news.” </p><p> Immediately the word went out and trade</p><p>began. The Indians swarmed into the yard </p><p>and covered the trading-room floor. Tall, </p><p>black-eyed, raven-haired, smoky-skinned, </p><p>they stood, gaunt of waist and sinewy of </p><p>limb, clad only in deerskin trousers and </p><p>moccasins. Galt took a bag of trade bullets </p><p>to represent the beaver skins which they </p><p>comprehended. </p><p> They laid down what they had brought.</p><p>Galt gave them its estimated value in trade </p><p>bullets. They traded the bullets back to </p><p>Galt for whatever supplies they needed. </p><p>Thus in wilderness currency they turned </p><p>fox, mink, beaver and other skins into flour, </p><p>sugar, bacon and other commodities. </p><p> “Nor do I measure my flour and sugar</p><p>with my fingers inside the cup as the North- </p><p>westers and Free-Traders do,” Galt en- </p><p>couraged them in their own language. </p><p> “Neither do I take more of your bullets</p><p>than the value says. And I write no </p><p>larger debt against you in the books than </p><p>the just debt.” </p><p> The trade grew brisk, and not with the</p><p>Hudson’s Bay Company’s Indians alone </p><p>but with the tribes the Free-Traders and </p><p>Northwesters had won to their allegiance. </p><p>Cotameg the Chippewa in Carlisle’s service </p><p>and others visited the teepees about Wayne’s </p><p>and Richelieu’s posts, dropping news that </p><p>sent the occupants of those teepees stalking </p><p>over to Cumberland House. </p><p> At Richelieu’s post Cotameg detached</p><p>himself from all the rest and performed </p><p>another and unrehearsed act. By a circuit- </p><p>ous route he worked ’round to the rear of the </p><p>post and there, unmarked by any one on the </p><p>Cumberland House side, signaled to a man </p><p>on the palisades above. In a moment the </p><p>gate opened, and Richelieu himself ap- </p><p>peared. </p><p> “What is it, Cotameg?” he whispered.</p><p>“Quick! It is broad daylight, you must </p><p>remember, and it would not do for us to be </p><p>seen. Mon Dieu, no!” </p><p> “He has sent men to the Nepowin, the</p><p>Pas, Moose Lake, Chimawawin and Grand </p><p>Rapids,” the Chippewa spoke rapidly. </p><p>“There is food and trade stuff coming up </p><p>from James Bay. It will stay at the river </p><p>posts till he sends for it. No one was to </p><p>know, but I was hidden in the loft while they </p><p>talked and I heard.” </p><p> 11	Bon!” exclaimed Richelieu. “That is</p><p>all, eh?” </p><p> “He has made two beaver the price of one</p><p>beaver.” </p><p> “Ciel, a trade war! Then come to me day</p><p>by day, Cotameg. There will be things I </p><p>must know. Voila! Go back swiftly and </p><p>secretly.” </p><p> Nor was Wayne long in hearing the news</p><p>from his own Indians, and that very morn- </p><p>ing he met the Hudson’s Bay Company’s </p><p>challenge by advancing the beaver unit </p><p>another skin. In the afternoon Richelieu </p><p>was compelled to make it four skins, and </p><p>that night Carlisle raised it to five. </p><p>THEREAFTER it was a colossal </p><p>game of poker with beaver skins for </p><p>chips and no limit but the topaz sky </p><p>overhead. Like the Northland princes they </p><p>were the three played the game with mad </p><p>persistence. Never for an instant, night or </p><p>day, did trade slacken, for to slacken was to </p><p>lose. </p><p> Carlisle, Galt and Drummond worked in</p><p>turn behind the counter while the Indians </p><p>they dealt with traded and slept in relays or </p><p>slept not at all. Such profit, the tribes well </p><p>knew, could not last long. They availed </p><p>themselves while they might.</p><p> Never had the stoic hunters been moved</p><p>to such excitement. They stalked no more </p><p>but ran violently from post to post, frantic </p><p>for the highest bid. Around Wayne’s or </p><p>Richelieu’s counter they would be swarm- </p><p>ing, trading greedily, when a fellow tribes- </p><p>man would rush in jabbering and away </p><p>they would surge to Cumberland House </p><p>where beaver was worth another skin. For </p><p>never before had the Northland known the </p><p>like, never before had the poverty-ridden </p><p>Crees been possessed of so much wealth or </p><p>reveled in so much luxury. </p><p> Now their costlier pelts came out, bear,</p><p>lynx, wolf, wolverine, ermine, otter, marten, </p><p>fisher, the prime red fox, crosses, silvers, </p><p>blacks. Carlisle, Galt and Drummond </p><p>Ambush </p><p>35 </p><p>were pressed harder than ever, toiling in a </p><p>sweat through the sweltering August days. </p><p> The trading-room was a-reek with the odor</p><p>of fur. The teepees of the hunters were piled </p><p>with debt they carried away from the store, </p><p>pyramided with flour, sugar, tea, tobacco, </p><p>bacon,^beans. The hunters’ squaws came </p><p>likewise and had their lords clutter them up </p><p>with soap, ribbon, calico, velvet, thimbles, </p><p>mirrors, beads, silk handkerchiefs, Balmoral </p><p>skirts, huckaback towels and a hundred </p><p>other useless things. Gay as their squaws, </p><p>these lords went about in Wincy shirts with </p><p>castor-oil rubbed on their heads, gloating </p><p>over the new capotes laid by for colder </p><p>weather, proud of their bright axes, knives, </p><p>brass-bound trade guns and ammunition. </p><p> Much of the food they wasted in gorging</p><p>feasts. Much of the ammunition they </p><p>foolishly fired at marks. But, in Indian </p><p>logic, what did it matter? By the end of </p><p>the first mad week Carlisle, supreme in the </p><p>field, had hammered the price of beaver to </p><p>thirty skins. </p><p> Also by the end of that mad week Cum-</p><p>berland House was stripped of every article </p><p>of trade goods, every pound of provisions. </p><p>So, too, were the other posts, and the Factor </p><p>congratulated himself and his men. He had </p><p>won his game. It was what he aimed at. </p><p>Too late Wayne had awakened to the cost </p><p>of playing Northern poker. </p><p> The fort was out of farinaceous food, and</p><p>he was forced to send messengers off into </p><p>the forest for others of his independent </p><p>posts to come to his aid with enough sup- </p><p>plies to tide him over the Winter. Riche- </p><p>lieu, however, sent no messengers forth. </p><p>He looked at the empty shelves of his post, </p><p>shrugged his shoulders and awaited Car- </p><p>lisle’s next move. </p><p> It was Saturday night and the Factor,</p><p>Galt and Drummond with the volunteer </p><p>help of Andrews balanced up the company’s </p><p>books. Besides forcing the hands of their </p><p>competitors in the matter of supplies, they </p><p>had corrtered the bulk of the furs. Galt’s </p><p>fur-room was crammed with pelts. </p><p> It was true that they had paid five times</p><p>too much for some of the beaver and other </p><p>cheaper pelts, but they would make up that </p><p>loss on the priceless skins like the black and </p><p>silver foxes which all traders undervalued </p><p>for the Indians. More than that, they had </p><p>secured the trade, and the trade, in the </p><p>Indian mind, was the psychological thing. </p><p> “But are you sure, Galt,” asked Carlisle</p><p>when they finished, “that all our Indians </p><p>are in? None who got debt are missing off </p><p>the books?” </p><p> “Only old White Loon, his two sons,</p><p>nephew and cousin,” answered Galt. “They </p><p>all lived in one family, and they’re all just </p><p>nicely over the smallpox. I got word of </p><p>their coming in and stopped them up the </p><p>shore by Carcajou Cove. They went into </p><p>camp there. I made them throw away </p><p>their furs but gave them value for them. </p><p> “I dumped new clothes, outfits, supplies,</p><p>and everything for them on the shore and </p><p>told them to strip and leave the old camp </p><p>naked. They walked out bare as babes </p><p>new-born and took the fresh stuff, and then </p><p>I sent them back on their trap lines.” </p><p>“That’s good—you did right, Galt,” </p><p>commended Carlisle. “We want no infec- </p><p>tion here. And there are no others?” </p><p>“No.” </p><p> “Then we’ll close up and have a night’s</p><p>sleep.” </p><p> “Ba gar, yes,” yawned Drummond.</p><p>“I’m dozin’ in ma stride, me—snorin’ ovaire </p><p>de beaver packs everyw’ere. Bon soir, </p><p>messieurs.” </p><p> He lurched off, staggering for sleep, and</p><p>the others rose and followed. </p><p> “I’m glad you finished up before Sunday,</p><p>Paul,” observed Andrews, as they passed </p><p>up-stairs in the Factor’s house. </p><p> “Oh, yes,.Father! As you know, most of</p><p>the Factors go on just the same with their </p><p>trading or routing of the brigades, but I be- </p><p>lieve in resting as far as possible one day </p><p>in seven. See you in the morning, Andrews, </p><p>and hope I’ll be up in time for your service!” </p><p>SUNDAY morning broke in a white </p><p>lake fog, dank and woolly, but when</p><p>Carlisle stepped out of his house he </p><p>saw the sun sluicing away the fog with a </p><p>flood of gold. He beheld the ordered march </p><p>of the rollers, white wave-crest behind white </p><p>wave-crest as far as the eye could reach, </p><p>running beneath the fog drift, and the tops </p><p>of the pine-clad islands lifting starkly above. </p><p> Andrews was already on the shore, taking</p><p>his stand upon a huge rock that rose up like </p><p>a giant altar, and whites and Indians from </p><p>all three posts were blackening the beach, </p><p>the bronzed, roughly-clothed woodsmen, </p><p>the smoky savages, the squaws decked in all </p><p>their finery with new velvet moss-bags for </p><p>their wailing papooses. </p><p> On this day of truce in their trade war the</p><p>36 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>rival companies met on a common ground </p><p>of worship, some out of genuine desire, </p><p>others out of curiosity, more out of sheer </p><p>idleness. </p><p> Richelieu himself arrived with his black</p><p>beard newly trimmed and his resplendent </p><p>uniform cleaned and polished. Despite the </p><p>peaceful appearance of things he had a </p><p>bodyguard along, and he chose his place on </p><p>the other side of the throng from Carlisle, </p><p>giving him, with exaggerated courtesy, his </p><p>ramrod bow from the hips while the sar- </p><p>donic laugh of the devil lurked in his black </p><p>beard. </p><p> For Wayne or Joan Carlisle looked in</p><p>vain, and a disconcerting qualm disturbed </p><p>him inwardly. All the busy week he had </p><p>had no glimpse of her, and today he had </p><p>hoped—but yonder! Was the flash of a </p><p>woman’s dress flitting over from Fort </p><p>Wayne? He stared, and his heart leaped. </p><p>It was Joan and she was coming alone. </p><p>Gone were her trail garments, the gray </p><p>wool canoe skirt and the mosquito veil. </p><p> She walked bareheaded, a jewel at her</p><p>throat, clad in a clinging silk dress of cham- </p><p>pagne color with new, snow-white doeskin </p><p>half moccasins peeping from underneath. </p><p>A moment he drank in the vision of her, all </p><p>unflawed fairness in the full blaze of the sun, </p><p>all rose and golden as Wayne had said of her </p><p>mother, before she sat down upon a boulder </p><p>on the outskirts of the crowd. </p><p> With prayer and oration in Cree the brief</p><p>service went on, Andrews towering in his </p><p>black cassock upon the rock altar above his </p><p>motley congregation, his strong voice sound- </p><p>ing sonorously from the water-line to the </p><p>rim of the large gathering. To the cadences </p><p>of the waves breaking upon the beach and </p><p>the breezes playing through the pines they </p><p>sang their hymns, chanting in many lan- </p><p>guages, crying to their divers gods. </p><p> Then with a benediction Andrews dis-</p><p>missed them, and the adherents of each post </p><p>began to gravitate slowly toward their own </p><p>precincts. </p><p> Carlisle, watching, saw that Joan did not</p><p>go back directly. As if loath to leave the</p><p>fresh sweetness of the morning, she slipped </p><p>from the crowd and loitered up one of the </p><p>forest aisles between Cumberland House </p><p>and Fort Wayne. For a moment he hesi- </p><p>tated, made as if to follow Andrews inside </p><p>the stockade and then turned off up the </p><p>ferny avenue Joan had taken. </p><p> A little farther on he caught sight of her</p><p>wandering amid the jumble of rock ridges </p><p>and grassy hills that fringed the woodland. </p><p>All the hollows were splashed with the hue </p><p>of berries, red raspberries, golden goose- </p><p>berries, blueberries, the profligate wild black </p><p>currants. All the hills were ablaze with </p><p>flowers, waves of bluebells, tangles of wild </p><p>pink roses, patches of vivid lilies, a largess of </p><p>yellow daisies running riot everywhere. </p><p> Joan was idling along, bending here and</p><p>there with the supple ease of the wilderness </p><p>trained, gathering what pleased her fancy, </p><p>but at the sound of Carlisle’s feet in the </p><p>briers she whirled swiftly, poised at her </p><p>full height in the fashion she had inherited </p><p>from her father. </p><p> In a flash Carlisle sensed the change in</p><p>her! She was the same yet not the same </p><p>woman as before her father’s revelation the </p><p>night of their arrival on Sturgeon Lake. </p><p> That revelation seemed to have thrown</p><p>her back on herself, stamped her more def- </p><p>initely as a Wayne. In the very accentu- </p><p>ation of her father’s mannerism Carlisle read </p><p>a strengthening of her loyalty to that father, </p><p>and deep loyalty to Wayne could mean </p><p>nothing but deep antagonism to him. </p><p> With something of the same feeling he had</p><p>experienced when he feared she was going </p><p>to be absent from the congregation of the </p><p>Pine Island Lake shore, he stopped before </p><p>her without a greeting, searching her face </p><p>with his eyes. </p><p> “Paul, Paul,” she cried peremptorily,</p><p>first to break silence, “who ' gave you </p><p>leave to follow me here?” </p><p> “Nobody, but I took it,” he answered</p><p>boldly. “I took it, as men must always </p><p>take the things they want in this Northland.” </p><p>“But you had no right!” </p><p> “Ah, but I have the right! A wood</p><p>nymph came to me one night on the Winni- </p><p>peg River and gave me that right. Do you </p><p>remember?” </p><p> “No, I don’t remember.”</p><p> “Joan, you mean you don’t choose to</p><p>remember.” </p><p> “Well, then—I don’t choose to remember!”</p><p> FACE to face with him she stood,</p><p>defiant, imperious, her arms full of </p><p>the gathered wild flowers but sham- </p><p>ing the flowers in all their fairness, far </p><p>sweeter to Carlisle than the honeyed blos- </p><p>soms, far more haunting than the languor- </p><p>ous perfume they breathed. </p><p> “But you must, Joan!” he cried almost</p><p>Ambush </p><p>37 </p><p>fiercely. “You don’t hate me. In spite </p><p>of all, you don’t hate me.” </p><p> “There you’re wrong,” she flashed. “I</p><p>do hate you. I hate you with my father’s </p><p>hatred of your father, with his eternal loath- </p><p>ing of a Carlisle.” </p><p> He leaned over till his eyes were close to</p><p>hers, till he could catch every flicker of </p><p>expression, every shade of emotion. </p><p> “With his hatred,” he admitted trium-</p><p>phantly, “but not -with your own! Great </p><p>heavens, Joan, I showed my feeling in the </p><p>Rapide des Boisfranc, and you showed me </p><p>yours in the teepee in the forest when you </p><p>thought I was asleep. No — no—don’t </p><p>say you didn’t. You can’t deceive me. I </p><p>won’t take a thousand denials. You’re </p><p>acting—acting a lie for your father’s sake. </p><p>By the God of the Northmen, girl, you care!” </p><p>“No! no! no, I don’t!” </p><p> He laid his palms on the arms that hugged</p><p>the bunch of tangled flowers. </p><p> “You care!” he repeated chokingly.</p><p>. “No, Paul, I-” </p><p> The rest was lost in the swift sliding of his</p><p>palms to her shoulders and the swifter </p><p>crushing of herself against his great frame. </p><p> “Stop, Paul, stop!” she implored, her face</p><p>like a wild flower all sprayed with crimson </p><p>among the crushed roses. “The blood of </p><p>my mother stands between. And my </p><p>father forbade me even to meet you on the </p><p>trail. Let me go. If any of his men </p><p>should come by and see!” </p><p>jMfrey’d see the truth, for you’re living a </p><p>liephe passionately persisted. “Tell me </p><p>it’s a lie!” </p><p> His caress was the elemental, soul-shaking</p><p>caress that had swayed her in the caldron </p><p>of the rapids, and with a little cry, Joan </p><p>involuntarily tightened one arm upon his </p><p>shoulders. </p><p> “Yes, I lie—I do,” she panted. “And I</p><p>shall go on lying—for my father’s sake, for </p><p>my dead mother’s sake. I shall hate you</p><p>day by day. Let me go! Here, take the </p><p>flowers, the bluebells for my eyes, the daisies </p><p>for my hair, as my father says. </p><p> “They’re all you’ll ever have of me.</p><p>Take them. And, oh, Paul, no matter how </p><p>I hate you, how I hurt you, remember </p><p>that I lie! There! There! My God, what </p><p>have I said—and done?” </p><p> She had forced the crushed flowers into</p><p>his arms and, writhing free, darted through </p><p>the saskatoon bushes into the fringe of trees </p><p>that straggled ’round to Fort Wayne. </p><p> A radiant fight on his features, Carlisle</p><p>looked down at the crushed, tangled armful </p><p>of flowers she had left him. His vision was </p><p>blurred, and he seemed to-see them as her </p><p>palpitant self, her longings crushed like the </p><p>bruised petals upon her vow of parental </p><p>devotion. He held the blooms tight as he </p><p>moved away along the grassy hills, through </p><p>the hollows and over the brake of fern to </p><p>Cumberland House, and continually his </p><p>eyes strayed to his fragrant burden. </p><p> Lounging in the gateway of the stockade</p><p>Galt and Drummond saw him coming and </p><p>stared their surprise. </p><p> “Ba gar, w’at’s dat he be got, Henry?”</p><p>demanded the brigade leader. </p><p> “Flowers of the hills,” replied the keen-</p><p>eyed half-breed. </p><p> “Certainemenl, dat’s right! Ha! Factor,</p><p>you be peeck de bouquet for de post dis </p><p>momin’, eh?” </p><p> Carlisle looked up, startled.</p><p> “Oh— ah— yes, Eugene!” he returned.</p><p>“The hills are covered with them. Did you </p><p>ever see such shades? But they wilt quickly. </p><p>And say, now that I think of it, is Cotameg </p><p>about?” </p><p> “De Chippewa canoeman? I’m t’ink he</p><p>be gone on de lac. Oui, I’m remembaire </p><p>heem say he be goin’ after w’itefish.” </p><p> “Well, when he comes in, send him to me.</p><p>I have a journey for him this afternoon.” </p><p>“Oui,” assured Drummond, “soon’s I be </p><p>set eyes on hees canoe!” </p><p> The Factor passed on through the gate</p><p>and up to his house, and the moment his </p><p>back disappeared Eugene grasped the half- </p><p>breed chief trader by the arm. </p><p> “You be see it, Galt?” he chuckled.</p><p> “No,” confessed Galt whose sight had</p><p>failed him for once, “see what?” </p><p> “He peeck dem, eh?” Eugene laughed</p><p>enigmatically. “For sure he peeck dem. An’ </p><p>you ain’t see it? Ba gar, wound ’round de </p><p>stems—forgotten? Wan dainty handkerchief, </p><p>silk, all ovaire dat stinky smell—w’at you call </p><p>it?—oui, perfume! Diable, Galt, an’ dat’s </p><p>strange flowaire for grow on de wild rose </p><p>bush!” </p><p>CHAPTER VIII </p><p>THE PRICE OF A KISS </p><p>A T THE moment Eugene Drummond </p><p>was speaking of Cotameg as having </p><p>gone on the lake, the Chippewa’s canoe was </p><p>turning into Carcajou Cove up the Pine </p><p>38 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Island Lake shore not a great distance </p><p>from Richelieu’s post. As Cotameg softly </p><p>beached his craft over the rough shingle, the </p><p>Northwest leader stepped out of the tree </p><p>with a companion, a slim, smooth-cheeked </p><p>Frenchman with a pointed mustache and a </p><p>large hawk nose. </p><p> “He is here, Dentaire,” observed Riche-</p><p>lieu with satisfaction. “Par Dieu, never </p><p>failing, never late—a spy of spies! Com- </p><p>ment?” </p><p> “Yes, but what are you thinking of?”</p><p>asked Dentaire. </p><p> “Wait and see what I am thinking of,</p><p>Dentaire,” laughed Richelieu. “Ha! Cota- </p><p>meg, what fable did you give this morning?” </p><p>“I am seeking whitefish,” replied Cota- </p><p>meg without the trace of a grin, “and it will </p><p>not do for me to be too long away. Also, </p><p>I must not go back without some fish.” </p><p>“All right, Cotameg, go on through the </p><p>woods to the post. Robouix will give you </p><p>money for your work, also rum since it is a </p><p>slack day and nothing to do.” </p><p> With alacrity the Chippewa spy sped off</p><p>through the trees, and the instant he was </p><p>gone Richelieu seized upon the limp dun- </p><p>nage sack in the canoe, the sack which con- </p><p>tained his meager gear. </p><p> “Now, Dentaire, you will see what use I</p><p>make of this trbs vite,” he announced. </p><p> He shook the contents of the dunnage</p><p>sack out into the underbrush and with the </p><p>empty bag over his arm led the way a little </p><p>distance ’round the curve of the cove and </p><p>through the woods. Three hundred yards </p><p>in, the deserted camp of White Loon, the </p><p>smallpox-ridden Indian, and his relatives </p><p>opened out before them, and Dentaire sud- </p><p>denly realized where he was being led. </p><p> “Bon Dieu!” he ejaculated and crossed</p><p>himself in the trail. </p><p> “Diablement, Dentaire,” ridiculed Riche-</p><p>lieu, “are you afraid of an old teepee?” </p><p> “Bon Dieu!” repeated Dentaire, shiver-</p><p>ing, “teepees which chill one’s heart!”</p><p>“Bah!” shrugged Richelieu. “They </p><p>don’t chill my heart.” </p><p> He walked fearlessly through the ashes</p><p>of the camp-fire, kicking aside discarded </p><p>cooking utensils and other paraphernalia, </p><p>and peered into the opening of the torn </p><p>skins that covered the teepee poles. </p><p> His examination seemed to satisfy him,</p><p>for, hanging the sack open-mouthed upon </p><p>one of the poles, he picked up a long stick </p><p>and began to fork into it things from the </p><p>dark interior, worn moccasins, soiled trou- </p><p>sers of buckskin, the dirty parfltches or bed- </p><p>rolls, while Dentaire, staring at him with </p><p>horrified eyes, trembled and crossed himself </p><p>and called incessantly on Providence. </p><p> “Mort Rouge, the Red Death, the Indians</p><p>call it,” grinned Richelieu as he pulled the </p><p>bag down by the drawstrings in its mouth, </p><p>jerked the strings tight and started to drag </p><p>it behind him. “But never fear, Dentaire. </p><p>This is not for you, though Providence </p><p>would no doubt defend you from the plague </p><p>with all that beseeching. It is for the men </p><p>of the Hudson’s Bay.” </p><p> “And, bon Dieu, does Cotameg know?”</p><p>quavered Dentaire, taking frantic care to </p><p>keep ahead all the way back to the cove. </p><p> “No, you fool! Cotameg knows nothing</p><p>about it. If he did he would be like you. </p><p>del, he would run or drop the bag in the </p><p>lake. Since he knows nothing he will go </p><p>back and throw the bag down as usual in </p><p>Cumberland House—like I do now!” </p><p>With a tug and swing on the drawstrings </p><p>Richelieu tossed the dunnage sack care- </p><p>lessly into the canoe bow. </p><p> “With never a touch of my hands!” he</p><p>boasted. “But calm yourself, Dentaire, </p><p>and quit your crossing. I think I hear Cot- </p><p>ameg coming back. See that you give no </p><p>suspicion to him.” </p><p> Shortly the Chippewa appeared, walking</p><p>more noisily, with less of his stony stoicism </p><p>what of the rum with which Robouix un- </p><p>der Richelieu’s instructions had plied him. </p><p>He had half a dozen whitefish in his hands, </p><p>and, grinning, he held them out. </p><p> “Robouix’s men caught many today,” he</p><p>explained. “And I have wasted time. These </p><p>will save me time.” </p><p> “Yes,” Richelieu nodded, “take them</p><p>quickly. They will not starve today at </p><p>Cumberland House. And when the Factor </p><p>sends for his supplies, do not fail to give me </p><p>word or sign.” </p><p> Cotameg threw the whitefish into the</p><p>stern of his canoe, paddled out of Carcajou </p><p>Cove and swung back to Cumberland </p><p>House. He had been absent the greater </p><p>part of the morning. Several times Car- </p><p>lisle had asked Drummond if he had re- </p><p>turned, and now as his craft came in sight, </p><p>the brigade leader went up to the Factor’s </p><p>house. </p><p>“De Chippewa be cornin’,” he informed. </p><p>“All right, Eugene. Bring me Smoking </p><p>Pine to the beach. I am sending the two of </p><p>Ambush </p><p>39 </p><p>them to the Pas for food stuffs. I don’t </p><p>like the post to be too long on a straight </p><p>meat diet. It breeds disease.” </p><p>WHEN Eugene found Smoking </p><p>Pine, Carlisle followed them down </p><p>to the shorej where the Chippewa </p><p>was edging in his canoe. </p><p> “You needn’t trouble to land, Cotameg,”</p><p>the Factor told him. “Your being away </p><p>has made your start late. Step in, Smoking </p><p>Pine. No—keep the fish. They’ll make </p><p>your first meal, for you’ll have to feed your- </p><p>selves on the way. Go to the Pas. Tell </p><p>Lewis to send on the York boats from his </p><p>post. If the boats aren’t there, wait for </p><p>them, and see that there is no delay on the </p><p>river.” </p><p> Though the rum was in his veins, Cota-</p><p>meg had wisdom enough to show no con- </p><p>cern. He grunted comprehendingly and </p><p>dipped his paddle in time with Smoking </p><p>Pine’s as the canoe glided off, but a mile or </p><p>two upon his way he stopped for the noon </p><p>meal just near one of the secret rendezvous </p><p>that he and Richelieu had picked upon to </p><p>obviate the risk of his visiting the North- </p><p>west post too often. </p><p> There they roasted some of the fish on</p><p>sticks, and there Cotameg lagged behind </p><p>Smoking Pine a moment before he stalked </p><p>down to the canoe to reembark. </p><p> With his knife he blazed a white space</p><p>upon a tree trunk in the secret rendezvous </p><p>and with a piece of charcoal from the fire </p><p>smudged on it the sign for Richelieu—a </p><p>crude drawing of a full flour sack labeled </p><p>H. B. C. </p><p> Nor was the departure of Cotameg and</p><p>Smoking Pine the only departure from </p><p>Cumberland House that day. After the </p><p>mid-day meal, seemingly without fore- </p><p>thought, without any definite plan, the In- </p><p>dian hunters took down the medicine bags </p><p>from the rear of their teepees and the </p><p>squaws struck the tents. </p><p> The tribes ’round Richelieu’s post and</p><p>Fort Wayne perceived the exodus and fol- </p><p>lowed suit. The littered camp-grounds be-</p><p>came a chaos andabedlam of bucks, squaws, </p><p>children and dogs, but finally the ruck was </p><p>straightened out, the baggage bundled and </p><p>apportioned, the papooses and curs sorted, </p><p>and the pilgrimage began. </p><p> Their destinations were many, the up-</p><p>Saskatchewan country, the down-Saskatch- </p><p>ewan, the Sturgeon River, the Carrot River, </p><p>the eastern and western arms of Sturgeon </p><p>Lake, Lakes Namew, Amisk, Goose, Atha- </p><p>puscow! </p><p> Some went afoot on the forest trails, their</p><p>worldly goods piled upon their shoulders and </p><p>their dogs back-packed with forty pounds </p><p>apiece. Others traveled by canoe, the glis- </p><p>tening yellow craft loaded to the gunwales </p><p>with heterogeneous dunnage and the dogs </p><p>thrust under the thwarts. </p><p> The serried hosts of the forest trees swal-</p><p>lowed the files of marchers more quickly </p><p>than the sweeping phalanxes of the crested </p><p>waves could hide the fleets. From the door- </p><p>way of his house Carlisle watched the fa- </p><p>miliar sight. They were going back, these </p><p>children of the wilderness, to their wilder- </p><p>ness crafts, to their fish channels, caribou </p><p>runs and trap lines. </p><p> They would travel from fifty to one hun-</p><p>dred miles from Cumberland House, plant- </p><p>ing their marten deadfalls, their double- </p><p>spring fox traps, their twitch-up snares for </p><p>rabbits through a waste of frost and snow </p><p>and he would see none of them again till </p><p>Christmas. </p><p> With a strange sense of loneliness he held</p><p>them to the last with his keen eyes, till the </p><p>straight backs of the hunters, the bright </p><p>shawls of the squaws, the warm yellow of the </p><p>birch canoes faded beyond the heaving silver </p><p>rollers. </p><p> A fortnight passed after their departure,</p><p>and there was no sign of the York boats at </p><p>Cumberland House. The month of Sep- </p><p>tember came in, and still Carlisle felt no un- </p><p>easiness. For Cotameg and Smoking Pine </p><p>had to go down ’round the Great Bend of </p><p>the Saskatchewan, beyond the mouth of the </p><p>Carrot to the Pasquia River where the post </p><p>of the Pas lay in the crotch the Pasquia </p><p>formed with the Saskatchewan. </p><p> Perhaps the supplies had not reached</p><p>Lewis when they got there! Perhaps on </p><p>account of pack icc or shifting shoals in </p><p>James Bay the company’s ship had not been </p><p>able to get in on schedule, and there might </p><p>have been delay in sending the York boats </p><p>up from York Factory. </p><p> So the Factor waited philosophically, liv-</p><p>ing like the rest of the men of the post, and </p><p>the rival posts as well, upon a straight meat </p><p>diet varied a little by berries from the hills. </p><p>Daily they plied the rifle and the net, </p><p>bringing in the first fall ducks, ptarmigan </p><p>whose brown Summer feathering was whit- </p><p>ening for Winter, finny prizes from the cool </p><p>40 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>deep waters, whitefish, inconnu, silvery </p><p>trout as big as salmon, sometimes a weighty </p><p>sturgeon. </p><p> Surplus fish, especially the whitefish, were</p><p>dried for Winter dog feed, and when the </p><p>nets yielded nothing the canoes went out at </p><p>night with spearmen in the bows, bronze </p><p>statues posing under the red flares in the iron </p><p>baskets above them, darting their steel into </p><p>the pitchy, flame-carmined water where the </p><p>startled fish fluked in phosphorescent streaks. </p><p> Bird life, too, was flocking for the Fall</p><p>migration. Plover, snipe, terns, long-billed </p><p>marsh wrens, yellow-headed blackbirds, </p><p>red-winged blackbirds, Sora rails filled the </p><p>reedy labyrinths. Wood duck, ruddy duck, </p><p>grebes, loons, coots, mallards, black duck </p><p>covered the weedy channels, while day by </p><p>day the rafts of gadwall, pintail, teal, </p><p>scaups, scoters, redheads, canvasbacks grew </p><p>greater and greater. </p><p> Then down drove the wedges of - wild</p><p>geese, true harbingers of coming Winter, </p><p>the Canadas from Hudson’s Bay, the wavies </p><p>from unknown islands of the Arctic. Every </p><p>day from sunrise to sunset the guns of the </p><p>Indian goose hunters talked on the lonely </p><p>shores, and by the hundreds they brought </p><p>them in, to be eaten fresh or salted down in </p><p>barrels, for Winter use. </p><p> But white men quickly sicken of flesh</p><p>alone and white women more quickly than </p><p>men, and often Carlisle wondered how Joan </p><p>was faring on the savage diet. He had not </p><p>seen her since the Sunday morning she had </p><p>fled from him. Her flowers were withered </p><p>and dead, but he looked in vain for another </p><p>meeting. All the week days there was </p><p>practically no communication between the </p><p>posts and on Sundays she never came any </p><p>more to Andrews’ mixed services on the </p><p>lake shore. </p><p> He wondered if she were ill, and censured</p><p>himself for pressing the trade war so bit- </p><p>terly. Would Wayne perhaps save some </p><p>staple provisions for such an emergency? </p><p>But on second thought he knew Wayne was </p><p>not the man to hedge in a fight. She would </p><p>be living on the post diet, and he feared it </p><p>did not agree.</p><p> The idea harassed him continually, set</p><p>him searching at nights for overlooked food </p><p>among the shelves of his quarters till one </p><p>night he came across his gear bag, thrown </p><p>aside and forgotten since he had established </p><p>himself at the post. </p><p> In its bottom his groping fingers felt a</p><p>bundle which he did not recognize at first </p><p>but as he unrolled the oilcloth in which </p><p>it was wrapped he suddenly remembered </p><p>about it. It was a small reserve of pro- </p><p>visions, stowed away there when he left </p><p>Moose Factory in case of accident or emer- </p><p>gency on the trip to Cumberland House. </p><p> Eagerly he spread out its contents and</p><p>eyed the articles with satisfaction—a tiny </p><p>bag of flour, the same of meal, a tin of </p><p>salted butter, a package of raisins, a little </p><p>powdered chocolate. Delicacies for any- </p><p>one in the North, a boon to Joan whether </p><p>she was sick or not! And who was to see </p><p>him if he tossed them by night over the pal- </p><p>isades of Fort Wayne? </p><p>HASTILY he wrapped them up </p><p>again in strong paper, wrote Joan’s </p><p>name on the wrapper, slipped out of </p><p>his house and through the stockade gate. </p><p> The moment he left the stockade he</p><p>caught it—the first tang of real Autumn, </p><p>that indefinable feel in the air, something of </p><p>coolness, something of dampness, a savor of </p><p>falling leaves, white frost fogs, mournful </p><p>winds and a world left desolate by fleeting </p><p>migrant wings. The moon was nearly full, </p><p>ghost-like, gibbous, pouring its radiance </p><p>over the blackly silhouetted tree-tops upon </p><p>Pine Island Lake beneath. </p><p> A flux of molten silver Carlisle beheld the</p><p>waters, broken only by the swimming musk- </p><p>rats at the apices of their V-shaped ripples </p><p>along the shores and by the huge rafts of </p><p>ducks, huddled black as islands, quacking </p><p>sleepily in mid-lake. Shore and open for- </p><p>est aisles were bright as day, so the Factor </p><p>edged into the trees and kept the shadows </p><p>as he worked ’round to Fort Wayne. </p><p> Velvet-footed on his moccasins he ap-</p><p>proached the palisades, maintaining a sharp </p><p>watch for riflemen who might fire first and </p><p>challenge afterward, measuring his distance</p><p>till he thought he was near enough to throw. </p><p>As he swung back his arm, the creak of the </p><p>opening stockade gate froze him in his tracks, </p><p>and the next instant a woman’s figure came </p><p>flying ’round the palisades on the trail that </p><p>led to the water’s edge, almost colliding with </p><p>him before she could come to a stop. </p><p> “Joan!”</p><p> “Paul!”</p><p> “Where on earth were you going, girl, at</p><p>this time of night?” </p><p> “Hush, Paul!” she whispered. “Mur-</p><p>dock, the gate-keeper or some of the others </p><p>Ambush </p><p>41 </p><p>may hear you. What on earth are you </p><p>doing yourself, here, under our palisades?” </p><p>“TeU me where you were going, first,” he </p><p>insisted. </p><p> “I was going to the lake. I—I have not</p><p>been feeling too well lately!” </p><p> “Ha, I knew it! It’s the meat diet. I</p><p>found some other food in my packs and was </p><p>going to toss it over for you. Here it is.” </p><p>He thrust the package into her hands, his </p><p>eyes full of tender solicitude as they studied </p><p>her face in the moonlight, a face not so full </p><p>of its laughing curves, not so rose-fresh in </p><p>color as it should be. </p><p> “You’ve been sick, sicker than you’ve</p><p>admitted,” he diagnosed. </p><p> “I’ve been worrying—that’s the main</p><p>trouble,” she told him. “I’m all upset. </p><p>It’s about my father, Paul, his supplies. </p><p>He got word back from the independent </p><p>posts, and none of them can spare anything. </p><p>They’ve had their trade wars too.” </p><p> “Of course!” Carlisle exclaimed. “You</p><p>didn’t suppose mine was an isolated attempt </p><p>did you? The Hudson’s Bay Company’s </p><p>making a timed and concerted effort all over </p><p>the West to smash competition with one </p><p>stroke, and the key point of the whole cam- </p><p>paign lies right here. That’s why it pinches </p><p>hardest. If I fail, everything fails. </p><p> “By heaven, Joan, do you think I carry my</p><p>responsibility lightly? Do you think it’s easy </p><p>for me to starve you, to make you suffer? But, </p><p>girl, you won’t force me to that cruelty, will </p><p>you? Tell me, if things come to the worst, </p><p>that you’ll persuade your father to give in.” </p><p>“Never, Paul, never!” she refused pas- </p><p>sionately. “Before you break his inde- </p><p>pendence, you’ll have to break him—and me!” </p><p>“Ha, you mad girl! Then if you will face </p><p>hunger, you’ll have to let me send you stuff </p><p>like that in your hands.” </p><p> “Perhaps, Paul—that is, if you have it to</p><p>send,” she smiled enigmatically. </p><p> “WTiat does that mean? Is it a riddle?</p><p>Do you promise?” </p><p> “I’ll give you my promise if you give me</p><p>yours.” </p><p> “But there’s no necessity for me to</p><p>promise. Are you laughing at me, warning </p><p>me, or-” </p><p> He stopped in mid-sentence, twisting his</p><p>head swiftly at the roar of a wild commo- </p><p>tion at Cumberland House. He caught the </p><p>thud of moccasined feet running and the </p><p>shrill tenor voice of Eugene Drummond </p><p>pitched on the night: </p><p> “Factor, Factor!” he was yelling. “Mon</p><p>Dieu, w’ere you be disappear an’ gone den? </p><p>De York boats be on de shore an’ dere’s </p><p>diable trouble makin’. Fur men fightin’ de </p><p>crews an’ Smoking Pine be run for help! </p><p>Factor—Factor!” </p><p>“Here, Eugene!” roared Carlisle, forgetful </p><p>of Murdock or anybody else. “I’m coming!” </p><p>As he whirled about he found Joan block- </p><p>ing the trail, the moonlight glinting on a </p><p>pistol in her hand. </p><p> “Stay right where you are, Paul,” she</p><p>commanded. </p><p> “Joan—your father’s men!” Carlisle ex-</p><p>claimed intuitively. </p><p> He leaped suddenly, making a swift pass</p><p>with his hand to grasp her arm, but, agile as </p><p>a fawn, she sprang back and evaded him. </p><p> “Paul, I’ll shoot,” she threatened. “As</p><p>sure as I hold it, I’ll shoot!” </p><p> The pistol muzzle covered him fairly,</p><p>daunting, deadly. For a minute or so </p><p>Carlisle hesitated, searching her eyes for </p><p>any sign of uncertainty, of yielding, but he </p><p>read only determination there. A will that </p><p>matched his own she showed, and its an- </p><p>tagonism fired him with a sterner resolve. </p><p>With a lightning movement he launched </p><p>himself bodily upon her, pistol and all. He </p><p>had her grasped by the shoulders, but the </p><p>weapon touched his breast. </p><p> “Paul,” she cried breathlessly, “don’t</p><p>make me-” </p><p> Then in the crucial moment her will</p><p>failed. With a little cry of despair she </p><p>thrust the weapon back into her pocket </p><p>and swept her arms about his neck. </p><p> “I couldn’t,” she burst out. “I couldn’t.”</p><p>Carlisle’s strong frame trembled from </p><p>head to foot. For mad moments he knew </p><p>nothing there in the trail, saw nothing but </p><p>the spun-gold hair, the amethyst eyes and </p><p>the passionate face touched to his under the </p><p>moonlight—till through the cloying sweet- </p><p>ness of his oblivion rang the raucous clamor </p><p>of men fighting on the shore. Her arms </p><p>still clinging, he tore himself free and </p><p>dashed back toward Cumberland House. </p><p>AS HE reached the stockade gate out </p><p>shot Eugene Drummond, his raven </p><p>hair disheveled and streaming, his </p><p>volatile face ridged in consternation and his </p><p>black eyes glinting fire in his excitement. </p><p> “Name of le diable!” he shouted. “I’m</p><p>be hunt you everyw’ere, Factor. Smokin’ </p><p>Pine-” </p><p>42 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “I know,” blurted Carlisle guiltily. “I</p><p>heard you. Come on. Have you routed </p><p>out the men?” </p><p> “Mon Dieu, oui!” exploded Eugene,</p><p>catching him by the arm. “Some in deir </p><p>shirts half-naked, some snorin’ in peeg sleep. </p><p>An dose York boats’ crews fightin’ off t’ree </p><p>taims deir number!” </p><p> The rest of his frenzied declamation was</p><p>lost upon Carlisle, who, tearing his arm free </p><p>and distancing Eugene, was bounding down </p><p>to the lake edge in great, long strides. Al- </p><p>ready he could see the York boats, three in </p><p>number, sweeping-lined, long-prowed, eight- </p><p>oared crafts, so huge as to be capable of </p><p>holding one hundred bags of flour. </p><p> They lay black as logs along the shore,</p><p>and over them, poised on the gunwales, run- </p><p>ning along the seats, trampling the cargoes, </p><p>raged and surged a mob of fighting men. </p><p>Even at that distance the Factor recognized </p><p>the attackers as Free-Traders, Wayne’s men </p><p>of the Missouri, men of the Mississippi, men </p><p>of the Red, all mingled with his Cree and </p><p>Chippewayan Indians. </p><p> He saw the brown-bearded, long-jawed</p><p>Mason, war-whooping his way through his </p><p>opponents, and in the center of the melee he </p><p>caught a glimpse of Wayne, towering to his </p><p>great height, his copper-colored mustache </p><p>flashing golden in the moonlight as he </p><p>wrenched and struck. </p><p> The York boats’ crews fought back with</p><p>the oars and the long poles they had used </p><p>for poling up the rapids, but Wayne’s force </p><p>was too large for their meager numbers. </p><p>Before Carlisle could reach the waterline </p><p>the Free-Traders had swarmed over the </p><p>York boats from stern to prow, pulled, </p><p>dragged, knocked the crews overside into </p><p>the shallow water and seized the oars. </p><p> Then under the Factor’s astounded eyes</p><p>another force struck the victors like a </p><p>thunderbolt. All in a second the shore </p><p>thickets gushed men, the very rocks of the </p><p>earth seemed to spew them. One moment </p><p>they were not, the next moment they were, </p><p>as if borne up on the oscillations of an earth- </p><p>quake or the breath of a tornado, North-</p><p>westers all, outnumbering Wayne’s force as </p><p>Wayne’s had outnumbered the York boats’ </p><p>crews. </p><p> In hiding from the first, their rush, timed</p><p>to the fraction of a second, caught the Free- </p><p>Traders in the moment of disadvantage, just </p><p>in the act of replacing the oars in the locks. </p><p>Carlisle could see that the Northwesters had </p><p>a stout cable in their hands, stretched taut </p><p>as a rod, a score of men on either end. With </p><p>a surge and splash they hurled themselves </p><p>through the shallows, and like a giant scythe </p><p>the taut cable cleared the York boats at one </p><p>stroke, sweeping the Free-Traders overside </p><p>like manikins from their perch. </p><p> In a flash the cable was lashed onto the</p><p>leading boat, the other boats lashed onto the </p><p>first, and already the flotilla was being </p><p>towed rapidly toward Richelieu’s post. As </p><p>well as being equipped with a land-gate, the </p><p>Northwest fort boasted a water-gate, part </p><p>of the stockade extending out over the </p><p>water, enclosing a little harbor entered </p><p>through a heavy log barrier that was raised </p><p>by ropes on capstan-like drums inside. </p><p> Carlisle saw that the water-gate stood</p><p>open and that it was Richelieu’s plan to </p><p>slide the York boats, cargoes and all, inside </p><p>his palisades. He marked the Northwest </p><p>leader at the head of the trackers, pulling, </p><p>exhorting, cursing the clumsy. </p><p> “Name of a name, is it a hearse, then?</p><p>And par Dieu, do not fall over your own </p><p>feet. Quick! Quick! Straight ahead, and </p><p>the sooner the better!” </p><p> With an imprecation Carlisle took a run-</p><p>ning leap from the shore, Drummond, Galt, </p><p>Smoking Pine and the straggle of Cumber- </p><p>land House men launching after, backed up </p><p>by the dripping York boats’ crews. He </p><p>landed with a geyser-like splash among the </p><p>knot of trackers, grappling with the cursing </p><p>Richelieu, his feet slipping upon the shelving </p><p>rock. Together they went down in the </p><p>shallows, rolling and wrenching. Half a </p><p>dozen men fell on top of them. The boats, </p><p>never stopping in their career, bumped them </p><p>aside, and in the scramble Carlisle’s grip was </p><p>torn from Richelieu. </p><p> He found his footing again and staggered</p><p>up, but as he emerged from the water a fly-</p><p>ing oar blade caught him on the side of the </p><p>head, knocking him, half-stunned, across </p><p>the gunwale of one of the boats. In a daze </p><p>he felt himself dragged along, half in, half </p><p>out of the water. All about him surged </p><p>shouting, snarling tangles of men, black as </p><p>demons against the silver moonlight, his </p><p>own adherents striking and tearing at the </p><p>towers on the ropes, hacking at the lashing </p><p>themselves, while the Northwesters fended </p><p>them off. </p><p> Occasionally a rifle spat out, but at too</p><p>close quarters for indiscriminate shooting, in </p><p>a maze where they hardly discerne.1 friend </p><p>Ambush </p><p>43 </p><p>from enemy, the Hudson’s Bay men smote </p><p>with clubbed rifles, pieces of broken oars, </p><p>rocks, knives, axes. Yet despite the weight </p><p>of their attack the York boats were sliding </p><p>foot by foot toward Richelieu’s water-gate. </p><p> Within a few hundred feet of it Carlisle</p><p>pulled himself up once more with a resurge </p><p>of strength and cast himself into the fray. </p><p>Knocking men right and left, he seized the </p><p>last boat by the stem and with all the </p><p>mighty power of his body swung it sidewise </p><p>toward the shore. </p><p> “Eugene! Galt!” he importuned. “Any</p><p>of you there—hold the bows!” </p><p> His idea was to turn the flotilla broadside</p><p>on so that it could not enter the water-gate </p><p>and thus delay it till more reinforcements </p><p>could arrive from Cumberland House. </p><p>Without a doubt the maneuver would have </p><p>been successful had it not been for the length </p><p>of the Northwesters’ cable. </p><p> The loose end of it had been seized by</p><p>men in the water-gate and whipped ’round </p><p>one of the capstan-like drums inside. Oth- </p><p>ers threw themselves on the bars, and with </p><p>a wrench and run the flotilla was torn bodily </p><p>from the hands of Carlisle and his com- </p><p>panions and snaked through the water-gate. </p><p>THE heavy log barrier dropped </p><p>with a rumble and splash, and a </p><p>loud cheer burst from the victorious </p><p>Northwesters within. Still cheering, they </p><p>ran to the palisades, and the hail of their </p><p>bullets began to splat-splat in the shallows </p><p>uncomfortably close to Carlisle and the rest. </p><p> It was madness to crouch there in the</p><p>moonlight, black targets for guns behind log </p><p>walls. The Hudson’s Bay men paused only </p><p>long enough to hurriedly shoulder their </p><p>wounded and disabled and broke into a run </p><p>for Cumberland House. </p><p> As Carlisle lurched along in the rear he</p><p>could discern the baffled Free-Traders off </p><p>toward Fort Wayne, making for their own </p><p>stockade. By his great height he marked </p><p>Wayne among them and close beside Wayne </p><p>the shimmer of Joan’s dress. Well, he read </p><p>her riddle now. But her need was not yet</p><p>satisfied. Richelieu had won! </p><p> In the trading-room of Cumberland</p><p>House the panting Hudson’s Bay men let </p><p>down their burdens under the candlelight, </p><p>the lifeless Chippewa, Cotameg, shot fairly </p><p>through the head, two wounded white men of </p><p>the post with bullets through their thighs, </p><p>three men of the York boats’ crews </p><p>with splintered bones in their arms or legs. </p><p> Hardly a man was there but showed the</p><p>marks of the battle, cracked heads, smashed </p><p>knuckles, flesh wounds and bruises without </p><p>end, and as they felt each other over to make </p><p>sure there was no more serious hurt, Father </p><p>Andrews appeared in the doorway. </p><p> Roused from sleep by the commotion, his</p><p>cassock only half-belted on by its cord, he </p><p>came, and at his entrance Eugene Drum- </p><p>mond, wiping the blood from his swarthy </p><p>face, dropped his handkerchief with an </p><p>amazed exclamation. </p><p> “Ba gar,” he whispered hoarsely, “hees</p><p>face—hees face for sure!” </p><p> Andrews in his hurry had forgotten his</p><p>mosquito veil, and for the first time in </p><p>twenty-one years Drummond saw his fea- </p><p>tures. Yet he saw them only for an instant </p><p>and then only in the semi-obscurity of the </p><p>doorway. Eugene’s exclamation struck the </p><p>priest like a warning word. </p><p> His hand went up and drew close the cowl</p><p>of his cassock before he stepped from the </p><p>threshold into the fuller light of the candles. </p><p>Though the veil was not there, the shadow </p><p>of the cowl lay dark across his features. </p><p>Drummond could read them no longer. </p><p> “In the name of Heaven, what’s been</p><p>going on, Paul?” demanded Andrews. </p><p>“What have you done?” </p><p> “Done?” echoed Carlisle grimly.</p><p>“Brought you a corpse and some patients, </p><p>Father. You’ll have to bury Cotameg and </p><p>look after the others well while I’m away.” </p><p>“Away?” echoed the priest in his turn. </p><p>“What do you mean?” </p><p> He took a step after Carlisle as the latter,</p><p>unanswering, passed out through the trad- </p><p>ing-room doorway.</p><p> “Are you leaving Cumberland House,</p><p>then, Paul?” he asked. </p><p>“Yes,” Carlisle told him, “I’m going </p><p>down river for the rest of my York boats.” </p><p>“Oh! The ones from the Pas came on, </p><p>eh? That was the cause of the fighting?” </p><p>“Yes, they came, three of them, Andrews, </p><p>and—I sold them for a kiss!” </p><p>CHAPTER IX </p><p>MUTINY </p><p>T EWIS, his craggy face puckered in be- </p><p>' wilderment, stared long at the canoe </p><p>gliding in to his post of the Pas. It was the </p><p>Factor’s craft, all right. He could recog- </p><p>44 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>nize Waseyawin and Missowa, bowsman </p><p>and steersman, and the four middlemen as </p><p>well, and there was Carlisle himself amid- </p><p>ships with Eugene Drummond by his side. </p><p>Yet why were they here? It was not in ac- </p><p>cordance with the outlined plans or the </p><p>issued orders. Something had happened. </p><p>Something had gone wrong. Lewis tugged </p><p>at his gray beard and muttered a wonder- </p><p>ing monologue till the Factor was close </p><p>enough to hail him. </p><p> “Well, Lewis, how is it with everything</p><p>here at the Pas?” </p><p> “Nae mon wull bother me, ye ken, Fac-</p><p>tor,” replied Lewis. “I ha’ done well wi’ </p><p>the trade, an’ I maun no be complainin’. </p><p>An’ yersel’? Wha’ aboot Jihe York boats. </p><p>Had they ony trouble gettin’ up?” </p><p> “No, but lots of trouble when they got</p><p>there. Richelieu has them now, cargoes </p><p>and all, and I’m bound down for the </p><p>others.” </p><p> “The de’il! An’ ye are sayin’ so, Factor?</p><p>But wull ye no be stoppin’ a bit?” </p><p> “No—no time,” refused Carlisle, sheer-</p><p>ing off again. “I just wanted to let you </p><p>know. Keep a tight hand, Lewis. I’ll see </p><p>you again on the way back!” </p><p> On down the river the huge canoe</p><p>leaped, flinging its miles behind, winding </p><p>’round its interminable curves to Chimawa- </p><p>win lying where the Saskatchewan broad- </p><p>ened into Cedar Lake, but Hampton had </p><p>no boats there. </p><p> “Us hasn’t larned aught about them from</p><p>Jarvis, Factor,” was his report to Carlisle. </p><p>“Not likely they comed across the lake yet </p><p>or it’s a very mistaken judgment I has.” </p><p> So they were off again down Cedar Lake</p><p>through the Narrows, past the Demie </p><p>Charge Rapids, past the Roche Rouge </p><p>Rapids to the Grand Rapids post. Here the </p><p>Saskatchewan, watering a vast empire in </p><p>its long journey from the Rockies, poured </p><p>at last into Lake Winnipeg, and here Jarvis </p><p>had the same report as Hampton. Only </p><p>three York boats had crossed the lake, the</p><p>three that had gone on to the Pas. </p><p> Jarvis couldn’t tell the cause of the de-</p><p>lay. They might be still on the river, or </p><p>they might be moored at Norway House </p><p>waiting for favorable weather to cross. </p><p>Jarvis did not know. He would not know </p><p>till they arrived. </p><p> “But strike me blind in the blinkers if</p><p>they ayn’t put Heskimos or some other </p><p>God-fors’yken copper-skins on for crews!” </p><p>he prophesied. “ ’Cos w’y should it tyke </p><p>them this long to reach ’ere? Cawn’t come </p><p>fine and dry! Have to wait for the dirty </p><p>rain and blows. We ’aven’t but three sea- </p><p>sons ’ere anyw’y, Factor—July, Haugust </p><p>and Winter!” </p><p> Carlisle would have continued on across</p><p>the lake to Norway House, but the Octo- </p><p>ber rains and gales were on and the Winni- </p><p>peg was too dangerous at the moment for </p><p>canoe travel. Perforce he fretted away the </p><p>days at Grand Rapids, ever watching for </p><p>the lift of the York boats through the </p><p>squalls. The breath of Winter blew fros- </p><p>tily down the vast inland sea. </p><p> All the forest was a dying blaze of color,</p><p>cardinal-leaved moose maples, yellow </p><p>birches, canary willows, umber cotton- </p><p>woods, silvered poplars, burning brightly </p><p>against the sere grasses of the gulches and </p><p>the purple-black spruce of the hills. Then </p><p>a weird storm with thunder, lightning, hail, </p><p>sleet quenched the flame in a night, and </p><p>the next morning the forests were stripped </p><p>to their swaying trunks and moaning </p><p>branches. </p><p> Stark as a skeleton lay the land, with</p><p>the sifting snow padding its bare ribs and </p><p>ragged vertebras like leprous flesh. The </p><p>flowers were swept from the hills. No </p><p>longer Carlisle saw in the dance of blue- </p><p>bells Joan’s laughing eyes, no longer he </p><p>caught in the breeze-blown daisies the </p><p>golden shimmer of her hair. He cursed </p><p>the laggard York boats and wore out his </p><p>eyes trying to pierce Winnipeg’s wrack of </p><p>storm. </p><p> The lake raged incessantly, a Winter-</p><p>harrowed maelstrom, its headlands hidden </p><p>by the breaking waves, its islands frost- </p><p>armored over, its beach littered with shore</p><p>ice broken off and cast high like chips, its </p><p>three hundred miles of rollers ramping to </p><p>the clouds, roaring at the migrant rout </p><p>scudding through the snow. </p><p> “Ae, Factor, it is not Wenipak now,”</p><p>described Waseyawin who with Missowa </p><p>always watched at his shoulder. “It is </p><p>Keche (the ocean) Wenipak.” </p><p> “So,” nodded Missowa, “but in three</p><p>days the wind will lose its breath. The air </p><p>will be sweet and warm.” </p><p> “Indian Summer, eh, Missowa?” asked</p><p>Carlisle. </p><p> “Thus the white men call it, but it is not</p><p>of this earth. It comes from afar, from an- </p><p>other world. It is the time when the spirits </p><p>Ambush </p><p>45 </p><p>of our forefathers rise to go forth on the </p><p>Winter hunt, and in that time of calm, Fac- </p><p>tor, your boats will arrive.” </p><p> MISSOWA’S words proved true.</p><p>In three days the wind seemed to </p><p>have blown out its lungs. The earth </p><p>poised in a vacuum through which stole </p><p>mellow lights, a haze of incense, chatter of </p><p>birds, droning of bees, the gurgle of run- </p><p>ning rapids. The snow steamed on the </p><p>slopes, and the river ice pooled with black </p><p>water, when all in one fleet, manned by </p><p>York Factory Indians and steered by half- </p><p>breeds, out of the dank lake vapor the </p><p>York boats rose like hoary ghost craft. </p><p> There had been a forest fire on the Hayes</p><p>after the routing of the first boats up, they </p><p>said, and these later ones had been forced </p><p>to clear the stream of miles of half-burned </p><p>trees. </p><p> Carlisle was ready for them. When the</p><p>passing of the Autumn season showed him </p><p>that there was no hope of getting the car- </p><p>goes up-river by boat, he had made ready </p><p>his toboggans, dog teams, snow-shoes and </p><p>all his Winter gear. Now the transfer from </p><p>boats to dog teams was arranged. Before </p><p>all was completed the weather changed </p><p>again. </p><p> Some invisible hand loosed the leash that</p><p>held the wind, opened the snowgates of </p><p>the sky. The frosts bit like the stroke of </p><p>steel. Ahead lay a foot of river and lake </p><p>ice covered with sand-like drifts. </p><p> At Chimawawin the Factor drew on</p><p>Hampton for a fresh relay of men, dogs and </p><p>toboggans and sent the first relay back to </p><p>Grand Rapids to bring on the surplus stuff </p><p>he had been compelled to leave behind for </p><p>lack of outfits. At the Pas he repeated, </p><p>sending back both relays, and out of the </p><p>Pas on the home trail he marshaled a long </p><p>train of toboggans each drawn by six hus- </p><p>kies and loaded with one thousand pounds </p><p>apiece. </p><p> With a surge of joy he turned his face up-</p><p>stream on the final relay.- It was the Com- </p><p>pany’s business, but his heart was not in it. </p><p>His heart was up yonder on Sturgeon Lake</p><p>where a mad girl would have finished by </p><p>this time the food he had surreptitiously </p><p>given her and no doubt be pining for more! </p><p> Of a truth, Joan was pining for more.</p><p>Like medicine in her blood the provisions </p><p>Carlisle had given her brought back the </p><p>roses to her cheeks, but it was only for a </p><p>little, and when the delicacies were done </p><p>she failed more rapidly than before. Worry </p><p>aided malnutrition. </p><p> The failure to capture the Hudson’s Bay</p><p>Company’s York boats chagrined her and </p><p>her father beyond measure. For Wayne’s </p><p>attempt was no mere hostile raid. It was </p><p>a serious venture forced by the dire need </p><p>of better sustenance, and the fact that </p><p>Richelieu had outwitted them as well as </p><p>Carlisle was bitter as hemlock drink. </p><p> Wayne brooded over it continually, and</p><p>his brooding finally brought him to a reluc- </p><p>tant decision. </p><p> “By the Doom, Joan, I’ll have to send</p><p>you out,” he told her, his eyes dwelling </p><p>longingly upon her. “We’ve never been </p><p>separated before, but I think the time has </p><p>come. It’s too late now to get you out by </p><p>canoe, but on the first snow I’ll send you </p><p>with Mason by dog team to St. Paul.” </p><p> “No, no, father,” Joan passionately pro-</p><p>tested. “I can’t leave you here alone. I </p><p>couldn’t bear it alone at St. Paul. I’ll fight </p><p>it out with you. Oh! My dear, I want to. </p><p>I must. I will. There,” laughing her old </p><p>gay laugh as she cast herself into his arms, </p><p>“there’s your defiant daughter, sir! But </p><p>don’t worry. I’ll be all right, father. Let </p><p>us both be cheerful. I’m sure something </p><p>unexpected will turn up.” </p><p> She had no communication with Cumber-</p><p>land House and knew nothing of the Hud- </p><p>son’s Bay Company’s plans, for since the </p><p>battle over the York boats the tension had </p><p>tightened about all three posts and rivalry </p><p>had grown more bitter. The gates were </p><p>always closed now and a watch kept upon </p><p>the palisades. </p><p> Antagonism flared openly. The woods</p><p>were full of surprises. By night daring </p><p>raiders dashed out trying to put torch to </p><p>their enemies’ stockades. By day sharp</p><p>skirmishes occurred. Wood-gathering par- </p><p>ties were put to flight and hunters fired at </p><p>on lonely forest trails. </p><p> Yet never in those eventful days had Joan</p><p>seen or heard anything of Carlisle. She </p><p>wondered at his seclusion, his silence. Per- </p><p>haps he had been unable to secure more </p><p>supplies for himself! But in any event he </p><p>had intimated that he would not forget </p><p>her if she were in need, and though she was </p><p>not just sure that her pride would let her </p><p>accept, nevertheless she resented the ab- </p><p>sence of any overture. </p><p> The weeks passed without any sign from</p><p>46 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>him, the geese went South, the snow fell, </p><p>and the frost crackled. Her indisposition </p><p>increased day by day. To the observant </p><p>Wayne her trouble seemed threefold—the </p><p>disturbing effect of the straight meat diet, </p><p>the brooding over the Free-Trade prospects </p><p>and an apparent canker, heart-longing, for </p><p>which he could find no reason. Casting </p><p>about for a reason, his mind turned upon </p><p>Carlisle. </p><p> As a magnanimous enemy he had brought</p><p>her food to the palisades, food which Wayne </p><p>in a wrath was prone to throw away had </p><p>it not been for the girl’s actual need. Was </p><p>he more than a magnanimous enemy? </p><p>Wayne recalled the intimacy between him </p><p>and Joan during the earlier part of the </p><p>canoe journey from Grande Portage, also </p><p>the fact that, together, they had voyaged </p><p>the latter part of it without him. </p><p> Foreboding entered into him. Perhaps</p><p>it was not worry, not dangerous diet he had </p><p>to fear most! Perhaps something else was </p><p>eating her youthful health away, the con- </p><p>suming desire of the void spaces of her </p><p>heart, the emaciating hunger of her soul— </p><p>a hunger he himself had suffered all these </p><p>years. </p><p> “You had better let me send over to</p><p>Cumberland House for Father Andrews,” </p><p>he suggested. “He’s skilled with medi- </p><p>cines, and no doubt he’ll be able to give </p><p>you something to help you.” </p><p> “No, father, no, you mustn’t,” she</p><p>flashed with genuine fire. “We ask noth- </p><p>ing of the Hudson’s Bay Company, and if </p><p>word passes between the posts it must come </p><p>first from Cumberland House.” </p><p> STILL her sickness persisted, and</p><p>• jp® Wayne cursed the eternal, nauseat- </p><p>EJL_j ing, gorge-raising meat. It was af- </p><p>fecting even his iron self. It was affecting </p><p>all his men. He had disconcerting visions </p><p>of scurvy and plague, and he told Mason to </p><p>see that the men brewed spruce tea and </p><p>drank it as a preventive. But the men had </p><p>long been muttering among themselves, </p><p>brewing a draft of trouble. </p><p> They grumbled at their fare, grumbled</p><p>at the spruce tea and when no one was </p><p>looking threw it in the snow. They had </p><p>not bargained, they told each other, to live </p><p>through the Winter eating each day three </p><p>meals of flesh and flesh alone, all for the </p><p>sake of the Indians’ trade. </p><p> They knew that if they went out fifty or</p><p>one hundred miles to the Indians’ teepees in </p><p>their hunting districts and took back what </p><p>supplies they needed, they would stir the </p><p>tribes to bloodshed and kill Wayne’s trade </p><p>and prestige at one stroke, but this they </p><p>violently threatened to do. Straight meat </p><p>was all right for Eskimos and pagan In- </p><p>dians, they stormed, but they had been </p><p>born in the South! </p><p> Had Wayne not been so preoccupied</p><p>with his daughter’s condition, he would </p><p>have marked the fermentation of discon- </p><p>tent, the progression of discontent to open </p><p>mutiny, but he spent most of his time with </p><p>Joan who, lapsing from her usual vigorous </p><p>activity, lay listless and tired upon a couch </p><p>by the fireplace in his council-room. </p><p>Through the shortening Winter days and </p><p>the ever-lengthening nights he would sit </p><p>smoking by her side, staring at the pale face </p><p>upon the black bearskin couch-robes, </p><p>racking his brains for a way out of the </p><p>situation, pleading with her in vain to let </p><p>him get medicines or send her South. </p><p> Mason warned him once that he feared</p><p>the men might get out of hand, and he </p><p>promised to look into the matter, but the </p><p>warning slipped from his mind in the treach- </p><p>erous fashion things had been slipping of </p><p>late. He never remembered it till his bri- </p><p>gade leader stalked in on him and Joan one </p><p>Wintry dusk with the news that the men </p><p>had not come back that afternoon from </p><p>their fuel-gathering. </p><p> Rudely shaken out of his thinking and</p><p>brooding, Wayne leaped up, mentally alert, </p><p>poised at his full height as if scented danger </p><p>had put him on his guard. </p><p> “How’s that, Mason?” he demanded.</p><p>“How long have they been away? When’d </p><p>they leave the post?” </p><p> “Jist at noon, Wayne, and I’m sartinly</p><p>gittin’ anxious.” </p><p> “But maybe they’re working late, Mason;</p><p>maybe they’ve had a brush with Northwest- </p><p>ers or Hudson’s Bay choppers and are lying </p><p>low to get in under cover of the dark.” </p><p> The Missourian shook his head, his</p><p>weather-wrinkled, alkali-seared face creas- </p><p>ing deeper in his anxiety. </p><p> “Mebbe so,” he doubted, “but thar ain’t</p><p>the ring of an ax or the spit of a rifle to be </p><p>heerd. The woods is as still as a cussed </p><p>vault.” </p><p> “No noise, eh?” pondered Wayne.</p><p>“That’s suspicious. By the Doom, Mason, </p><p>if they’re trying to play me tricks, I’ll have </p><p>Ambush </p><p>47 </p><p>the skins of the whole crowd! How many </p><p>are left in the Fort?” </p><p> “You, me, Murdock, and three more.”</p><p>“Well, tell Murdock and the three to </p><p>stand keen watch. You and I’ll go out and </p><p>find them.” </p><p> “Oh! Don’t leave me here alone, father,”</p><p>pleaded Joan, sliding off the couch and </p><p>glancing apprehensively at the Winter dark </p><p>on the window-pane, at the somber shad- </p><p>ows of the room. “Take me with you. I </p><p>don’t know what’s the matter with me, but </p><p>I’m all nerves, and I can’t stay here alone.” </p><p>“All right, Joan,” he humored her. </p><p>“It’s not very far. Put on something warm </p><p>and come with us.” </p><p> Over her blanket-cloth suit she slipped</p><p>her warmest capote, beautifully cased in </p><p>ermine with the edge of the hood fringed </p><p>with tails of the silver fox. She thrust her </p><p>moccasined toes into the loops of her tas- </p><p>seled snowshoes and passed out between </p><p>her father and Mason over the soft snows </p><p>into the woods. Shuffling without a sound </p><p>they went, Wayne and Mason on their </p><p>broad bear’s-paw shoes, their rifles thrown </p><p>across their left arms in readiness. </p><p> Around them crept the eeriness of the</p><p>Winter night, deep shadow in the under- </p><p>brush, a half twilight in the open aisles, the </p><p>snow’s refraction of the starlight filtering </p><p>through the festooned branches. </p><p> The forest was a fairyland filled with fan-</p><p>tastic shapes, a strange cathedral packed </p><p>with voiceless worshipers standing white- </p><p>robed, huddled upon their knees or lying </p><p>prone upon their hidden faces, and over all </p><p>like the shroud of the dead spread the ever- </p><p>lasting snow, cloaked on the tree boles, </p><p>bossed on the stumps, draped from the in- </p><p>terwoven branches, plumed on the spruce </p><p>tops overhead. </p><p> From the roofed aisles they stepped out</p><p>into the slashed clearing where the Free- </p><p>Trading men had been at work. There lay </p><p>the trampled, chip-littered crust, the felled </p><p>trees, the sawn log lengths, the chopped </p><p>stove wood, all just as it had been left. </p><p>The very axes were still sunk in the scored</p><p>blocks. A few ghostly hares at play about </p><p>the piles vanished as the snowshoes began </p><p>to clatter on the chips. Wayne stooped </p><p>abruptly to examine something on the sur- </p><p>face of the padded area. </p><p> “By the Doom—look!” he commanded</p><p>harshly. </p><p> Joan and Mason stared speechless. Even</p><p>in the poor light they recognized the litter </p><p>Wayne pointed out, frozen bread crusts, </p><p>rinds of bacon, the chocolate blotch of tea- </p><p>leaves, a forgotten rum jug lying empty on </p><p>the snow. </p><p> “Condemnation!” Wayne blazed in ter-</p><p>rific wrath. “You’re sure it’s our chopping </p><p>ground, Mason?” </p><p> “Tarnation sure!” avowed Mason.</p><p>“Didn’t I set them to work here and leave </p><p>them workin’? And they ain’t shifted </p><p>sence, fer them’s our axes.” </p><p> “The cursed curs! There’s only one</p><p>place they could get that stuff to eat!” </p><p>Wayne was off as he spoke, running ’round </p><p>the edge of the clearing, searching for the </p><p>trail of the intruders. </p><p> “Here are their tracks!” he shouted.</p><p>“Dozens of them, coming from the direc- </p><p>tion of Richelieu’s post. The Northwesters </p><p>wear longer-tailed snowshoes than ours, </p><p>and there are the marks of both kinds going </p><p>back. By Heaven, Richelieu has drawn </p><p>them off! Come on, Mason. Come on, </p><p>Joan.” </p><p> At a great speed he lurched out of the</p><p>woods again over the snows toward Fort </p><p>Wayne, Joan and Mason running in the </p><p>path he broke. </p><p> “Murdock, Murdock!” he yelled to the</p><p>gatekeeper. “Send out your three. You </p><p>yourself stand in the entrance with rifle </p><p>ready. My men have been eating and </p><p>drinking with the Northwesters.” </p><p>DROPPING one armed man every </p><p>hundred yards or so to form a line </p><p>of communication with Murdock </p><p>in the open gateway of his own fort, Wayne </p><p>led on to Richelieu’s post. Mason he kept </p><p>by him, and Joan, in spite of his entreaties</p><p>to stay back on this line of communica- </p><p>tion, followed persistently upon their heels. </p><p> The gateway of the Northwest post stood</p><p>open as they ran up, and in the yellow glow </p><p>that flooded from the lighted windows out </p><p>across the trampled yard they could see </p><p>Richelieu himself, a heavy military coat </p><p>partially covering his resplendent uniform, </p><p>standing in the entrance, waiting as if he </p><p>had expected such a visit. </p><p> “Comment?’' he chuckled when lie saw</p><p>their faces. “What do you want now?” </p><p>“My men—curse you!” exploded Wayne, </p><p>his rifle threatening from the hip. “They’re </p><p>here. I want them quick!” </p><p> Richelieu was unarmed, but he showed</p><p>48 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>not the slightest fear of Wayne’s nor Ma- </p><p>son’s weapons. He reached out and plucked </p><p>Wayne by the arm, drawing him midway </p><p>into the entrance and pointing to a big door </p><p>in the mess building that faced the gate. </p><p>The door had just opened wide to admit </p><p>two Northwesters rolling in a keg of liquor, </p><p>and it revealed a long, candle-lighted table </p><p>inside, loaded with food and lined with </p><p>feasting men. </p><p> “Ciel, see them!” Richelieu urged ma-</p><p>liciously. “Hunger is a great chastener, </p><p>Ralph Wayne. They were tempted, and </p><p>they fell. There they are, yours and mine </p><p>together. I am not holding yours. Go and </p><p>take them.” </p><p> With a growl Wayne shook off the hand</p><p>on his arm and darted for the door. </p><p> “Mason, stay at the gate with Joan,”</p><p>he flung over his shoulder, “and put a bul- </p><p>let through that laughing devil if he so </p><p>much as moves!” </p><p> Joan did not obey as her father expected</p><p>she would. Instead, she inserted her hand </p><p>within her capote, felt in the pocket of her </p><p>blanket coat to assure herself that her pis- </p><p>tol was there and followed her father up to </p><p>the door of the mess building. </p><p> Inside reigned bedlam, pandemonium,</p><p>drunken Northwesters and Free-Traders all </p><p>mingled together, gorging themselves at </p><p>the table, laughing, singing, shouting, smit- </p><p>ing each other’s backs at ribald stories and </p><p>hammering the board with their liquor </p><p>mugs. As wild a revel as ever he glimpsed, </p><p>Wayne saw under the candle-light, and the </p><p>sight sent him up the steps in a single jump. </p><p> In a whirl of passion he jammed between</p><p>the two Northwesters who were rolling in </p><p>the liquor keg, put sole upon the keg itself </p><p>on the top step and sprang into the mess </p><p>room with his rifle clubbed. </p><p> “You condemned traitors! You treach-</p><p>erous sneaks!” he denounced furiously, his </p><p>gloomy face ablaze, his mustaches quiver- </p><p>ing, his rifle-butt swaying every second as </p><p>if to crash down upon the nearest head. </p><p>“You steal off into the woods and devour</p><p>like dogs what these dirty Northwesters </p><p>throw you, while my own daughter starves </p><p>for a bit of good food. Get up! Get up on </p><p>your drunken legs and out of this!” </p><p> They were too far gone in liquor for</p><p>shame. Just a moment of bewildered star- </p><p>ing, and a wave of laughter and jeering </p><p>drowned his rage. They guffawed in his </p><p>face, Northwester and Free-Trader alike, </p><p> pounding the table more violently and</p><p>making the room shake with their incoher- </p><p>ent cries. While from the head of the feast </p><p>one Harris, a Mississippi river-man and </p><p>wood boss of the men that day, rose up tee- </p><p>tering on his toes. </p><p> “Come’n’ have a drink, Wayne,” he in-</p><p>vited, “ ’n’ I’ll sing ye a liT song. Lissen- </p><p>ere-” </p><p> “By the Doom, you were responsible,</p><p>Harris!” Wayne roared in interruption. </p><p>“And you’re responsible still. Get the men </p><p>out. Call them out, you, every staggering </p><p>son of them, or as sure as you’re drunk your- </p><p>self, you’ll never sing again!” </p><p> Wayne’s rifle-butt poised over Harris’s</p><p>head, but without warning the two shrewd </p><p>Northwesters in the doorway shot their </p><p>rolling keg into Wayne’s legs from behind. </p><p>Wayne went down backward, flat on the </p><p>floor, his rifle flying from his hands. The </p><p>two Northwesters were upon him like cats, </p><p>clutching and grappling, preventing his </p><p>hands from securing the weapon again. </p><p> Joan gave a cry as she saw her father go</p><p>down and groped in her coat for her pistol. </p><p>Mason had also seen from the gate, and he </p><p>sprang forward, his rifle outflung. With </p><p>the lightning-like sighting of the woodsman </p><p>he took a snap shot in the doorway, but he </p><p>had bargained without Richelieu. The lat- </p><p>ter reached the step as quick as Mason, </p><p>struck up the Missourian’s rifle-barrel, send- </p><p>ing the shot wild, and wrestled for the pos- </p><p>session of the weapon. </p><p> Joan had her own weapon out, but both</p><p>her father and Mason whirled in such a </p><p>tangle of bodies that she dared not shoot </p><p>for fear of injuring them. She hovered on </p><p>the step of the mess-room doorway, scream- </p><p>ing for aid through the frosty night. </p><p> “Murdock, Murdock!” she entreated</p><p>frenziedly. “My father—here! Bring all </p><p>the other men, quick!” </p><p> Tearing forward abreast the four broke</p><p>through the gateway, but Richelieu had not </p><p>been there alone. Back in the shadows of </p><p>the stockade he had others lurking silently, </p><p>waiting for such a rush. As Murdock and </p><p>his three companions surged through, a </p><p>dozen Northwesters leaped bodily upon </p><p>them, bearing them down, smothering their </p><p>spitting rifles in the snow. </p><p> “Tiens, Mademoiselle Joan,” gloated</p><p>Richelieu, emerging from the fighting group </p><p>that overpowered Mason, “you are the only </p><p>one left and you I will take myself!” </p><p>Ambush </p><p>49 </p><p>WITH the throb of the trapped </p><p>wild thing in her breast Joan sprang </p><p>aside from his reach, doubled back </p><p>upon him like an agile hare and raced for </p><p>the gateway, firing as she ran. The North- </p><p>westers still struggling to pinion Murdock </p><p>and the other three Free-Traders, there </p><p>was no one in the entrance to stop her, but </p><p>Richelieu was gaining on her at every stride. </p><p> She had on her snowshoes, and he, in</p><p>moccasins only, outran her on the packed </p><p>snow of the yard. The lurch of her run- </p><p>ning caused her to shoot wild while Riche- </p><p>lieu dodged and laughed jeeringly, strain- </p><p>ing every moment to catch her before she </p><p>left the palisades. </p><p> Once, twice, three, four—five times she</p><p>fired without effect. Then in the gateway </p><p>she whirled, snapping the sixth and last </p><p>shot in Richelieu’s face only arm’s length </p><p>away. She saw his head flip back as if </p><p>jolted with a fist. His body slumped, feet </p><p>forward, on the snow and slid in against the </p><p>open gate. Joan turned and ran with pal- </p><p>pitating heart across the deep snows out- </p><p>side. </p><p> She knew there was not a Free-Trader</p><p>left in Fort Wayne, no safety for her in her </p><p>own post. There was only one destination </p><p>in her mind—Cumberland House. There </p><p>was only one object of appeal—Carlisle. </p><p>With him there was at least sanctuary from </p><p>Richelieu and his wild crew, and, mag- </p><p>nanimous enemy as he was, he would surely </p><p>come to the aid of her father as he had done </p><p>once before! </p><p> Like the wind she ran, springing from</p><p>the heel on the resilient webbing of her </p><p>shoes, twisting her feet in the swing of the </p><p>stride to clear her ankles of the fast-shift- </p><p>ing frames, spurning the snow in white jets </p><p>behind her. </p><p> She looked back fearfully over her shoul-</p><p>der to see if Richelieu had arisen again or </p><p>if any of his men were following, but she </p><p>saw nothing, heard nothing but the shout- </p><p>ing and laughter in the Northwest post. </p><p>The noise faded with the distance. She </p><p>was alone on the cameo snows lighted </p><p>faintly by the stars and a wan aurora that</p><p>brightened the horizon to the northward. </p><p> Cumberland House loomed ahead, the</p><p>snow-roofed buildings crouching within the </p><p>drifted stockade, rimmed by the black wall </p><p>of the forest, and she pressed to the limit of </p><p>her speed. As she swerved into the tram- </p><p>pled path before the gate, another sound </p><p> 4</p><p> beside the shuffling of her snow-shoes</p><p>drifted to her ears. </p><p> She paused, listening in the void of the</p><p>frost, and immediately her wilderness- </p><p>trained ears interpreted the other sound, a </p><p>blending of toboggan creak, husky pant, </p><p>snow-shoe crunch, whip-crack—the weird </p><p>harmony of a coming dog-train on the trail. </p><p> Wondering, Joan wheeled, staring out</p><p>over the snow-blanketed ice, and under the </p><p>play of the aurora she glimpsed it, revealed, </p><p>concealed and revealed again by the flash- </p><p>light flares, the whole train imaged against </p><p>the pallid background like a painting of </p><p>the Northland wastes. </p><p> She caught the impression in its entirety,</p><p>the long, winding furrow dotted with the </p><p>loaded toboggans each exactly alike except </p><p>that the more distant diminished in size; </p><p>the track beaters ahead of the dogs leaning </p><p>forward on their smoking shoes; the strain- </p><p>ing, steaming, six-dog teams; the drivers on </p><p>the run, their whips writhing through the </p><p>air; the armed guards with rifles slung upon </p><p>their hunched shoulders. </p><p> And the figure in front of all, tall, big of</p><p>frame, flattening the drifts with great </p><p>seven-foot snowshoes cut long and swift in </p><p>their lines for open-river work, seemed to </p><p>her vaguely familiar. </p><p> There was something in his poise of body,</p><p>in his stride, in the way he held his head, </p><p>looking straight forward under the hood of </p><p>his capote that insinuated itself into her </p><p>consciousness. With a flash of enlighten- </p><p>ment, illumination of brain or heart she </p><p>could not tell which, she suddenly knew </p><p>him. Even under the furred capote she </p><p>knew him. </p><p> “Paul, Paul!” she cried, and dashed down</p><p>the snowy bank toward him.</p><p>CHAPTER X </p><p>THE RED DEATH </p><p> YOU, Joan,—now the God of North-</p><p>men is good!” exulted Carlisle, catch- </p><p>ing her hands and bringing her to a stop </p><p>upon her coasting snow-shoes. “I was </p><p>never dreaming-” </p><p> But his gauntleted palm had closed upon</p><p>the hard steel weapon in her grip, and his </p><p>tone changed. </p><p> “Good heavens, girl, what’s this?</p><p>What’s wrong?” </p><p>“Oh, come quickly, Paul, you and your </p><p>50 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>force!” she implored. “My father’s a pris- </p><p>oner in Richelieu’s post with all his men.” </p><p> Involuntarily his mind flew back to the</p><p>night when with this very weapon, and </p><p>with other weapons more mighty, she had </p><p>delayed him from reaching his York boats </p><p>in time to prevent them being captured. </p><p> Yet he knew this was no ruse of hers.</p><p>There was no doubting the sincerity of her </p><p>words as she poured out the story of Riche- </p><p>lieu’s cunning and how with his hands al- </p><p>most upon her he had fallen to her last shot </p><p>in the gateway of his stockade. </p><p> “Curse him!” Carlisle anathematized.</p><p>“I hope it’s through his dirty heart. Let me </p><p>help you up the bank, Joan. There! My </p><p>men will be up in a minute.” </p><p> From the top of the bank he began to call</p><p>out the news to them, to Eugene Drum- </p><p>mond, Missowa, Waseyawin and their four </p><p>middlemen who with the coming of Winter </p><p>at Grand Rapids had put aside canoe and </p><p>paddle for toboggan and racket. They </p><p>together with the drivers from the lower </p><p>river posts cracked their whips more lust- </p><p>ily, urging on the dogs. </p><p> “Marche! Marchel” they called. “Httl</p><p>Hul” </p><p> With the spume flying from the toboggan</p><p>hoods they made a rush at the incline, </p><p>teams clawing tenaciously, track-beaters </p><p>hauling from the front with tow ropes, </p><p>drivers shoving from behind. Toboggan </p><p>after loaded toboggan undulated over the </p><p>crest amid a mist-like shower of snow. </p><p> “Chawl Chawl” yelled the drivers, and</p><p>the giddes swerved to the right into the </p><p>beaten track that wound up to the gates of </p><p>Cumberland House. </p><p> “Who comes there?” demanded the loud</p><p>voice of Galt. </p><p> “Carlisle,” was the answer. “Hurry up,</p><p>Galt. There’s trouble over at Richelieu’s </p><p>post, and we’re needed there.” </p><p> Immediately the gate swung open, and</p><p>the dog-drivers cracked their whips anew. </p><p> “Yeel Yee!” they commanded.</p><p> The teams hauled ’round to the left with</p><p>the sweep of the trail and galloped tri- </p><p>umphantly into the yard where they were </p><p>swallowed up by a rush of shouting men. </p><p> “Where’s Andrews, Galt?” asked Carlisle,</p><p>bellowing to make himself heard in the </p><p>clamor. </p><p> “Here, Paul,” answered Andrews himself,</p><p>pushing through the crowd, garbed in his </p><p>Winter gear, the heavy capote with the fur- </p><p>fringed, helmet-like hood drawn as close </p><p>about his face as he was wont to draw the </p><p>dun cowl and mosquito veil in Summer. </p><p>“I’m .glad you’re safely back, also glad to </p><p>see you’ve got supplies.” </p><p> “Forest fires delayed the York boats,</p><p>Father, so that the frost caught us.” </p><p> “Who’s that with you? Ah—you, Miss</p><p>Wayne.” </p><p> “Yes, and it’s only by grace of a lucky</p><p>bullet that she is here,” Carlisle told him. </p><p>“Richelieu, you understand! Her father </p><p>and his men are prisoners, she says, and she </p><p>did well to escape.” </p><p> “You brave girl!” eulogized Andrews,</p><p>taking her hands. “But you didn’t—kill </p><p>him?” he added anxiously. </p><p> “I—I don’t know,” confessed Joan. “I</p><p>fired in his face, and he went down. That’s </p><p>all I know.” </p><p> “A job for you in any case, Father,”</p><p>intimated the Factor, “and who knows but </p><p>you may have many more! Galt,” giving </p><p>orders to the chief trader, “have the drivers </p><p>of the lower river posts keep guard here. </p><p>Arm all our Cumberland House force and </p><p>bring them on our heels.” </p><p>HE TURNED through the entrance </p><p>again with Joan and Andrews, and </p><p>Eugene Drummond, Waseyawin, </p><p>Missowa and their middlemen sped after, </p><p>trailed by the rest of the Hudson’s Bay men </p><p>as fast as Galt could hand out the weapons. </p><p> As they skimmed back on Joan’s tracks</p><p>toward the Northwest post, they saw that </p><p>the gate was still open, and at the entrance </p><p>the girl hesitated with repugnance till </p><p>Carlisle took her hand with a reassuring </p><p>gesture. </p><p> There was blood upon the snow but no</p><p>sign of Richelieu himself. Ahead of them, </p><p>across the space of the yard, bulked the </p><p>log mess building. The door was closed, </p><p>but a yellow glow sprayed from the lighted </p><p>square of the windows on either side of </p><p>the door-jambs. </p><p> Listening, they could hear no singing or</p><p>shouting, but the angry hum of voices </p><p>buzzed from within as from a colossal hive </p><p>of bees. </p><p> “We’d better leave our snow-shoes here,”</p><p>suggested Carlisle. “And don’t make a </p><p>sound in the yard.” </p><p> He set the example by twisting his toes</p><p>from their loops and sticking the tails of </p><p>his shoes into the snow. The others did the </p><p>Ambush </p><p>51 </p><p>same, creeping after him, panther-footed </p><p>in their moccasins, through the hard-packed </p><p>yard. They reached the level of the steps </p><p>without noise and, craning their necks, </p><p>peered through the lighted window on the </p><p>nearer side of the door. </p><p> Inside the rough-walled mess-room the</p><p>feast was all disordered, the feasters all </p><p>disarranged, although it was at once ap- </p><p>parent that no hands had been laid upon </p><p>the main body of the Free-Traders who had </p><p>partly composed the feast. </p><p> Too drunk to care what company ruled</p><p>the Northland, they slouched in their chairs </p><p>or lolled forward across the table, grinning </p><p>maudlinly at the plight of Wayne who had </p><p>sought to chastise them. Upon half a </p><p>dozen chairs Wayne, Mason, Murdock and </p><p>the other three sober men sat in a row </p><p>against the wall, their limbs bound tightly </p><p>to the chair backs and the chair legs. </p><p> Across one cleared end of the table lay</p><p>Richelieu, his uniform flashing bright under </p><p>the candlelight as three or four Northwest- </p><p>ers worked over him, and in the ministering </p><p>hands those outside could see his muscles </p><p>stir slightly. </p><p> “He’s not dead, anyway, thank Heaven!”</p><p>whispered Andrews. </p><p> “Then the devil must have him in special</p><p>keeping!” growled Carlisle under his breath </p><p>as he laid his hand quietly on the latch. </p><p>“Stand well to one side of the door jamb, </p><p>Joan, and you, Andrews, in case of shoot- </p><p>ing.” </p><p> He swung the door wide and stepped</p><p>swiftly upon the doorsill, two long pistols </p><p>in his hands covering the packed room. </p><p> “Bon soir, messieurs/” he greeted them</p><p>mockingly. </p><p> He gave neither order nor threat, yet in-</p><p>stinctively they knew his intent and froze </p><p>into immobility, staring at his huge figure </p><p>in the frost-rimmed, furred capote and at </p><p>the other figures, likewise frost-rimed, </p><p>who crowded behind him on the steps, their </p><p>long-barreled rifles looking down the table.</p><p> “So Richelieu met with a little accident</p><p>in his game,” Carlisle laughed. “Is he </p><p>badly hurt?” </p><p> “Not badly we think, m'sieu’,” returned</p><p>one of the Northwesters somewhat sullenly, </p><p>“but you have a doctoring priest there. He </p><p>could tell.” </p><p> “Surely,” acquiesced Carlisle. “Will you</p><p>take a look at him, Father?” </p><p> He made room for Andrews to push in,</p><p>and the priest walked up to the table where </p><p>Richelieu lay. </p><p> “Through the muscles of his neck, Pere,”</p><p>the Frenchman pointed out the course of </p><p>the ball. “He is just on the edge of—how </p><p>do you say it?—coming to!” </p><p> “Yes,” nodded Andrews, passing a lighted</p><p>candle over Richelieu as he lay, “and no </p><p>great danger in that ball through his neck </p><p>muscles! But do you see what is all through </p><p>his face?” </p><p> “Frost scars?” hazarded the Northwester,</p><p>staring. </p><p> “Frost scars? No, you never saw frost</p><p>scars like those. The man has smallpox!” </p><p> Swifter and harder than lead the diag-</p><p>nosis hit them. Every one in the room </p><p>seemed to start as if from a violent shock. </p><p>The Northwesters around Richelieu threw </p><p>up their arms before their faces in tangible </p><p>defense against the plague, while all the </p><p>rest crossed themselves in palpable terror. </p><p> Even the slouching Free-Traders were</p><p>stirred. The horrible significance of the </p><p>word penetrated their drunken conscious- </p><p>nesses. They stood up unsteadily, their </p><p>faces whitening, sucking in their breaths </p><p>in nervous clicks. </p><p> Yet only for an instant did the great</p><p>crowd cower. Abruptly, in a frantic rush, </p><p>in an insane stampede they dashed for the </p><p>doorway. </p><p> Carlisle’s big frame blocked the exit, and</p><p>he met the rush with clubbed pistols. Like </p><p>cattle they came, shoving, trampling,</p><p>frenzied with fear. Three of them went </p><p>down from his clubbed weapons. A dozen </p><p>more were hurled back from the stiff rifle </p><p>barrels around him, as from the ends of </p><p>lances. </p><p> The rout fell aside, temporarily checked,</p><p>swerved and made for the windows. Swing- </p><p>ing chairs, they smashed away the glass and </p><p>frames, but at Carlisle’s command several </p><p>of his men had sprung to the outside of the </p><p>windows, and an array of rifle-barrels </p><p>speared the Northwesters back into the </p><p>room. </p><p> “Stop!” roared Carlisle through the crash-</p><p>ing babel. “Stop your panic or I’ll order </p><p>my men to shoot. They can rake the whole </p><p>place from the door and windows. Which </p><p>will you face: smallpox or bullets?” </p><p> The threat stayed for a little their wild</p><p>frenzy, and Carlisle seized upon the mo- </p><p>ment of their uncertainty to try to prevent </p><p>another stampede. </p><p>52 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “There’s no use in making confounded</p><p>fools of yourselves,” he told them. “You </p><p>have to face the situation anyway, so why </p><p>not face it like men? I’m not going to let </p><p>you get away to any other post or Indian </p><p>camp to spread the infection there. Just </p><p>make up your minds to fight a sane light </p><p>here. First, some Free-Trader cut loose </p><p>Wayne and the rest!” </p><p>HARRIS, the Mississippi River man </p><p>who had wanted to sing Wayne a </p><p>song, stepped forth. The crisis </p><p>had sobered him like a dash of cold water, </p><p>and he quickly slit the chair lashings with </p><p>his sheath knife, freeing the six men. </p><p> “Now, Wayne, you and your I'ree-Trad-</p><p>ers are under quarantine with the North- </p><p>westers,” Carlisle informed him. “I hope </p><p>you’re not thinking of making any trouble </p><p>about it. If you are, make it right now and </p><p>we’ll have it over with.” </p><p> “Do you take me for a cursed fool?”</p><p>blazed Wayne. “I know smallpox. I had </p><p>it myself once on the Red River. My men </p><p>have been hobnobbing with these North- </p><p>westers and two of the bloody dogs mauled </p><p>me all over. Why, I wouldn’t dream of </p><p>going back to my post. I wouldn’t go near </p><p>my worst enemy. I wouldn’t rub up </p><p>against you, Carlisle, and I hate you worse </p><p>than a hundred hells.” </p><p> “Thanks,” Carlisle sent back sarcasti-</p><p>cally. “Wayne, you’re no hypocrite, any- </p><p>way!” </p><p> “But for heaven’s sake, watch my girl,”</p><p>Wayne implored in his next breath. “Keep </p><p>her away from this place. Joan, stand </p><p>back from the doorway, there.” </p><p> “I’m all right, father,” Joan assured him.</p><p>“I’ve never been in the room.” </p><p> “Did Richelieu touch you, girl?”</p><p> “No, father, no, he didn’t. And how I</p><p>wish you’d never gone in after your men!” </p><p>“So do I, though I’m not afraid for my- </p><p>self,” growled her father. “But it can’t be </p><p>helped now. Anyhow not likely anything </p><p>will come of it. What’s the program,</p><p>Carlisle?” </p><p> “Everybody parade for inspection,” Car-</p><p>lisle answered. . “You’ll all pass before </p><p>Andrews. Any further cases remain here </p><p>in the mess-room with Richelieu. The rest </p><p>go over to the trading-room till we see what </p><p>develops. Richelieu’s house we’ll save for </p><p>the recoveries. File up, every one!” </p><p> Some bold, some fearful, nearly all ner-</p><p>vous, they passed in review before the priest, </p><p>who examined each one closely for symp- </p><p>toms with his lighted candle. Now and </p><p>then he put a question bearing on their </p><p>general health or diet. </p><p> Twice he motioned a Northwester out</p><p>of the line to sit down in a chair by the </p><p>table. There was scarcely need to examine </p><p>the Free-Traders, since they had been ex- </p><p>posed to infection only that day, but for </p><p>the impression of equality in the unfortu- </p><p>nate circumstance Andrews scanned them </p><p>over with the rest. </p><p> “Only the two cases besides Richelieu,”</p><p>he announced when he had finished his in- </p><p>spection. </p><p> “All right, the two cases can clear this</p><p>room and knock together three bunks while </p><p>the rest go to the trading-room as I said,” </p><p>directed Carlisle. </p><p> “But bon Dieu,” burst out the North-</p><p>wester Dentaire, he of the pointed mus- </p><p>tache and the large hawked nose, “do you </p><p>mean to pack us there like curs waiting for </p><p>the Red Death to come and choose which </p><p>one?” </p><p> “Where else can I put you?” countered</p><p>Carlisle. “Out in the freezing woods?” </p><p> “I—I will not go,” Dentaire shrieked,</p><p>his pale face contracting in convulsive </p><p>muscular twitchings, his eyes staring wide, </p><p>horrific, his trembling fingers never ceasing </p><p>their continual crossing. “Non! Nonl Nor </p><p>mes camarades either!” </p><p> “Come out first, you!” ordered Carlisle,</p><p>sensing a new outbreak and leveling his </p><p>weapons at Dentaire. </p><p> Dentaire dived suddenly behind the</p><p>crowd and with a sweep of his feet kicked </p><p>out the legs of the big sheet-iron stove in </p><p>the middle of the room. With a crash the </p><p>mass of red-hot metal fell upon the floor, </p><p>and its bushels of glowing coals poured out </p><p>across the planks. Dry as dead moss, the </p><p>slivery planks blazed up instantaneously, </p><p>and not content with fire in one place </p><p>Dentaire scattered the coals to all corners </p><p>of the room. </p><p> “You hold us here to do your will?” he</p><p>gibbered behind the screen of his fellows, </p><p>“You will not let us out of the room? Voila, </p><p>then, there will be no room. The candles, </p><p>mes camarades—the candles aussil” </p><p> They seized them from the table and flung</p><p>them lighted into anything inflammable, </p><p>into the woodbox, into the cupboard, into </p><p>piles of old papers on the shelves about the </p><p>Ambush </p><p>53 </p><p>walls. The place was aflame in all quarters </p><p>at once, choked with smoke and shaken to </p><p>its foundations by the concerted rush to </p><p>escape. </p><p> Dentaire, slim, swift as a dancing-master,</p><p>was in the van of those who surged to the </p><p>doorway. Half-minded at first to put a ball </p><p>through him, Carlisle lowered his weapons </p><p>and made way. The room was now a roar- </p><p>ing furnace, and there was no holding men </p><p>in it to be burned to death. </p><p> “Back from the door and windows,” he</p><p>ordered. “Galt, shut the gate and you, </p><p>Joan, keep close to me. Back, men, I say, </p><p>and for the lives of you don’t touch any of </p><p>them!” </p><p> “Oui, touch us at your peril,” warned</p><p>Dentaire. “Stop us at your doom. But </p><p>put the hand on us and receive the Red </p><p>Death!” </p><p> In a stream they gushed forth, leaping</p><p>down the steps, vaulting over the window- </p><p>sills, Northwesters and Free-Traders to- </p><p>gether in wild flight. In strange anomaly, </p><p>armed men backing away from men only </p><p>partly armed, the Hudson’s Bay force gave </p><p>them the right of way. Weapons could </p><p>hold domination over them penned within </p><p>walls but not as a mad horde here in the </p><p>open where a hand grip might prove more </p><p>deadly than a bullet. </p><p> “Shoot!” Dentaire shrieked crazily.</p><p>“Shoot if you have the thought to keep us. </p><p>You may kill one, two, six, a dozen, but </p><p>I swear by the Virgin that the rest will lay </p><p>the plague on you with their fingers! Come </p><p>on, mes camarades, come on!” </p><p> “The demented fool!” denounced Carlisle</p><p>helplessly. “The whole mob of demented </p><p>fools! Hold your fire, men. The idiot </p><p>means what he says.” </p><p> The rush passed them, some making for</p><p>the gate, some for the shed next the store </p><p>where the snow-shoes and toboggans were </p><p>kept. Galt had managed to wedge the </p><p>gate bar so that it could not be withdrawn, </p><p>but the crazed mob was not to be denied. </p><p>Mar.y climbed up on the palisades to the</p><p>top of the gate. Many more groveled in </p><p>the snow at the bottom, worming their </p><p>shoulders under the heavy barrier. With </p><p>a united heave they tore the gate bodily </p><p>from its hinges and hurled it aside. </p><p> Meanwhile their comrades had cast down</p><p>the toboggans, thrown on the grub-bags </p><p>from the store, seized their snow-shoes and </p><p>rushed to join them. Together the two </p><p>sections surged through the gateway, North- </p><p>westers and Free-Traders still mingled, all </p><p>Richelieu’s Frenchmen and post Indians, </p><p>all Wayne’s men of the Missouri, men of the </p><p>Mississippi, men of the Red, his Crees and </p><p>Chippewayans—the whole crowd that had </p><p>been drinking with the Northwesters that </p><p>day. </p><p> Their panic seemed to increase as they</p><p>ran. They strained forward, bound for </p><p>immunity wherever they might find it, </p><p>falling over each other upon the aurora* </p><p>lighted snows till they disappeared into </p><p>the black mystery of the surrounding </p><p>forest. </p><p>EXCEPT the Hudson’s Bay forces, </p><p>none remained in the yard but </p><p>Richelieu whom Andrews and </p><p>Wayne had carried out and laid down within </p><p>the light and heat of the fire, Wayne him- </p><p>self, Mason, Murdock and the three sober </p><p>Free-Traders. Having contracted the dis- </p><p>ease one Summer while doctoring Indian </p><p>camps on Eabamet Lake, Andrews, like </p><p>Wayne, had no fear of contamination him- </p><p>self, yet he was careful to keep his patient </p><p>apart from the others. </p><p> Although Richelieu stirred from time to</p><p>time, he had never opened his lips or his </p><p>eyes. Upon his forehead, close up to the </p><p>hair, the priest could discern a large bruise </p><p>where he had evidently struck his head </p><p>against the gate in falling. </p><p> “The head blow is the cause of his un-</p><p>consciousness rather than the neck wound,” </p><p>Andrews pointed out to Carlisle and the </p><p>others who came peering from a respectful </p><p>distance. “Where shall we take him, Paul? </p><p>Is there any chance of saving the other </p><p>buildings?” </p><p> “Not the slightest chance,” Carlisle de-</p><p>cided. “We’ll do well if we keep the fire in-</p><p>side the palisades. We don’t want it to </p><p>get into that fringe of trees and ’round </p><p>through the forest to the other posts. </p><p>Richelieu must stay wliere he is for a little. </p><p>He’ll not be cold in this heat.” </p><p> “You won’t risk trying to get anything</p><p>out, Paul—the supplies or the furs?” asked </p><p>Joan anxiously. </p><p> Carlisle shook his head grimly.</p><p> “No, the risk’s too great! They’ve been</p><p>handling the food and pelts, you see. We </p><p>daren’t touch anything, but I think we’ll </p><p>level the store and fur house to hold the </p><p>flames as low as possible.” </p><p>54 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> He ran outside the palisades with Galt,</p><p>Drummond and others and came back </p><p>bearing long trunks of young spruce that </p><p>had been drawn up from the woods for fuel. </p><p>These were five or six inches through and </p><p>stripped of their branches, of a fit size to </p><p>be handled as battering rams. </p><p> The mess building was all a-roar, throb-</p><p>bing on the night like the fire-pit of some </p><p>gigantic engine, belching flame through </p><p>windows and door and the roof that was </p><p>commencing to sag. </p><p>' The heat was terrific, lance-like, unbear- </p><p>able upon the uncovered flesh, but with the </p><p>hoods of their capotes puckered tight to </p><p>shield their faces from the flames, Carlisle </p><p>and his men crept up to the buildings with </p><p>the long spruce trunks in their gauntleted </p><p>hands. </p><p> With swing and prod, swing and prod</p><p>they battered off the already burning roof </p><p>troughs of the fur room, exposing the top </p><p>logs which they began to rattle down tier </p><p>by tier, but the fire was quicker than they. </p><p> It caught on the walls and beams and</p><p>the pelts that hung thereon, and the flare </p><p>of the greasy fats shot fifty feet in the air. </p><p> “What a waste!” deplored Joan, as</p><p>Carlisle and the men were forced to fall </p><p>back from the geyser of flame. “What a </p><p>waste of splendid fur!” </p><p> “Yes, but it couldn’t be otherwise,” ob-</p><p>served Carlisle. “We couldn’t have saved </p><p>it even if we had wanted to. The heat’s </p><p>enough to shrivel one!” </p><p> Still it was with a qualm of regret that he</p><p>gazed over his shoulder as he rushed in </p><p>again toward the store. Mink, marten, </p><p>otter, ermine, costly, beautiful, blazed and </p><p>wrinkled before his eyes; rare silver and </p><p>black-fox skins singed and smouldered, the </p><p>silky fur curling up like downy feathers to </p><p>the licking flame. He saw it as desecration, </p><p>as profanation, as a crime against the en- </p><p>during wild—and all the handiwork of the </p><p>panic-stricken Dentaire! </p><p> The roof of the store he got off before the</p><p>fire reached it. The wall logs thundered </p><p>down amid clanking showers of cooking </p><p>utensils, knives, axes and other trade-stuff </p><p>from the shelves, his own trade-stuff that </p><p>Richelieu had captured in his York boats. </p><p>Piled upon the floor, standing revealed un- </p><p>der the fire’s glare, showed his own food </p><p>supplies captured at the same time along </p><p>with the trade-stuff. </p><p> “There were greases in the supplies,</p><p>Galt,” he told his chief-trader, “pork and </p><p>such, and some kegs of powder that might </p><p>be dangerous. Pass the kegs along as I </p><p>shove them out.” </p><p> One by one with his pole butt he rolled</p><p>the barrels and kegs off the floor, and they </p><p>were prodded far back into the snow beyond </p><p>the fire zone. Then he pushed down the </p><p>top tier of the flour bags, stacked in layers </p><p>of four. Three of the sacks fell with solid, </p><p>dusty thuds. The fourth struck lightly </p><p>and bounced to the feet of Galt. </p><p> “What’s that, Henry?” asked Carlisle.</p><p>“Not heavy enough for flour, is it?” </p><p> The chief-trader stooped and scrutinized</p><p>it by the brilliant light, discerning a canvas </p><p>dunnage bag with drawstrings in its mouth. </p><p>It bore the customary marking H. B. C., </p><p>and as Galt turned it over with his pole </p><p>the name “Cotameg” stared him in the face. </p><p> “By Nenaubosho (the Cree Evil</p><p>Spirit)!” he exclaimed. “It’s the Chippe- </p><p>wa’s gear-bag, Factor. Piled in by mistake </p><p>among the flour sacks when they captured </p><p>your boats!” </p><p> “By Jove, Galt, is that so?” cried Carlisle,</p><p>coming over to look. “Unlucky Cotameg! </p><p>You buried him without his gear, eh?” </p><p> “We had to,” declared Galt. “We</p><p>couldn’t find liis gear, and I guess it was </p><p>here alUthe time.” </p><p> With a thud of his pole he broke the</p><p>drawstrings in the mouth of the bag, </p><p>thrust the end of the pole into the open </p><p>mouth and shook it. Out rolled worn moc- </p><p>casins, soiled trousers of buckskin, frowsy </p><p>parfleches of a filthiness unimaginable. </p><p> “Shades of bold Rupert!” blurted Car-</p><p>lisle. “I didn’t know he was as dirty as all </p><p>that. Is that the only gear he owned?” </p><p>But Galt’s eyes were brighter than Car- </p><p>lisle had ever seen eyes of Cree shading. </p><p>His face was more violently astounded than </p><p>Carlisle had ever beheld a face of Cree casting. </p><p> “It’s—it’s not Cotameg’s,” he stammered,</p><p>even his voice losing the unemotional timbre </p><p>of his mother’s tongue. “It’s old White </p><p>Loon’s and his family’s—the smallpox </p><p>Indians I stopped from coming in to Cum- </p><p>berland House!” </p><p> “By heavens, Galt, are you sure?”</p><p>bellowed Carlisle. </p><p> “Sure? Didn’t I stand and see them strip</p><p>it off at my orders? There are five moc- </p><p>casins, all of different sizes. White Loon </p><p>had two sons, a nephew and a cousin with </p><p>him, you remember! </p><p>Ambush </p><p>55 </p><p> “Besides, I went out to drop a few trees on</p><p>their camp and burn it at the first snow </p><p>when there was no danger of firing the forest, </p><p>but the clothes were gone. I put the theft </p><p>down to the sneaky wolverines, set fire to </p><p>the teepee and thought no more about it.” </p><p>“But, Galt, Cotameg didn’t take and </p><p>put them in his gear-bag. You under- </p><p>stand Indians, and you know no Indian </p><p>born would go near the smallpox camp at </p><p>Carcajou Cove, much less lay a hand on </p><p>anything there.” </p><p> “I know,” nodded Galt, pushing bag and</p><p>all back into the fire. “It was no Indian </p><p>who put them in Cotameg’s bag. It was </p><p>a white man, a white man with the iron </p><p>nerve of the devil.” </p><p> “Then who was that white man?” pro-</p><p>pounded Carlisle. </p><p>TO the chief-trader he put the ques- </p><p>tion, to Eugene Drummond and </p><p>all the Hudson’s Bay forces behind, </p><p>to Joan hovering as near as the flames </p><p>would let her, to Wayne and his five faith- </p><p>fuls grouped by themselves off to one side. </p><p> They stared at him unanswering, stricken</p><p>dumb by the horrible enormity of the thing, </p><p>and as he looked into their eyes, recollec- </p><p>tions of many past incidents flashed un- </p><p>bidden through Carlisle’s mind. </p><p> He remembered that it was Cotameg who</p><p>had let the Northwest mail-courier Bertand </p><p>escape into Grande Portage, remembered </p><p>Cotameg’s frequent absences from Cumber- </p><p>land House, his delay in coming in to the </p><p>post from his fishing upon the morning he </p><p>wanted to send him to the Pas, and the fact </p><p>that Richelieu know he had sent for his </p><p>York boats and was on the watch for their </p><p>coming. </p><p> “I see it now!” he burst out suddenly.</p><p>“Cotameg was in Richelieu’s pay from the </p><p>first. The Chippewa must have been at </p><p>the Northwest post that Sunday morning </p><p>I sent him and Smoking Pine down-river, </p><p>and that’s when his gear-bag was filled un- </p><p>known to him. It was a plan to turn the </p><p>plague loose in Cumberland House, but in </p><p>the ways of the North the bag came back</p><p>untouched to the one who filled it.” </p><p> “My God, Paul,” cried Joan shuddering,</p><p>“how could any man do that?” </p><p> “He ain’t wan man,” put in Drummond</p><p>promptly. “He be wan fiamin’ diable, an’ </p><p>if I be had ma way, I’m would t’row heem </p><p>back into de fire w’ere he be come from.” </p><p> “That’s the way to talk, Drummond,”</p><p>supported Wayne. “It’s only what he </p><p>deserves.” </p><p> “Maybe there’s worse than fire in store</p><p>for him,” reminded Andrews, prophetically. </p><p>“He’s fully conscious now, Paul. His eyes </p><p>are open.” </p><p> Richelieu awoke in a daze, raising him-</p><p>self up on his elbow and staring at the blaz- </p><p>ing walls which had burned low enough to </p><p>allow the Hudson’s Bay men to dart in and </p><p>scoop snow upon the flames with their long </p><p>snow-shoes used as shovels. </p><p> “Name of a name!” he blurted, unable to</p><p>comprehend the crimson glare, the shoveling </p><p>figures of the men and the hiss of the snow </p><p>masses smothering the fire. “I dreamed </p><p>I was on the brink of hell. Comment? </p><p>Has my dream come true?” </p><p> “Partly,” explained Carlisle, grimly strid-</p><p>ing over to him. “Your men set fire to your </p><p>post and scattered to the thirty-two points </p><p>of the North when they heard you had </p><p>smallpox!” </p><p> “Smallpox!” echoed Richelieu unbeliev-</p><p>ingly. </p><p> “Yes, the Red Death! Cotameg’s dun-</p><p>nage-bag came back to you among the food- </p><p>sacks.” </p><p> Richelieu’s lips parted stiffly, but Carlisle</p><p>poised his moccasined foot as if to spurn </p><p>him into the dying conflagration. </p><p> “Don’t say a word, Richelieu!” he warned</p><p>passionately. “Not a cursed word or in </p><p>you go!” </p><p> Richelieu closed his lips again, and Car-</p><p>lisle dropped his foot. </p><p> “I guess we’ll get a toboggan and run</p><p>him across to Cumberland House,” he told </p><p>Andrews. “Eugene, run and fetch it. I’ll </p><p>set aside one of my buildings for him alone.” </p><p> “Condemnation, no you won’t, Carlisle!”</p><p>expostulated Wayne. “I’ve no love for you </p><p>as I said, but I’m a white man. None of </p><p>your Hudson’s Bay traders have been ex- </p><p>posed to infection. We six Free-Traders </p><p>have. Besides, I’ve had it. Andrews has </p><p>had it. So we’ll take Andrews and Richelieu </p><p>to Fort Wayne with us. Richelieu can be </p><p>put in the fur house. We’ll use the trading- </p><p>room, and Andrews may have my own </p><p>quarters.” </p><p> “By Jove, you are a white man, Wayne!”</p><p>accepted Carlisle, his face lighting up. </p><p>“I wouldn’t have asked it of you, but I </p><p>take your offer in the spirit in which it’s </p><p>given.” </p><p>56 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “There’s a little selfishness in it,” Wayne</p><p>confessed. “I would go crazy if Joan were </p><p>near any infection, and you’ll have to give </p><p>her quarters at Cumberland House. Send </p><p>your men over now to my post for her stuff </p><p>and the furs and everything but the bare </p><p>necessities we’ll use. They can gut the </p><p>buildings before we go into them. And </p><p>about the furs, you’ll keep them in trust </p><p>only, so that there will be no trouble over </p><p>them!” </p><p> “All right,” agreed Carlisle heartily,</p><p>hastening to issue his orders and to direct </p><p>Drummond to place the toboggan he had </p><p>brought so that Richelieu might roll onto </p><p>it. “And, Wayne, I’ll leave you a load of </p><p>provisions at your palisade gate.” </p><p> “Thanks,” nodded Wayne. “I’ll take</p><p>them in the spirit they’re given.” </p><p> He passed with his five Free-Traders</p><p>through the gateway. Andrews, Drum- </p><p>mond, Galt and the other Hudson’s Bay </p><p>men followed after, drawing Richelieu upon </p><p>the toboggan. Carlisle turned from a last </p><p>inspection of the smoking post ruins and </p><p>gave Joan his hand for the run across the </p><p>snows to Cumberland House. </p><p> “We, too, are in isolation,” he observed</p><p>with a whimsical laugh. “Do you happen </p><p>to care, Joan?” </p><p> She gave him a tantalizing smile as they</p><p>raced side by side. </p><p> “As long as I can go to my father’s</p><p>stockade every day, talk to him and know </p><p>that he is all right, I—why, I expect to be </p><p>very comfortable in Cumberland House,” </p><p>she evaded naively. “And do you know </p><p>what I’m going to make you do the very </p><p>minute we get there, Paul?” </p><p> “What?” he challenged.</p><p> “Cook me a full course-dinner!” Joan</p><p>decreed. </p><p>CHAPTER XI </p><p>OOCHEMEGOU KESIGOW </p><p>THE full tale of the flight of the Sturgeon </p><p>Lake Northwesters and Free-Traders </p><p>did not come down the Saskatchewan to </p><p>Carlisle for several weeks. Christmas Day </p><p>passed without the arrival of any of his </p><p>Indian trappers, but about three o’clock on </p><p>New Year’s Day the jingle of bells brought </p><p>him and Joan running to the door. </p><p> A grand Cree cavalcade they beheld, to-</p><p>boggans and carioles drawn by gaily capa- </p><p>risoned dogs with bead-worked blankets on </p><p>their backs and bells upon their collars. Pot- </p><p>tering in the rear, the squaws drove the </p><p>teams with the duffle, children and furs </p><p>packed into the carioles, but the hunters </p><p>sped in front, gorgeous in their new capotes </p><p>and leggings fringed with porcupine quills. </p><p> At Carlisle’s beckoning they trooped up</p><p>to the steps where he stood, led by old </p><p>Soaring Eagle, a chief of the tribes and one </p><p>of the best fur-takers on his books. </p><p> “It is Oochemegou Kesigow—the New</p><p>Year’s—the Kissing Day of the Crees, when </p><p>every man is supposed to kiss every woman </p><p>in sight— Factor,” Soaring Eagle greeted, </p><p>“and we are here according to our custom.” </p><p>“That is good, Soaring Eagle?” returned </p><p>Carlisle gravely, albeit there was a twinkle </p><p>in his eye as his glance met Joan’s. “There </p><p>is a gift for each one of you at the store when </p><p>you trade your furs. How was the catch?” </p><p>“We took much fur, Factor,” reported </p><p>Soaring Eagle, “but we will take no more </p><p>in that upper country. After the trade and </p><p>feast we will hunt toward the Wenipak. </p><p>The Red Death is raging yonder, and we </p><p>fear it stalking through our teepees.” </p><p> “Where, Soaring Eagle?” demanded Joan</p><p>anxiously. “Where is it raging?” </p><p> “Where roams the wind, Golden Daugh-</p><p>ter? Where fall the forest leaves? The </p><p>Red Death is killing out the posts and tribes </p><p>of the French Company and the Free- </p><p>Trading men as red fire runs among the </p><p>trees. So my far-journeying tribesmen </p><p>bring the word.” </p><p> “It hasn’t got among our own Indians,</p><p>then, or into our own posts?” asked Carlisle </p><p>with concern. </p><p> “No,” declared Soaring Eagle, “for the</p><p>struggle among the companies has been </p><p>bitter and nothing but rifle balls has passed </p><p>between. But the tribes of the Hudson’s </p><p>Bay Company in the other districts are </p><p>fearful even as we. They are fleeing from </p><p>the Red Death, going east toward James </p><p>Bay, south upon the prairie or north to the </p><p>Barren Lands.” </p><p> “Heavens!” ejaculated Carlisle. “That</p><p>means the closing of those posts. Are there </p><p>no districts free from it at all?” </p><p> “The tales of the Indian runners say that</p><p>it has not spread as far as Fort des Prairies </p><p>yet nor to the Athabasca, but that all posts </p><p>are closed against newcomers.” </p><p> Carlisle pointed toward Richelieu’s dis-</p><p>mantled post. </p><p>Ambush </p><p>57 </p><p> “There’s where the Red Death started,</p><p>Soaring Eagle,” he informed. </p><p> “So ran the story of those who fled among</p><p>the Indians and posts of the other districts,” </p><p>nodded the old chief. </p><p> “And there,” went on Carlisle, point-</p><p>ing to Fort Wayne, “the Northwest leader </p><p>is sick with it. There the Free-Trade leader </p><p>watches by the bed of Mason, the only one </p><p>left alive of five faithful men. There our </p><p>praying man is with them, all under the </p><p>plague.” </p><p> “So,” nodded Soaring Eagle, unmoved.</p><p> “You are not afraid?”</p><p> “I am not afraid, Factor. If it was not</p><p>good for us to come, you would have sent </p><p>a runner to warn us. We are here, and after </p><p>the feast we trail to the Wenipak.” </p><p> “It is well,” concluded Carlisle. “Go to</p><p>the store now and Galt will give you your </p><p>gifts.” </p><p> “It is Oochemegou Kesigow,” reminded</p><p>Soaring Eagle, looking at Joan. </p><p> Carlisle’s eyes twinkled again, but Joan</p><p>was equal to the occasion. </p><p> “I kiss you all,” she spoke tacitly in Cree,</p><p>touching her finger-tips to her lips and toss- </p><p>ing them the caress. </p><p> Soaring Eagle and the others gravely</p><p>acknowledged the salute, catching the kiss </p><p>in mid-air on their own finger-tips and carry- </p><p>it to their mouths; then they stalked off to </p><p>the store. </p><p>CARLISLE backed hastily indoors </p><p>under Joan’s indignant assault. </p><p>“You wanted him to say it,” she </p><p>accused. “Just wait till you have to salute </p><p>all the greasy squaws! But, seriously, Paul, </p><p>isn’t it horrible news?” </p><p> “It’s very bad,” admitted Carlisle with</p><p>a shake of his head. “Yet don’t let it spoil </p><p>our New Year’s dinner, Joan. I wouldn’t </p><p>care about myself, but I want Lewis and the</p><p>men of the other posts to enjoy themselves. </p><p>You see it’s the only break for them in the </p><p>whole Winter.” </p><p> “I won’t let the news spoil it,” she prom-</p><p>ised. “Though there’s fear in my heart!” </p><p>“Fear of what?” </p><p> “Fear that it means the end of my father’s</p><p>already shaken power!” </p><p> “I don’t know,” Carlisle deftly hedged.</p><p>“I can’t tell anything about it till I get word </p><p>how things stand in the other districts from </p><p>official quarters. The governor promised </p><p>when I left James Bay to have a message </p><p>routed through before Spring to let me know </p><p>the exact situation. But hurry, Joan. It </p><p>will soon be dark, and the men will be over </p><p>from the store.” </p><p> Joan hastened about, directing the work</p><p>of the two young Cree maids in the kitchen, </p><p>putting the finishing touches upon her New </p><p>Year’s dinner spread upon the long table in </p><p>the Factor’s council-room, and while he </p><p>watched her gliding about, Carlisle mar- </p><p>veled at the miracle of a woman’s touch </p><p>in softening the bare austerity of his former </p><p>quarters. </p><p> He had given the house up to her entirely</p><p>since the night Richelieu’s post was wrecked </p><p>and the rest went to Fort Wayne, to do with </p><p>it what she willed. </p><p> He himself had taken business and sleep-</p><p>ing quarters in Galt’s trading-room with </p><p>Galt and Drummond, and it was ever a </p><p>source of pleasure to them to pass from that </p><p>rough environment into this newly conse- </p><p>crated feminine sphere for their meals or to </p><p>spend the long, storm-bitten Winter evenings </p><p>before the roaring birch logs of the fireplace. </p><p> The possessions transferred from Fort</p><p>Wayne before it went under quarantine </p><p>she had used to garnish Cumberland House. </p><p>Formerly Carlisle’s council-room contained </p><p>nothing but table and chairs, guiltless of </p><p>any adornment. Now the bate planks of </p><p>the floor were hidden under a plethora of </p><p>fur rugs, skins of the wolf, lynx, black and </p><p>grizzly bears; the bare walls were covered </p><p>with curios, weapons of the savage tribes, </p><p>antlers of the red deer, moose and caribou, </p><p>horns of mountain-sheep and musk-ox.</p><p> Her cushions, filled with downy wild-</p><p>goose feathers, covered with leather in </p><p>colored patterns and trimmed with Indian </p><p>bead-work, padded the chairs. Her couch, </p><p>luxuriously fur-robed, invited lounging by </p><p>the fireplace; her pictures decorated the </p><p>mantel above. </p><p> In one corner stood her harpsichord</p><p>brought in by the Red River route from St. </p><p>Paul. While upon a shelved cabinet beside </p><p>was piled her music and her library, a col- </p><p>lection begun while schooling at St. Paul and </p><p>added to at every opportunity—*history, </p><p>travel, poetry, French and Spanish novels </p><p>which she read in the original. </p><p> Upon the table she hovered over in the</p><p>deepening dusk of the room was arrayed </p><p>her cherished linen, flat silverware, china, </p><p>the magnificent silver tea-service and tall </p><p>brass candelabra. </p><p>58 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> The latter she filled with candles, and as</p><p>she lighted them, the Hudson’s Bay officers </p><p>came tramping over from the store, Drum- </p><p>mond, Galt, Lewis in from the Pas, Lea </p><p>from the Nepowin, Garry from Moose Lake, </p><p>Hampton from Chimawawin, Jarvis from </p><p>Grand Rapids, Wells from the Seepanock </p><p>Channel. </p><p> “Bon soir, Mademoiselle Wayne,” greet-</p><p>ed Drummond, opening the door in the </p><p>lead, his volatile face a-quiver with sup- </p><p>pressed merriment. “Wan happy New </p><p>Year to you, an’ I’m wondaire if you re- </p><p>membaire dis day be Oochemegou Kesi- </p><p>gow?” </p><p> “ Soaring Eagle told you, Eugene, ”</p><p>flashed Joan intuitively, breaking into </p><p>laughter with them all. “But it shall never </p><p>be said that I did less for white men than </p><p>for red. You may kiss my hand, sir.” </p><p> With the air of an old-world courtier</p><p>Drummond bent over it, then all his com- </p><p>panions, and Joan with a queenly gesture </p><p>waved them to the table. </p><p> “The feast is ready; be seated, gentle-</p><p>men,” she directed. </p><p> She took her stately place behind the</p><p>silver tea-service. Carlisle took his opposite </p><p>her, beyond the branching candelabra, at </p><p>the foot of the table, and the other officers </p><p>ranged themselves on either side. Under </p><p>the mellow candlelight they dined like true </p><p>lords of the North in the presence of a </p><p>gracious lady. </p><p> Course by course the quiet-footed Cree</p><p>maids served the meal—soup of delicious </p><p>moose meat, stewed ptarmigan breasts </p><p>garnished with forest herbs, fish course of </p><p>flaky lake trout, the savory dressed goose, </p><p>the Christmas pudding and cake and the </p><p>wines of Sicily and Madeira. </p><p>Illllll THEN while the men lighted the </p><p>llllll fragrant Company tobacco in their </p><p>pipes, Joan stole away to her instru- </p><p>ment, playing soft, dreamy airs that wafted </p><p>like Summer winds through the hazy in- </p><p>cense of the room. As they smoked and </p><p>listened, the officers gave their brief verbal</p><p>reports to Carlisle, so much fur taken in </p><p>trade, this and that incident in the post </p><p>routine, such and such friction with the ad- </p><p>herents of the rival companies. </p><p> Succinctly Garry told how a vagrant party</p><p>of Free-Traders sacked two of his fur trains </p><p>on Moose Lake. Lea described the looting </p><p>of his Nepowin post by a tribe of the French </p><p>Company’s Indians and his struggle to save </p><p>the greater part of the fur which he had </p><p>managed to cache safely on the Saskatche- </p><p>wan by the mouth of Ptarmigan Creek. </p><p> Wells related how he had captured a</p><p>Northwest guide forerouteing the See- </p><p>panock Channel for brigades in the Spring </p><p>and sent him southward on La Longue </p><p>Traverse to the Assiniboine. </p><p> “But never fear, zur,” Wells concluded</p><p>in his broad wheeze, “they zhan’t get </p><p>through there. I will zee to’t.” </p><p> Their tones were low so as not to raise</p><p>discord in the music’s harmony. Joan’s </p><p>playing was zephyr-like, unobtrusive as </p><p>meditation, so as not to break the thread of </p><p>their council. But as the talk lagged and </p><p>lapsed, her music increased in volume, and </p><p>the men heard the airs of their own lands </p><p>swelling in their ears. </p><p> With magic interpretation she played</p><p>them back to those lands, to the rugged </p><p>Highlands, the English downs, the vineyards </p><p>of sunny France. Their battle chants, their </p><p>hymns of unction, their folk legends, their </p><p>hearth songs, the songs that never die she </p><p>played them, and their hearts went out </p><p>to their far-off homes. </p><p> Galt drove an imaginary paddle down to</p><p>the Sault, home of the white adventurer </p><p>who had fathered him and his old mother </p><p>of the Crees. Drummond lay sun-basking </p><p>under the loom of the Pyrenees on the banks </p><p>of the River Adour. Garry and Lea trod </p><p>again their beloved Inverness and Cro- </p><p>marty. Hampton climbed his Devon hills. </p><p>Jarvis saw and heard the color and rattle of </p><p>London. Wells stood under the waving </p><p>trees upon the green lawns of the Squire’s </p><p>house. Lewis watched with his aged eyes </p><p>the gray seas breaking upon the foamy crags </p><p>which whelped him, in his nostrils the salted </p><p>fog, in his soul the void that runs:</p><p>From the dim shielding of the misty island </p><p>Mountains divide us and a world of seas, </p><p>But still ours hearts are true, our hearts are Highland, </p><p> And we in dreams behold the Hebrides.</p><p> On and on she played while they drifted</p><p>in their dreams and Carlisle lay back in his </p><p>chair before the fireplace watching her </p><p>through the blue wreaths of his pipe smoke. </p><p>Ethereal, intangible she seemed through the </p><p>blur, the candlelight filtering softly on her </p><p>spun-gold hair and golden satin dress and </p><p>striking the facets of a few choice rings </p><p>upon her nimble fingers. </p><p>Ambush </p><p>59 </p><p> For him, too, her magic was potent. He</p><p>was a little boy again in the post of Niagara; </p><p>his was the boyish vision of its pageants </p><p>and alarms; and his was the boyish memory </p><p>of his father, tall, straight, handsome in the </p><p>dashing uniform of a captain of the Rangers </p><p>—all in that old day before his mother died. </p><p> When the music ceased they did not know</p><p>it till they saw Joan slipping off the stool and </p><p>coming toward them through the haze. </p><p> “Isn’t it time to start.their dance, Paul?”</p><p>she smiled. “You know I want to take my </p><p>father his own New Year’s dinner very </p><p>soon.” </p><p> “Yes, yes,” assented Carlisle, returning</p><p>from his childhood’s vision and dropping </p><p>his pipe ashes into the birch logs, “we’ll go </p><p>right over and set things going and then </p><p>see about the dinner.” </p><p> He helped her on with the beautiful</p><p>ermine capote, its hood fringed with tails </p><p>of the silver fox, and they followed the men </p><p>across to the store buildings and into the </p><p>trading-room. </p><p> The trading-room was full of whites,</p><p>breeds and Indians of both sexes waiting </p><p>expectantly. They, like Carlisle’s officers, </p><p>had feasted to the full, and now they were </p><p>ready for the merriment. </p><p> The room was cleared for the occasion,</p><p>benches ranged ’round the sides, and the </p><p>walls and ceiling lined with bright red calico </p><p>and hung with the New Year’s decorations </p><p>of evergreens and scarlet swamp berries. </p><p>Upon Galt’s counter were placed three </p><p>chairs for the musicians, high up under the </p><p>burning candles upon the shelves. </p><p> One of these chairs Galt took himself with</p><p>his violin. Drummond and Jarvis climbed </p><p>up on either side of him with bass viol and </p><p>piccolo. The crowd upon the floor at </p><p>Carlisle’s direction resolved itself into coup- </p><p>les, forming a Circassian circle ’round the </p><p>room, and to the vamping of the violin </p><p>strings the dance was on. </p><p> Buoyantly, madly, they danced, all their</p><p>spirits congealed through long, lonely</p><p>months melting instantly in the warmth of </p><p>human companionship and effervescing </p><p>in flourish, laughter and shout. Though </p><p>Carlisle and Joan withdrew after the first </p><p>dance, the gaiety did not pause. They had </p><p>given it the necessary impetus. The feet of </p><p>joyous abandon were loosed. </p><p> While they watched a little, the square</p><p>dances, string dances and round dances </p><p>shuttled in quick succession. The musi- </p><p>cians changed, the instruments changed, </p><p>violin, viol and piccolo giving way to man- </p><p>dolin, tambourine or bagpipes, but the tide </p><p>of music and restless muscles flowed per- </p><p>petually. </p><p> One moment it was Galt leading the</p><p>Feather Dance of the tribes, the next Drum- </p><p>mond banging the tambourine he had learn- </p><p>ed from Iris Spanish neighbors and reeling </p><p>a Spanish whirl, or, again, Lewis strutting </p><p>the length of the room, his droning bag </p><p>under his arm, skirling away on the pipes </p><p>to the Highland steps. </p><p>FROM that carnival of color and </p><p>movement Carlisle and Joan were </p><p>never missed when they stole unos- </p><p>tentatiously back to the Factor’s house. </p><p>The Cree maids had cleared the table, but </p><p>according to Joan’s instructions they had </p><p>reserved a choice portion of each course, </p><p>enough for Wayne and Andrews and Mason </p><p>if he should have the heart to taste the soup </p><p>or nibble a ptarmigan breast. </p><p> It was packed in a large lidded basket</p><p>woven of willow by the Cree weavers, all </p><p>ready to be warmed up and eaten, and </p><p>Carlisle, adding a bottle of wine and a </p><p>canister of tobacco, hung the basket over </p><p>his shoulder by its leather thong. </p><p> The sound of the dance echoed forth from</p><p>the trading-room as they passed by and on </p><p>along the fringe of trees toward the camp- </p><p>fires of the Crees. Here in the shelter of the </p><p>forest all those in from the trap-lines had </p><p>made open bivouac, snow-walled quadran- </p><p>gles scraped to earth, floored with spruce </p><p>boughs and warmed by abundant fires. </p><p> A few old squaws, too old to care for the</p><p>revelry in the post, were tending the fires, </p><p>while’’round the blaze sprawled many groups </p><p>of wolf-dogs, stick-tied to prevent them</p><p>wandering or fighting, lying with feet out- </p><p>stretched to the heat or worming forward </p><p>luxuriously upon their bellies. </p><p> Each team relaxed by themselves, snarl-</p><p>ing defiance at any inquisitive encroacher </p><p>from a strange outfit and baring fangs in </p><p>meteor-like leap and retreat at the end of </p><p>their leashes. On one side of the fire in the </p><p>end quadrangle which they skirted, an </p><p>especially large five-dog team lay by an up- </p><p>ended cariole, and Carlisle pointed them </p><p>out to Joan. </p><p> “Those big Hudson’s Bays are Soaring</p><p>Eagle’s dogs,” he informed her. “Aren’t </p><p>they splendid brutes? They weigh one liun- </p><p>6o </p><p>Adventure </p><p>dred,and fifty pounds apiece, and they’re </p><p>the fastest dogs in my district.” </p><p> The Cree camp-fires winked fainter</p><p>behind them, and they neared the palisades </p><p>of Fort Wayne. Upon the snows in front </p><p>of the entrance they could see a black figure </p><p>pacing up and down and dancing on his </p><p>snow-shoes to keep warm, the Indian guard </p><p>posted there to prevent curious huskies from </p><p>clawing a way under the gate or unwarned </p><p>hunters from inadvertently stumbling into </p><p>the plague. </p><p> “Blow your whistle, Burning Cloud,”</p><p>ordered Carlisle, when the guard challenged. </p><p> Burning Cloud with a grunt of recogni-</p><p>tion complied, sending a shrill screeching </p><p>note through the frosty air, the signal for </p><p>Wayne to come to the entrance. The gate </p><p>had been fitted with an outside bar for </p><p>greater facility in handling, and this Burn- </p><p>ing Cloud withdrew, swinging the barrier </p><p>wide. The yellow blotch of an opened door </p><p>showed in the post, with Wayne’s fur- </p><p>capped head touching the top of the seven- </p><p>foot doorway as he emerged. </p><p> “Paul, are you going to tell him about his</p><p>posts and Indians?” Joan whispered while </p><p>Wayne, wrapped in a big bearskin coat, </p><p>crunched across the yard. </p><p> “I don’t know,” Carlisle replied. “I</p><p>thought I might if he asked. Why?” </p><p>“Don’t tell him,” she pleaded. “You </p><p>know his nature, all gloom and bitterness </p><p>and through no molding of his own! He’s </p><p>had too much to bear already with the cut- </p><p>ting off of his trade, semi-starvation, the loss </p><p>of his post men and this hateful isolation </p><p>here. Now a new calamity would lie like </p><p>a mountain on his spirit to weight him down. </p><p>Please don’t tell him, Paul—yet!” </p><p> “I won’t, then Joan,” he agreed. “You</p><p>know I don’t want to heap trouble on him. </p><p>Hello, Wayne,” calling cheerily to tl.e Free- </p><p>Trader, “a happy New Year to you! That </p><p>sounds like mockery, but I mean as happy </p><p>as the circumstances allow. Thanks to Joan, </p><p>we had a real New Year’s dinner at Cumber- </p><p>land House, and she’s brought you your </p><p>share.”</p><p> He stepped forward in the gateway and</p><p>hung the basket on a wooden pin. </p><p> “The same to you, Carlisle!” greeted</p><p>Wayne with simulated cheerfulness, tak- </p><p>ing the basket down by its thong. “And </p><p>you, girl! I knew you wouldn’t forget me.” </p><p>“No, no, father, I couldn’t forget you, </p><p>and I wish this imprisonment were all over. </p><p>But if you’re going to talk a while, take the </p><p>basket inside first. The food was warm </p><p>when we left, but it will soon freeze.” </p><p> “Yes, it’ll soon freeze,” nodded Wayne</p><p>somewhat absently, “but I’ll take it inside in </p><p>a moment. I wanted to ask about your </p><p>hunters, Carlisle. We saw them making </p><p>in to the post today, and I thought they </p><p>might have heard some news of my own men </p><p>from my Indians. Were they in touch with </p><p>my tribes at all?” </p><p> “No,” answered Carlisle truthfully</p><p>enough, “my hunters haven’t been in </p><p>touch with your Indians. They didn’t pass </p><p>any word with them or with the North- </p><p>westers’ tribes.” </p><p> “Ah!” sighed Wayne in disappointment.</p><p>“I didn’t know. I thought perhaps they </p><p>might have. But no matter, I’ll send them </p><p>word that the plague will soon be over and </p><p>they’ll be in shortly with their fur.” </p><p>“Mason’s getting better, then, father?” </p><p>cried Joan eagerly. “I’m so glad!” </p><p> “Better?” echoed Wayne with a gloomy</p><p>shake of his head. “He died at dark!” </p><p>“High heaven!” breathed Carlisle, while </p><p>Joan clutched his arm with a sob trembling </p><p>in her throat. “That’s hard, Wayne. </p><p>That’s too abominably hard—the last of </p><p>your five!” </p><p> “Condemnation, yes!” exlaimed Wayne,</p><p>a wave of rebellious despair rising through </p><p>his gloomy apathy. “Why couldn’t the </p><p>plague have taken some of those treacherous </p><p>curs who ran away and left me my five true </p><p>men? By the Doom, Carlisle, I sometimes </p><p>wonder if there is any-” </p><p> “Hush, father, don’t say that!” beseeched</p><p>Joan, divining what was in his mind. </p><p> “What about Richelieu?” asked Carlisle</p><p>by way of diversion. “Is he getting along </p><p>as well as he was?” </p><p> “Yes, he is.

You’ll have time </p><p>to eat your dinner before we’re ready.” </p><p>“Thanks, Carlisle. I haven’t much appe- </p><p>tite, but I can’t refuse what my girl has </p><p>prepared. And you’d better stay at the </p><p>post, Joan. You’d better not come into the </p><p>forest.

I </p><p>loved them all, just as you did.” </p><p> “Well, well, whatever you think, girl!”</p><p>he nodded, turning back into the post. “In </p><p>about an hour or so!” </p><p>THE dance was swinging, the music </p><p>thrilling, vibrant, lusty, care-free </p><p>when Carlisle and Joan returned to </p><p>the trading-room of Cumberland House, but </p><p>a word to Galt and the shuffling feet stilled, </p><p>the violins ceased with a whine of protest. </p><p> Seizing their outer garments, the men</p><p>followed the chief trader, many taking </p><p>torches and axes from the store. Lewis, </p><p>at Carlisle’s request, put his bagpipes under </p><p>his arm, and all poured out across the snow </p><p>to the big clearing in the woods where the </p><p>Winter’s fuel had been gathered. </p><p> There they set to work under Galt, lay-</p><p>ing dry branches in layers, each layer cross- </p><p>ing at right angles the one beneath as in the </p><p>end towers of the near-by piles of cordwood. </p><p>Upon the branches they heaped the cord- </p><p>wood itself, lengths of dry, dead birch and </p><p>resinous pine, slivery, pitch-soaked, ex- </p><p>tremely inflammable, bulking hugely high </p><p>above men’s heads. </p><p> When the work was nearly finished Joan</p><p>and Carlisle crossed to the gate of the Free-</p><p>Trade post to tell Wayne all was ready, but </p><p>he and Andrews were at that moment </p><p>coming out of the fur-house doorway which </p><p>Richelieu held open for them. </p><p> The Northwester could see the two at the</p><p>entrance, but he offered no greeting. </p><p>Silently he held the door out of the way and </p><p>shambled up the steps, with an ax handle </p><p>used as a cane to support his weak limbs; </p><p>closing the door again when Wayne and </p><p>Andrews inched forth their pole stretcher </p><p>with the long, still figure upon it. </p><p> “Is he coming, father?” whispered Joan.</p><p> “No, thank Heaven!” gritted Wayne.</p><p>“He says it’s too cold and too far for him to </p><p>walk.” </p><p> Five times they made the out trip, four</p><p>times the back trip, before the row of bodies </p><p>upon the pile of cordwood was complete. </p><p>Then Carlisle’s men touched torches to the </p><p>bottom branches in many places and step- </p><p>ped back as Andrews began to read the </p><p>burial service. </p><p> The flames mounted and grew, redden-</p><p>ing the snow, silhouetting the forest trees, </p><p>painting the white and Indian faces staring </p><p>up at the five fever-shattered, pox-pitted, </p><p>rigescent bodies of men who had been true. </p><p> The world turned back a thousand years,</p><p>and like a pagan crowd of ancients the </p><p>motley horde of Northmen watched the </p><p>funeral pyre blaze. Men and women alike </p><p>thronged about, all of Cumberland House, </p><p>all of the Cree Tribes, even the old squaws </p><p>whose mission it was to tend the fires in the </p><p>bivouacs. The only two souls missing were </p><p>Richelieu shut up alone in Fort Wayne </p><p>and Burning Cloud guarding its open gate. </p><p> Andrews’ “Amen” rang out sonorously.</p><p>Across the momentary silence that followed </p><p>trembled the throbbing of the fire, Joan’s </p><p>stifled sobbing, the weird of Lewis’ dirge, </p><p>the wailing death chant of the Cree women, </p><p>while overhead sounded the solemn harp of </p><p>the aurora, some unseen Hand pulsating </p><p>its golden strings! </p><p> “Hoo—ah—h—h! Hoo—ah—h—h!” the</p><p>squaws quavered. </p><p> They mourned these true men as they</p><p>mourned their own dead of the tribes, and </p><p>their wailing shrilled eerily in the ears of </p><p>Wayne and Andrews, of Joan and Carlisle, </p><p>plodding back in pairs toward Fort Wayne. </p><p>fipSSRg OF THE four Carlisle was the most </p><p>mentally alert. His was the first </p><p>observant glimpse of the Fort Wayne </p><p>gate, and as he glimpsed it, he gave a star- </p><p>tled exclamation and leaped forward in front </p><p>of the others. No tall dark form showed in </p><p>sentinel pose in the opening, but prone upon </p><p>the snow lay the sprawling figure of a man. </p><p> “Burning Cloud!” burst out Carlisle as</p><p>he bent over and examined him. “Stunned </p><p>with an ax handle. Look—there it is beside </p><p>him in the snow!” </p><p>A </p><p>6 2 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “By the Doom!” exploded Wayne, rush-</p><p>ing up with the rest. “It’s Richelieu’s </p><p>work. The shamming skunk! Too cold for </p><p>him to go into the forest! Too far to walk, </p><p>eh? Condemnation, he’s been biding his </p><p>time, just waiting his chance, Carlisle, and </p><p>I’ve given it to him.” </p><p> “But where under the dome of heaven</p><p>does he hope to hide, Paul?” demanded </p><p>Andrews breathlessly. </p><p> Carlisle was reading the signs. He saw</p><p>where Burning Cloud had been standing </p><p>upon a drift, the toes of his snow-shoes </p><p>pointing forestward, no doubt staring at the </p><p>distant glare of the funeral pyre and listen- </p><p>ing to the death chant of his people when he </p><p>was struck down by a blow from behind. </p><p> His rifle and snow-shoes were gone, and</p><p>Carlisle, bent double as he scanned the crust, </p><p>nosed about like a hound to find the tracks </p><p>of the shoes striking out from the muddle </p><p>of prints about the gateway. </p><p> They were the long, slim shoes of the</p><p>Cree runner. There had been no others like </p><p>them near Fort Wayne that day, and pres- </p><p>ently Carlisle discovered where they had </p><p>struck the softer snows in a scent-breaking, </p><p>fifteen-foot jump out from the packed area </p><p>about the entrance. </p><p> “No weak man’s jump, that!” he pointed</p><p>out to the rest. “And those strides aren’t </p><p>the strides of a weak man, either!” </p><p> He indicated the marks of Richelieu’s</p><p>shoes where the Northwester had run upon </p><p>the tracks he and Joan had made in coming </p><p>over from Cumberland House. It was plain </p><p>that Richelieu’s purpose had been to con- </p><p>fuse trails and throw any tracker off the </p><p>scent, but Carlisle was never at fault. </p><p> He skimmed rapidly ahead, Joan glid-</p><p>ing at his side, Wayne and Andrews keep- </p><p>ing their distance farther back but equally </p><p>anxious to see the results of the trailing. </p><p> The tracks led straight toward the Cree</p><p>bivouacs, toward the snow-walled quadran- </p><p>gles glowing pink under the blazing fires </p><p>within.</p><p> “He’s hiding in the teepees somewhere,</p><p>Joan,” breathed Carlisle, “waiting till the </p><p>woods are clear. You’d better drop back. </p><p>He’s armed, and he’ll likely shoot on sight.” </p><p>Then Carlisle’s shoes struck the snow- </p><p>banked side of the end quadrangle, sending </p><p>the flakes hissing into the fire, and instan- </p><p>taneously the truth struck home to him. </p><p>There had not been a hunter or a squaw in the </p><p>whole camp to menace or alarm a pillager. </p><p> Soaring Eagle’s dogs, the splendid one-</p><p>hundred-and-fifty-pound Hudson’s Bays, </p><p>the swiftest dogs in Carlisle’s district, the </p><p>animals no other post team could pretend </p><p>to overtake, were gone from their former </p><p>place by the fire. </p><p> Soaring Eagle’s up-ended cariole, too, was</p><p>gone, and yonder was the white furrow of it </p><p>streaking off in the direction that led up the </p><p>Saskatchewan. </p><p> “Escaped!” breathed Joan. “But be</p><p>careful, Paul. Maybe he has spread the </p><p>plague here as he tried to do once be- </p><p>fore!” </p><p> “No, thank Heaven, his tracks don’t go</p><p>any farther than this fire. He hadn’t time </p><p>to enter the main bivouac, you see, Joan. </p><p>It took him all his time to get the harness </p><p>on those five big brutes and get away. He </p><p>has barely done it, for the cariole furrow </p><p>hasn’t yet hardened in the frost!” </p><p>CHAPTER XII </p><p>THE SORCERY OF SPRING </p><p>WINTER’S waning they sensed first in </p><p>the flutter of ptarmigan flocks back </p><p>from the Takipi Hills, in the drift of the </p><p>phantom caribou herds down from the </p><p>Barren Lands, in the lengthening days, the </p><p>receding horizon which drew away into in- </p><p>finite remoteness, the rampant winds which </p><p>snow-smoked that far horizon but died </p><p>in a strange vacuum over the bosom of </p><p>Pine Island Lake itself. </p><p> All about Cumberland House the North-</p><p>ern world burned incandescent, lurid, shot </p><p>through and through, earth, air and sky, </p><p>with weird shafts of color. The snows were </p><p>billowy seas of coral with the bloody sun- </p><p>sets lying on them like islands of rubies.</p><p> The atmosphere was a mystic veil, today</p><p>a shower of diamond dust, tomorrow a sil- </p><p>ver vapor, the next day the gossamer cloak </p><p>of a sleeping glacier chrysoberyl-stained </p><p>upon a web of hoar frost. And sheer from </p><p>the dome of heaven to the line of the snows </p><p>banked the deep purple clouds, like regal </p><p>hangings in an ancient temple with the mock </p><p>suns peering through as eyes of the priests </p><p>of the sacrifice were wont to peer. </p><p> Yet there came no vernal transition, no</p><p>slow travail of nature bringing forth new </p><p>life. Only the purple tapestries and the </p><p>peering eyes dissolved one day, and in their </p><p>place floated turquoise skies and cirrous </p><p>Ambush </p><p>63 </p><p>clouds painted with the eeriest sight North- </p><p>ern eyes may see. </p><p> Joan was the first to notice, straying to</p><p>the door of the Factor’s house while her </p><p>father, Andrews and Carlisle talked and </p><p>smoked the bright evening away before the </p><p>fireplace in the council room. </p><p> Now the sun set late. Jealous daylight</p><p>claimed many hours of the former dark, </p><p>and upon this evening the low sun was </p><p>screened behind a fan of ground fog shoot- </p><p>ing up a half-circle of crimson spokes </p><p>rimmed by a golden felloe. Yet it was not </p><p>the fantastic sunset but the weird sky itself </p><p>that called forth Joan’s excited cry and </p><p>brought the others to her side. </p><p> “Look!” she murmured in a tone of awe.</p><p>“Did you ever see such unnatural beauty?” </p><p>“By heavens, a mirage!” exclaimed Car- </p><p>lisle. “A mirage of the South!” </p><p> For before their uplifted eyes, as if it</p><p>lay out yonder upon the bare snows or just </p><p>over the needle-tufted pines, stretched the </p><p>open waters of the Great Lakes and the </p><p>verdant land to the southward. What a </p><p>charm of color, what a mellow sweep of </p><p>warmth they beheld! </p><p> Chrysoprase green the waters shimmered,</p><p>frothed with the crests of the surges, edged </p><p>with the pearly foam of pounded beaches, </p><p>while afar spread the silver ribbons of rivers, </p><p>the fat, grassed fields, the groves of leafed </p><p>trees, the acres of orchard bloom. Almost </p><p>could they hear the cries of children at play </p><p>under the showering petals, catch the drone </p><p>of the hived bees, feel the hot-lipped South- </p><p>ern winds kissing their faces like the pas- </p><p>sionate caress of their own febrile Chinook. </p><p> “It’s Spring!” declared Carlisle. “It’s</p><p>blossomy Spring down there.” </p><p> “Yes, it’s Spring on the Wyoming Valley</p><p>—see!” urged Wayne, his fawn-green eyes </p><p>burning raptly, has abnormally long arm </p><p>pointing out his homeland in the sky pic- </p><p>ture as one would lay a finger upon an un- </p><p>rolled map. “It’s Spring, and it’s a sign. </p><p>By the Doom, a sign that I’m going back!” </p><p>Carlisle and Andrews were silent.</p><p> The tears flooded to Joan’s eyes.</p><p> They all stared mutely while the mirage</p><p>faded as quickly as it had appeared and </p><p>somber clouds slipped over with the motion </p><p>of a hand wiping away the drawing from </p><p>a slate. </p><p> Wayne’s eye went dark with the sky.</p><p>He groped for the doorway as they turned </p><p>'nside and sat down in his chair before the </p><p>fireplace, his head in his hands, gazing into </p><p>the glowing embers as one who sees old </p><p>scenes in pageant. </p><p> Within an hour the rain came, the warm,</p><p>steaming, smiting rain that had lurked for </p><p>weeks in the purple cloud banks, and all </p><p>night it poured, gushed, fell in torrents, </p><p>sweeping the snows like a magic broom, </p><p>brimming ice-bound lake and river with the </p><p>leaping waters of life. </p><p> Companioning it, came the Chinook,</p><p>stealing a march in the dark, ravishing the </p><p>naked woods, stirring the pulse primordial </p><p>in the heart of the waking earth. </p><p> Morning revealed a world aflood, the ice</p><p>jams flying, the Saskatchewan in rampage, </p><p>hurling the glut of a thousand streams down </p><p>to Lake Winnipeg. Spring! It burst like </p><p>prison doors for prisoners long confined. </p><p>It came like a swift reprieve to mourners </p><p>of one doomed. Spring! The air was one </p><p>vast flyway of wildfowl winging north. </p><p> As rivers run to the sea, as men seek their</p><p>own hearth fires, so these whizzing wedges </p><p>returned to the nests that fledged them, the </p><p>ducks to their million marshes, the Canada </p><p>geese to their Hudson’s Bay shores, the </p><p>wavies to their nameless Arctic islands. </p><p> While the ice runs reeled along, the wil-</p><p>lows budded beside them. While the mus- </p><p>kegs shed their frozen skins, the wild rose </p><p>clothed their starkness. While the melting </p><p>snows uncarpeted the forest floor, the </p><p>nymph-like flowers spread over it their rugs </p><p>of matchless hue. Spring! The incompar- </p><p>able thrill and verve and urge of it! It </p><p>surged in all living tilings from the human </p><p>occupants of Cumberland House to the </p><p>singing bluebirds in the tree tops and the </p><p>whining mosquitoes in the swamp.</p><p> I THE breaking of the forest trails</p><p>meant the cutting off of all commun- </p><p>ication in the Northland till the </p><p>floods had subsided sufficiently for the frail </p><p>canoes to breast them. Carlisle had had </p><p>no word from James Bay. If word had not </p><p>been sent out by trippers before the snows </p><p>broke, it might not arrive in time to let </p><p>him know the situation in the other dis- </p><p>tricts. The lack of such knowledge was </p><p>a severe handicap. </p><p> The governor always kept his promises</p><p>strictly, and he wondered what had hap- </p><p>pened to prevent a message getting through. </p><p>But even while lie worried, a lone Indian </p><p>canoeman, daring the running ice, drove </p><p>64 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>up the Saskatchewan over the lessening </p><p>flood and threw a dispatch bag upon </p><p>Carlisle’s desk. </p><p> “You are Flaming Torch from the bay</p><p>post of York Factory,” identified Carlisle, </p><p>scanning him keenly, “but you have not </p><p>come from the bay by canoe. I know that.” </p><p> “No,” explained Flaming Torch, “I</p><p>came by dog-team. The trail was slow with </p><p>the melting snows, and the floods caught </p><p>me at the Pas. I had to wait for the ice </p><p>to run. Then I came on with a canoe from </p><p>the post.” </p><p> “Stay here,” Carlisle directed him. “I</p><p>may have a message to send back right </p><p>away.” </p><p> He knew Wayne and Andrews were out</p><p>somewhere along the swollen river, so he </p><p>took the dispatches over to his house to </p><p>have privacy while reading them, but when </p><p>he opened the council room door Joan sat </p><p>there. </p><p> “What is it, Paul?” she asked, looking</p><p>up from the book she was reading. </p><p> “Dispatches,” he replied with satisfac-</p><p>tion. “I’ve looked for them a long time. </p><p>Don’t let me disturb you, though. Go on </p><p>with your reading. I’ll just glance over </p><p>them and get the news.” </p><p> Most of them were documents of the</p><p>ordinary post routine, things that would </p><p>come under the jurisdiction and execution </p><p>of Galt and his clerks, but finally he came </p><p>to one of greater import. </p><p> The sweeping chirography he recognized</p><p>as the governor’s own handwriting, and </p><p>it was addressed: Chief District Factor </p><p>Carlisle, Cumberland House, Cumberland </p><p>District, via Norway House. Also it was </p><p>marked Important, and Carlisle tore it open </p><p>with eager hands. It was written in con- </p><p>versational style, and the body of it ran: </p><p> All the Upper Country is a hell of smallpox!</p><p>Between that and trade war, all of the Free-Trade </p><p>and the majority of the Northwest posts are wiped </p><p>out. As far as the latest dispatches by runners</p><p>point out, the Northwest posts of James and Rod- </p><p>erick McKenzie, McLeod, McDougall, Todd, Mc- </p><p>Gillivray and Sager are the only ones left. These </p><p>posts are very strong, as many of the other posts </p><p>evacuated and fell in on them. </p><p> I have temporarily closed all our posts in the</p><p>infected districts and freighted out the fur by the </p><p>Churchill River, using dog teams for the purpose be- </p><p>fore the river broke. The Northwesters have made </p><p>no move, and beyond a doubt the McKenzies and </p><p>the rest will try to come down the Saskatchewan </p><p>as usual in the Spring. </p><p> You must stop them. They must not go through.</p><p>I hope you are strong enough as you stand and have </p><p>escaped the plague. If not, I can perhaps get you </p><p>reinforcements up in time. Everything here on the </p><p>bay is much the same. The past Winter has been </p><p>a severe one, and it may be I shall not endure an- </p><p>other. My health is failing greatly, and I think I </p><p>may ask for a change in the Spring. Let me know </p><p>your prospects by the runner who carries this!” </p><p> As Carlisle raised his eyes from his reading</p><p>he caught the gaze of Joan bent upon him </p><p>across the table. </p><p> “What is the news, Paul?” she asked</p><p>earnestly. “Is it betraying confidences or </p><p>trade secrets to tell me?” </p><p> “No, Joan, there’s nothing in it you</p><p>shouldn’t know about,” he assured her, </p><p>handing the dispatch over the board. </p><p>“You may read it for yourself. I’m sorry </p><p>it confirms our worst news about your </p><p>father’s posts. Soaring Eagle’s words were </p><p>true. They’re all gone, it seems. The </p><p>Northwesters fared somewhat better.” </p><p> Joan quickly read the dispatch, and</p><p>Carlisle saw the soft gleam of commisera- </p><p>tion spring into her eyes. </p><p> “I was afraid—so dreadfully afraid!”</p><p>she exclaimed. “Now I know. I know </p><p>what I haven’t the heart to tell him. But </p><p>it doesn’t make any mention of Richelieu, </p><p>Paul. Do you think he’ll have reached any </p><p>of these posts that remain unaffected?” </p><p> “He has certainly reached one of them,”</p><p>Carlisle emphatically declared. “He had </p><p>the very best of dogs, and it wouldn’t take </p><p>him long to reach, say, Todd’s post.” </p><p> “Then perhaps he’ll warn them not to</p><p>come down the Saskatchewan. Perhaps </p><p>they’ll try some other ruse or else hold </p><p>their furs over for another year.” </p><p> Carlisle shook his head.</p><p> “They won’t do that,” he prophesied.</p><p>“Furs held over are not so profitable as if </p><p>marketed at once. Then, they have to </p><p>go to Grande Portage for next year’s sup- </p><p>plies. Besides, Richelieu is a bully and a </p><p>fighter, no coward whatever. Nobody need </p><p>warn him off, and he won’t warn anybody </p><p>else off. </p><p> “Even if any of the other partners object</p><p>and want to play a safer game, he’ll smash </p><p>their objections. I know Simon Richelieu. </p><p>He’ll come, and he’ll have all the North- </p><p>west brigades under his command. Further </p><p>than that, Joan, don’t you realize how much </p><p>depends on my scattering his brigades here? </p><p>If I should lose-” </p><p> “Don’t, Paul, don’t mention that pos-</p><p>sibility!” cried Joan. </p><p>Ambush </p><p> She was half out of her chair, her face all</p><p>flushed, leaning over the table toward him, </p><p>her hands planted on the litter of dispatches. </p><p> “Don’t mention it, please! It would</p><p>bring misfortune, I’m sure. I’ve learned </p><p>to be superstitious in this North, you see. </p><p>Yes, I was a fool to say he wouldn’t come. </p><p>He will come. And Paul, Paul—you must </p><p>not lose!” </p><p> Carlisle’s fingers closed on hers, outspread</p><p>upon the papers. </p><p> “By the God of Northmen, Joan,” he</p><p>vowed, “I will not lose!” </p><p> The magnetic pressure of his hands told</p><p>more than the mere words. Joan with </p><p>a radiant smile slowly withdrew her hands </p><p>and dropped back into her chair, still fol- </p><p>lowing his movements with her eyes as he </p><p>set about writing the answer to the govern- </p><p>or’s despatch. </p><p>ffjg WHEN he had finished he looked </p><p> up-</p><p>“Would you like to read it, Joan?” </p><p>he asked. </p><p> “Yes, I would like to, Paul,” she con-</p><p>fessed, “that is, if it is the same as the other </p><p>—if it is proper that I should read it.” </p><p>“It’s all right for you to see it, girl. Here!” </p><p> Joan took the paper and read:</p><p> I have your dispatch via Norway House, al-</p><p>though it was somewhat delayed en route. The </p><p>break-up of the river caught the courier at the Pas, </p><p>and he had to lie up with the dogs and come on at </p><p>the first opportunity by canoe. This circumstance </p><p>would have made it a question whether reinforce- </p><p>ments could have reached here in time had I needed </p><p>them, but luckily I do not. </p><p> Besides my own men, Galt’s strong following</p><p>which was here when I arrived, and the crews of </p><p>the two fleets of York boats whom I have retained, </p><p>I am drawing in all the forces of the other posts with </p><p>all the Indians of those sections. The Indians are </p><p>loyal and numerous, and thus I shall have a prepond- </p><p>erance of men. As regards the smallpox, it has been</p><p>here. In fact, it started here in a manner I shall </p><p>explain when I reach James Bay. </p><p> Both Northwesters and Free-Traders fled from it,</p><p>burning Richelieu’s post as they fled, except Riche- </p><p>lieu, Wayne and five of Wayne’s men. In isolation </p><p>at Fort Wayne the five Free-Traders died with it, </p><p>Richelieu recovering and managing to escape up the </p><p>Saskatchewan. Fort Wayne we fired so as to leave </p><p>no possibility of the disease spreading here. </p><p> I have given Wayne quarters at Cumberland</p><p>House, although we thought it best not to tell him </p><p>the extent of his losses yet, he is such a strange </p><p>and moody man. There has been no infection at </p><p>Cumberland House. Everything is in the usual </p><p>shape, and fur has been plentiful. I shall stop the </p><p>Northwest brigades here and then go down to </p><p>Grande Portage. </p><p>65 </p><p> The Northwesters have claimed the ground there</p><p>and closed the Portage and thus the Pigeon River </p><p>route to any but their own voyageu^. I myself </p><p>had to make a dash up the Kaministiquia coming in. </p><p>You can understand that it is supremely in our </p><p>interests to contest that claim without delay, be- </p><p>fore undisputed closing of it gives them excuse for </p><p>holding it under a ruling of the corrupt Montreal </p><p>courts. </p><p> So I shall pass over the ground to void the claim</p><p>and come home to the bay via the Michipicoten, </p><p>the Missinabie and the Moose. I am sorry to hear </p><p>you have been troubled in health but trust to find </p><p>you much improved when next I pay my respects. </p><p> “Well, Joan?” he questioned when she</p><p>looked up with the light of surprise upon her </p><p>face. </p><p> “You are going down to Grande Portage,</p><p>Paul? I thought you would go down to </p><p>James Bay by the Hayes River?” </p><p> “No,” he responded, “if I stopped Riche-</p><p>lieu’s brigades here and then went down the </p><p>Hayes, my work would be only half done. </p><p>I am going to open up Grande Portage, and </p><p>by the God of Northmen, Joan, you are </p><p>going with me!” </p><p> That day the courier Flaming Torch</p><p>departed down the river. The next day </p><p>the men of the other posts came up, Lewis </p><p>from the Pas, Lea from the Nepowin, </p><p>Garry from Moose Lake, Hampton from</p><p>Chimawawin, Jarvis from Grand Rapids. </p><p> They brought all the Indians of their</p><p>sections to add to Carlisle’s strength, and </p><p>Jarvis, his Cockney nose tilted skyward </p><p>in pride, drove up with his own crew the </p><p>Factor’s great craft which had been left </p><p>at Grand Rapids when the river froze. </p><p> “See the bloomin’ Rajah ride!” he grinned</p><p>doffing his cap to the crowd on shore. </p><p>“Some d’y I’ll command one of my own. </p><p>Just mark wot I s’y.” </p><p> He had with him Soaring Eagle’s tribe,</p><p>the up-Saskatchewan Indians who had </p><p>elected to hunt about Lake Winnipeg when </p><p>driven out by the plague, laden with a fresh </p><p>catch of fur. The fur went in in trade, and </p><p>these were the busy hours, hours filled with </p><p>life and movement, sound and color after </p><p>the ghostly desolation and silence of the </p><p>Winter. </p><p> Never an hour went by, day or night, but</p><p>some new fleet of canoes touched prows </p><p>upon the Pine Island Lake shore, some new </p><p>family pitched camp and swelled the teepee </p><p>city ’round about Cumberland House. </p><p> Out of the eastern and western arms</p><p>they came, off the Sturgeon and the Carrot </p><p>Rivers, from Lakes Namew, Amisk, Goose, </p><p>66 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Athapuscow, foregathering after custom </p><p>immemorial, spiraling the blazing skies </p><p>with their camp smokes, filling the balmy </p><p>air with liquid language that lisped like the </p><p>moist Spring wind or gurgled like the waters. </p><p> They were all in, every man upon the</p><p>trade books, every Hudson’s Bay hunter </p><p>in the district with their squaws, papooses, </p><p>dogs and household gods. The only out- </p><p>post remaining was Wells’ camp on the </p><p>Seepanock Channel. </p><p> Wells’ men Carlisle had not drawn in</p><p>like the others. On the contrary he had </p><p>added to the Seepanock Channel force, </p><p>bidding Wells redouble his vigilance with </p><p>the opening of the stream and giving him </p><p>explicit orders as to what course he must </p><p>pursue when the Northwesters came down. </p><p> Nor was the significance of these prepara-</p><p>tions lost upon Wayne. They marked, as </p><p>it were, the breaking of the truce enforced </p><p>between him and Carlisle by the smallpox </p><p>outbreak. They loomed upon his concep- </p><p>tion as a final menace to his interests and </p><p>he became morose, moody, brooding over </p><p>Carlisle’s actions and his ancient wrongs, </p><p>watching for the Free-Trading brigades </p><p>he hoped to see come driving down the </p><p>Saskatchewan and grimly waiting for that </p><p>moment when there would be no further </p><p>truce and he and Carlisle must decisively </p><p>settle accounts. </p><p>THE ice run was practically past. </p><p>Vagrant floes spun by on the turgid </p><p>waters, but their very solitary journ- </p><p>eying told Carlisle that the mighty highway </p><p>was open. Even back to the tiniest feeders </p><p>in the foothills of the Rockies the way was </p><p>clear, and the Northwesters were doubtless </p><p>driving down. They might come by day- </p><p>light or dark, today, tomorrow, there </p><p>was no telling, but it was well to be pre- </p><p>pared. </p><p> Carlisle went up to the Seepanock Chan-</p><p>nel and personally posted Wells’ men, both </p><p>in the -hills across the Saskatchewan and </p><p>in the low scrub round the channel opening </p><p>itself. A mile inland the channel had been </p><p>heavily barricaded as a necessary precau- </p><p>tion, but no evidence of Hudson’s Bay</p><p>forces being in possession was visible from </p><p>the main stream. </p><p> “Keep out of sight,” Carlisle adjured</p><p>Wells. “Don’t let them get a glimpse of </p><p>any of your men. If they enter the chan- </p><p>nel, rush and hold them till I can get up the </p><p>river to help you. If they go by, make sure </p><p>that it is not a ruse and then follow them </p><p>on to me as fast as you can.” </p><p> “Yez, Factor,” Wells assured him, “I</p><p>zhall make zertain o’ that. You zhall </p><p>zee!” </p><p> Carlisle dropped down-stream again be-</p><p>low the muddle of straggling islands, be- </p><p>low the scramble of rapids, below the twisted </p><p>knot of river bends known as the Coiled </p><p>Snakes to a spit where the Saskatchewan </p><p>narrowed not a great distance from Cumber- </p><p>land House. </p><p> Here the park lands met the ruder forest</p><p>in a series of rolling bluffs and low plateaus, </p><p>a bold promontory crowding the river into </p><p>a twisted, somber chasm. Close by the rim </p><p>of the chasm and up on the slopes shouldered </p><p>the jostling spruce, and against these high </p><p>trees Carlisle sent his men with their axes. </p><p> To the swinging steel the spruce trees</p><p>swung and snapped, plunging like the </p><p>thrown spears of Titans into the river be- </p><p>neath. They criss-crossed and lodged and </p><p>jammed, piling trunk on trunk, seineing </p><p>the vagrant floes that drifted down, form- </p><p>ing a stubborn wall against the angry roar- </p><p>ing river. </p><p> The dammed flood rose a foot, two feet,</p><p>three feet, but the matted barrier held, </p><p>while high above Carlisle and his axmen </p><p>rained down the trunks till the sullen tide, </p><p>backed ’round the face of the promontory </p><p>and gave up the fight. Beaten, it slunk out </p><p>the easier way, over the bank through the </p><p>Devil’s Elbow, a broad, barren valley that </p><p>seemed to have been an ancient beaver </p><p>meadow. </p><p> Owing to the width of the valley the</p><p>yellow flood flowed no deeper than a man’s </p><p>waist, sweeping in a majestic curve of three </p><p>miles or more back to the well-nigh drained </p><p>Saskatchewan’s bed. As the waters rolled </p><p>ruminatively through, they raised some-</p><p>thing inch by inch upon their rippling sur- </p><p>face, a dark line across the molten gold, </p><p>a triple boom of logs securely roped to giant </p><p>pines on either benchland. </p><p> Ralph Wayne heard the axes ringing,</p><p>saw the Saskatchewan temporarily draining, </p><p>and ran out-to where Carlisle was at work. </p><p>He glimpsed the dammed chasm, the boom </p><p>of logs across the Devil’s Elbow, and his </p><p>fawn-green eyes blazed with their old inim- </p><p>ical light into Carlisle’s. </p><p> “Condemnation! You close the Saskatch-</p><p>ewan, Carlisle?” he exploded. </p><p>Ambush </p><p>67 </p><p> “So it seems, Wayne,” returned Carlisle</p><p>quietly. </p><p> “To my brigades?”</p><p> “No, to the Northwest brigades.”</p><p> “But what’s the difference? You close</p><p>the waterway, and you stop all who travel </p><p>down. By the Doom, do you think I will </p><p>stand and by and see it done?” </p><p> Carlisle’s gray eyes looked steadily into</p><p>Wayne’s blazing ones where he stood upon </p><p>the end of the boom, and as he gazed, the </p><p>Factor seemed to see back into those far- </p><p>gone years which had molded the man so </p><p>harshly. </p><p> With strange occult vision he saw the</p><p>pall of smoke and the sweep of pillage </p><p>through the Wyoming Valley and Wayne’s </p><p>long pilgrimage into the North with his </p><p>child of four. He sensed the vision and </p><p>dream that had lured Wayne in his loneli- </p><p>ness to do what many another adventurer </p><p>had failed to do, to blaze the trail of empire </p><p>beyond the Missouri. </p><p> Carlisle saw, felt the greatness of Wayne’s</p><p>dissolving dream, and there was no emnity </p><p>in his heart, nothing but regret and pity, </p><p>and he laid an earnest hand on the Free- </p><p>Trader’s arm. </p><p> “On my honor, Wayne, this move has</p><p>nothing to do with you!” he assured him. </p><p> “You won’t try to hold my brigades,</p><p>then?” flashed the incredulous Wayne. </p><p>“You’ll let them pass around when they </p><p>come?” </p><p> Carlisle hesitated, then nodded helplessly.</p><p>“If—if they come,” he evaded, “I’ll put </p><p>out no hand to stop them.” </p><p> “If!” blurted Wayne. “What in creation</p><p>have you up your sleeve? Do you think my </p><p>men aren’t as loyal as yours? Just because </p><p>some of the drunken curs joined in the rout </p><p>like sheep when they got the smallpox scare, </p><p>you needn’t class them all as that. Look at </p><p>Mason. Look at Murdock, and the rest. </p><p>Had you ever truer men under your red flag?”</p><p>“No, none truer than those,” admitted </p><p>Carlisle. “None truer in all the world for </p><p>that matter!” </p><p> Wayne shrugged his shoulders darkly as</p><p>he turned away again. </p><p> “Then that settles it,” he growled.</p><p>“They’ll come all right, and when they </p><p>take passage through here, they take it for </p><p>all time, Carlisle. Either that or-” </p><p> He finished his sentence with a shake of</p><p>his head that was more sinister than any </p><p>spoken threat. </p><p> Gravely, without answering his threat,</p><p>Carlisle watched him striding back to the </p><p>post before he turned to give final directions </p><p>to his men. Some dozen he appointed to </p><p>work in two shifts, walking the triple boom </p><p>with poles in their hands deflecting the </p><p>drifting ice so that it would squeeze under </p><p>and leave the barrier clear. </p><p> The rest he split into two camps to</p><p>bivouac upon the benchlands at either end </p><p>of the boom, ready at the coming of the </p><p>sleepless scouts he had posted here and </p><p>there all the way up-river to the Seepanock </p><p>Channel. There was nothing more to be </p><p>done but wait. The long twilight of the </p><p>Northern evening had crept in upon the </p><p>completion of the day’s work, and through </p><p>the dusk Carlisle followed in Wayne’s </p><p>footsteps back to Cumberland House. </p><p>IN THE deepest dark before the </p><p>dawn Wells’ scout Spotted Deer, a </p><p>Cree Indian of tremendous endur- </p><p>ance and skill, fell in upon him, breathless </p><p>and sweating. </p><p> “They come,” he grunted in Cree, spent</p><p>with his running. “Many canoes. Many </p><p>voices of white men, the French Company’s </p><p>men singing to their paddles.” </p><p> Instantly Wells struck fire with his flint</p><p>and steel to the dry birchbark, heaped be- </p><p>side him on the hillside, and blew it into </p><p>flame. </p><p> The flare was hidden by the bulge of the</p><p>hill from any one up-river, but could be </p><p>readily seen by an appointed eye in an ap- </p><p>pointed place down-river. As Wells strained</p><p>his eyes into the dark, he caught the an- </p><p>swering flare a mile or two below, a bright </p><p>flame and unmistakable but no larger than </p><p>a handful of fireflies held on high by a spor- </p><p>tive boy. </p><p> Immediately Wells smothered his flame</p><p>with earth, and far down he saw the second </p><p>flare go out and knew that his message was </p><p>speeding swifter than the swiftest bird. </p><p> All the way along the Saskatchewan</p><p>from island to island, from headland to </p><p>headland, from hill to hill the red eyes </p><p>glowed and winked out in the dark, and the </p><p>last one glared for Waseyawin stationed </p><p>upon the steep benchland above the Hud- </p><p>son’s Bay men’s bivouacs. Swiftly Wase- </p><p>yawin lit his torch and waved it in answer. </p><p>The far spark died in the gloom. He </p><p>dashed the torch into the soft muck and </p><p>bounded down the hillside. </p><p>68 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “The men of Black-beard are coming,”</p><p>he cried to the drowsy camp. “The sign </p><p>of the fire flashed through the night to me. </p><p>They will be here with the winged dawn. I, </p><p>Waseyawin, have spoke it. Ae, and I go </p><p>to tell the Factor.” </p><p> Like wraiths the Hudson’s Bay men</p><p>arose from wherever they lay, from bough </p><p>beds on the ground, from the canopy of the </p><p>bushes, from the tents spread in desperation </p><p>to keep off the plague of mosquitoes. </p><p> They stepped forth shadowy, vague,</p><p>thronging like ghosts in the dark that would </p><p>soon break to show the stern, bronzed faces </p><p>of Northmen sculptured by the chisel of </p><p>daring. Among them the chief trader Galt </p><p>moved his heavily-built body, ordering, </p><p>directing, posting them in their allotted </p><p>positions. </p><p> “Go across the valley, Eugene,” he begged</p><p>Drummond, “and let them know what we </p><p>know. It is good to be ready when the </p><p>Factor comes.” </p><p> Amid the low, musical, night-roar of the</p><p>waters flowing under the boom and the </p><p>spaced thud of ice cakes smiting the logs, </p><p>Drummond’s moccasins pat-patted across </p><p>on the wet bark. He gave the word to the </p><p>polers as he passed, and in a few minutes </p><p>more ghostly forms were thronging in the </p><p>bivouac at the other end of the boom. </p><p> Waseyawin waited for none of these</p><p>things. He ran as the deer run, the tang </p><p>of the dank night air and the smell of the </p><p>young earth throbbing in his nostrils and </p><p>setting his primitive blood a-leap, making </p><p>straight for Cumberland House. </p><p> Up the trampled shore he sped and</p><p>through the sleeping city of teepees, setting </p><p>the curs to howling and stirring the tribes </p><p>from their dreaming of forest dreams. </p><p>They cried out to him to know if he was </p><p>Maunobosho or Nenaubosho stalking </p><p>through the night, but he heeded them not. </p><p> Through the open gate of the palisades</p><p>he darted and across the dark stockade </p><p>ground. He knew there was no use in </p><p>going to the Factor’s house, for he had seen</p><p>that only Wayne, his daughter and Father </p><p>Andrews were sleeping there. The Factor’s </p><p>bed was in the trading-room, and, dispens- </p><p>ing with all custom in the urgency of the </p><p>moment, Waseyawin sprang up the steps </p><p>and opened the door. </p><p> Carlisle lay upon the temporary bed be-</p><p>hind his desk, sunk in a deep sleep after the </p><p>long day’s toil. He did not hear the almost </p><p>soundless feet of his bowsman, did not </p><p>wake till he felt the Indian fingers laid </p><p>softly and respectfully upon his cheek. </p><p> “Koos koos kwa, Factor!” cried Wase-</p><p>yawin. “Wake up! The eyes of fire winked </p><p>through the dark to me, and after the eyes </p><p>will the sun flash upon the paddles of the </p><p>men of the French Company.” </p><p> “It is well, Waseyawin,” spoke Carlisle</p><p>in Cree, mentally alert the moment he was </p><p>awake. “Go among your people in their </p><p>teepees and gather the hunters. Take them </p><p>with you to the Devil’s Elbow to strengthen </p><p>my men. I will not be far behind you.” </p><p>CHAPTER XIII </p><p>A SKIN FOR A SKIN </p><p>MAKING ready his weapons as he </p><p>went, Carlisle ran forth from the trad- </p><p>ing-room. The stars were gone as he </p><p>glanced upward. The sky was graying, and </p><p>above the eastern forest-line the lemon </p><p>forelights of the dawn were gleaming. </p><p> Outside the stockade the Indian teepees</p><p>buzzed like a vast colony of bees. Wasey- </p><p>awin had already hurried the hunters away, </p><p>but their womenkind were hissing the news </p><p>of impending trouble about and scurrying </p><p>off to the slope above the Devil’s Elbow </p><p>where they might see their lords give battle. </p><p>Carlisle’s swift feet passed many of them on </p><p>the way, and as he came to the steep of the </p><p>benchland, the vivid picture of the valley </p><p>below spread sharp and clear before his eyes. </p><p> Through the great gut of greening hills,</p><p>along their scarred earth faces, rocky out- </p><p>crops and scrubby slopes rolled the slum- </p><p>brous sheet of golden-colored water. Its </p><p>vagrant floes had found the gouged earth </p><p>an easy place to lodge, and there shimmer- </p><p>ing acres of ice were stranded, ghostly white</p><p>in the growing light. Above hung the furry </p><p>buds and opened leaves of the willows, the </p><p>lacy, climbing birches and over all the </p><p>regal, scornful spruce pricking stiffly into </p><p>the lemon sky. </p><p> Clusters of tents marked the ends of the</p><p>boom, drawn like a black triple cable across </p><p>the golden flood and fretting it into a snarl- </p><p>ing line of foam where the flow plunged </p><p>under. ’Round the tents and scattered </p><p>across the long boom he marked his wait- </p><p>ing forces, all the swarthy hunters Wasey- </p><p>awin had marshaled, all the Hudson’s Bay </p><p>white men, half-breeds and resident Indians </p><p>Ambush </p><p>69 </p><p>of Cumberland House and the other district </p><p>posts. </p><p> Yonder was Waseyawin himself, moving</p><p>on the boom with the snaky slouch of the </p><p>Crees, Missowa the Ojibway standing tall, </p><p>strong, straight as a lance. </p><p> There were all the rest of his officers posed</p><p>on the logs, their physical characteristics </p><p>infallibly betraying their identities even at </p><p>that distance—Galt’s stocky body, Drum- </p><p>mond’s eagle profile and raven hair, Lewis’ </p><p>hoary head, Lea’s slim Highland figure, </p><p>Jarvis’ nervous shuffle, Hampton’s fleshy </p><p>bulk, Garry’s squat limbs and flaming red </p><p>beard. </p><p> Even as he looked, Carlisle saw Eugene</p><p>point up the majestic curve of the Devil’s </p><p>Elbow, saw the hands of the row of men on </p><p>the boom drop to their hips and belts and </p><p>curl up under their armpits for the handy </p><p>weapons. There was something coming on </p><p>the rolling flood. The output of the pines </p><p>across the shoulder of the slope shut out his </p><p>own view of the curve, but Carlisle knew </p><p>that Eugene and the rest had sighted their </p><p>enemies. </p><p> In long, slipping, coasting strides he slid</p><p>down the benchland upon his wet moccasins </p><p>and ran out on the boom beside his brigade </p><p>leader. </p><p> “Ba gar, here dey be come!” shrilled</p><p>Eugene, still pointing, and Carlisle sighted </p><p>over his hand to glimpse the Northwest </p><p>brigades sweeping ’round the promontory. </p><p> The jam of trees and ice in the narrow</p><p>chasm was not the first jam they had avoid- </p><p>ed in their long journey down that roaring </p><p>waterway. They followed the Saskatche- </p><p>wan wherever it went, and in the natural </p><p>diversion of things they came driving over </p><p>the broad, unobstructed yellow flood that </p><p>eddied ’round the Devil’s Elbow. </p><p>BLACK as Stygian craft the canoes </p><p>loomed in the shadow of the head- </p><p>land, but as they passed the head- </p><p>land the first sapphire shafts of the </p><p>dawnlight struck them, glinting from the </p><p>canoe sides, flashing from the dipping pad-</p><p>dles, paradoxically investing the white and </p><p>Indian faces with nebulous, pearly haloes. </p><p> In the sudden blaze of light Carlisle</p><p>recognized the faces, the men of every craft, </p><p>James and Roderick McKenzie, McLeod </p><p>and McDougall with their Athabasca </p><p>brigades, Todd from Fort des Prairies, </p><p>McGillivray and Sager from Fond du Lac. </p><p>The governor’s information had been </p><p>accurate. Not a man he had named was </p><p>missing. </p><p> Todd’s canoe was in front, and as it</p><p>approached the boom, Carlisle saw a man </p><p>rise to his feet and plant a flagstaff in the </p><p>curving bow. </p><p> The banner of the Northwesters broke on</p><p>the morning wind, and behind its rippling </p><p>folds he beheld Richelieu, stiff as a ramrod </p><p>in the swaying craft, resplendent in his </p><p>uniform of a colonel, his grinning black- </p><p>bearded face hideously pox-pitted, more like </p><p>the face of the devil than ever! </p><p> “Long live the Northwest Company!”</p><p>he cried, and like an echo his forces took up </p><p>the Northwest watchcry: “Fortitude in </p><p>distress!” their cheering drowning the roar- </p><p>ing of the river. </p><p> Carlisle stooped to pick up a spike-ended</p><p>shaft that lay at his feet on the boom. With </p><p>a strong darting thrust he drove the spike </p><p>into the logs, and the shaft oscillated there, </p><p>shaking out the blood-red emblem of the </p><p>Hudson’s Bay Company and Carlisle’s own </p><p>streaming gonfalon, the gonfalon that had </p><p>come undimmed through fire and flood, </p><p>through famine and plague, through all the </p><p>hazards of the Northland. </p><p> “Pro Belle Cuteml” he shouted antago-</p><p>nistically, and the bellow of the Hudson’s </p><p>Bay giants set the high hill-tops quaking. </p><p> “Long live the Northwest Company!”</p><p> “A skin for a skin!” they boomed in a</p><p>diapason of terrible strength. “Long live </p><p>the H. B. C.!” </p><p> “By the Doom, yes, and to perdition with</p><p>Richelieu and his cursed Northwesters!” </p><p>shrilled a wild voice ashore. </p><p> Carlisle glanced over his shoulder to see</p><p>the tall form of Wayne dashing out upon </p><p>the boom and behind him Joan, her pale </p><p>face paler with excitement, her spun-gold </p><p>hair flying in the breeze, calling him back in </p><p>vain. Behind Joan ran Andrews, holding </p><p>the skirts of his cassock, his mosquito-veil </p><p>flapping over his face at every stride. </p><p> Wayne impetuously zigzagged through</p><p>the line of men to Carlisle’s side. His </p><p>mahogany countenance was ridged with </p><p>anger, his fawn-green eyes sparking wick- </p><p>edly. </p><p> “Condemnation, Carlisle,” he burst out,</p><p>“yesterday I never dreamed I would fight </p><p>under your flag! Today what is left for </p><p>me to do? Look at my brigade leaders </p><p>yonder, one, two—six of them from the </p><p>70 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Upper Country posts,” pointing them out </p><p>with rapid stabs of his rifle muzzle, “speck- </p><p>led through Richelieu’s crew like the pits in </p><p>his face! And when my brigade leaders </p><p>paddle in his pay, Carlisle, I ask you where </p><p>in creation are my brigades?” </p><p> “Sleeping under the green ferns, Ralph,”</p><p>Richelieu answered swiftly before Carlisle </p><p>could speak. </p><p> “You cursed slime! Who put them</p><p>there?” flashed Wayne. </p><p> Richelieu stiffly shrugged his military</p><p>shoulders. </p><p> “Diablement, do I control the elements</p><p>and the plagues? The Red Death raged, </p><p>and the Red Death took whom it wished. </p><p>Voilal It is the will of God. But my </p><p>quarrel is not with you, Ralph Wayne. </p><p>Non, nor with Mademoiselle Joan. I will </p><p>have a word to your profit with both of you </p><p>when I have finished with this cannaille </p><p>Carlisle, broken his barrier and razed his </p><p>post to the ground.” </p><p> Wayne half-lifted his rifle stock to his</p><p>cheek. </p><p> “By the Doom—will you have a word</p><p>with us?” </p><p> Carlisle pressed Wayne’s rifle barrel</p><p>down. </p><p> “This is my business, Wayne,” he warned</p><p>the Free-Trader. “Keep your weapons </p><p>still. Get Joan back to the shore end </p><p>yonder. She may be carried into the water </p><p>if they tty a rush.” </p><p> Carlisle half-turned to enforce his re-</p><p>quest on Wayne, for the instant lessening </p><p>his vigilance, and in that moment of un- </p><p>wariness Richelieu thought to seize the </p><p>advantage. </p><p> “Holat” he shouted loudly to his brigades.</p><p>“Form the line!” </p><p> LIKE lightning the paddles urged,</p><p>S| the hindmost canoes drawing up on </p><p>EBB a level with the foremost, edging in,</p><p>bellying sidewise, jockeying like race-horses </p><p>at the barrier, forming an unbroken line </p><p>from shore to shore. All in a second they </p><p>executed the maneuver with two or three </p><p>darting paddle-flips, and as the prows </p><p>evened and still glided in swift motion, </p><p>Richelieu waved them forward. </p><p> “Charge!” he ordered and hurled them on</p><p>with a violent gesture of his arm as if they </p><p>had been a squadron in action. </p><p> Like charging cavalry the canoes leaped</p><p>ahead, like immense horses carrying many </p><p>riders, the foam streaking from their noses, </p><p>the spray spattering behind them, Richelieu </p><p>towering in the bow of Todd’s craft as on </p><p>the neck of a charger, leading them reck- </p><p>lessly like the fearless soldier he was and </p><p>whipping them to frenzy with the stinging </p><p>lash of his tongue. </p><p> Straight at the boom they reared, but</p><p>Carlisle sensed their trick. A canoe’s </p><p>length away, the whole array would swerve </p><p>broadside on and spill the Northwesters out </p><p>on the boom with momentum enough to </p><p>carry all before them and sweep the Hud- </p><p>son’s Bay forces into the water. </p><p> Richelieu was shrewd enough not to mass</p><p>his attack in one spot but to batter the whole </p><p>boom simultaneously. His force was al- </p><p>most equal to Carlisle’s and he knew that </p><p>the swift rush of the canoes would dash his </p><p>men upon the boom with a smashing impact </p><p>that no merely stationary force could with- </p><p>stand. It would be like a single line of </p><p>infantry before galloping horsemen, over- </p><p>ridden, crushed, shattered by sheer impetus. </p><p> He knew that Carlisle knew it too, and</p><p>he passed a quick order along the line. </p><p> “Shoot once!” he commanded. “Then</p><p>jump for their canoes before they reach the </p><p>boom!” </p><p> Yelling demoniacally, the Northwesters</p><p>were driving in, only a few yards distant. </p><p>Todd’s canoe was surging fairly for Carlisle, </p><p>Richelieu still upright in the bow, the flap- </p><p>ping folds of the flag partly hiding his body </p><p>but the ugly black-bearded face showing </p><p>clear above, his mocking eyes gleaming over </p><p>the barrel of the pistol he held in his hand. </p><p> “Par Dieu, Carlisle,” he grinned. “It is</p><p>the end for you, the end of everything, the </p><p>end of your strife, your Company, your </p><p>dream of mademoiselle!” </p><p> Carlisle did not trouble to answer. His</p><p>own pistol in his hand, he waited, his eyes </p><p>never shifting from Richelieu, his body </p><p>slightly bent forward from the hips, his </p><p>moccasined feet grip*ping the wet bark of </p><p>the logs. </p><p> When the canoes were still two paddle-</p><p>strokes away he saw the muzzle of Richer </p><p>lieu’s pistol flip upward, caught the puff of </p><p>smoke, heard the weapon’s bark, felt the </p><p>wind of the silent lead through his hair and </p><p>its burning groove along his scalp. </p><p> Straight into the black-bearded face he</p><p>fired, but the swaying flagstaff snapped, </p><p>while Richelieu still grinned there, mock- </p><p>ingly, sardonically, sighting Ills pistol afresh </p><p>Ambush </p><p>71 </p><p>in the rocking craft. But before either he </p><p>or Carlisle could shoot again, Wayne’s long- </p><p>barreled rifle spat from the boom. </p><p> Faint as a squib it went off at Carlisle’s</p><p>ear in concert with the Hudson’s Bay men’s </p><p>volley, but the effect was contrastingly </p><p>violent. Richelieu, his weapon dropping </p><p>with a splash, whirled halfway’round as if </p><p>spun by an invisible hand. Todd’s canoe </p><p>was just in the act of turning a broadside on </p><p>to the boom, and the jerk catapulted the </p><p>staggering Richelieu out of the swerving </p><p>canoe bow. </p><p> He landed limply, half in the water, half</p><p>on the boom. Carlisle had a momentary </p><p>glance of Andrews dragging his body out on </p><p>the logs, of Wayne jamming in another </p><p>charge, of the white-faced Joan beside him </p><p>as he leaped from the boom before Todd’s </p><p>canoe could touch it. </p><p> All along the line the others leaped with</p><p>him, and they landed with a wallowing </p><p>splash close under the Northwesters’ whirl- </p><p>ing canoes. The Hudson’s Bay men knew </p><p>the depth of the water, a knowledge that </p><p>their enemies lacked, and therein lay their </p><p>advantage and Carlisle’s strategy. The </p><p>total unexpectedness of the move lent it </p><p>all the greater force, and the number of </p><p>Carlisle’s officers distributed throughout </p><p>the line ensured perfect unison of effort. </p><p> Galt, Drummond, Lewis, Jarvis, Hamp-</p><p>ton, Garry, Lea, Missowa and Waseyawin </p><p>and the lesser clerks were personally respon- </p><p>sible for the men undertheir command, and </p><p>they saw to it that all moved in concert. </p><p> Thus it was an unbroken row of men that</p><p>barred an unbroken row of canoes, before </p><p>the occupants of the canoes could jump </p><p>from craft to boom, and seized their low- </p><p>sunk gunwales. The clear-headed Todd </p><p>smelled disaster the moment the Hudson’s </p><p>Bay men launched through the air. </p><p> “Hades! Look out!” he yelled to the</p><p>ether partners. “Back-water, all!” </p><p> But Carlisle was too swift for him. A</p><p>whirl of the Factor’s hands and Todd’s </p><p>canoe was upside down, the fur packs on the</p><p>bottom, Todd and his crew floundering in </p><p>the water. </p><p> Todd came up sputtering and cursing.</p><p>His rifle-butt smashed down on Carlisle’s </p><p>shoulder, but Carlisle skimmed the surface </p><p>with a fist blow that caught Todd upon the </p><p>chin and stretched him limp and floating. </p><p>Scattering the Indian crew, he lunged on to </p><p>overturn the nearest craft. </p><p> Nor had his men been idle! Everywhere</p><p>he looked he saw the Northwest canoes </p><p>either capsized or in the act of being cap- </p><p>sized by his men. Up to their waists, </p><p>sometimes to their armpits in the icy water </p><p>they offered small targets for Northwest </p><p>violence while the canoes were easy prey. </p><p> Often top-heavy with crews and packs of</p><p>fur, always hair-poised on their keelless </p><p>bottoms, the birch-barks went over at the </p><p>touch of a hand, the poke of a knee or the </p><p>solid push of a gun-butt. </p><p>IT WAS a weird sight to behold, </p><p>whole brigades suddenly turning </p><p>turtle, heeling on their gunwales, </p><p>rearing up on their sterns, spilling and </p><p>sprawling arms, gear, men and furs in all </p><p>directions. </p><p> Some of the Hudson’s Bay men in then-</p><p>savage zeal paused not for the laying on of </p><p>hands but struck through the birch-bark </p><p>skins of the canoes with knives and belt </p><p>axes, scuttling the crafts at a stroke, sending </p><p>the paddlers under like mannikins in a </p><p>biscuit-box. </p><p> Bitter was the amphibious battle through</p><p>which Carlisle rampaged. Though they </p><p>had lost their canoes, the Northwesters </p><p>found their footing and resisted tenaciously. </p><p>Many of their arms were sunk in the plunge, </p><p>more they saved were plugged with mud and </p><p>slime so that there was little shooting. </p><p> They fought as their forefathers fought,</p><p>with knife and club and knotted fist, a primi- </p><p>tive horde battling like cavemen in the </p><p>wilderness, raging in the churned, moiled </p><p>river between steep benchlands under the </p><p>blazing sun. </p><p> High on those benchlands clustered the</p><p>womenkind of the tribes in action, all gay- </p><p>clothed in their calicoes, bright-cowled in</p><p>their warm-colored shawls, the squaws, the </p><p>boys, the maidens, the moss-bagged papoos- </p><p>es, even the husky dogs of the camp snarling </p><p>and clipping their fangs over the conflict </p><p>in the water below. </p><p> In that wild moment the women far for-</p><p>got their race stoicism and shrilled encour- </p><p>agement to their hunters, waved their gaudy </p><p>silk handkerchiefs, beseeching their Good </p><p>Spirit to help the Hudson’s Bay, calling on </p><p>their Evil One to blast the bold North- </p><p>westers. </p><p> The hunters answered their cries with</p><p>strident yells, their wet, swarthy arms </p><p>glistening like bronze in the sunlight as, led </p><p>72 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>by Missowa and Waseyawin, they carried </p><p>the fight more fiercely to their foes. The </p><p>Northwesters were beaten back from the </p><p>boom they hoped to break. Carlisle at the </p><p>head of his men seized McLeod and bodily </p><p>hurled him out on the farther shore. </p><p> “Get the partners!” he shouted above the</p><p>crazy din. “Smash the other partners and </p><p>the whole crowd will break!” </p><p> “Are ye no seein’ I ha’ got ane?” rum-</p><p>bled Lewis, sloshing in the water like a </p><p>hippopotamus. </p><p> He had a neck-hold on McGillivray, and</p><p>even though Sager leaped upon his back he </p><p>staggered out to the shallows, cast McGil- </p><p>livray into the saskatoon bushes like a </p><p>discarded sack and tore Sager off as a man </p><p>would pluck a climbing cat. </p><p> “Ane an’ twa!” he amended. “Where</p><p>are yon ithers?” </p><p> “Ba gar, here—dese two!” chuckled</p><p>Drummond as he and Galt backed the </p><p>McKenzies out on to the stranded ice-cakes </p><p>with their hammering gun-butts. </p><p> Jarvis was smiting McDougall with his</p><p>fists, fighting as he had fought many a Lon- </p><p>don street fight in the years that were gone. </p><p>He struck the Northwester at will upon the </p><p>face and neck, all that showed above the </p><p>rippling surface, but without warning </p><p>McDougall drove his knee under water into </p><p>Jarvis’ stomach and Jarvis staggered </p><p>violently back against the boom. </p><p> McDougall turned and madly splashed</p><p>ashore, while Jarvis gazed after him with a </p><p>surprise and agony on his Cockney face. </p><p> “Stryke me blind in the blinkers! That’s</p><p>a foul, I s’y!” he gasped and promptly col- </p><p>lapsed across the logs. </p><p> Up-river a tremendous shout burst out.</p><p>Carlisle wheeled waist-deep, and a trium- </p><p>phant laugh broke from him. </p><p> “Wells is coming!” he encouraged his</p><p>men. “Now, all together! Give them </p><p>blue perdition!”</p><p> Wells’ fleet was swinging ’round the</p><p>Devil’s Elbow at a dizzy speed, the canoes </p><p>boring forward in long jumps, throwing the </p><p>water aside in rolling ridges, the paddles </p><p>making the surface boil. They cheered </p><p>as they came, all the loud-throated men of </p><p>the Seepanock Channel, all the river </p><p>scouts he had picked up on his way </p><p>down. </p><p> “Skin for skin!” they roared to their</p><p>battling fellows, and immersed warriors </p><p>found breath to answer back. </p><p> “Long live the H. B. C.!”</p><p> Fresh and strong and numerous Wells’</p><p>force struck the Northwesters in the back, </p><p>and under the pressure of his advance they </p><p>scattered for the shore like a herd of caribou </p><p>to join their beaten leaders. Heading the </p><p>rout, Carlisle saw a bedraggled figure he </p><p>recognized, the hawk-nosed Dentaire with </p><p>his mustaches plastered over his cheeks. </p><p> “By Jove, there he is!” Carlisle cried.</p><p>“Look, Eugene. Look, Galt. Dentaire— </p><p>you remember? Did you ever know the </p><p>like of that? Ready to die of fear of small- </p><p>pox and never got it!” </p><p> Dentaire heard Carlisle’s laugh and took</p><p>it for an imputation on his bravery. </p><p> “Bon Dim, can we fight enemies with our</p><p>backs as well as our fronts? Also, it is of a </p><p>circumstance condemnable that our leaders </p><p>run away. It’s all over with us!” </p><p> He gesticulated frantically while all the</p><p>other partners cursed him as they drew out </p><p>the injured Todd and many more before </p><p>they broke and clawed a way up over the </p><p>benchland and off through the park lands. </p><p> “Missowa! Waseyawin!” Carlisle or-</p><p>dered. “Take the Indian hunters and </p><p>trail them well clear of the river. Without </p><p>canoes or many arms they’ll have to beat a </p><p>way south to the Assiniboine trails, so don’t </p><p>bother them an)' further than to see that </p><p>they keep moving. Lewis, take Jarvis and </p><p>the rest of the hurt men up to the </p><p>post.” </p><p> “You Galt have Spotted Deer get ready</p><p>to take my despatch to James Bay and then</p><p>get plenty of men to pry out that jam in the </p><p>chasm. This place ought to drain by night, </p><p>and we’ll pick the fur packs and gear off the </p><p>dry bottom. And you, Eugene, look after </p><p>the canoes and salvage what you can.” </p><p>Amid fresh, joyful shrieks from their </p><p>squaws, the hunters scrambled away on </p><p>their mission, and Lewis and Galt set about </p><p>their respective tasks, while Carlisle waded </p><p>back to the boom with Eugene. </p><p> Since the struggle began, he had had no</p><p>opportunity to even glance aside to where </p><p>he had left the others, but now he saw them </p><p>in the same spot, Andrews bent over the </p><p>prostrate Richelieu lying on the logs, </p><p>Wayne standing beside with his rifle-butt </p><p>grounded and Joan beckoning with anxious </p><p>hands. </p><p> “Diable!” exclaimed Eugene. “W’at she</p><p>be want now? W’at’s wrong dere? I ain’t </p><p>be see any wan.” </p><p>Ambush </p><p>73 </p><p> “It’s Richelieu,” deduced Carlisle. “He</p><p>must be badly hurt. Go on and attend to </p><p>the canoes, Eugene, before they get </p><p>smashed up with floating ice.” </p><p> He lunged ahead whereTodd’s canoe with</p><p>Richelieu’s broken flagstaff in the bow lay </p><p>half-crushed against the boom and drew </p><p>himself up dripping on the logs. </p><p> “What’s the matter, Joan,” he asked.</p><p>“Is he badly wounded?” </p><p> “Andrews says he’s going to die,” she told</p><p>him. “And he wants you. Hurry up!” </p><p>“Here, Paul,” begged Andrews, “stand </p><p>over where he can see you.” </p><p>CARLISLE stepped over with Joan </p><p>to where her father leaned on his </p><p>rifle by Richelieu’s side. The North- </p><p>wester lay in the groove between two of the </p><p>three rows of logs in the triple boom, his </p><p>shoulders supported by Andrews. At first </p><p>glance Carlisle noted where Wayne’s bullet </p><p>had pierced his uniform high and to the left </p><p>of the middle of his breast. </p><p> There was little blood staining it above,</p><p>but underneath the bark was red, and his </p><p>breathing came in long irregular gasps. </p><p>His black-bearded face was somber with an </p><p>unearthly somberness on account of the </p><p>pallor of the skin wherein the sunken pox- </p><p>pits showed a bluish tinge. His eyelids lay </p><p>shut, but at Andrews’ whisper he opened </p><p>them and stared weakly up into Carlisle’s </p><p>wondering face. </p><p> “Dieu!” he murmured, his eyes turning</p><p>to Andrews. “It is my last breath, and it </p><p>is good that it goes into confession, Father. </p><p>I have lived in sin. That goes without say- </p><p>ing. But I will not sink eternally into hell. </p><p>Oui, and that is why I make confession </p><p>openly and to all.” </p><p> He paused, breathing heavily, while his</p><p>eyes went back to Carlisle, to Joan and </p><p>then to Wayne. </p><p> “It was I, Wayne,” he confessed with</p><p>electrifying unexpectedness. “That day, </p><p>in the Wyoming Valley—that old day of </p><p>Butler’s Raid! Mon Dieu, you knew I</p><p>loved her, but you did not know how much. </p><p>I was young. I was a lieutenant. I was </p><p>mad. In the panic of the raid I thought to </p><p>make her ride away with me, but she was </p><p>true. Ciel, yes, she was true, and I-” </p><p> He stopped, and Wayne gazed at him as</p><p>a man of stone, an inanimate thing that </p><p>can not comprehend. Then, sudden as his </p><p>wrath, the full import of Richelieu’s words </p><p>flashed upon him, and he changed from a </p><p>man of stone to a livid, quivering demon. </p><p>Often as Carlisle had seen him in anger, he </p><p>had never seen anything like the light that </p><p>instantly fused his fawn-green eyes to incan- </p><p>descence. </p><p> It was as if all the fires of hell suddenly</p><p>struck them and were glanced back. He </p><p>opened his mouth, but not a word came </p><p>forth. Then with an animal-like snarl he </p><p>raised his rifle like a giant pestle in both </p><p>hands, the butt poising over Richelieu’s </p><p>head as if to stamp out some vermin or </p><p>reptile, some monstrous abortion that he </p><p>had glimpsed in all its vileness. </p><p> Carlisle and Joan threw themselves upon</p><p>him from either hand, Carlisle’s grip locking </p><p>his arms to his side. He raged like a fiend, </p><p>but the Factor’s great strength held him </p><p>back, their bodies swaying from side to side </p><p>on the logs, and as they swayed Richelieu </p><p>began to speak again. </p><p> “Voila! And then I lied. I took you,</p><p>Wayne, and told my story but named an- </p><p>other man. I hated him. Oui, you do not </p><p>know howl hated then, in my youth. I hated </p><p>Charlie Carlisle for I knew he loved her too. </p><p>So I laid my wrong upon him because he </p><p>could not deny. Comment? No, he could </p><p>not deny, wounded and drunk as he was. </p><p>They were all drunk that day, and he knew </p><p>not whether he fought man, woman or child, </p><p>one or one thousand of them.” </p><p> “My God!” breathed Carlisle, swift anger</p><p>overwhelming the vibrant thrill that Riche- </p><p>lieu’s first words had sent pulsing through </p><p>him. “You did that?” </p><p> He loosed his grip from Wayne, and oddly</p><p>enough the surge of wrath in Carlisle left </p><p>Wayne quiescent. He was a man of stone </p><p>once more with one hand pressing on his</p><p>rifle barrel, the other hand passed around </p><p>Joan’s waist. </p><p> Carlisle leaned over Richelieu, his face</p><p>contorted with mingled emotion, righteous </p><p>indignation, horror, disgust, suspense. </p><p> “My God, man—you did that?” he re-</p><p>peated. </p><p> “Oui,” and the head nodded feebly, “but</p><p>I knew his life would not be worth a franc </p><p>while Wayne knew he was alive, and I had </p><p>blood enough on my hands. So I smuggled </p><p>him away till the heat of the day had died </p><p>out of him, and then I told him what he </p><p>had done.” </p><p> “You incarnate fiend!” choked Carlisle,</p><p>for into hs mind rose the vision of his father </p><p>74 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>as he had known him—tall, straight, hand- </p><p>some, the pride of his boyish eyes in the </p><p>dashing uniform of a captain of the Rangers. </p><p> “Just so! He knew he would not have</p><p>his life long if he stayed. And who could </p><p>face his friends or his own flesh with that </p><p>stain upon him? He disappeared, and one </p><p>day a priest came into the post of Niagara </p><p>to care for his boy.” </p><p> “Who, pray?”</p><p> “Father Andrews, here!”</p><p> Carlisle leaned lower, his face abruptly</p><p>charged with red blood. </p><p> “And he lived—lives yet?” he demanded.</p><p>“Why not? I have lived—till now. </p><p>Wayne lives. Why not Charlie Carlisle? </p><p>Take my word for it. If you don’t take my </p><p>word for it, ask Father Andrews here. </p><p>Charlie Carlisle paid him to keep his se- </p><p>cret and to raise you, and he knows. But </p><p>be quick. I am weakening fast, and An- </p><p>drews must give me absolution.” </p><p> “Andrews—Andrews!” cried Carlisle, torn</p><p>with emotion. “My father’s alive?” </p><p>“Yes, Paul—yes.” </p><p> “You know where he is?”</p><p> “Yes.”</p><p> “And you’ll take me to him now—I mean,</p><p>soon, without delay?” </p><p> “Yes, soon,” promised Andrews. “When</p><p>we go down to Grande Portage I’ll take you </p><p>to him. Now go, quickly. Don’t you see </p><p>Richelieu’s at his last breath?” </p><p> Andrews bent over Richelieu to give him</p><p>final absolution, and Carlisle with his heart </p><p>in a tumult and his face alight turned away </p><p>to Wayne and Joan. Joan’s eyes were shin- </p><p>ing into his through a film of moisture, but </p><p>Wayne still stood like an image staring </p><p>stonily at the strange confessional. Then </p><p>he raised his eyes to Carlisle’s and put out </p><p>his gnarled hand. </p><p> “Richelieu isn’t the only one who wronged</p><p>you, Carlisle!” he exclaimed with a depth of </p><p>feeling that shook his chest. “I’ve put a </p><p>terrible wrong on you—on both you and </p><p>your father.” </p><p> “But, Wayne, you can make it right,”</p><p>smiled Carlisle, clasping the gnarled fist </p><p>with one hand and significantly taking </p><p>Joan’s soft palm with the other. “All in a </p><p>minute you can make it right.” </p><p> Wayne looked from one to the other, and</p><p>an ancient tenderness, a memory of van- </p><p>ished years, seemed to creep into his stony, </p><p>mahogany face. His mask broke suddenly, </p><p>and the tears ran down his cheeks. </p><p> “By the Doom, Carlisle,” he muttered,</p><p>laying his hands upon their shoulders, “I </p><p>make it right.” </p><p>CHAPTER XIV </p><p>IN THE TEMPLE OF THE WILD </p><p> GRANDE PORTAGE at last, father!”</p><p>exclaimed Joan, using words she had </p><p>used a full year before as the Factor’s craft </p><p>grazed the Port Charlotte landing on the </p><p>Pigeon River’s bank. “It is good to get </p><p>the canoe cramps out.” </p><p> “Yes, Joan,” nodded Wayne, a smile</p><p>cracking the grim mahogany of his face as </p><p>recollection stirred within him. “It’s been </p><p>a long day, but there’s a nine-mile walk to </p><p>stretch your legs.” </p><p> “And not a packer to clutter up the trail!”</p><p>laughed Carlisle, giving Joan his hand to </p><p>help her out. “Look at Port Charlotte— </p><p>empty as a last year’s bird’s nest! Look </p><p>at the Portage—deserted to the skyline I </p><p>We’ll have a quick passage over.” </p><p> Twelve months ago he had gone into</p><p>Cumberland House with a lone canoe. Now </p><p>he had come out down the Saskatchewan, </p><p>Lake Winnipeg, through the Winnipeg </p><p>River, the Lake of the Woods, Rainy Lake </p><p>and the Pigeon River with a fleet of fifteen </p><p>hundred paddles. As he turned off up the </p><p>trail with Joan, followed by Wayne and </p><p>Andrews, he waved a sign to his brigade </p><p>leader Drummond to unload the massed </p><p>brigades and pack over after him. </p><p> Side by side in the warm glow of the July</p><p>evening he and Joan climbed up over the </p><p>three miles of gentle convolutions that </p><p>terraced the way to the loftiest ridge before </p><p>they looked back, and when they glanced </p><p>around they beheld an unbroken line of </p><p>pack-laden men crawling upward with the </p><p>slow, peculiar, bobbing motion that packs </p><p>in the tump-line impart. </p><p> The sight brought home more clearly to</p><p>Joan the memory of that other evening when </p><p>Carlisle and Andrews had come over the </p><p>Portage with their warning, and she began </p><p>to laugh softly in low, throaty notes that </p><p>blended with songs of the thrushes by the </p><p>trailside. </p><p> “Do you remember, Paul, how you came</p><p>to tell us the Portage was closed? You were </p><p>a Northwest mail courier in black cotton </p><p>shirt, mackinaw trousers, cowhide mocca- </p><p>sins and a battered, blue felt hat. Yes, and </p><p>Ambush </p><p>75 </p><p>your face was stained as brown as an In- </p><p>dian’s. Do you remember?” </p><p> “Yes,” nodded Carlisle, “I remember that</p><p>masquerade, all right, and I remember how </p><p>I cursed it when you came.” </p><p> “Why?” she teased, “because it was so</p><p>dirty?” </p><p> “No, you cherished hypocrite, because I</p><p>wanted you to know me as I was. I wanted </p><p>to stand in the skin God gave me.” </p><p>“Conceited thing!” Joan bantered. “As </p><p>if that amounted to much! And as if I </p><p>cared at all!” </p><p> She fluted out her laughter freely as she</p><p>darted down the Grande Portage slope of </p><p>the trail, away from the reach of his im- </p><p>pulsive arm. Graceful as a fawn she ran, </p><p>breaking into song in the sheer joy of her </p><p>surroundings and inner being, and Carlisle, </p><p>his heart singing too in anticipation of the </p><p>union and the reunion that was to be, sprang </p><p>lightly after. </p><p> They swish-swished in their moccasins</p><p>across the corduroy paths of the beaver </p><p>meadows, over the small, bridged creeks, </p><p>down the hundred-foot gulches that dropped </p><p>like steps toward Lake Superior. Through </p><p>the patches of poplar and birch and the </p><p>heart of the grand pinery they descended, </p><p>now slowly to a walk, now quickening to a </p><p>run till they traversed the last mile of the </p><p>long slope and came out into the clearing </p><p>close to the Northwest post. </p><p> As at Port Charlotte and along the whole</p><p>length of the Portage, there was not a man </p><p>to be seen. Yet men had been here not </p><p>long before, for in the canoe harbor the re- </p><p>covered fur sloop Otter and many big Rab- </p><p>iscaw canoes from Montreal were tied, and </p><p>upon the curving sand beach burned the </p><p>evening fires of the canoemen. </p><p> Breathing themselves while they waited</p><p>for the others, Carlisle and Joan stared at </p><p>the scene before them with the sympathetic </p><p>eyes of children blooded to the wild. Afar </p><p>surged the vast green expanse of Lake Su- </p><p>perior gilded with the molten wash of gold </p><p>spilled over the high, wooded mainland</p><p>ridge where the Pigeon River brawled down </p><p>to its rest on the mighty bosom, scrolled </p><p>with its white-crested waves. </p><p> Nearer at hand spread the channel, a</p><p>mile and one-quarter wide, screened by the </p><p>tree-crowned island that almost yielded to </p><p>the primeval embrace of the mainland. </p><p>As they had seen it a year ago, so they saw </p><p>it now, the sheltering island with its rubble </p><p>of great, gnarled boulders littering the </p><p>beach, its long, sloping point sheering up and </p><p>its rampart of bush standing solid above. </p><p> Their eyes followed the amphitheater of</p><p>the bay, a crescent sweep of shallow water, </p><p>delicate green in color and clear as air, edged </p><p>by a low, flat shore that was backed in turn </p><p>by terraced Laurentian hills. </p><p> Tier upon tier the hills rose as of old, the</p><p>lowest three hundred feet in height, the </p><p>highest over one thousand, covered with </p><p>crowding forest of birch and spruce and </p><p>pine thrusting out virgin arms to embrace </p><p>the lesser island. Yonder was the natural </p><p>barrier, the forty-foot cliff of rock walling </p><p>the back of the level shore land and curving </p><p>westward into the lake. Not a tree or a </p><p>stone was changed or gone! </p><p> Along the eastern side foamed the small</p><p>stream in unvaried volume, and there, with- </p><p>out addition or diminution the post build- </p><p>ings crouched behind their eighteen-foot </p><p>cedar palings with the gate fast closed, </p><p>while the same tent villages and teepees and </p><p>cabins dotted the eastern bank of the stream </p><p>with the same cattle grazing on the meadows </p><p>and terraces farther back. </p><p> In the midst of their silent gazing they</p><p>heard the feet of Wayne and Andrews and </p><p>the packers behind, and with one accord </p><p>they moved on along the path that led to </p><p>the closed gate of the post. </p><p>EIGHTEEN feet in the air Thomp- </p><p>son’s quizzical Welsh face peered </p><p>down at them over the top of the </p><p>palisades. </p><p> “By St. John, Carlisle!” he greeted.</p><p>“Art here, then? Had word of ’ee. Hast </p><p>come in peace or in war?” </p><p> “In peace, Dawy, old friend,” laughed</p><p>Carlisle. “There’s no need to trouble you. </p><p>Open the gate.” </p><p> “Ha! Is good news,” grinned Dawy.</p><p>“Wouldst not want tuh slaying of all with </p><p>my own hands. Am all alone here.” </p><p>Joan, Carlisle and the rest burst into </p><p>hearty laughter as Thompson’s head dis- </p><p>appeared from the palisades to reappear a </p><p>moment later in the open entrance. </p><p> “That was a bold front you put on for a</p><p>solitary man, Dawy,” chaffed Carlisle </p><p>shaking his hand prodigiously. “I won- </p><p>dered why Port Charlotte and the Portage </p><p>were deserted.” </p><p> “Word of thy doings came down tuh</p><p>waterways,” Thompson explained, “and </p><p>76 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>not a man wouldst stay. The Eastern </p><p>partners wouldst not come past tuh Kam- </p><p>inistiquia, and tuh Indians and tuh Mon- </p><p>treal paddlers here took to tuh bush.” </p><p> “They don’t need to be alarmed,” Car-</p><p>lisle assured him. “All we want is a peaceful </p><p>passage. You see, Dawy, the Hudson’s </p><p>Bay Company has smashed the North- </p><p>westers to pieces in the hinterland, and the </p><p>absorption of the pieces will not be long </p><p>delayed. Amalgamation is coming, old </p><p>friend, and you yourself will be back with </p><p>us again.” </p><p> “By St. John! Dost say so, old roamer?</p><p>Wilt not grieve me any if canst keep clear </p><p>of Colen. Hast loved thee like a brother, </p><p>Carlisle, and wilt go with a good heart if tuh </p><p>Hudson’s Bay takes tuh Northwest Com- </p><p>pany over. Wilt be no trade this Summer </p><p>anyway, so wast thinking of going West to </p><p>hew a new pass over tuh Rockies.” </p><p> “Then you’ll hew it for the Hudson’s Bay</p><p>Company in the end, Dawy.” </p><p> Thompson shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>“What matter, Carlisle? Tuh land is big- </p><p>ger than any institution, is greater than its </p><p>furs. Wilt be an empire in tuh end of all. </p><p>And thou? Art going to James Bay?” </p><p>“Yes, Davyy.” </p><p> “Art stopping tuh night here?”</p><p> “No, we’ll travel the lake when the breeze</p><p>dies down. Tomorrow we may have to lie </p><p>up wind-bound on the shore. Will you give </p><p>Miss Wayne and Father Andrews the use of </p><p>your post for a few minutes? She wants to </p><p>put on another dress, and Andrews a new </p><p>cassock.” </p><p> “Wilt give me pleasure,” agreed Thomp-</p><p>son, saluting Joan and the others gravely. </p><p>“But what is tuh purpose?” </p><p> “Dawy,” smiled Carlisle, “the last time</p><p>I was here as a mail courier, I had a hand in </p><p>saving a certain young lady from being </p><p>carried off against her will. Now she’s </p><p>being carried off with her own consent.” </p><p>Thompson’s eyes opened wide, his face </p><p>creased in a grin of remembrance and com-</p><p>prehension, and he suddenly extended his </p><p>hand to the girl. </p><p> “Ha! Is that, then? Wilt congratulate</p><p>you, Miss Wayne. Yon dirty courier is lucky </p><p>man. Art most beautiful woman hast ever </p><p>seen. Come in. Wilt give ’ee my own house </p><p>for tuh purpose, you and tuh priest.” </p><p> He led Joan and Andrews inside, while</p><p>Carlisle and Wayne passed on to the beach </p><p>where the first packers were letting down </p><p>the canoes and fur bales and more and more </p><p>were arriving every minute in the gathering </p><p>dusk and slipping their tump-lines to the </p><p>ground. </p><p> Carlisle knew such a freight of fur</p><p>throughout the whole history of the fur </p><p>trade had never come over the Grande Por- </p><p>tage in a single season. Not only the vast </p><p>catch of the Hudson’s Bay Company was in </p><p>transit but also the large take of the North- </p><p>west Company which he had captured from </p><p>Richelieu, the McKenzies, Todd, McLeod, </p><p>McDougall, McGillivray and Sager in the </p><p>Devil’s Elbow. </p><p> Their yearly turnover, greater than any</p><p>other turnover known in America, had </p><p>turned to his hands, and it would continue </p><p>to so turn. Vast as had been the institution </p><p>of the Northwesters, it was, like the trust of </p><p>the Free-Traders, shaken to its foundations </p><p>by a combination of organized warfare and </p><p>Divine visitation. </p><p> The Montreal brigades of rivermen were</p><p>here, slinking in the woods, but this year </p><p>the Northmen from the Pays d’en Haut </p><p>would not gather to meet them. </p><p>GRANDE PORTAGE was an open </p><p>road, not a private gateway to the </p><p>West, and though it would be used </p><p>for some time by his company as an entre- </p><p>pot for inland business and as an outlet on </p><p>Superior, Carlisle saw in his mind’s eye a </p><p>changing of the routes by which the fur </p><p>would all flow to Hudson’s Bay instead of to </p><p>Montreal. </p><p> He pictured the dwindling of the Grande</p><p>Portage, the spot where the brains of the </p><p>Northwest Company had been situated </p><p>though its nominal headquarters pulsed in </p><p>Beaver Hall, the spot from which the ruth-</p><p>less power of the organization was distrib- </p><p>uted in stupendous ramifications, like </p><p>electric energy from a distant waterfall. </p><p>And in the end he saw the post dismantled, </p><p>its foundations buried in the sand and scrub, </p><p>the Portage unused, the Western highway </p><p>forgotten! </p><p> Something of the same thought was run-</p><p>ning through Wayne’s mind as he watched </p><p>the packing down and the relaunching </p><p>and reloading of the canoes, and Carlisle, </p><p>turning to speak to him, caught it in </p><p>his eye. </p><p> “You see it too, Wayne?” he ventured.</p><p>“You see the glory departing from this </p><p>place?” </p><p>Ambush </p><p>77 </p><p> “Yes, it’s sure to go down now,” proph-</p><p>esied Wayne, his eyes fixed seer-like, “and </p><p>the first wagon-road linking up the East and </p><p>the West will carve its epitaph.” </p><p>“Sometimes I see a road of my own,” </p><p>Carlisle confided, “from the Pays d’en Haut </p><p>to Hudson’s Bay. Yes, and sometimes I </p><p>even see the shoals of the bay gouged out </p><p>and a regular fleet of ships sailing there. </p><p>It’s going to be as Thompson says, a coun- </p><p>try bigger than any individual, bigger than </p><p>any institution, an empire in the end. </p><p>Furthermore it’s going to be an empire no </p><p>man can be ashamed of, Wayne. Why not </p><p>have a hand in its making?” </p><p> Wayne shook his head disconsolately.</p><p>“No, I’m going back when we reach </p><p>Michipicoten, back to the Wyoming Valley. </p><p>It was unrest drove me out, Carlisle. It’s </p><p>rest, content, that’s taking me home.” </p><p>“But you’ll come sometimes, come to see </p><p>her?” </p><p> “Every year in the Spring—when the</p><p>wanderlust stirs! During the months I </p><p>won’t see her, I tell you I’ll be very lonely, </p><p>Carlisle. But don’t let her know that. </p><p>Never a word. Look out—here she comes!” </p><p>She was coming out of the post with </p><p>Thompson and Andrews and time was sud- </p><p>denly telescoped for Carlisle. He beheld </p><p>her as he had first beheld her that evening </p><p>she had stepped out of her father’s canoe at </p><p>Port Charlotte, and as he gazed at her he </p><p>had the mystic feeling that this was that </p><p>very moment. There had been no long, </p><p>hard, danger-ridden months, no bitter blood </p><p>feud, no deadly rivalry between. </p><p> Here glided her swelling-hipped, full-</p><p>bosomed figure, erect, agile, supple in poise, </p><p>with the graceful strength in the curves of </p><p>the limbs, as it had first glided into his con- </p><p>sciousness. Here shimmered her radiant </p><p>hair, yellow, wheaten, spun-gold all in one, </p><p>like the mingling hues of the birchen leaves </p><p>in Autumn, framing the laughing-eyed, </p><p>crimson-sprayed, red-lipped face. </p><p> Only, she wore the clinging champagne-</p><p>colored dress of silk that she had worn at </p><p>Andrews’ first open-air service on the shores </p><p>of Pine Island Lake, the snow-white doe- </p><p>skin half-moccasins peeping from under-</p><p>neath, the single jewel at her throat. </p><p> Carlisle caught his breath deeply as he</p><p>walked out with Wayne upon the shoreway </p><p>of the canoe pier, his ermine canoe-robe </p><p>over his shoulder. On the eastern or harbor </p><p>arm of the cribwork that extended but </p><p>halfway back to land he spread the robe for </p><p>Joan’s feet and stood upon it with her, </p><p>Wayne at their side, Andrews in front. </p><p> In the crystal-clear water of the canoe</p><p>harbor at their feet floated his huge six- </p><p>fathom craft with the Hudson’s Bay Com- </p><p>pany’s crimson flag in the bow, his own </p><p>streaming gonfalon in the stern. His tried </p><p>crew were poised in their places, Waseyawin </p><p>in the bow, Missowa in the stern, the two </p><p>middlemen paired forward, the two others </p><p>paired aft, their paddle shafts decorated </p><p>with the gaudy woolen streamers, their </p><p>bright-beaded moccasins, gay leggins, flam- </p><p>ing belts and scarfs flashing many hues, </p><p>their black-haired, fillet-bound heads car- </p><p>tying the long, graceful, slanting, violent- </p><p>colored plumes that proclaimed them Fac- </p><p>tor’s canoemen. </p><p> Close beside nosed the canoes of the</p><p>officers, Galt, Drummond, Lewis, Garry, </p><p>Lea, Jarvis, Hampton, Wells, while behind </p><p>them the massed brigades covered the </p><p>entire canoe harbor, the blood-red stars </p><p>burning upon their warm-yellow bows like </p><p>the fires upon the beach. </p><p> Alone by the fires stood Thompson, sole</p><p>guest of the Northwest Company till pres- </p><p>ently the Montreal brigades lurking in the </p><p>woods on either hand took heart to emerge. </p><p>They had marked the Hudson’s Bay fleet </p><p>all afloat, marked how things were shaping </p><p>on the pier and crept out, three hundred and </p><p>fifty of them, to gather silently ’round on </p><p>the sandy flat—the giant Pork Eaters, </p><p>French voyageurs off the Ottawa River </p><p>and the parishes around, Iroquois Indians, </p><p>Caughnawaga Indians, the famed rivermen </p><p>of the Rabiscaws. </p><p>A TAMED, voiceless host they </p><p>gathered, for this season their car- </p><p>nival among the Northmen would </p><p>not ring, their carousal would not rage, with </p><p>their songs and their boissons and their dev- </p><p>iltry, and for them the code of the law was </p><p>written farther than the Sault.</p><p> They stared in wonder while the same</p><p>priest they had seen in Grande Portage the </p><p>year before raised his voice from the rude </p><p>altar of the canoe pier in the spruce-walled, </p><p>starry-naved temple of the wild. </p><p> “On the winds of the wilderness and to</p><p>you dwellers in the wilderness,” he de- </p><p>claimed, “I publish the banns!” </p><p> Sonorously Andrews’ voice sounded as</p><p>he went on to complete the ceremony, and </p><p>78 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>even as he finished the shade of Bertand </p><p>the Montreal mail courier seemed to rise </p><p>from the depths of Grande Portage Bay. </p><p> There came the snoring surge of waters</p><p>swiftly cloven, a triumphant yell out of the </p><p>lakeward dark, the thump of a quickly- </p><p>wielded paddle upon a canoe gunwale, and </p><p>the next instant a lone birchbark craft tore </p><p>through the water-gate of the pier and </p><p>spilled its lone occupant on the cribwork at </p><p>their feet. </p><p> “Spotted Deer!” exclaimed Carlisle, rec-</p><p>ognizing the Cree dispatch-bearer he had </p><p>sent down to James Bay by the Hayes with </p><p>the report of victory for the governor. </p><p> “Ae,” replied Spotted Deer, “with the</p><p>sun and the stars I have paddled to meet </p><p>you here.” </p><p> He held out a dispatch that bore the</p><p>governor’s seal. </p><p> Hastily Carlisle broke it open and glanced</p><p>it over in the red flare that the camp-fires </p><p>sent across the water. His hand shook a </p><p>little as he passed it on to Andrews. </p><p> “Read it out, Andrews,” he begged. “It</p><p>concerns them all as well as me.” </p><p> Andrews read aloud:</p><p> I was overjoyed to get the news of the North-</p><p>westers’ defeat. Its consequences will be far-reach- </p><p>ing indeed. It means no less than the conserving </p><p>of our charter till such time as we see fit to surrender </p><p>it. It means the founding of a Western empire </p><p>which we shall pioneer. </p><p> Words can not express my delight and my satis-</p><p>faction at the trust I had in you, and I want to </p><p>record that trust in a more material way. As I </p><p>wrote you, the James Bay climate has been hard on </p><p>me. The doctor here at York Factory says I have </p><p>no option but to leave. </p><p> So I must sail on the London fur vessel this</p><p>Summer. I shall earn,- my resignation with me, and </p><p>you I have appointed temporary governor in my </p><p>stead till I reach England and have the London </p><p>Committee ratify the appointment. Any appoint- </p><p>ments you- may think due those under you, I shall</p><p>also slate accordingly, as one of my last acts before </p><p>giving up the governorship. </p><p> Spotted Deer speaks of a rumor that runs hinting</p><p>of another honor you will win. My sincerest con- </p><p>gratulations and the hope to see you both soon! I </p><p>am arranging a grand reception for you when you </p><p>reach James Bay. </p><p> “Paul—Paul!” breathed Joan tensely,</p><p>while Carlisle, his eyes shining into hers, </p><p>mutely pressed her hands. </p><p> “You dwellers in the wilderness, I intro-</p><p>duce Governor Carlisle and his wife!” an- </p><p>nounced Andrews, handing the dispatch </p><p>back and stepping aside. </p><p> From the massed brigades a vociferous</p><p>cheer thundered out, and simultaneously </p><p>the fifteen hundred paddles poised in per- </p><p>pendicular salute, the crimson firelight </p><p>flashing from the blades. </p><p> Carlisle acknowledged the salute with</p><p>upraised hand and began to speak in res- </p><p>onant tones fraught with deep emotion. </p><p> “Men of the Hudson’s Bay, I take the</p><p>governor at his word. You have earned </p><p>more than any men may get in this world, </p><p>but this much at least may be yours. To </p><p>Galt, Lewis, Lea, Garry, Hampton, Jarvis, </p><p>and Wells I give the permanent Factorships, </p><p>of Cumberland House, the Pas, the Nep- </p><p>owin, Moose Lake, Chimawawin, Grand </p><p>Rapids and the Carrot River. </p><p> “Waseyawin, Missowa and their middle-</p><p>men are no longer Factor’s crew. They are </p><p>governor’s crew, and to the middlemen I </p><p>add Smoking Pine and Spotted Deer. </p><p>And you, Drummond, I make chief brigade </p><p>Leader of all the Hudson’s Bay Company’s </p><p>brigades.” </p><p> A second time the vociferous cheer thun-</p><p>dered out, the generous-hearted tribute of </p><p>the brigade men to these honored officers, </p><p>and the officers in grim pride acknowledged </p><p>the tribute—all but Eugene Drummond. </p><p> His diable mystery was dissolving at last,</p><p>and, unthinking of his high appointment, </p><p>his volatile face worked, his milk-white teeth </p><p>gleamed, his thin nostrils quivered, his coal- </p><p>black eyes danced as he stared at Andrews </p><p>on the pier loosing the cord to drop his</p><p>brand-new cassock and pull away the mos- </p><p>quito veil. </p><p> “Mon Dieu!” cried Eugene, gesticulating</p><p>with outstretched finger and streaming his </p><p>raven hair this way and that with nervous </p><p>head jerks. “Mon Dieu—look there!” </p><p> Carlisle, Joan and Wayne wheeled swiftly,</p><p>but Andrews was not there. </p><p> By the discarded cassock and mosquito</p><p>veil stood a tall, straight, handsome, gray- </p><p>haired, grave-faced stranger in the ancient </p><p>but dashing uniform of Butler’s Rangers. </p><p> “By the Doom—Captain Charles Car-</p><p>lisle!” identified Wayne. </p><p>THE FETISH STICK </p><p> Edgar^k&amp;Ilace</p><p>Author of “The Fluent Adventurer," “The Sleuth,” etc. </p><p>IEWED from the sea the head- </p><p>quarters of Mr. Commissioner </p><p>Sanders was a strip of golden sand </p><p>fringed to the seaward side by a </p><p>green backing of trees. You caught a </p><p>glimpse of the white residency with its </p><p>red roof and on a very clear day the little </p><p>flagstaff where the national standard hung </p><p>limply. Perhaps you might even see the </p><p>long rows of yellow barrack huts where the </p><p>Housas lived, but you saw little more. </p><p> Officers of passing steamers which came</p><p>sufficiently near the west African coast </p><p>would point out the mouth of the river and </p><p>show the passengers how the yellow waters </p><p>ran far out, cutting a muddy roadway into </p><p>the indigo-blue of the sea and sometimes </p><p>a mail steamer would slow down and drop </p><p>into a waiting surf-boat a small mail-bag. </p><p> But the territories and the three white</p><p>men who ruled them had no personality </p><p>to the ocean-going wanderers until a certain </p><p>day when a beneficent Government placed </p><p>in the hands of the commissioner a means </p><p>by which he and his fellows might become </p><p>at least articulate. </p><p> Lieutenant Tibbetts coming to breakfast</p><p>one fiery morning discovered a folded sheet </p><p>of foolscap paper beneath his plate. </p><p> “Ha, Monday, sir!” said he with an</p><p>extravagant start, as though the discovery </p><p>that this was indeed the second day of the </p><p>week came in the nature of a shock, “and </p><p>orders of the week as per regulations.” </p><p> “Read ’em you lazy do—fellow,” said</p><p>Hamilton, catching his sister’s reproving </p><p>eye. </p><p> “Quite unnecessary, my jolly old tyrant,”</p><p>said Bones airily, as he shook his serviette </p><p>free with a loud “/lap!” and all but caught </p><p>Mr. Commissioner Sanders’ coffee-cup. </p><p>“Quite superfluous—I know ’em by heart: </p><p> “‘i. The orderly officer of the week is</p><p>poor old Bones, who will do everything </p><p>every day.</p><p> “ ‘2. Field trainin’ will be carried out on</p><p>Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday an’ Saturday </p><p>under the command of poor old Bones. </p><p> “ ‘3. Kit inspection on Thursday. Bones</p><p>will arrange. </p><p>“ ‘By order.’ ” </p><p> “Read it,” suggested Hamilton.</p><p> With a hoist of his shoulders Bones</p><p>opened the paper and read. </p><p> “ ‘Orderly officer for the week: Lt. Tib-</p><p>betts’—what did I say? ‘Field trainin’ in </p><p>accordance with paragraph’—um—um—‘Lt. </p><p>Tibbetts’—as expected—hullo, dear old </p><p>sir—what’s this? </p><p> “ ‘3. On the erection of the new flagstaff</p><p>and signal yard, Lt. Tibbetts will assume </p><p>79 </p><p>8o </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the duties of 0. C. Signals. He will be </p><p>responsible for the maintenance in good </p><p>condition of the signal locker and flags, </p><p>code books-’ ” </p><p> “They are sending the pole down from</p><p>H.	Q. administration,” explained Hamil-</p><p>ton, “and it should be up by the end of </p><p>the week—do you know anything about </p><p>signals, Bones?” </p><p> Bones smiled.</p><p> “I think I may say in all modesty, dear</p><p>old sir,” he said with fine carelessness, </p><p>“that there’s jolly little I don’t know about </p><p>signals. I hate to boast, dear old Ham, </p><p>as you’ve often said-” </p><p> “I’ve never said anything so untruthful—</p><p>but I should not let that discourage you,” </p><p>interrupted Hamilton, “nor should it divert </p><p>your mind from the fact that I asked you </p><p>a very simple question to which you have </p><p>not yet replied. Do you understand sig- </p><p>nals?” </p><p> “I won’t deceive you,” said Bones</p><p>solemnly, “I do.” </p><p>AND this he proved, for when the </p><p>great new flagstaff had been erected, </p><p>and the Government tug which had </p><p>towed the pole to the beach had turned </p><p>its nose for home, Bones, with the aid of </p><p>the Government code-book, signalled— </p><p>“Wish you pleasant voyage.” </p><p> Whereupon the tug spun ’round and came</p><p>back at full speed. </p><p> “The' signal flags H.L.M.I., sir,” said</p><p>the exasperated skipper of the tug, “do not </p><p>mean ‘Wish you pleasant voyage,’ but </p><p>‘return at once; natives are in revolt.’ ” </p><p>“Dear me!” said Bones, “how jolly </p><p>romantic!” </p><p> And so the tug went off again and Bones</p><p>undeterred sent a string of flags fluttering </p><p>up to the yard which the skipper read— </p><p>“Am short of coal—can you tow me?”</p><p>Which he rightly interpreted as being some- </p><p>thing rather complimentary in farewell </p><p>messages. </p><p> Bones not only took kindly to his new</p><p>job, but it became for him an absorbing </p><p>passion. Not only did he spend his spare </p><p>hours poring over the Government and </p><p>mercantile codes, but he invented a code of </p><p>his own. </p><p> Not only had he signal flags, but in a</p><p>great box, each enclosed in a neat canvas </p><p>bag, were the ensigns of the nations “for </p><p>employment”—said the printed instruc- </p><p>tions—“in saluting war vessels, governors, </p><p>commissioners, etc., of foreign powers.” </p><p>“Some of ’em wholly superfluous, dear </p><p>old sir,” he complained, “unless we receive </p><p>a visit from the Swiss fleet or hobnob with </p><p>the jolly old King of Siam—an’ who the </p><p>dooce am I to salute with the German </p><p>Royal Standard? With a war like this </p><p>going on it can’t be done, dear old thing!” </p><p>Life had a new interest not only for </p><p>himself, but for every native within ten </p><p>miles of the station. Visitors and residents </p><p>alike would gather about the flagstaff and </p><p>watch Bones as he played with his new toy. </p><p>And one of these visitors was the son of </p><p>the sister of a certain Buluta, and a no- </p><p>torious thief. </p><p> Of this small fact Bones was oblivious</p><p>in the ecstasy of new discoveries, for he </p><p>found friends which in olden days moved </p><p>outside of his orbit. He sent astounding </p><p>greetings to little old tramps that came </p><p>rolling over the edge of the ocean, spoke </p><p>hilariously to passing liners which answered </p><p>briefly and often coldly—the “affirmative” </p><p>in answer to a sixteen-flag message was little </p><p>short of a snub—and once when a lean gray </p><p>American warship came nosing out of </p><p>nowhere looking for submarines Bones </p><p>surpassed himself in a cordial greeting </p><p>which ran, literally: </p><p>D. Y.D. has arrived at this port. </p><p>S. </p><p>Y. </p><p>L. </p><p>X. Have cavalry chargers on board.</p><p>A. </p><p>B. </p><p>T. </p><p>S. Am carrying feathers and hats. </p><p>Y. </p><p>R. </p><p>U. </p><p>G.

If Sanders were here he’d under- </p><p>stand it in a minute. I’ve studied the </p><p>dashed thing an’ worked it out.” </p><p> “But what does it mean?” insisted</p><p>Hamilton. </p><p> Bones uttered impatient sounds.</p><p> “It’s a verse,” he said shortly, “that jolly</p><p>little tune: </p><p> “Yankee Doodle came to town</p><p> Riding on a pony</p><p> He stuck a feather-”</p><p> “If you’re going to laugh,” said Bones</p><p>huffily, “there’s nothin’ more to be said, </p><p>sir,” and he closed the book with a bang. </p><p> Bones was frankly bad-tempered that</p><p>morning, for in addition to other vexations </p><p>he had discovered the loss of a certain </p><p>national ensign which had disappeared </p><p>from under his eyes. </p><p>ABOUT this time in the forest </p><p>village of Kasanga a man fell sick. </p><p>He had pains in his head, shoot- </p><p>ing, throbbing stabs of agony that did not </p><p>cease by day or night. </p><p> He was lucky in that there lived in this</p><p>village a very famous witch-doctor, one </p><p>Buluta, to whom all the forest folk went </p><p>in their hour of adversity. His fame </p><p>passed the frontiers of his own land and </p><p>you might not travel for a day anywhere </p><p>in the river territories without coming upon </p><p>a man or woman who wore on his or her </p><p>breast one of those charms which were </p><p>characteristic of Buluta. </p><p> If you take a palm-kernel, soak it in a</p><p>solution of gum and camwood, thread it </p><p>neatly with two steel wires and turn the </p><p>free ends of the wires until each forms the </p><p>letter “P,” you have a fair imitation of </p><p>that powerful spellmaker which cured </p><p>coughs and insured for married men the </p><p>fidelity of their wives. </p><p> The sick would pay him a chicken for</p><p>his services, and this gift was tied to one</p><p>of the legs of the sufferer, and Buluta, </p><p>kneeling by the patient’s side, would knead </p><p>and pound the unfortunate body of his </p><p>victim, starting from the head and working </p><p>down to the feet until the evil spirit which </p><p>possessed the patient and which caused his </p><p>unhappiness would depart with a loud </p><p>cry—which Buluta himself supplied—into </p><p>the body of the bird. Whereupon he would </p><p>cut off the head of the bird, sprinkle a few </p><p>drops of his blood upon the gratified patient </p><p>who by this time should have felt such </p><p>relief as would enable him to rise and call </p><p>his doctor blessed. </p><p> And in most cases this relief was in-</p><p>stantaneous and complete. Sometimes </p><p>Buluta would find no response to his treat- </p><p>ment, but that was invariably explained </p><p>to his own credit by the discovery of be- </p><p>witchment or a peculiarly strong devil </p><p>whom the sick man had offended. </p><p> In such cases as these Buluta would go</p><p>into the forest for a consideration and </p><p>conduct an expensive wrestling match with </p><p>the devil. Usually by the time he re- </p><p>turned to the village to discover what had </p><p>happened to the patient—the patient </p><p>had died. </p><p> Now this man who laid so grievously</p><p>sick was rich and Buluta had long envied </p><p>him his wealth, so that when he was sum- </p><p>moned by the man’s principal wife he saw </p><p>the magnificence of the opportunity. </p><p> He had the patient stripped and laid</p><p>upon a wooden grille and beneath him he </p><p>lit a fire of herbs that sent up a very thick </p><p>and pungent smoke. </p><p> He also painted all the toes of the sick</p><p>man with red camwood that the devils </p><p>might not enter his body. Then he cut </p><p>little patterns in the chest of Kofubu—: </p><p>that was the man’s name—with a small </p><p>keen knife. What other treatment he </p><p>would have introduced may only be sur- </p><p>mised. </p><p> Since it was acknowledged that none was</p><p>greater than Buluta and that if he could </p><p>not cure Kofubu no other witch-doctor </p><p>could perform that service for him, the </p><p>philosophical villagers decided that he </p><p>must be left to die, and death would cer-</p><p>tainly have been his fate but for the happy </p><p>circumstance that Mr. Commissioner San- </p><p>ders was making a tour through the forest </p><p>villages, and arrived one evening when the </p><p>seven wives of Kofubu were discussing the </p><p>division of his property. </p><p> Sanders carried a hairy little medicine-</p><p>chest which contained a few, but powerful </p><p>drugs, designed to meet the half-a-dozen </p><p>epidemic or simple maladies native to the </p><p>country. If the disease was outside the </p><p>range of the six diseases for which he had </p><p>made provision, the sick man or woman was </p><p>treated for the commonplace ailment </p><p>which it most nearly resembled. </p><p> Sanders went into the hut of the man</p><p>82 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>and found two strands of wire tightly- </p><p>bound about his skull, these strands having </p><p>been in place for some twelve years. They </p><p>were rather difficult to cut, and Kofubu </p><p>suffered something in the process, but </p><p>when they were removed and after the man </p><p>had spent a night under the influence of </p><p>one of Sanders’ six medicants, he dis- </p><p>covered that his pain had disappeared. </p><p> “I think you are a fool, Kofubu,” said</p><p>Sanders, “for who but a fool would put wire </p><p>about his head?” </p><p> “Lord,” said Kofubu ruefully, “that</p><p>was a very powerful charm which kept </p><p>from me ghosts and evil devils.” </p><p> “You were nearer to ghosts and evil</p><p>devils than you know, my man,” said </p><p>Sanders with a wry smile. He had no use </p><p>for witch-doctors of any kind. </p><p> Sanders sent for the medicine-man.</p><p> “Buluta,” said he, “do you believe in</p><p>devils?” </p><p> “Lord, I do,” replied the man appre-</p><p>hensively eying the stick which Sanders </p><p>carried. </p><p> “And do you believe that your devils will</p><p>save you pain?” </p><p> The man, still with his eye on the stick,</p><p>edged away. </p><p> “Answer!” said Sanders sharply.</p><p> “Lord, it is said that we wise men do</p><p>not feel—ouch!” </p><p> “And now,” said Sanders, when the</p><p>flogging was finished, “hear my words. I </p><p>will have no witch-doctor who draws blood </p><p>in this land. This time I beat, but if I send </p><p>for you because you have done this evil </p><p>again, I will await you at the Village of </p><p>Irons, and there you shall stay for ten </p><p>years.” </p><p> The commissioner passed on the next day</p><p>and Buluta was forgotten, but Buluta did </p><p>not forget.</p><p>IT WAS a month or five weeks </p><p>after Sanders had come and gone, </p><p>that Buluta sent secret messengers </p><p>to all the tribes, to the N’gombi, the Inner </p><p>N’gombi, to the Akasava, the Lesser </p><p>Akasava and the Three-Streams Akasava, </p><p>to the Isisi, the Lesser Isisi, to the Ochori </p><p>and the Upper Ochori and even into the </p><p>forbidden land of the Old King. </p><p> To no chiefs or headmen did his summons</p><p>go, but to strange old men who lived apart </p><p>from the communities to which they were </p><p>attached, and on the night his call reached </p><p>them, they left their villages furtively and </p><p>came by hidden ways to the rendezvous </p><p>which Buluta had appointed. This was </p><p>one of those famous islands where bats </p><p>hang in great bunches from the trees </p><p>throughout the hot day and fly by the </p><p>thousand over the river at night. There </p><p>never was such an assembly in all the </p><p>history of the land since the day when </p><p>they buried Gufufu, the witch-doctor. </p><p> There were old men and there were young</p><p>men too. Men fantastically arrayed in </p><p>skins of unknown animals, men belted </p><p>about with teeth and claws, men cloaked </p><p>in feathers, men streaked and circled with </p><p>paint and they came to sit at the feet of </p><p>Buluta and learn his will. </p><p> “Wise goats,” said Buluta, “I have called</p><p>you that I may tell of wonders, for I who </p><p>understand devils and have fought with </p><p>terrible ghosts have been beaten by Sandi </p><p>because he hates me. Also I have dis- </p><p>covered a great wonder. All men know </p><p>that Sandi has a ju-ju which tells him when </p><p>any man breaks the law—for have not the </p><p>people of the river held very private </p><p>palavers and has not Sandi come swiftly? </p><p>And when the Akasava went secretly to </p><p>make war and none knew, save the king, </p><p>where the goats would bleed, was not Sandi </p><p>waiting in the Isisi River for their coming?” </p><p>“Wa!” chorused his audience, “all men </p><p>know this.” </p><p> Buluta’s eyes blazed.</p><p> “Now I have found the mystery,” he</p><p>shouted in triumph, “Sandi has a wonderful </p><p>fetish!” </p><p> “That is foolish talk,” said a skeptic in</p><p>the circle, “for all people know that Sandi </p><p>is a white man and white men have no </p><p>fetishes.” </p><p> “Wa! that is true,” said another, “for</p><p>did not Sandi beat me cruelly because I </p><p>smelt out one who had bewitched the </p><p>daughter of Kumulubu the chief of the </p><p>Lesser Isisi?” </p><p> “Let all men hear this,” cried Buluta,</p><p>“Sandi who lives in a fine house by the sea </p><p>has put up a great stick near where the big </p><p>water runs, and that is his fetish for the son </p><p>of my sister who has newly come from </p><p>Sandi’s home, tells me this and every morn- </p><p>ing Tibbetti, the young one, goes before this </p><p>stick and bows himself and picks up pieces </p><p>of cloth and hangs it upon the stick and </p><p>puts his hand to his face thus.” </p><p> One of the old witch-doctors nodded.</p><p>The Fetish Stick </p><p>83 </p><p> “I also have seen Bonsei put his hand to</p><p>his face when he speaks to my Lord Sandi </p><p>and to Militini, and a soldier of Sandi’s </p><p>told me that he does Jhis thing to do honor </p><p>to Militini and to Sandi, who are his chiefs. </p><p>Now, tell us, Buluta, what may we </p><p>do?” </p><p> Buluta raised his hands, he was almost</p><p>incoherent in his excitement. </p><p> “We will make a dance and a devil</p><p>palaver, such a palaver as never was seen </p><p>in this land, and we ourselves will put up a </p><p>great stick so that we may talk with ghosts, </p><p>for the son of my sister has stolen a won- </p><p>derful cloth such as Tibbetti hangs, and </p><p>this is sutely a great magic and a charm </p><p>for sickness. And since we shall be as </p><p>great as Sandi he shall not harm us if </p><p>through our medicine men die. Also be- </p><p>cause he beat me, I will lay a spell upon </p><p>him and he will go mad. Wa!” </p><p> For six days there were mysterious</p><p>doings on the Island of Bats, fifty separate </p><p>fires burned and smoked and the awe- </p><p>stricken villagers on the mainland watched </p><p>this evidence of the witch-doctor’s activity </p><p>with their knuckles to their teeth. There </p><p>was sacrificing of goats and chickens and </p><p>a score of snakes died in the course of </p><p>twenty different rituals. There was a </p><p>pounding and a mixing, a dancing and a </p><p>chanting beyond all precedent, and when </p><p>a week and three days had gone by Buluta </p><p>and five delegates launched their canoe </p><p>and struck down the river to the forest </p><p>of tall trees to choose “The Stick” and </p><p>annoint their find with proper ceremony. </p><p> NEWS of a gathering of witch-</p><p>jtfg&amp;Prjj doctors reached Sanders and the </p><p> commissioner acted quickly. Bones</p><p>was torn from his tangled halyards and his </p><p>chaotic signal locker and dispatched, he </p><p>protesting, in search of proofs. </p><p> Near the Forest of Happy Dreams the</p><p>river broadens until it forms a great lake, </p><p>where, on hazy days, it is almost impossible </p><p>to see from shore to shore. Steersmen </p><p>loathe this breadth of water because sand- </p><p>banks grow in a night and islands that you</p><p>chart on your way up give way to five </p><p>fathoms of water on your way down-stream. </p><p>There are places in this lake where a </p><p>steamer can bump her way into deep </p><p>water and find herself within a sandy circle </p><p>from whence there is no escape. On such </p><p>occasions all the crew descend into the water </p><p> t</p><p>and literally lift the steamer from her em- </p><p>barrassing position. </p><p> On a hot day in July a little steamer</p><p>specklessly white, her tall twin funnels </p><p>belching a constant billow of black smoke, </p><p>picked an erratic way through the lake. </p><p>Two sounding boys sat in her bows and </p><p>stabbed the water at intervals of a few </p><p>seconds with long rods, transmitting the </p><p>depth in tones of abysmal weariness. </p><p> Bones, standing on the bridge of the</p><p>Zaire with a telescope under his arm and a </p><p>very severe and disapproving frown upon </p><p>his forehead watched the maneuver of the </p><p>Government ship with every indication of </p><p>impatience. </p><p> “Oh, Yoka,” he said at last, turning to</p><p>the steersman, “is there no straight course, </p><p>for when I brought the Zaire through this </p><p>broad river I turned neither to the left nor </p><p>to the right?” </p><p> “Lord,” said the Kano boy who steered,</p><p>not taking his eyes from the waters ahead, </p><p>“who knows this river—every day the </p><p>water finds a new way?” </p><p> Bones turned to a weary “Tut!” and his</p><p>thoughts went back longingly to a cool </p><p>beach and a high white flagstaff. </p><p> Presently he spoke again in Arabic.</p><p>“Now my great eyes can see the course,” </p><p>he said, “you shall go to the middle </p><p>waters.” </p><p> “Master,” said Yoka earnestly, “I think</p><p>there is sand in the middle waters.” </p><p> “It is an order,” said the imperious</p><p>Bones. </p><p> The wheel spun ’round under the helms-</p><p>man’s hand and the nose of the Zaire </p><p>pushed ’round. They struck the strong</p><p>river current. The black waters piled </p><p>themselves up before the bows. </p><p> “Exactly,” said Bones complacently, “I</p><p>thought we should do it.” </p><p> Suddenly the speed of the vessel per-</p><p>ceptibly stopped and Yoka, who knew that </p><p>this meant that she was reaching shallow </p><p>water, spun the wheel with feverish haste. </p><p>There was a shivering bump, another and a </p><p>whole series of frantic little hops, and </p><p>though the stern-wheel thrashed furiously </p><p>the Zaire went neither forward nor back- </p><p>ward. </p><p> “Master,” said Yoka simply, “this is a</p><p>sandbank.” </p><p> Bones said nothing. He took his big</p><p>pipe from his pocket, deliberately loaded </p><p>it with tobacco, struck a match and lit it </p><p>84 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>and puffed cloudily. He was apparently </p><p>deep in thought. Then at last he spoke. </p><p> “We shall have to get her off,” he</p><p>said. </p><p> Unfortunately the Zaire on this trip was</p><p>carrying a skeleton crew. There were a </p><p>dozen Housas, a few deck hands, a native </p><p>engineer, also half a dozen villagers who </p><p>had begged a passage to Youkombi. </p><p> Moreover, part of the Zaire lay in deep</p><p>water so that it was impossible to wade. </p><p>Bones rang the engines first to stop and </p><p>then to astern, but the Zaire was firmly </p><p>fixed. </p><p> “But presently the river will rise,” he</p><p>said to Yoka confidently, “and the water </p><p>will wash away the sand.” </p><p> Yoka scratched his chin.</p><p> “I think the waters are going down,</p><p>lord,” he said, “for the river was in flood </p><p>six days ago and there have been no </p><p>rains.” </p><p> “You are a silly old ass,” said the an-</p><p>noyed Bones. </p><p> He scanned the horizon for a sign of a</p><p>village, though he might have known that </p><p>there was none, for he had passed through </p><p>the lake fifty times. Bones’ motto, how- </p><p>ever, was that “you never know,” and such </p><p>was his optimistic spirit that he, at any rate, </p><p>would not have been surprised to have dis- </p><p>covered a fairly large-sized township, </p><p>equipped with, amongst other things, a </p><p>complete dredging plant, had established </p><p>itself since his last visit.1 </p><p> There was only one thing to do. Bones</p><p>ordered the canoe to be launched, and with </p><p>four paddlers and one Housa as an escort </p><p>he made his way to the nearest village </p><p>which, as it happened, was situated on the </p><p>big middle island that lay athwart the </p><p>northern end of the lake. There was, as </p><p>he knew, a footpath close to the river, and </p><p>he started off on his two-mile tramp to </p><p>Youkombi, the village in question. </p><p> A mile from the point of his departure</p><p>the path divided, for here the land forms a </p><p>promontory. One path naturally followed </p><p>the water, but the other cut straight across </p><p>the neck of the salient and formed a short </p><p>way for such people as did not fear ghosts. </p><p>Bones took the nearer path, and in conse- </p><p>quence he did not see the two watchers who </p><p>squatted by the side of the water only </p><p>waiting for a glimpse of the Zaire to fly </p><p>back with their discovery to Youkombi. </p><p> It also happened that when he reached the</p><p>point where the paths were reunited, in- </p><p>stead of following the one broad track that </p><p>leads to the village, he followed the forest </p><p>path which took him away to the left, for </p><p>he was anxious to see for himself whether </p><p>certain allegations against the people of </p><p>the Youkombi were well founded. Though </p><p>he was not conscious of the fact, here he </p><p>missed the second group of watchers who, </p><p>as a matter of precaution, had been placed </p><p>on the road half a mile from the village. </p><p> Bones searched diligently and patiently,</p><p>for in all matters of strict and serious duty </p><p>Bones was conscientious to a fault. His </p><p>search was well rewarded, for under a </p><p>dwarf mimosa and almost hidden by the </p><p>rank foliage which smothered the ground </p><p>he discovered a bundle wrapped in native </p><p>cloth and containing certain little wooden </p><p>pots of native manufacture which were filled </p><p>with van-colored clay. There was red and </p><p>green and vivid orange, blue and brown. </p><p>Also there was a necklace of human teeth, </p><p>a mask of feathers and a strange-looking </p><p>ivory instrument shaped rather like a </p><p>tuning-fork. </p><p>BONES met no villager, and it was </p><p>extremely unlikely that he would, </p><p>because the whole of Youkombi was </p><p>sitting in wrapt silence watching a man </p><p>fantastically hued with great white rings </p><p>painted ’round his eyes and blue and green </p><p>stripes of ocher running across his shrunken </p><p>breast. They would have been interested </p><p>in Buluta under any circumstances, for his </p><p>name was a household word from the terri- </p><p>tory of the Great King to the villages by </p><p>the sea. But what added fascination to his </p><p>own personality was the fact that he was </p><p>at that moment engaged, under the pro- </p><p>fessional inspection of fifty witch-doctors, </p><p>in curing the first wife of the headman of</p><p>the Youkombi. </p><p> The cure was a simple business. She</p><p>lay, spread-eagled, on the ground, ankles </p><p>and wrists attached by stout rawhide thongs </p><p>to little sticks which had been driven in the </p><p>ground and he was letting out the nine and </p><p>nine devils with which she was possessed, </p><p>from time to time lecturing as an ana- </p><p>tomical professor to his fascinated audience. </p><p> “Oh, people and wise ones, thus you see</p><p>my magic,” he said, brandishing his little </p><p>knife and rubbing his nose with the back </p><p>of his lean hand, “because of the wonderful </p><p>things I do now Sandi would hate me and </p><p>The Fetish Stick </p><p>85 </p><p>follow me with guns. But now because of </p><p>a great magic which I have done, I am </p><p>greater than Sandi and I may do many </p><p>things which were forbidden. I cut this </p><p>woman a little—so. What do you see, wise </p><p>brothers and people of the Youkombi? </p><p>Just a little blood. Do you see the little </p><p>devils with eyes like moons? Only Buluta </p><p>sees those. Look, there he goes!” </p><p> His bony finger pointed and traced the</p><p>passage of the mythical devil, and as it </p><p>indicated a progress nearer and nearer to </p><p>the circle those who stood in its line leaped </p><p>out and sprang shivering back to allow it </p><p>passage. </p><p> “There it goes,” he croaked, “into the</p><p>forest! I see it! It is gone! Presently it </p><p>will come back a very beautiful wonder. </p><p>None will see it but I!” </p><p> He bent his head as though listening, his</p><p>hand to his ear. </p><p> “My ju-ju tells me it is coming. Look,</p><p>look!” he pointed again to the forest, “it </p><p>comes!” </p><p> An appropriate moment this, for Bones to</p><p>make his appearance which he did quite </p><p>unknowing that he fitted so well into the </p><p>scheme of clairvoyance. The people stood </p><p>dumfounded, their knuckles to their </p><p>mouths. </p><p> “This is a great wonder,” said the head-</p><p>man of Youkombi, “for this good devil </p><p>looks like Tibbetti.” </p><p> But the witch-doctor did not reply.</p><p>This was a moment too great for words. </p><p>As for his fifty hideous colleagues they </p><p>faded into the shadow of the woods. </p><p> Bones marched into the circle, his helmet</p><p>pulled rakishly over one eye, an eye-glass </p><p>in the other and stood looking down at the </p><p>medicine-man and his victim. He dropped </p><p>his cane lightly on the shoulder of the </p><p>headman. </p><p> “Take this woman away, Kabala,” he</p><p>said, “afterward you shall call a palaver</p><p>of your people.” </p><p> He turned his attention to the witch-</p><p>doctor. </p><p> “Oh, Buluta,” he said, “Sandi wants</p><p>you.” </p><p> The witch-doctor licked his lips. Before</p><p>him was the supreme injustice of a ten </p><p>years’ sentence—and that it was unjust </p><p>he stoutly believed. </p><p>He looked ’round helplessly and then— </p><p>“Lord!” he cried, his eyes bright with </p><p>hope, “by my magic and my ju-ju you may </p><p>not touch me, for I am favored by a fetish </p><p>stick greater than Sandi’s—look!” </p><p> Bones’ eyes followed the pointed finger.</p><p>For the first time he saw the tall roughly </p><p>dressed flagstaff. </p><p> “Good gracious, heaven an’ earth!”</p><p>gasped Bones. </p><p> “Lord,” Buluta went on proudly, “that</p><p>is a great devil more terrible than M’shimba- </p><p>m’shimba, very fierce and terrifying, who </p><p>eats up people, and I call this thing Ewa, </p><p>which is death.” </p><p> Bones shaded his eyes and looked steadily</p><p>upward at the one standard that floated </p><p>at the head of the staff. </p><p> He saw the big black cross on the white</p><p>ground and the double-headed eagle with </p><p>its clutching talons and nodded. </p><p> “Ewa which is called death,” he repeated</p><p>soberly, “I think you are wiser than you </p><p>know, Buluta.” </p><p> His automatic pistol cracked three times</p><p>and at the third shot the rope that held the </p><p>German Imperial Standard aloft was </p><p>severed and the flag came fluttering down. </p><p>UPSIDE DO¥N OR BACKWARDS </p><p>^1/ W C Txittle </p><p> Author of “Mary's Little Lamb,” “With the Joker Wild," etc.</p><p>she ain’t changed an awful </p><p>i&gt;'.ce I left,” remarks Magpie </p><p>'kins, as he cuddles his long </p><p>up under his chin and tilts </p><p>his chair against the side of the cabin. </p><p> “You can’t expect no big changes in uh</p><p>wilderness like this in thirty days,” says I, </p><p>and he nods emphatic like and spits at uh </p><p>lizard. </p><p> “The East looks good, Ike,” he pro-</p><p>claims. </p><p> “Did the East look good to you or did</p><p>you look good to the East?” I asks. “Seems </p><p>to me that you gets uh heap civilized in </p><p>thirty days.

He orates that in the East</p><p> is uh tribe uh philanthropists who spend</p><p> their time hunting for uh shaft to sink their</p><p> money in.</p><p> Also he opines that as uh hunter and</p><p> finder uh this certain person he can’t be</p><p> beat or even tied. I protests audibly and</p><p> often that we ought to let gold enough</p><p> alone, but when Magpie gets an idea like</p><p> that it’s all off until he’s proved that my</p><p> objections were well founded.</p><p> Therefore and immediate he packs his</p><p> valise—or rather one he borrows from</p><p> Buck Masterson, the saloon-keeper at</p><p> Piperock, and pilgrims East.</p><p> I holds down uh chair on the shady side</p><p>86 </p><p>Upside Down or Backwards </p><p>87 </p><p>of our cabin for thirty days, and tries to </p><p>figure out how long it will take 'em to get </p><p>Magpie’s nine hundred away from him. </p><p>He indicates in his departing words that </p><p>his stay is indefinite and his destination </p><p>problematical, but he comes back on the </p><p>thirtieth day. </p><p> He pilgrims up from Piperock, with the</p><p>taste uh ashes in his mouth, uh yaller, hard </p><p>hat on his head and kid gloves on his hands. </p><p>I hands him uh welcome and uh cigaret, and </p><p>he humps up in my chair. </p><p> “She’s uh hard drag, Ike,” he states.</p><p>“The tribe I mentioned is either getting </p><p>scarce or somebody has declared uh closed </p><p>season on ’em. I invades Pittsburg and </p><p>Chicago and other places too numerous to </p><p>mention, but all I could find was folks who </p><p>were kind enough to listen while they took </p><p>uh drink on me. When the drink was gone </p><p>they all lost their hearing, Ike.” </p><p> “Did yuh expect to find capitalists in</p><p>grog shops?” I asked, chiding like. “Money- </p><p>ed men don’t get drunk—they gets in- </p><p>toxicated. Didn’t yuh do uh thing to be </p><p>thankful for, Magpie?” </p><p> He shakes his head, sad-like, and fumbles</p><p>in his pocket. After searching through all </p><p>his clothes he comes back to the first pocket </p><p>he looks in, where it was all the time and </p><p>he knowed it, and pulls out uh letter. </p><p> “Ike, this is uh mystery,” he proclaims.</p><p>“Honest to grandma, I don’t know what it </p><p>means, but this letter says it was paid for </p><p>and is on its way here. I didn’t think I </p><p>got so drunk that I bought anything except </p><p>more drinks, but—well, take uh look at </p><p>this.” </p><p> He hands me the letter. At the top it</p><p>proclaims to be from the Fur and Feathers </p><p>Pet Shop, of Chicago. They orates that </p><p>they handles each and everything what </p><p>wears fur and feathers, and will supply </p><p>same with cheer and great speed. The </p><p>letter reads like this: </p><p>Dear Sir:— </p><p> As per your request and purchase we are shipping</p><p>you today one cassowary. This is a male, and, </p><p>in case you desires uh female, we can secure you one </p><p>inside of thirty days. Thanking you for past and </p><p>future favors, we begs to remain—and so forth. </p><p> I hands the letter back to Magpie, and</p><p>rolls uh smoke. </p><p> “The letter was waiting for me when I</p><p>got here,” he explains. </p><p> “You don’t need to apologize, Magpie.</p><p>How much did yuh pay for this male bird, </p><p>beast or reptile?” </p><p> “That’s what I don’t know, Ike. I’m</p><p>sorry.” </p><p> “You always are, Magpie,” says I.</p><p>“You can be sorry more times, hand </p><p>running, than any man I ever seen. You </p><p>were born to sorrow. Some folks are born </p><p>to sorrow, but some are like me—they has </p><p>sorrow forced upon ’em. What’ll we do </p><p>with the danged thing?” </p><p> “How do I know?” he snaps at me.</p><p>“Cassowary! What in - is uh casso- </p><p>wary, Ike?” </p><p> “I ought to know!” I snaps right back at</p><p>him. “You must uh been pretty blamed </p><p>drunk, Magpie Simpkins.” </p><p> He nods, solemn-like, and spits at uh</p><p>lizard again: </p><p> “Maybe. That Eastern hooch is awful</p><p>stuff, Ike. I don’t remember no pet store. </p><p>I must uh bought it the night I left Chicago </p><p>for St. Louis. I wakes up in the morning </p><p>and went to uh ticket office. </p><p> “Give me uh ticket to St. Louis,” says I</p><p>to the clerk. </p><p> “He looks queer like at me, and calls in</p><p>uh policeman, and Ike, I had uh-of uh </p><p>time convincing that officer that I wasn’t </p><p>crazy. He explained to me that I’m already </p><p>in St. Louis.” </p><p> “Them policemen must be uh near-</p><p>sighted bunch,” says I. “You’d have uh </p><p>nice time trying to prove that to an officer</p><p>west uh Dakota.” </p><p> “Don’t chide me, Ike,” says he. “I was</p><p>uh stranger in uh strange land, and they </p><p>took me in. Anyway I got uh green and </p><p>red shirt, uh civilized hat and uh necktie </p><p>pin to show for my trip.” </p><p> “Don’t forget Cassie,” says I. “Didn’t</p><p>you talk mines uh-tall?” </p><p> “Uh-huh. There was uh fat bartender</p><p>in Chicago who sympathized with me uh </p><p>heap. Said he wished I’d uh showed up </p><p>sooner with my proposition, cause he’d </p><p>sunk all his money in uh new diving appa- </p><p>ratus. He sure was uh good old scout, Ike. </p><p>Dog-gone, that feller could fix up uh drink </p><p>uh hooch until she tastes almost temperance, </p><p>but she sure was uh sheep in wolf’s clothes. </p><p>I rode all the way from Chicago to St. Louis </p><p>on three of ’em and didn’t know it.” </p><p>“The big question before the house is this, </p><p>Magpie: is this here purchase uh yours uh </p><p>singer, uh beast, uh burden or uh nuisance?” </p><p>“Must be uh useful utensil, Ike, or I’d never </p><p>88 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>bought it. I may get red-eyed from wobble </p><p>water but I never loses my sense uh useful </p><p>and ornamental things. I’m what you’d </p><p>call uh discerning person—drunk or sober.” </p><p>All uh which shows that there ain’t no </p><p>use arguing with Magpie Simpkins. He </p><p>can do no wrong. Uh course he might do </p><p>things that he’d be sorry for, but he never </p><p>figures that he’s wrong—just uh little mis- </p><p>taken for the time being. </p><p> “Come back broke?” I asks.</p><p> “Uh-huh. My gosh, Ike, I must uh</p><p>spent money like uh timber Willie. If I </p><p>knowed what that animile cost me I could </p><p>figure how much the trip cost me.” </p><p> “You don’t have to let X equal the miss-</p><p>ing quantity, Magpie,” says I. “You </p><p>had nine hundred when yuh left, and you’re </p><p>broke now; therefore the trip cost me </p><p>four hundred and fifty. Sabe?” </p><p> Magpie don’t sleep well that night.</p><p>First he has an argument with that Chicago </p><p>bartender. Uh course, me being an inno- </p><p>cent bystander or bylayer, I gets hit in </p><p>the nose. I cautions him to fight the other </p><p>way. He apologizes uh heap, but inside </p><p>uh five minutes he starts another fight with </p><p>some colored person over the way his bed </p><p>is made and I gets pitched out of the </p><p>bunk and hits my head on the stove. </p><p> I’ve been mistook for an Injun, and one</p><p>time “Red River” Radkey absorbs too much </p><p>of the fermented foam, and mistakes me </p><p>for uh pink pollywog, but that’s the first </p><p>time that anybody ever mistook me for </p><p>uh colored porter, and it makes me mad. </p><p> I climbs right back on that bunk, gets</p><p>Magpie by the feet, and drags him around </p><p>the yard in the moonlight. He’s plumb </p><p>awake and docile enough to apologize again </p><p>when I finishes the third lap around the </p><p>woodpile, so he climbs back on the bunk </p><p>and I takes uh blanket and sleeps on the floor. </p><p>THE next morning we saddles our </p><p>burros and starts for town. We’re </p><p>out uh spuds, and we needs some </p><p>drill steel. Magpie leads the procession, </p><p>setting on the rump of uh fuzzy-looking</p><p>jackass. He’s wearing that hard hat, </p><p>green and red shirt—he sheds his vest— </p><p>and on his hands he wears them gray gloves. </p><p>He sure is uh thing to see. Even the burros </p><p>acts bashful around him. </p><p> “I reckon I’ll make the inhabitants uh</p><p>Piperock set up and take notice,” he states, </p><p>admiring himself. </p><p> He sets the pot-shaped hat on the peak</p><p>of his head, and brushes off that loco shirt </p><p>with his gloves. </p><p> “Yes,” says I. “All I hope is that they</p><p>don’t set up with uh gun in their hands. </p><p>You sure look like uh cross between uh </p><p>lodge-pole Christmas tree and uh zebra.” </p><p>We pilgrims down to the main road, and </p><p>ambles through the dust in the direction </p><p>of Piperock. We comes to uh turn in the </p><p>road, where we sees uh man setting along- </p><p>side on uh rock. He’s all humped up, with </p><p>his head between his hands, and don’t look </p><p>up until I hails him. Then we recognizes </p><p>him as being Chuck Warner, puncher for </p><p>the Cross-J. I never did know just how </p><p>to take that feller. He never growed none </p><p>to speak of from his waist on down, and I </p><p>figures that he’s the honestest-looking liar </p><p>I ever met. He sets there on that rock, </p><p>sad-like, but when he sizes up our outfit </p><p>his eyes gets bigger and he sort uh gasps: </p><p> “My-! It must be true!”</p><p> “Too true,” I replies, glancing at Magpie.</p><p>“Too true.” </p><p> He gets off the rock and wobbles over to</p><p>us. His eyes are blood-shot, like he’d been </p><p>dallying unduly with the cheerful fluid, </p><p>and he squints at Magpie. </p><p> “It’s Magpie Simpkins in disguise,</p><p>Chuck,” says I. </p><p> “Huh,” says he, sort uh relieved like.</p><p>“Maybe I ain’t so bad as I thought. You </p><p>fellers got time to help out uh pilgrim in </p><p>doubt?” </p><p> “Your obedient servants,” says I. “Lead</p><p>us to the doubt.” </p><p> He turns and ambles off across the</p><p>country, and me and Magpie is right </p><p>behind him. About two hundred yards</p><p>from the road he stops and points across </p><p>an open spot. </p><p> “That’s my bronc,” he states. “Yessir,</p><p>that’s my little hawse, but, but—say, what </p><p>in-is on that rope uh mine, eh?” </p><p> “Fluttering fool-hens!” explodes Magpie,</p><p>fanning himself with his civilized hat. </p><p> I looks and swallers uh chaw uh natural</p><p>leaf. </p><p> “Do—do you see it, too?” asks Chuck.</p><p>“Just exactly,” states Magpie. “What </p><p>is it?” </p><p> “If it ain’t the granddaddy uh all blue</p><p>grouse I’ll eat my hat,” orates Chuck. </p><p>“Yuh see I been down to Piperock for three </p><p>days, trying to bust Buck’s wheel, and </p><p>drink all the hooch in town. I comes along </p><p>Upside Down or Backwards </p><p>89 </p><p>the road this morning, singing merrily, </p><p>when I happens to see that busted crate </p><p>in the road. I pulls up to see what it is, </p><p>and my bronc danged near dumps me off. </p><p>He’s scared at something in the brush, and </p><p>when I spurs him over to see what it is, </p><p>we scares out that blasted thing! </p><p> “Not being responsible for my actions</p><p>I takes down my rope and proceeds to </p><p>annex the thing. Between that thing and </p><p>my bronc, they makes life miserable for me, </p><p>so I gets off and leaves ’em to their fate. </p><p>The rope is wound around the bush between </p><p>’em so they can’t do nothing but stand </p><p>there and contemplate each other.” </p><p> “I don’t reckon there’s any doubt about</p><p>it being uh grown bird,” states Magpie, </p><p>fussing with uh cigaret. </p><p> “Your perceptions are wide open, Mag-</p><p>pie,” nods Chuck. “Wonder where it flew </p><p>from. It ain’t no grouse nor yet it don’t </p><p>partake of any of the requirements of the </p><p>fool-hen. It might uh been uh humming- </p><p>bird about the time this here world was </p><p>started.” </p><p> “She’s sure uh hummer,” I agrees. “If</p><p>I’d been born with uh neck like that I’d </p><p>uh died from delirium tremens years ago.” </p><p> “I’d opine that somebody done lost that</p><p>crate off uh wagon, and maybe there’s </p><p>something around to tell what and whose </p><p>it is,” says Magpie. </p><p> We all pilgrims back to the road, and</p><p>Chuck leads us to the busted bunch uh </p><p>slats. On one side it says— </p><p>DO NOT TEASE. </p><p> On the other side, in letters uh foot high,</p><p>it says— </p><p> MAGPIE SIMPKINS</p><p> PIPEROCK</p><p> MONTANA</p><p> We reads it over several times, and then</p><p>Magpie steps back, cocks his yaller hat over </p><p>one eye, sticks his thumbs in his belt and </p><p>snorts—</p><p> “That is Cassie!”</p><p> “Make it Caspar,” says I. “It’s uh male</p><p>cassowary, Magpie.” </p><p> “Huh!” snorts Chuck. “You wise guys</p><p>knowed all the time what it was, didn’t yuh? </p><p>What yuh going to do with the thing? </p><p>What in-is it anyway?” </p><p>*\“That thing, Chuck,” says I, “is what </p><p>uh man buys in the East when he’s drunk </p><p>up seven hundred dollars’ worth uh mixed </p><p>hooch. Cassowary is uh French word </p><p>what means, ‘something yuh bought when </p><p>you’re too drunk to consider the expense </p><p>and necessity.’ ” </p><p> “I always did like the French language,”</p><p>states Chuck. “It sure is expressive that- </p><p>away, ’cause yuh don’t have to say much </p><p>to mean uh whole lot. My mother was </p><p>French. Name was Jones. Yuh pro- </p><p>nounces it ‘Hones,’ the J being silent like </p><p>the Q in cassowary.” </p><p> “Well,” says I, “we got to do something,</p><p>and, being as it belongs to you, Magpie, </p><p>I reckon yuh better suggest.” </p><p> But Magpie sucks away on that cigaret,</p><p>and shakes his head. </p><p> “I’d admire to hear all about it,” states</p><p>Chuck. “There must be uh deep and dark </p><p>mystery about that bird, Magpie. If I </p><p>knowed the details about that bird’s past, </p><p>maybe I could help yuh out.” </p><p> Magpie is willing to receive help—as</p><p>usual—so he sets down there and tells </p><p>Chuck all about it —what he can remember. </p><p> “How much do yuh think yuh paid for</p><p>it?” asks Chuck. “You sure ought to </p><p>remember that part of it.” </p><p> “Dang me if I know,” replies Magpie.</p><p>“Couple uh hundred, most likely. What </p><p>yuh got on your mind, Chuck?” </p><p> “Say, what good is uh cassowary? If</p><p>she was worth something to humanity we </p><p>might peddle the blasted thing. If folks </p><p>had an idea it was—cripes!”</p><p> “What’s the exciting thought, Chuck?”</p><p>I asks, but Chuck begins to roll uh fresh </p><p>cigaret and grin to himself. Pretty soon </p><p>he busts out laughing and slaps his quirt </p><p>across his chaps. </p><p> “By cripes,” he chuckles. “It won’t cost</p><p>nothing to try.” </p><p> “Try what?” asks Magpie.</p><p> “Say, if you gets your two hundred back</p><p>will yuh give me all I can make over </p><p>that?” </p><p> “You answered yc.ir own question,</p><p>Chuck,” declares Magpie. “You get us two </p><p>hundred for that overgrown fool-hen and </p><p>you can have the rest. What yuh going </p><p>to do?" </p><p> “That’s my business, Magpie. You and</p><p>Ike go along a.h^ut your business, and don’t </p><p>peep—no matter what happens. Sabe? </p><p>Here comes the stage.” </p><p> Art Miller swings his four broncs around</p><p>90 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>in front of us, and looks us over, sort uh </p><p>grouchy like. </p><p> “Howdy, Art,” says Magpie. “What</p><p>yuh doing these days—distributing poul- </p><p>try?” </p><p> Art spits over his off-wheeler, and con-</p><p>siders the busted crate. </p><p> “Did yuh see what comes in that there</p><p>box?” he asks, and we nods. “Did ye ever </p><p>hear it crow?” </p><p> We all shakes our heads, and Art puts</p><p>his hat on the brake lever and fumbles for </p><p>his tobacco. </p><p> “Sounds like-!” he snorts. “We was</p><p>going along, sleepy like, when it crows. </p><p>Runaway. Lost the crate out the wagon.” </p><p>“Uh-huh,” agrees Magpie. “Crate </p><p>busted and canary flew.” </p><p> “Canary!” Art spits out the word like</p><p>he’d pulled uh slug from his old pipe. </p><p>“Magpie Simpkins, you can get the dang- </p><p>dest things sent to you. What yuh going </p><p>to use that thing for?” </p><p> “Art,” says Chuck, chiding like, “you</p><p>neglected your duty as uh stage-driver </p><p>when yuh let that piece uh valuable freight </p><p>get away.” </p><p> “Well, go ahead and say it,” replies Art,</p><p>resigned like. </p><p> “Can you forget that you ever had that</p><p>bird in your care?” asks Chuck. </p><p> “Audibly or mentally, Chuck?” asks Art.</p><p> “Audibly.”</p><p> “I hope to some day.”</p><p> “Be worth uh five spot, and no questions</p><p>asked, Art.” </p><p> “I never seen it,” states Art. “What’s</p><p>the idea?” </p><p> “You fellers are as inquisitive as an old</p><p>maid,” replies Chuck. “All I asks is</p><p>silence, and plenty of that. I’ll pay the </p><p>bills.” </p><p> “We’re as silent as the tomb, eh, Mag-</p><p>pie?” says Art. “You ain’t got nothing </p><p>against me.” </p><p> “Nothing but admiration, Art. Chuck,</p><p>do what you please with that hooch-hen, </p><p>and we’ll go on to town. I don’t sabe your </p><p>play, young feller, but I’m for it all the way </p><p>from the ace to the deuce.” </p><p> We got our stuff at Piperock, and pilgrims</p><p>right back home. The crate and bird are </p><p>gone when we returns. </p><p> “I wish I knowed what Chuck aims to</p><p>do?” says Magpie, as we goes past the spot. </p><p> “And bust up our chances to get back</p><p>that two hundred,” says I. “If you didn’t </p><p>hunger and thirst for information so hard, </p><p>Magpie, I’d be living uh life uh ease right </p><p>now. You always wants to monkey with </p><p>the wheels uh progress.” </p><p>ABOUT five days later “Scenery” </p><p>Sims and “Dirty Shirt” Jones pil- </p><p>grims up our way and stops to eat. </p><p>They asks the usual questions and gets an- </p><p>swered. </p><p> “Magpie, did yuh ever see uh railami?”</p><p>asks Dirty Shirt. </p><p> “Uh-uh which?”</p><p> “Uh railami. Didn’t yuh ever hear of</p><p>one?” </p><p> “Oh, yes. I used to raise ’em.”</p><p> “You did not!” squeaks Scenery</p><p>“There’s only one specimen left on earth </p><p>today. Sabe?” </p><p> “Meaning you, I reckon, Scenery,” says</p><p>I.	“You’re the only specimen I ever seen</p><p>that might fit that cognomen.” </p><p> “No, not me!” snaps Scenery. “If yuh</p><p>don’t know and recognize one when yuh </p><p>see it, maybe you’ll wish yuh did.” </p><p> There ain’t much left to say, except un-</p><p>pleasant things, so they says “Klahowya” </p><p>and departs. </p><p> “Railami,” says Magpie, after they’re</p><p>gone. “Never heard the name before. </p><p>The way Scenery pronounces it makes it </p><p>sound like uh hare-lipped Piegan with hay </p><p>fever trying to make uh noise like uh </p><p>blowsnake.” </p><p> “It can’t be uh serious condition,” I re-</p><p>plies. “It sure can’t amount to much if </p><p>Scenery and Dirty Shirt knows what it </p><p>is, so I ain’t worrying about it none, </p><p>Magpie.” </p><p> The next day bringeth forth “Half Mile”</p><p>Smith and “Tellurium” Woods. They </p><p>rides in and partakes of bacon and beans. </p><p> “What you fellers doing up this way?”</p><p>asks Magpie. “Seems like me and Ike is </p><p>being honored lately. Scenery and Dirty </p><p>Shirt was up to see us yesterday.” </p><p> “Crazy as bedbugs, too,” says I. “They</p><p>was looking for—say, Magpie, what was </p><p>that word?” </p><p> “Railami.”</p><p> Half Mile and Tellurium looks foolish</p><p>like at each other and then back at us. </p><p> “You know what it is?” asks Tellurium,</p><p>but me and Magpie has to plead total </p><p>ignorance. </p><p> “You looking for it, too, Tellurium?”</p><p>I asks. </p><p>Upside Down or Backwards </p><p>9i </p><p> He rubs the bald spot on top of his head,</p><p>and grins. </p><p> “Uh-huh. She’s worth looking for.”</p><p>“We hate to have to ask questions,” </p><p>I states. </p><p> “Worth uh thousand dollars,” says</p><p>Tellurium. “Uh cold thousand.” </p><p> “So is sixty ounces uh gold, too, but</p><p>that don’t tell nothing but the value,” </p><p>orates Magpie. “Speak up, you're among </p><p>friends.” </p><p> “I wouldn’t,” states Half Mile. “No use</p><p>letting everybody in on it, Tellurium. If </p><p>they don’t know about it we hadn’t ought </p><p>to lessen our chances by telling.” </p><p> We thanks ’em heartily for the informa-</p><p>tion, and they rides away. Magpie gets </p><p>out his dictionary and ponders deep like </p><p>over it, but shakes his head. </p><p> “It ain’t in the book, Ike. Must be uh</p><p>foreign substance.” </p><p> The next day comes old Judge Steele and</p><p>Ricky Henderson. They salutes us, and </p><p>gets off to rest their saddles. </p><p> “How’s law and justice, Judge?” asks</p><p>Magpie. “You fellers hunting for uh </p><p>railami?” </p><p> “Huhl” snorts the judge, like he didn’t</p><p>hear, and glances at Ricky. </p><p> “Railami,” repeats Magpie.</p><p> “Why—uh—you seen any?” asks the</p><p>judge. </p><p> “I’ve quit drinking, Judge,” says Magpie.</p><p>“I’m sure I’d uh seen one next, and I tapers </p><p>off just in time.” </p><p> “Well, well!” exclaims the judge.</p><p>“Ricky, I reckon me and you had better </p><p>be going on. We’re looking for uh couple </p><p>uh strays. Two red cows. Seen anything </p><p>of ’em up here, Magpie?” </p><p> We disclaims all credit for seeing two red</p><p>cows, and they departs. </p><p> “Somebody’s uh heap crazy around here,</p><p>Ike,” states Magpie. “Either they’re crazy </p><p>to look for uh thing with uh name like that, </p><p>or we’re crazy for not looking. Let’s me </p><p>and you go over on Roaring Crick tomorrow </p><p>and do uh little gophering on that quartz </p><p>seam. Maybe we’ll meet uh railami on </p><p>the trail, eh?” </p><p> Me and Magpie gets enthusiastic over</p><p>the way that quartz seam shows up, and </p><p>when we leaves there we’re out uh grub. </p><p>Magpie suggests that we pilgrims to Pipe- </p><p>rock and get uh banquet uh ham and aigs, </p><p>and I’m right with him, so we points our </p><p>burros toward town. </p><p> Magpie is still wearing that yaller hard</p><p>hat. The burro he’s riding turns its head </p><p>once in uh while and looks back. It sizes </p><p>him up, shakes its ears, sad like, and pil- </p><p>grims on. Magpie sure is dressed up like </p><p>uh plush horse, and all he needs is uh cane </p><p>to be uh cripple for life. </p><p> There seems to be uh certain degree of</p><p>excitement in Piperock, when we arrives. </p><p>Chuck Warner is setting on his bronc out </p><p>there in the middle of the street, and he’s </p><p>surrounded with uh crowd. Lying down </p><p>in the dusty road is that blasted bird that </p><p>Magpie bought, and uh rope runs from </p><p>Chuck’s saddle to its long neck. The bird </p><p>seems to be the coolest thing in town. </p><p> “What do yuh reckon to do with it,</p><p>Chuck?” asks Dirty Shirt, and everybody </p><p>seems interested. </p><p> “Danged if I know,” replies Chuck.</p><p>“I ain’t never seen nothing like it before. </p><p>It just comes busting along down the road, </p><p>and I hangs my rope on it. Wish I knowed </p><p>what she is.” </p><p> “How much do yuh want for it, Mister</p><p>Warner?” asks Judge Steele, looking the </p><p>critter over, and fumbling in his pocket. </p><p> “You don’t want it, do yuh, Judge?”</p><p>laughs Masterson. “You couldn’t eat it.” </p><p>“I don’t know what she’s worth, Judge,” </p><p>states Chuck. “Ain’t she some whopper </p><p>of uh piece uh poultry? What do yuh </p><p>reckon she’s worth?” </p><p> “I’ll give yuh ten dollars for it,” squeaks</p><p>Scenery Sims. “I’d give uh ten just to own </p><p>uh thing like that.” </p><p> “The-yuh would!” snorts Half Mile.</p><p>“I’ll give fifteen.” </p><p> “Fifteen — fifteen — fifteen,” chants</p><p>Chuck. “Who’ll give twenty?” </p><p> “I’ll make it twenty,” yells Ricky Hen-</p><p>derson. </p><p> “Poultry’s going up!” whoops Chuck,</p><p>standing up in his stirrups. </p><p> “Who’ll give Ricky uh raise?”</p><p> “I makes it worth thirty,” states the</p><p>judge. </p><p> “Forty!” yelps Tellurium.</p><p> “Whoa!” whoops Chuck. “Wait uh</p><p>minute. What’s the idea uh getting all </p><p>heated up over uh overgrown fool-hen on </p><p>stilts. First thing we knows there’ll be </p><p>sorrow in our city. I got uh good scheme. </p><p>I’ll make a hundred tickets at five dollars </p><p>each, and rafile the blamed thing. You </p><p>fellers can gamble your heads off if yuh </p><p>feels inclined.” </p><p>92 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> That seems to suit the crowd, so Chuck</p><p>puts the bird in Buck Masterson’s stable, </p><p>and him and some of the rest gets busy </p><p>on making tickets. </p><p> Me and Magpie sets there on the sidewalk</p><p>and wonders what them Jaspers want of </p><p>that bird. Art Miller comes over, but he </p><p>don’t know any more than we do. </p><p> “How comes it that everybody covets</p><p>that monstrosity, Art?” I asks, but Art </p><p>shakes his head, and digs his toes in the </p><p>dirt. </p><p> “Danged if I know, Ike. I never seen</p><p>folks so crazy before. I felt that there’s </p><p>something in the wind for several days. </p><p>Tellurium, Half Mile, Scenery, Ricky, </p><p>Dirty Shirt and Judge Steele has been in </p><p>conference several times up in the judge’s </p><p>office. Here comes Tellurium. Maybe </p><p>he’ll tell us what it means.” </p><p> TELLURIUM sets down with us</p><p>for uh minute, and then gets up and </p><p>turns around three times, like uh </p><p>losing gambler does to change his luck. </p><p> “I’d admire to know what you wants</p><p>that freak bird for, Tellurium?” states Art. </p><p> “You would, eh?” chuckles Tellurium,</p><p>hauling some pieces uh paper out of his </p><p>pocket, and putting ’em into another. </p><p>“You would, eh? Don’t you know, Art?” </p><p> “I wouldn’t ask if I did.”</p><p> Tellurium fusses around in his inside</p><p>pocket, and hauls out uh piece uh writing- </p><p>paper. </p><p> “I reckon the tickets are all sold now,</p><p>so it won’t do no harm to let yuh know,” </p><p>says he, handing Art the paper. “I done </p><p>invested seventy-five on my luck, but I </p><p>reckon you fellers are too late to even buy </p><p>one ticket. When I left Judge Steele and </p><p>Half Mile was quarreling over who gets </p><p>the last number. Read that letter and be </p><p>sorry yuh didn’t buy no chances. We </p><p>don’t know who it was written to, but we </p><p>figures that it was some uh them citified </p><p>prospectors what was through here uh</p><p>short time ago. We found it on the floor </p><p>in Buck’s place, and that’s what brought </p><p>us up to your place that day, Ike.” </p><p> The three of us groups there on the side-</p><p>walk and reads what is left of that epistle. </p><p>The top and one corner is torn off, but that </p><p>is how she reads from that on down: </p><p>—little information. Some geologist friends of </p><p>mine were down in that country last Summer, and </p><p>they brought me the track of a bird—dried in alkali </p><p>mud. The measurements and peculiar arrange- </p><p>ment of the toes show it to be the track of a Railami, </p><p>a bird that is believed to have been extinct for many </p><p>years. The imprint is of recent times—not over six </p><p>months—and without a doubt, in the vicinity of the </p><p>town of Piperock lives and roams a specimen of this </p><p>rare bird. It greatly resembles an ostrich in size </p><p>and characteristics, but as there are no ostriches </p><p>in that country, it would be difficult to mistake </p><p>anything else for this rare bird. I would be willing </p><p>to give one thousand dollars for this specimen alive, </p><p>and will gladly welcome any information you can </p><p>send me. Very truly yours, </p><p>C. Ewein Chxjrch, New York, N. Y. </p><p> “My-!” snorts Magpie. “Here we’ve</p><p>had uh thousand dollars running loose </p><p>around here and didn’t know it. Ain’t that </p><p>the limit?” </p><p> “Just uh case of grasping an opportunity</p><p>when she comes your way,” chuckles Tel- </p><p>lurium, looking at his tickets again. “Some </p><p>of us are wide awake around here.” </p><p> “Uh-huh,” I agrees. “As far as I’m</p><p>concerned I tries to get my regular sleep.” </p><p>Tellurium pilgrims back across the street, </p><p>and pretty soon we opines that we might </p><p>as well go and see what’s doing, so we enters </p><p>Buck’s place. Chuck leads the bird in., and </p><p>ties it to uh leg of the pool-table. The bird </p><p>squats down on the floor, and Chuck mounts </p><p>uh chair. </p><p> “Gents,” says he, yelling for order. “We</p><p>are gathered together here to raffle off uh </p><p>bird that nobody seems to know nothing </p><p>about. I puts my rope on it and, being </p><p>it don’t show no brand, I claims it as mine. </p><p>Am I right?” </p><p> “According to law, Chuck,” admits the</p><p>judge. _ </p><p> “Being all tilings is so we will proceed</p><p>to rSffle off said bird. Gents, will the first </p><p>number out of the hat win the bird or will </p><p>we draw more before the lucky number </p><p>comes to view?” </p><p> “Make it three draws,” squeaks Scenery.</p><p>“Third number out wins.” </p><p> The bunch seems satisfied, so Chuck</p><p>takes up the hat-with the numbers in, and </p><p>begins to shake ’em up. </p><p> “Who will do the drawing?” asks the</p><p>judge. “We got to have this all according </p><p>to law.” </p><p> “You can’t, Judge,” states Tellurium.</p><p>“You got too many chances. Let’s get </p><p>somebody what ain’t got no interest. Let </p><p>Ike Harper do it.” </p><p> I didn’t want to be mixed up in the thing</p><p>uh-tall, but uh feller can’t refuse uh simple </p><p>request like that, so I moves into position. </p><p>Upside Down or Backwards </p><p>93 </p><p> “Let her go, Ike,” squeaks Scenery. “If</p><p>you draws my number I’ll make you uh </p><p>present of uh calf.” </p><p> “Just uh minute!” yells the judge.</p><p>“That sounds to me like he was trying to </p><p>bribe or coerce the drawee. Scenery, you </p><p>keep your mouth shut. I’d be willing </p><p>to make Mister Harper uh present of uh </p><p>calf if he drawed my number, but I ain’t </p><p>proclaiming it.” </p><p> I reaches up twice and tears up the two</p><p>numbers that I draws. </p><p> “This one tells the tale,” says somebody,</p><p>excited like, as I pulls it out and hands it </p><p>to Chuck. </p><p> He unfolds it and squints hard at the</p><p>number, turning it around and around. </p><p> “Number—uh—say, Ike, what number</p><p>is that?” </p><p> “Looks like uh sixteen to me,” says I, and</p><p>Scenery whoops: </p><p> “That’s mi-i-i-i-ine! I got sixte-e-e-</p><p>e-e-en! Whooe-e-e-e-e!” </p><p> “Wait uh minute!” howls Chuck.</p><p>“Maybe I was wrong, Ike, but take uh </p><p>look at it the other way. If that ain’t uh </p><p>nine-” </p><p> “That’s mine!” whoops Dirty Shirt.</p><p>“Dog-gone, I knowed-” </p><p> “Looks like ninety-one,” says I.</p><p> “My number! My number,” whoops</p><p>the judge. “Ninety-one wins!” </p><p> The judge comes clawing his way to the</p><p>front, and the whole crowd starts milling </p><p>around me. </p><p> “Ouch!” yelps Ricky, above the noise.</p><p>“Let loose! Wow! That danged pelican </p><p>bit me on the leg!” </p><p> “I claims that bird,” yells the judge.</p><p>“Lead her out to me, Ricky.”</p><p> '“Like - he will!” howls Scenery,</p><p>climbing up on the bar, and shaking his </p><p>number under the judge’s nose. “Just be- </p><p>cause you misrepresents the law, Judge, it </p><p>don’t give yuh no rights to take property </p><p>away from honest men.” </p><p> “Let’s live in/peace and harmony,” states</p><p>Buck Masterson, sliding his double-barreled </p><p>shotgun across the bar, and covering the </p><p>crowd. “Everybody shut up and listen </p><p>to me! Look at the tickets in the hat and </p><p>maybe yuh can settle this argument.” </p><p>“Your wisdom is to be applauded, Buck,” </p><p>says Chuck. “Sheath that cemetery pro- </p><p>moter, and we’ll rest easier and think </p><p>clearer. Ricky, give me that hat with the </p><p>tickets in.” </p><p> “Where’s your danged hat?” asks Ricky,</p><p>down on his hands and knees under the </p><p>table. “If it was down here—let loose, </p><p>you cross between uh Shanghai rooster and </p><p>uh giraffe! Huh!” </p><p> Ricky’s hand comes up over the table-top,</p><p>and produces one square of white paper. </p><p> “Your hat’s still here, Chuck, but that</p><p>danged bird has ate up all the tickets except </p><p>that number thirteen. I took that away </p><p>from him and—ouch! Yuh will, will yuh!” </p><p> “Biff! Coo-oo-orlook.”</p><p> Ricky must uh kicked that bird for get-</p><p>ting familiar, ’cause it comes right up into </p><p>our midst with dangerous intent written </p><p>on its countenance. </p><p>I LOVE birds. Maw used to have </p><p>uh canary, and I cried when it </p><p>passed out. I got uh lot uh feath- </p><p>ered friends, and I never met uh bird be- </p><p>fore that even attempted to kick me. </p><p>I don’t think that thing was uh bird in </p><p>the first place. I’d call it uh cross between </p><p>uh mean disposition and uh piledriver, </p><p>’cause it kicked Ike Harper, Esq., right </p><p>where he wears his pancakes. Ike Harper </p><p>immediate and soon skids across the floor </p><p>and plays uh billiard off Judge Steele and </p><p>Buck Masterson, and finishes up by holing </p><p>out under uh chair. </p><p> I peeks out from my ambush and observes</p><p>that alleged bird leave that low grog-shop </p><p>with Scenery hanging on to its neck and </p><p>Dirty Shirt hold of its tail. Somebody - </p><p>must uh cut that rope. The rest of the </p><p>audience, except me and Buck and the </p><p>judge, foilers in the rear. </p><p> I must uh hit Buck and the judge pretty</p><p>hard. Buck has got uh cut over his eye </p><p>where he bumped against the bar on his </p><p>way down, and the judge fell between the </p><p>bar and the rail, with his feet under the </p><p>rail. </p><p> I hauls the judge around so his back is</p><p>against the bar, with the rail across his- lap, </p><p>and folds his hands. Then I helps Buck </p><p>into uh chair, where he sets and makes </p><p>funny little noises. </p><p> “Railami,” states the judge, without</p><p>opening his eyes. </p><p> “Z-z-z-mnkujJ ’’ says I.</p><p> “Uf-uf-uf-fuf,” says Buck.</p><p> It sure was an intelligible conversation.</p><p>It was just about sensible enough for uh </p><p>gathering like that and we all enjoyed it. </p><p>Sudden like the noise starts percolating </p><p>94 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>down the street again, and I starts for the </p><p>door. I said I “started,” and that’s as far </p><p>as I got. Pete Gonyer’s pet coyote pup </p><p>must uh wanted uh railami, too, and it </p><p>wasn’t below its dignity to come right into </p><p>uh saloon to get it either. </p><p> In they comes, crowding each other for</p><p>first place, and starts making a three-ring </p><p>circus out uh Buck’s place. I’d tell uh </p><p>man that there was something going on in </p><p>there. That stilt-legged, overgrown fool- </p><p>hen sure can cut circles, and that pup ain’t </p><p>no slouch either. All outdoors seems to </p><p>beckon that bird, but he don’t sabe mirrors. </p><p>He cuts his last lap about two feet in the </p><p>lead of that pup, hops high, wide and </p><p>handsome to the top of the bar and meets </p><p>itself in Buck’s bar-mirror. </p><p> Bounce? Say, that bird simply turns</p><p>over in the air and comes back like uh </p><p>rubber ball. The coyote is yelping its </p><p>fool head off, trying to climb the bar, when </p><p>that mass uh feathers and legs hits him </p><p>dead center on the rebound. </p><p> Scenery Sims is just staggering in the</p><p>door when that pup opines he can hear his </p><p>maw calling him, and he tangles with poor </p><p>little Scenery on his way out. Scenery </p><p>loses his feet, so, as long as he ain’t got no </p><p>visible means of support, he sets down on </p><p>the back of his neck, and that demented </p><p>thing that Magpie bought meets its original </p><p>owner right in the doorway and they goes </p><p>into the street together. </p><p> “Six-te-e-e-e-en!” shrieks Scenery, claw-</p><p>ing at his head, where it had banged against </p><p>uh chair-leg. </p><p> “Ninety-one,” croaks the judge, clawing</p><p>at the bar-rail across his lap. </p><p> “Pass,” declared Buck, vacant like, and</p><p>just then “Doughgod” Smith weaves in. </p><p> He looks us over, foolish like, squints</p><p>hard at the judge, under the rail, and then </p><p>shakes his head and starts for the door. </p><p> “What’s the matter, Dud-Dud-Dough-</p><p>god?” stutters Buck. </p><p> “De-de-de-delirium tut-tut-tut-tremens,”</p><p>stutters Doughgod, right back at him. </p><p> He flops his arms, and sighs deep.</p><p> “No use,” he states. “Must be uh lot</p><p>uh lye in hooch that’ll make uh feller see </p><p>things like that. It was standing down the </p><p>road with its head under uh hard hat— </p><p>uh yaller one!” He shrieked the last sen- </p><p>tence, and lopes out to his bronc, and </p><p>away he goes. </p><p> “Head under uh hat!” whoops Scenery.</p><p>“My-! Hid out like uh ostrich!” And </p><p>then he lopes out of the door. </p><p> “I got uh claim to settle, too,” announces</p><p>the judge. </p><p> He slides out from under that rail, hitches</p><p>up his belt and gallops after Scenery. </p><p> Magpie ambles in the door, snorts the</p><p>dust out of his nose, and Chuck Warner </p><p>is right behind him. Chuck looks like he’d </p><p>been through a revolution. He weaves </p><p>over to the pool-table, gets down on his </p><p>knees and searches the floor. He shakes </p><p>his head, solemn like, and searches his </p><p>pockets once more. </p><p> Pretty soon he gets back on his feet and</p><p>wobbles up to the bar. </p><p> “Buck, you got any caster ile?” he asks.</p><p>“I had all that raffle money in my pocket, </p><p>and I reckon that danged cross between </p><p>uh greyhound and uh duck must uh ate it </p><p>up with them tickets. I can’t find nothing </p><p>but uh five-dollar bill in my pocket.” </p><p> “Let’s see the bill, Chuck,” says Buck,</p><p>and Chuck hands it to him. </p><p> “Thanks,” says Buck. “It ain’t much</p><p>but it will help to pay for that glass.” </p><p>“Dog-gone yuh, Buck!” wails Chuck, </p><p>leaning against the bar, “that bird ain’t </p><p>mine. It lays between Scenery Sims and </p><p>Judge Steele.” </p><p> “The - it does!” squeaks Scenery</p><p>from the doorway. “That bird is too active </p><p>to lay.”</p><p> He walks over to Magpie, and slams that</p><p>yaller hat down over his head until his ears </p><p>stand out like sails. </p><p> “Take your danged pot hat, Magpie!”</p><p>he snaps. “Nobody ought to wear uh hat </p><p>like that. Will some strong unwounded </p><p>man go out and bring in the judge? He </p><p>took that thousand-dollar bird, beast or </p><p>reptile by the leg while I takes the hat off </p><p>its head. I’d uh carried him in but I ain’t </p><p>able to do much. I suppose I got to own </p><p>that bird.” </p><p> “Don’t worry too much about it, Scen-</p><p>ery,” advises Buck. “If the judge opines </p><p>that his number wins you got to fight it </p><p>out among yourselves. If the judge don’t </p><p>survive I reckon he’s got an heir some place </p><p>to take it up.” </p><p> “Air-!” squeaks Scenery. “He was</p><p>trying to get some when I left. That thing </p><p>can give uh mule high, low and the game </p><p>and win.” </p><p> Just then in comes the judge, with</p><p>Tellurium, Half Mile and Dirty Shirt </p><p>Upside Down or Backwards </p><p>95 </p><p>helping to support him. They sets him </p><p>in uh chair and he droops like uh wilted </p><p>lily. </p><p> “How do yuh feel, Judge?” I asks.</p><p>“Paralyzed from the belt-line both ways, </p><p>Ike,” says he, painful like. “I don’t reckon </p><p>the shadder uh death is afar off. I sure </p><p>have had particular-kicked out uh me </p><p>this day and date.” </p><p> “How about your claim to that bird now,</p><p>Iudge?” squeaks Scenery. “I’ll fight it-” </p><p> “Go to it,” wheezes the judge. “I’ll pay</p><p>half your funeral expenses. I hereby </p><p>waives all claim to said monstrosity, and </p><p>grieves to think I ever coveted such uh </p><p>piece uh property.” </p><p> “I’ll take it!” whoops Scenery.</p><p>“I’ll-” </p><p> “With certain formalities, Scenery,”</p><p>states Tellurium, wise like, producing uh </p><p>piece uh paper and unfolding same. “This </p><p>here proclamation was picked up this day </p><p>in the street of Piperock, and unless I’ve </p><p>forgot all the botany I ever learned in </p><p>school we been bidding on the wrong bird. </p><p>You might pe-ruse it, Scenery.” </p><p> He looks at me and Magpie, and hands</p><p>the letter to Scenery. I leans close enough </p><p>to see that it’s the letter that Magpie got </p><p>announcing the shipment from the Fur </p><p>and Feathers Pet Shop. Scenery spells it </p><p>out, with uh squeak after each word. </p><p> “Cassowary,” he snorts at Tellurium,</p><p>and then he turns appealing like to Magpie: </p><p>“You ain’t going to send for another one </p><p>are you? Honest, yuh ain’t, are yuh, </p><p>Magpie?” </p><p> “Ker-boomI Ker-bang!”</p><p>BTHE house shakes with the con- </p><p>cussion and Buck drops uh glass </p><p>he’s been polishing for ten minutes. </p><p>He looks under the bar, and gasps— </p><p> “My riot-gun!”</p><p> We sets there and looks at each other</p><p>for uh minute, and then the judge runs his </p><p>fingers painful like through his hair, and </p><p>orates in uh peevish, wailing tone— </p><p> “Well, dang it all, send for uh doctor or</p><p>uh coroner.” </p><p> Somebody starts to get both when the</p><p>door flies open and in walks Chuck. He </p><p>nmbles the length of the room and slams </p><p>the .shotgun down on the bar. </p><p> “-!” he snorts, “I shot its crop all</p><p>to -!” </p><p> “Is—is it dead?” quavers the judge.</p><p> “I don’t know, Judge,” replies Chuck,</p><p>weary like. “It was when I left.” </p><p> “What’d yuh shoot it for?” asks Scenery.</p><p>“It ate up all that raffle money—dang </p><p>its hide! Now, I shot the treasury all to </p><p>flinders.” </p><p> “Raffle money!” snorts Tellurium. “Did</p><p>anybody pay yuh cash, Chuck? I know </p><p>danged well I didn’t. I just signed your </p><p>paper for it.” </p><p> Chuck looks blank like for uh minute,</p><p>feels of his head, and snorts: </p><p> “Cripes! I sure must uh been kicked</p><p>hard. Where’s Ricky?” </p><p> “Right here,” chirps Ricky. “What yuh</p><p>want?” </p><p> “Where’s that piece uh paper I gave yuh</p><p>just before the raffle started?” </p><p> “Piece uh—oh, that piece. Gosh! Was</p><p>that worth anything, Chuck? "I remember </p><p>you handing it to me, and telling me to put </p><p>it in my pocket, but I thought yuh was </p><p>joshing. Well, I was standing over there </p><p>by that shotgun, after Buck puts it back </p><p>on the bar, and unless I’m mistaken I sort </p><p>uh absent-minded like shoved it into the </p><p>muzzle uh that gun. I’m sorry-” </p><p> “You’re welcome,” states Chuck, offhand</p><p>like. “It looks to me like I’d shot the </p><p>business all to - with the profits. I </p><p>lose eleven dollars and four cents on the deal. ” </p><p>“What I want to know is this: is that </p><p>bird critter still in the land of the living?” </p><p>interrupts Scenery Sims. </p><p> “What I want to know is—has somebody</p><p>got some liniment?” states the judge, and </p><p>then me and Magpie and Chuck goes outside. </p><p> “Ain’t it awful?” complains Chuck.</p><p>“The goose that was going to lay the golden </p><p>aig is dead, and your two hundred is all shot </p><p>to pieces.” </p><p> “Just because uh sixteen upside down is</p><p>ninety-one,” agrees Magpie. “How do yuh </p><p>figure you’re out eleven dollars and four </p><p>cents?” </p><p> “I gave uh five spot to Art for holding</p><p>his tongue, and Buck took uh five for the </p><p>busted looking-glass. Sabe? That’s ten. </p><p>The dollar I had to pay uh feller in Great </p><p>Falls for writing that scientific letter, one </p><p>dollar, and it cost me postage both ways. </p><p>She totals up to eleven dollars and four </p><p>cents, Magpie.” </p><p> “Say, Chuck, where did yuh invent the</p><p>name ‘Railami’ for that bird?” </p><p> “Spell it backward, Ike,” says he.</p><p> “You are,” states Magpie.</p><p>A. STiif-t into Reverse </p><p> Rog P Churchill</p><p>Author of “Danny Takes a Chance,” “The Welding,” etc. </p><p>HIS Dugan is ruinin’ the second </p><p>division. Somebody oughter </p><p>make him lay off. That poor </p><p>bunch of long-timers show about </p><p>as much pep when he’s through with ’em </p><p>as a charge of black powder that’s been </p><p>overboard. What ails him?” </p><p> “Slim” Higgins was speaking. He and</p><p>Dick Reasoner were stopping their scrub- </p><p>and-wash clothes on the line. The decks </p><p>of the United States Training-Ship Dixie </p><p>were still half dark, and the long line of </p><p>wet clothing which would be triced up </p><p>before sunup, hid another man near enough </p><p>the two to overhear. This man stooped </p><p>under the line and faced Slim Higgins. </p><p> “What’s it to you?” he growled menac-</p><p>ingly. “Any old time you want to butt </p><p>in on my business, hop to it. You and </p><p>any other stool-pidgeoning rate that’s look- </p><p>ing for trouble.” </p><p> This was Cain Dugan. A burly, thick-</p><p>chested, boatswain’s mate who had taken </p><p>the paid-off Billy Yonts’ place at the last </p><p>home-coming of the ship. He turned from </p><p>Higgins to Reasoner, for while he had </p><p>successfully cowed the leaders and the </p><p>men of the other divisions, he had been </p><p>unable to fathom this tall, slow-moving, </p><p>even-tempered master-at-arms. </p><p> "Weill’' he demanded, thrusting forward</p><p> his heavy black-bearded jaw and doubling</p><p> his fists until the muscle-corded arms</p><p> ridged into knotty lumps. “This signal-</p><p> stick asked you a question. I’m waiting</p><p> for the answer.”</p><p> It was Dugan’s boast that he did not</p><p> fear God, man or devil, and the manner</p><p> of his life bore out his statement, for he</p><p> and the devil were cronies, he did not</p><p> know God, and he was a master of men.</p><p> Reasoner laughed easily. Laughed in</p><p> the other’s face as calmly, as much without</p><p> anger and without fear as if it was his</p><p> every-day job to be threatened.</p><p> “Don’t get excited, Dugan,” he said.</p><p> “If you care to listen, I’ll go on and tell</p><p> Slim what he wants to know.”</p><p> Dugan relaxed. Sooner or later he would</p><p> get a chance at this fellow, but this did not</p><p> seem the time.</p><p> “Go on,” he said sullenly.</p><p> “You’re too hard on the recruits. Every</p><p> officer on the ship knows it, but they are</p><p> hoping you’ll improve.”</p><p> “I know you tattled everything aft,”</p><p> interrupted Dugan.</p><p> Reasoner ignored him. This was rank</p><p> insult to an enlisted man, but no one had</p><p> yet been able to stampede Dick Reasoner,</p><p> and a man of Dugan’s stamp should have</p><p> known better than to try. When Reasoner</p><p> 96</p><p>A Shift into Reverse </p><p>97 </p><p>was ready, he would act, and all the </p><p>Dugans in the world could not make him </p><p>lose his head. </p><p> “You are not apt to improve,” he con-</p><p>tinued, “but I want to give you a little </p><p>warning. That second division itself is </p><p>the thing you want to look out for. You </p><p>can’t drive a bunch of youngsters like that </p><p>too far. They will kick back in the end. </p><p>That’s the comfort I wanted to give Slim, </p><p>and I’m glad you could hear it.” </p><p> “What’ll we call it?” scoffed Dugan.</p><p>“This whole ship’s company act like a lot </p><p>of Sunday-school teachers. One real he- </p><p>man in the bunch is treated as a freak. </p><p>That gang of sissies in my division haven’t </p><p>enough real manhood to animate a jelly- </p><p>fish. Me afraid of them! Why I could </p><p>pierce all their noses and make ’em wear </p><p>rings in ’em.” </p><p> Reasoner had finished what he had to</p><p>say. He turned from Dugan and began </p><p>to get his things together. Dugan ducked </p><p>under the line and a few minutes later </p><p>had crowded one of his division from a </p><p>favored place at the line and began to hang </p><p>up his clothes. </p><p> As Slim Higgins and Reasoner went aft</p><p>to other duties Slim’s unspoken question </p><p>was answered by his companion. </p><p> “He’s a tough nut, Slim. You’re won-</p><p>dering why I took the guff I did, but a fist- </p><p>fight won’t cure that fellow. He’s used </p><p>to that. He’d put up an awful scrap, and </p><p>even if I could best him, would still brow- </p><p>beat his division as bad as ever. I have </p><p>looked him up in the book. The word is </p><p>‘bide’ and it means to suffer and wait for. </p><p>That second division will not stand for the </p><p>treatment he gives them, and sooner or later </p><p>its time will come. That’s why I’m wait- </p><p>ing; maybe it’ll help Dugan.” </p><p> “The only way you can cure a man like</p><p>that is to shoot him with a bird gun at </p><p>three paees,” said Slim. “I know you </p><p>always dodge a fight until the last minute, </p><p>but you are goin’ to have to lick this Dugan </p><p>or he licks you pretty pronto.” </p><p> “Dictionary” Dick shook his head. He</p><p>was opposed to violence. The little worn </p><p>dictionary which he kept in his sea-chest </p><p>and sometimes in his blouse, carried many </p><p>solutions besides “fight.” To settle a </p><p>vexed question he looked for an answer </p><p>in the book. “Everything’s in it,” was </p><p>one of his favorite retorts to criticism. </p><p>“All you have to do is to find the right </p><p> word.” And his shipmates on the Dixie</p><p>had long since ceased to hold lightly the </p><p>advice he gave. Somehow things had a </p><p>way of working out as Reasoner said, </p><p>and the officers turned over to him many </p><p>strange problems among the recruits which </p><p>the training on the Dixie was to make fit </p><p>for places in the big fleet. </p><p> And Dictionary Dick usually found a</p><p>way out. In this case it was a petty </p><p>officer who was causing trouble. Like a </p><p>happy family the ship’s company of the </p><p>Dixie had taken on draft after draft of </p><p>recruits, had worked together, molding </p><p>and fitting them for duty, until Billy </p><p>Yonts, chief petty-officer of the second </p><p>division, was paid off and Dugan had come </p><p>to take his place. </p><p> “The second division is falling behind,”</p><p>complained the first lieutenant. “What’s </p><p>the trouble, Dugan?” </p><p> This was a week after the conversation</p><p>at the wash-line. The men were lined up </p><p>for inspection, and the second had showed </p><p>up poorer than usual in the morning drill. </p><p>It had been “away all boats,” and the </p><p>division had failed to provide all their </p><p>equipment, had rowed raggedly, and had </p><p>not kept up in the evolutions. The men </p><p>were nervous and full of false movements </p><p>and the vicious string of commands from </p><p>Dugan made them worse instead of better. </p><p> “They’re a bunch of quitters, sir,” said</p><p>Dugan, putting all the contempt that he </p><p>could into the words and making them </p><p>loud enough so that all the division heard. </p><p> “You’re here to help train the men,</p><p>not find fault with them,” spoke the first </p><p>lieutenant sharply. “Find out the cause, </p><p>and correct it.” </p><p> This Dugan proceeded to do in his own</p><p>way. The division had no rest from him.</p><p>More than half the men went on the report </p><p>for trivial infractions of the rules and all </p><p>went about their tasks jerkily. At the </p><p>next inspection they had not improved, </p><p>and their nervousness had given place to </p><p>a sullen resentment at all authority in </p><p>general and to Cain Dugan in particular. </p><p>The first lieutenant sent for Dugan. </p><p> “Your division is not improving,” he</p><p>said severely. “They haven’t been going </p><p>ahead since Yonts was paid off, and now </p><p>they are going back. Is it you or the men?” </p><p> “Yonts babied them too much, sir,” said</p><p>Dugan. “They’re spoiled, but give me </p><p>time, and I’ll break them.” </p><p>98 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> The first lieutenant shook his head.</p><p> “I don’t know about that. Maybe you</p><p>are too hard on them. Try easing up.” </p><p>“Aye, aye, sir,” said Dugan, with as </p><p>much anger as he dared, and from then on </p><p>drove the division harder than ever. </p><p>AGAIN it was early morning, and </p><p>the men were stopping their clothes </p><p>on the line. Little Bryan Weber </p><p>of the second had crept out of his hammock </p><p>half an hour early, and had just finished </p><p>up a big wash. At the line Dugan shoved </p><p>him aside and took his place—a place </p><p>forward where the wet clothing was in no </p><p>danger of swinging against the stays and </p><p>being soiled. This was not the first time </p><p>that little Weber had been roughly handled </p><p>by Dugan. The other times he had been </p><p>afraid to resent it, but now after weeks of </p><p>bad treatment he could stand it no longer, </p><p>and revolted. </p><p> “Get out of my place,” he cried shrilly,</p><p>“I was there first.” </p><p> Dugan paid no attention. With his</p><p>back turned he was impudently unconscious </p><p>of the other. </p><p> Bryan Weber was small and slight, and</p><p>had come into the Navy with the hard- </p><p>won consent of his parents when he was </p><p>barely seventeen, but he was manly and </p><p>studious, and under the tutelage of Billy </p><p>Yonts had made good progress. Dugan </p><p>had taken a special dislike to him, and </p><p>continually gave him the worst end of all </p><p>the watches and lookouts. </p><p> Robbed of his place and ignored, Weber</p><p>was beside himself with rage and humili- </p><p>ation, and Cain Dugan had the surprise of </p><p>his bullying life when the boy charged, </p><p>striking blindly with both fists. </p><p> “Why you little devil,” said Dugan.</p><p>“Haven’t I taught you anything yet?” </p><p>and he struck with one of his big fists. </p><p> The boy whirled dizzily, and fell back-</p><p>ward across the deck at the feet of Dick </p><p>Reasoner. Dugan followed and raised his </p><p>foot to kick him where he lay stunned.</p><p>The foot was bare, but a sailor’s bare, </p><p>tough toes are not the ineffectual weapons </p><p>of a shoe-wearing man. </p><p> “That’ll do,” said Reasoner, stepping</p><p>over the boy, and facing the angry Dugan. </p><p> “For you, yes. But it won’t do for me.</p><p>Out of the way, or I’ll paste you.” </p><p> Reasoner did not answer. Behind him</p><p>Bryan Weber crawled to his feet and </p><p>lurched unsteadily away across the deck. </p><p>Dugan started after him. </p><p> “That’ll do,” repeated Reasoner sharply.</p><p>His tone was commanding, and the words </p><p>those of a man who expected to be obeyed. </p><p>Dugan took the challenge. </p><p> “We might as well settle it now,” he said.</p><p>“You’ve butted in once too often into my </p><p>business.” </p><p> Both men were barefoot, and faced</p><p>each other across a length of wet deck, </p><p>slippery with soap from the clothes-scrub- </p><p>bing. They wore undershirts and trousers, </p><p>and in the half light of the early morning </p><p>were safe from interference from aft. </p><p> Cain Dugan had won his many rough-</p><p>and-tumble fights by bull rushes and his </p><p>ability to stand punishment. He was not </p><p>ignorant of the finer rules and science of </p><p>boxing, but chose to ignore them for a </p><p>freer display of his brute strength. His </p><p>game was to tear his opponent down, over- </p><p>whelm his defense, trample him under foot. </p><p>Without further warning he drove in, </p><p>striking wickedly. </p><p> Reasoner met the attack unexpectedly.</p><p>Other men had always given way before </p><p>Dugan’s vicious rush. It was to be ex- </p><p>pected that this rather slow and reluctant </p><p>opponent would do the same, but Dick </p><p>Reasoner was no longer slow. His body </p><p>stiffened as if the material in him had been </p><p>suddenly tempered into spring steel. His </p><p>long loose-jointed frame drew into itself, </p><p>became compact, finely knit, a working </p><p>unit of perfectly coordinated parts. Du- </p><p>gan’s rush met a swifter one from the made- </p><p>over Reasoner. Before his adversary could </p><p>gather momentum he had landed two </p><p>punishing blows where they would do the</p><p>most good. Dugan shook his head side- </p><p>ways to offset the shock, and stepped back. </p><p>His charge had been ruined by this quick </p><p>counter attack. </p><p> Reasoner gave him no rest, no chance</p><p>to draw breath. All the half-forgotten </p><p>science that he had ignored, Dugan used </p><p>for defense, and all his wonderful store of </p><p>strength he called on to withstand the </p><p>shower of blows. As he fought he threat- </p><p>ened and abused, but the silent Reasoner </p><p>met all his rushes with swifter attacks and </p><p>continued to lash out blows that Dugan at </p><p>first ignored, and then came to dread. </p><p> “It does my heart good to see old Dic-</p><p>tionary Dick in action,” said Slim Higgins </p><p>to the group that surrounded the two men. </p><p>A Shift into Reverse </p><p>99 </p><p>“Dugan had it in his head that he was </p><p>boss of the ship. I guess this’ll throw a </p><p>crimp into him. Dick’s wearin’ him out.” </p><p> Dugan realized at last that he was</p><p>getting the worst of the fight. It made </p><p>him furious, and he began to use his head. </p><p>Covering up as best he could, he saved </p><p>his strength for another rush. It was </p><p>getting lighter, and by Reasoner’s side </p><p>was a spot of soapy deck. He maneuvered </p><p>to get Reasoner on it. </p><p> Slim Higgins saw the danger.</p><p> “Look out for the soap to the left, Dick,”</p><p>he called. “He’s workin’ you over to it.” </p><p> The warning came too late. Dugan</p><p>rushed with all the power of his carefully </p><p>hoarded strength. Reasoner slipped on </p><p>the soap and went down. Before he could </p><p>get up, Dugan had leaped at his prostrate </p><p>body, feet first. What he meant to do </p><p>was to put Reasoner out by jumping on </p><p>him with his one hundred and eighty </p><p>pounds. Reasoner squirmed aside, and </p><p>as Dugan tried again, lay face up on the </p><p>deck. </p><p> “Shame! Let him get up!” cried those</p><p>watching. </p><p> A Navy fist-fight has one clearly defined</p><p>rule. There are no rounds, but when </p><p>a man is down, the other man must let </p><p>him get to his feet before he attacks again. </p><p> The interference was unnecessary in</p><p>this case. As Dugan jumped Reasoner </p><p>struck upward with his feet, catching </p><p>Dugan in the stomach. It was a blow </p><p>delivered with all the tense strength of </p><p>Reasoner’s powerful body from the hunched </p><p>Shoulders and neck braced by the deck, </p><p>up through the muscular back and legs </p><p>to the balls of his hard feet. Dugan </p><p>grunted as they struck him, and his weight </p><p>sagged down inertly over Reasoner, who </p><p>with another heave threw him backward </p><p>to the deck. Dugan did not get up. </p><p> “The word is ‘cul-de-sac',” said Reasoner,</p><p>getting up slowly and assuming his usual </p><p>drawl. “I looked it up last week. It</p><p>means when you are hemmed in and no </p><p>way out but to fight.” </p><p> Cain Dugan did not mend his ways</p><p>with the second division. He recognized </p><p>no power but force, and while he respected </p><p>Reasoner, he felt that no other man on </p><p>the ship had a right to consideration, but </p><p>even under his increased driving the </p><p>division began to improve in its work. </p><p> “How do you account for it?” asked</p><p>Slim. “Dugan is about as bad as ever </p><p>with his bunch, but they’re doin’ better. </p><p>They’re snappier in the drills and don’t </p><p>look so hopeless.” </p><p> “They are beginning to see that Dugan</p><p>isn’t invincible,” said Reasoner. “Their </p><p>self-respect is returning. Half a dozen </p><p>of them will be getting together and giving </p><p>him a licking, some shore leave, and it is </p><p>his own doing, for he’s driving the lesson </p><p>into them every day that might is right.” </p><p>“Is that dope in the book?” </p><p> “The word is ‘rebellion’. I’ve just</p><p>finished telling you what it means.” </p><p> “Here’s a good one,” said Slim, “and</p><p>it fits the case: ‘Oh why should the head </p><p>of a mortal be bone?’ ‘Batty’ McGinnis </p><p>sprung it on me when he was watchin’ this </p><p>Dugan makin’ it hard on the Weber kid, </p><p>and Batty told me something else. He’s </p><p>been shipmates with Dugan before. When </p><p>Dugan was paid off on his first cruise he </p><p>married and intended to stay on the out- </p><p>side, but in six months or less he was back </p><p>worse than ever. His wife couldn’t put </p><p>up with his ways, and she divorced him for </p><p>cruelty. He’s a bad hombre. I hope the </p><p>division gives it to him good when they </p><p>do get a chance.” </p><p> “You say he’s making it hard for little</p><p>Weber?” </p><p> “Yes, makin’ him scrub clothes for him,</p><p>and soakin’ him all the extra duty he dares, </p><p>but he hasn’t got the kid bluffed, even </p><p>if he thinks he has him crawlin’ in the dust. </p><p>Just as you say, he’s waitin’ a chance </p><p>and lettin’ Dugan think he’s a willin’ slave </p><p>until he gets a poke at him. He slipped </p><p>me this news, too. He found a letter in </p><p>one of Dugan’s pockets when he was wash-</p><p>in’ out a suit. He read it and then threw </p><p>it overboard. It was from Dugan’s wife </p><p>tellin’ him she was married again, and to </p><p>stop writin’ threatenin’ letters, or she would </p><p>turn ’em over to the police.” </p><p> JUST after the mid-watch came on,</p><p>SwCK two nights after Slim and Reasoner </p><p>ivQffl jia(j talked over Dugan’s case and </p><p>the second division, the radio man on </p><p>watch caught a message which made him </p><p>send a messenger-boy hurrying to the </p><p>officer of the deck. That officer woke the </p><p>first lieutenant, and after a few minutes’ </p><p>investigation the captain was called. The </p><p>passenger steamer Senator was afire, and </p><p>the fire was beyond control of the crew. </p><p>100 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Being forward, the ship was afraid to run </p><p>into the wind toward shore on account of </p><p>fanning the flames aft, and they were </p><p>asking for help. </p><p> The Dixie was a bare hundred miles</p><p>away, and the nearest other ship was three </p><p>times that. It- was up to the training-ship. </p><p>The Senator carried a big passenger-list, </p><p>and a good part of her cargo was ammu- </p><p>nition. When the Dixie picked her up, </p><p>she asked that rescue hurry, as the passen- </p><p>gers were demanding to be allowed to take </p><p>to the boats, which the officers refused to do, </p><p>as long as the Senator could steam back- </p><p>ward toward land, and there was a chance </p><p>of getting control of the fire. </p><p> The Dixie answered that she was coming</p><p>at full speed, and the final word from the </p><p>Senator was that the fire was gaining, and </p><p>there would be barely time to get the </p><p>passengers to safety before the ammunition </p><p>would be in danger. She had changed her </p><p>course, and was running toward the Dixie, </p><p>with the offshore wind on her beam. </p><p> “We will sight her before daylight,”</p><p>said the captain. “We are making eighteen </p><p>knots and she about fifteen. That will </p><p>give us about three hours. Let the crew </p><p>sleep for two of them, and then call the </p><p>Fire and Rescue Party.” </p><p> “Aye, aye, sir,” answered the first</p><p>lieutenant. “The boat’s crews will need </p><p>all the rest they can get. I would suggest, </p><p>sir, that I have the cooks called so the men </p><p>may have their breakfast before they are </p><p>called away.” </p><p> Lighting up the sky just as the dawn was</p><p>lighting the east, the lookouts caught their </p><p>first glimpse of the burning ship. An angry </p><p>red glow, topped with smoke, almost hid </p><p>her forward decks. The wireless was silent. </p><p>Half an hour before the office had been </p><p>burned out, and the last message had been </p><p>“Hurry!” </p><p> Mustered around the Dixie's decks were</p><p>the members of the Fire and Rescue Party. </p><p>Most of the men who were to handle the </p><p>boats with the boarding party were from </p><p>the second division, and Cain Dugan was</p><p>in charge. The other divisions were cast- </p><p>ing off the securing lines, and getting their </p><p>own boats provided and ready to rig out. </p><p> “Get them all ready,” was the first</p><p>lieutenant’s order. “The Senator’s boats </p><p>will be overloaded and some of them are </p><p>too far forward to use.” </p><p> As the ships drew nearer together the</p><p>Senator stopped her engines and began to </p><p>lower her after boats. The sea was smooth </p><p>and the launching not difficult. </p><p> “Do not overload the boats,” signaled</p><p>the Dixie. “We will use ours to supplement </p><p>yours.” </p><p> It was soon light enough to see the men</p><p>and women lining the after rails of the ship, </p><p>and the groups around the boats. </p><p> The Dixie was now close in, and as soon</p><p>as her way was stopped the order came, </p><p>“Away Fire and Rescue Party!” The first </p><p>men went in the two lifeboats with only </p><p>the regular crew and hospital steward. </p><p>The cutters and launches would follow, </p><p>and some of them carry the artificers, </p><p>portable extinguisher detail, and artificial </p><p>breathing apparatus. The first boats were </p><p>to rescue the lives and the others to fight </p><p>the fire, if it were feasible. </p><p> Running alongside the burning ship the</p><p>boats filled to capacity and returned to </p><p>the Dixie, then went back for another </p><p>load. It was hard, exciting work. The </p><p>passengers came first, some of them cool, </p><p>some half-hysterical, most of them insisting </p><p>on bringing their baggage. The Dixie's </p><p>men mingled with the crew of the Senator, </p><p>lifting children and women into the boats, </p><p>comforting the frightened, keeping back </p><p>the cowardly able-bodied who pushed for- </p><p>ward for first places. </p><p> Cain Dugan had returned for his second</p><p>load. The Senator’s boats and those from </p><p>the Dixie had thinned out the passengers. </p><p>Dugan was his usual self. On his first trip </p><p>he had quarreled with a sailor from the </p><p>Senator, and knocked the man down when </p><p>he sought to take a place in the boat. </p><p> “Get out,” he said harshly. “We’ll get</p><p>you in plenty of time.”</p><p> But the man came on, and Dugan struck</p><p>him. Not until then did he see that the </p><p>man was badly burned. </p><p> “Served him right,” he growled.</p><p>“Shovin’ in. Why didn’t he say he was </p><p>hurt?” </p><p> “You didn’t give him time,” expostu-</p><p>lated the hospital steward. “I intend to </p><p>report you for it.” </p><p> All this had not improved Dugan’s</p><p>temper. On the way over he had abused </p><p>his crew for slowness, when they were </p><p>rowing as if in a race, for the fact that </p><p>they were taking part in a rescue, and </p><p>that the fire might reach the ammunition </p><p>on the Senator and blow her up at any </p><p>A Shift into Reverse </p><p>IOI </p><p>minute, was stimulation enough for the </p><p>youngsters. Until Dugan railed at them, </p><p>they had forgotten how they hated him. </p><p> Alongside the Senator a few passengers</p><p>and a part of the crew who had been re- </p><p>lieved from the fire-fighting, came into the </p><p>boat at once, but when there was still </p><p>room for half a dozen more, they stopped </p><p>coming. Dugan stepped out of the boat </p><p>and ran up the ship’s gangway to the deck. </p><p>He wanted to get a full load before he </p><p>shoved off. </p><p> A man met him at the top. He wore</p><p>no hat, his face was scorched, his eyes red. </p><p> “Help!” he cried, in a voice full of</p><p>anxiety. </p><p> “Shut up yappin’,” ordered Dugan.</p><p>“You grown men give me a pain, actin’ </p><p>like a lot of babies.” </p><p> “My wife,” explained the man, resenting</p><p>the other’s tone, “not me. I want help </p><p>to get her up from below.” </p><p> “Where below?”</p><p> “Don’t stand there asking questions, but</p><p>get some more of your crew and come.” </p><p>Dugan realized that the man’s emotions </p><p>were not fear for himself, but worry for </p><p>some one else. </p><p> “All right,” he agreed, and called down</p><p>to the boat, “Come on deck, one of you.” </p><p>The men hesitated. “Weber,” desig- </p><p>nated Dugan, used to calling on the boy </p><p>for extra tasks, and in a moment he joined </p><p>Dugan and the passenger, and the three </p><p>ran down the deck toward the fire. As </p><p>they went the man explained. </p><p> “When the fire-alarm came, I went to</p><p>help with the fire, and my wife said she </p><p>would call the other passengers near us. </p><p>They put me where I couldn’t get away, </p><p>and for hours I haven’t seen her. I have </p><p>watched every boat that was loaded. </p><p>Between times I have searched the state- </p><p>room and all those near it. The smoke </p><p>is awful down there and she has been over- </p><p>come and is lying unconscious somewhere.</p><p>I want you to help me find her.” </p><p> In the passage alongside the staterooms</p><p>the smoke became worse as the three men </p><p>went forward. </p><p> “A little more of this and I go back,”</p><p>objected Dugan; “your wife probably </p><p>went in one of the boats while you were </p><p>looking at another.” </p><p> “This is our stateroom,” said the man,</p><p>“I’ll look once more to be sure.” </p><p> Dugan and Weber followed.</p><p> Inside the room the smoke was not so</p><p>dense and a woman tottered toward their </p><p>guide from where she had been lying </p><p>across the bunk. </p><p> “John!” she cried, “I’ve been looking</p><p>everywhere for you. I was afraid you </p><p>were hurt. Take me out of here.” </p><p>Tha»man put his arm around the woman </p><p>and turned toward the door. </p><p> “Yes, dear,” he said soothingly, “there</p><p>are plenty of boats. Here are two men </p><p>from the rescue ship. We will go now.” </p><p>DUGAN had been behind the man, </p><p>and the woman had not yet seen </p><p>him, but Bryan Weber had seen </p><p>the shock of surprise, followed by the </p><p>spasm of hate, which went over his features </p><p>as he heard the woman speak, and then </p><p>looked from behind her husband at her </p><p>face. The man’s revolver lay on a small </p><p>table at one side of the room. Dugan </p><p>stepped quickly forward and secured it. </p><p> The woman’s eyes followed him fasci-</p><p>nated. </p><p> “Cain!” she cried, “Cain Dugan! Stop</p><p>him, John! He’ll kill you.” </p><p> Her voice rose into the hysterical note of</p><p>absolute terror, and as her husband turned </p><p>toward Dugan she repeated the warning </p><p>in a barely audible whisper as she passed </p><p>into unconsciousness. </p><p> “Yes, Alice,” said Cain Dugan, addressing</p><p>the woman as if she could still hear what </p><p>he was saying. “The devil is good to his </p><p>own. I knew that the big chance would</p><p>come. I intend to kill this home-breaker </p><p>before your eyes, just as I have always </p><p>sworn to do.” </p><p> Dugan was so full of his anger that he</p><p>did not realize at first that the limp form </p><p>of the woman in her husband’s arms could </p><p>not hear what he had to say. Then he </p><p>addressed the man. </p><p> “So you are John Ryan. I’ll show you</p><p>how to break up a man’s home.” </p><p> Ryan did not answer.</p><p> “Everything has happened so well for</p><p>me,” continued Dugan, his words charged </p><p>with sneering triumph. “I will shoot you </p><p>in a moment and then carry the woman </p><p>out to the boats. She has fainted and </p><p>won’t see me do it, but then that allows </p><p>me to tell my own tale when I come to trial. </p><p>A man mustn't expect too much.” </p><p> John Ryan was no coward. As he faced</p><p>Dugan’s deadly rage his eyes did not waver </p><p>102 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>and his brain went over swiftly every detail </p><p>of escape that he could think of. Why </p><p>hadn’t he thought of the pistol! He had </p><p>laid it out so that it would be at hand if </p><p>he needed it, and the precaution had been </p><p>Dugan’s opportunity. When Dugan’s eyes </p><p>hardened into a resolution to fire he would </p><p>drop his wife and leap at his enemy, but </p><p>until then what? The sight of little Bryan </p><p>Weber gave him an idea. The boy stood </p><p>close to the door and a little behind Dugan. </p><p> “You forget the man with you,” said</p><p>Ryan. “He will have a different tale </p><p>from yours. With Alice’s testimony the </p><p>two of them will convict you.” </p><p>“Man!” exclaimed Dugan, “that poor </p><p>shrimp is no man. He’ll do as I say, swear </p><p>as I say, or keep his mouth shut as I say. </p><p>He knows that I will kill him if he doesn’t.” </p><p>Bryan Weber wet his lips. </p><p> “Don’t do it, Dugan,” he pleaded in a</p><p>voice which shook with his effort to keep it </p><p>steady. “These two people love one an- </p><p>other and are happy together. You shan’t </p><p>do it. You may threaten all you like, but </p><p>I will tell on you as sure as I live if you </p><p>shoot this man.” </p><p> “You won’t live, you little squealer.</p><p>Say you’ll keep your mouth shut or I’ll </p><p>begin on you.” </p><p> He turned the pistol toward the boy,</p><p>but before he could point it, Ryan had </p><p>grasped the opportunity and hurled him- </p><p>self forward, letting his wife slip to the </p><p>floor. One of his clutching hands struck </p><p>the gun and knocked it to the deck as he </p><p>grappled with Dugan. Weber leaped for </p><p>it as swiftly as a cat jumps for a mouse, </p><p>and caught it up. </p><p> Dugan had recovered from the first</p><p>shock of the other’s attack. Pulling Ryan’s </p><p>hands from his throat he hurled him across </p><p>the deck, and as the man stumbled to his </p><p>feet met him with a blow in the face which </p><p>sent him down beside his wife. Then he </p><p>turned to Weber. </p><p> “Gimme that gun,” he ordered. “I</p><p>want to finish this job before this old wagon</p><p>blows up.” </p><p> “No!” said Weber, backing away, “leave</p><p>them alone or I’ll shoot.” </p><p> “Shoot!” dared Dugan, still advancing.</p><p>“You haven’t got the nerve. You poor </p><p>chicken-hearted mama’s boy.” </p><p> Weber had his back to the wall.</p><p> “Keep off!” he begged. “I don’t want</p><p>to shoot.” </p><p> “You bet you don’t,” scoffed Dugan,</p><p>and made a flying leap at the boy. </p><p> He really thought that his cruel treat-</p><p>ment on the Dixie had broken the younger </p><p>man’s spirit. </p><p> Weber fired twice. He was quick and</p><p>handy with a revolver, and led his division </p><p>in small-arm practise. Dugan plunged </p><p>blindly on, struck the wall as Weber </p><p>dodged, and slumped down on deck. </p><p>Both shots had hit. </p><p> Ryan was trying to get to his feet and</p><p>Weber helped him. </p><p> “I shot him,” he sobbed. “I’ll help</p><p>you carry your wife out.” </p><p> Together the two men picked up the</p><p>still unconscious woman and groped their </p><p>way down the smoke-filled' passage. As </p><p>they left the stateroom the door slammed </p><p>shut behind them and the latch caught. </p><p> The people on deck had thinned out</p><p>when Weber and Ryan reached the open </p><p>air. “Hurry down the gangway,” advised </p><p>a smoke-blackened sailor, “there’s a boat </p><p>just about to shove off.” </p><p> There are two places in the boat, and</p><p>Weber had Ryan go with his wife. </p><p> “Jump aboard, kid,” advised the Sena-</p><p>tor's officer who was in charge. “You look </p><p>all in and you are light.” </p><p> “No,” said Weber, “I’ll wait for my own</p><p>boat. It’s on the way back now.” </p><p> His mind was confused as to what he</p><p>ought to do.</p><p> The Dixie's boat that Dugan had come in</p><p>had been filled with passengers and shoved </p><p>off to its own ship without waiting for the </p><p>two men absent, and now it was coming </p><p>back with Dick Reasoner in charge. Weber </p><p>saw him as he refused to get in the Senator's </p><p>boat. He felt that Reasoner would under- </p><p>stand about Dugan and he wanted his </p><p>help. The boat shoved off and he stood </p><p>on the lower gangway and waited. </p><p> Before the boat arrived other men</p><p>joined him on the platform. </p><p> “She’s going fast,” said one. “There’s</p><p>only one bulkhead left between the ammu- </p><p>nition and the fire.” </p><p> “The captain is relieving the men and</p><p>fo2tting his papers together,” answered the </p><p>other. “There’s two boats waiting along- </p><p>side the other gangway to take off the last </p><p>of the fire-hose men and the officers.” </p><p>Above him Weber could hear the roar </p><p>of the flames and it seemed as if the noise </p><p>grew momentarily louder. He turned to </p><p>A Shift into Reverse </p><p>103 </p><p>the men by him. Maybe it wasn’t right </p><p>to wait for Reasoner. </p><p> “There’s a man down in stateroom</p><p>twelve,” he blurted out, “he’s hurt-” </p><p> “Twelve, you say,” interrupted the man.</p><p>“Why, I wouldn’t go back into twelve for </p><p>all the money in the world. It’s next the </p><p>refrigerator plant, and the ammonia pipes </p><p>are breaking. Not for me. How do you </p><p>know there’s somebody there yet?” </p><p> Weber did not answer, for Dick Rea-</p><p>soner’s boat was alongside. </p><p> “Where’s Dugan?” asked Reasoner.</p><p>“Things are looking mighty bad, and we </p><p>want to get all our men off. The passen- </p><p>gers are all accounted for, and the rest of </p><p>it is up to the Senator’s officers.” </p><p> “Dugan’s hurt,” said Weber, taking the</p><p>easiest explanation to save time. “He’s </p><p>in stateroom twelve and can’t get out. I </p><p>can’t lift him by myself.” </p><p> “All right,” said Reasoner cheerfully.</p><p>“Jump out, half a dozen of you, and follow </p><p>Weber.” </p><p> Not a man of the second division moved.</p><p>They did not intend to undergo even a </p><p>slight risk for the sake of the hated Dugan. </p><p>Reasoner had feared this. His first thought </p><p>was that if the men of the division would </p><p>help Dugan the man might feel grate- </p><p>ful enough to relax a little in his severity. </p><p>But the feeling against him had gone too </p><p>deep. The second did not care what </p><p>became of Dugan. </p><p> “Come now,” persisted Reasoner. “I</p><p>know how it is, but this has to be done. </p><p>I would go myself if I didn’t think it would </p><p>do more good to have you go. There’s no </p><p>danger.” </p><p> “No danger!” exclaimed one of the men</p><p>on the gangway, and just ready to step into </p><p>the boat. “Number twelve is right at the </p><p>fire, and word has just come that the </p><p>passage is filled with ammonia gas from </p><p>the ice-tanks. The whole blooming ship is</p><p>likely to go fluey any minute!” </p><p> “Out you go,” insisted Reasoner.</p><p> He was sorry now that he had issued the</p><p>order, but once given he felt that it must </p><p>be obeyed for the good of the division. </p><p>His tone was sharp, incisive, the men re- </p><p>spected and liked him. </p><p> “The two forward thwarts,” he directed.</p><p>“We’ll do it for you,” said one of the men, </p><p>as the four stepped on to the gangway. </p><p>Weber ran in front of them. </p><p> “The more we hurry, the safer it will be,”</p><p>he encouraged, but those following did not </p><p>increase their pace. </p><p> “We’ll see how it looks,” muttered one.</p><p>As Weber plunged into the smoke they </p><p>hesitated, ran after him for a few paces, </p><p>and then slowed to a walk. A man with </p><p>his head tucked into his arm and dragging </p><p>a hose, bumped into them. </p><p> “Get out of here!” he directed. “Cap-</p><p>tain’s orders. Take your places for aban- </p><p>don ship!” </p><p> The four stopped. Weber had disap-</p><p>peared in the smoke down the passage. </p><p> “What’s it to me about Dugan?” said</p><p>one. “I’m for taking the safety-first route. </p><p>What do you say, fellows? We can tell </p><p>Reasoner that we couldn’t make it.” </p><p>“Where’s Weber?” asked another. “I </p><p>hate to let the kid go on alone.” </p><p> “When he finds out he’s alone, he’ll come</p><p>on out,” said the first speaker. “We </p><p>couldn’t find him now if we went on.” </p><p> And so it was that the four men trailed</p><p>out into the clearer air on deck, and at the </p><p>suggestion of the leader decided to wait a </p><p>few minutes for Weber before they reported </p><p>to Reasoner. </p><p>CAIN DUGAN only lapsed into </p><p>complete unconsciousness for a few </p><p>minutes. The shock of the two </p><p>steel-jacketed bullets, the first one through </p><p>his upper body, and the other through his </p><p>right arm and shoulder as he extended his </p><p>arm to catch the gun, wore off quickly,</p><p>and as he sat up on the deck he saw that </p><p>he was alone. </p><p> “Left me to burn,” he muttered, “but</p><p>I’ll fool ’em yet.” </p><p> Then he sought to pull himself to his feet</p><p>against the wall. Half-way up his unin- </p><p>jured arm gave way, and he sank down. </p><p> “The kid did shoot,” he said weakly.</p><p>“I thought I had him busted.” </p><p> Both of Dugan’s wounds were bleeding</p><p>freely, and he could feel himself losing </p><p>strength. To reach the passage outside </p><p>and get through the smoke to the upper </p><p>deck, he must lose no time. With his unin- </p><p>jured hand, he bound a part of his blouse </p><p>around the arm, wadded the remainder </p><p>into a pack over his. body wound, and </p><p>started to crawl to the door. Twice on </p><p>the journey he stopped to rest, but kept </p><p>on doggedly. The smoke interfered with </p><p>his breathing, and the injured arm dragged </p><p>uselessly, making his progress difficult. </p><p>104 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Only by calling on the last reserve of his</p><p>great strength was he able to gain the door. </p><p>For a full minute he lay panting before it, </p><p>then inch by inch he raised himself, caught </p><p>the knob and turned it. The door did not </p><p>open. The latch was a foot higher up, </p><p>and Dugan, stupid with pain, sank to the </p><p>floor before he realized the trouble. </p><p> The door opened inboard. Once more</p><p>Dugan pulled himself up by the knob. </p><p>Then with infinitely greater effort, he </p><p>gained the additional foot to the latch, </p><p>even pulled it back, and sought to open the </p><p>door, but his inert body blocked him. </p><p>The door came open an inch and no more, </p><p>for one of Dugan’s knees, which he was </p><p>powerless to move, was in the way. A </p><p>blast of smoke and the stifling sting of </p><p>ammonia gas in his nostrils, sent him </p><p>reeling backward, and an awkward foot </p><p>slammed the door again. </p><p> Flat on the deck, Dugan realized that</p><p>he could not open the door, that he could </p><p>not raise himself to the knob again, and </p><p>unless more strength came to him, that he </p><p>could not even move. This was a new </p><p>feeling to Dugan. Always there had been </p><p>an abundance of strength to do with as he </p><p>wished, to override all oppositions, to </p><p>make others obey him, and now he was </p><p>suddenly shorn of it all and left to die </p><p>miserably by a man he had sworn to kill, </p><p>a woman whom he had taught to fear him, </p><p>and a boy whose courage he despised. </p><p>Rage and humiliation burned in his soul, </p><p>but as he lay helpless they cooled some- </p><p>what, and left only bitterness and a clearer </p><p>vision of his life. </p><p> Always he had been unhappy, and</p><p>always he had dominated and ruled bru- </p><p>tally. And now facing the end, he knew </p><p>why no one came to get him out, why little </p><p>Weber, driven into a corner, had fired, </p><p>why men loved Dick Reasoner, and fled </p><p>from him. Knew the whole volume of hate, </p><p>and that its answer in a crisis was failure. </p><p>Realized fully that love and hate are like </p><p>mysteries of the soul, and that the more </p><p>a man gives of each, the more he gets. </p><p> “It can’t be long now,” he groaned,</p><p>grimly looking up at the closed door.</p><p> The smell of the gas came to him a little</p><p>stronger, and he closed his eyes. They </p><p>stung with the increasing smoke, and it </p><p>eased the irritation, but the noise of the </p><p>fire became louder, and he had to open them. </p><p>As he did so, the door burst open, and </p><p>Bryan Weber came in with head bent and </p><p>nose in his wet neckkerchief. Dugan </p><p>thought his eyes were tricking him until the </p><p>boy began shaking him. </p><p> “Help’s coming,” he cried. “Talk to me,</p><p>Dugan. Are you alive? I came back as </p><p>soon as I could get help. I tried to put the </p><p>bullets in your shoulders.” </p><p> Dugan’s good arm pulled the boy down.</p><p>Weber leaped back, breaking the hold. </p><p> “Don’t be afraid,” whispered Dugan.</p><p>“I won’t hurt you. I’m pretty well messed </p><p>up. One of the shots went low.” </p><p>Reassured, Weber bent over him. </p><p> “The others are coming,” he repeated.</p><p>“I’m afraid I can’t carry you alone.” </p><p> They waited a little, and Weber tried to</p><p>adjust the blouse more tightly around </p><p>Dugan’s wounds. </p><p> “There’s not much time,” whispered</p><p>Dugan. “Can’t you hear the fire cornin’, </p><p>and there’s some kind of gas escapin’.” </p><p> “I might drag you,” offered Weber.</p><p>“The others may have missed the state- </p><p>room.” </p><p> “Missed on purpose,” said Dugan</p><p>harshly, “and at that you can’t blame ’em. </p><p>What made you come back?” he demanded, </p><p>with a return of his old imperiousness. </p><p> “I didn’t want to,” acknowledged Weber,</p><p>“but I shot you.” </p><p> Opening the door, Weber grasped Dugan</p><p>by the shoulders and lifted him up. Dugan </p><p>cried out with pain. </p><p> “Take mv feet,” he directed. “I can’t</p><p>stand it that way.” </p><p> Across the room and through the door-</p><p>way Weber toiled with the dead weight</p><p>of the heavy man. Outside the full force </p><p>of the smoke and gas struck them. Weber </p><p>could not longer protect his nose, for both </p><p>hands were necessary on Dugan’s legs to </p><p>make headway. After a few yards he went </p><p>to his knees, choking for breath. </p><p> “Leave me here and get out,” ordered</p><p>Dugan. “You can’t make it, kid.” </p><p> His voice came jerkily from between shut</p><p>teeth. The strain on his legs, and the </p><p>bumping over the deck were almost un- </p><p>bearable. </p><p> Weber took up his burden again. He had</p><p>heard Dugan, but would not give up. </p><p>Every few feet he stopped and then went </p><p>on, but the stops were longer and the feet </p><p>gained fewer. </p><p> “Quit, I tell you!” said Dugan at the</p><p>next stop. “You’ve done all you can, and </p><p>A Shift into Reverse </p><p>105 </p><p>there’s no use of both of us going. You </p><p>can make it without me.” </p><p> Weber’s answer was to take up Dugan’s</p><p>feet and stumble on. But this time he </p><p>moved barely a foot before he stopped, </p><p>went to his knees and from his knees to his </p><p>stomach. As he tried to struggle up again, </p><p>letting go of his burden, a strong hand </p><p>lifted him and shoved him down the </p><p>passage. It was Reasoner. </p><p> “I’ll bring Dugan,” he said. “Get on</p><p>out and take your place in the boat.” </p><p>Weber obeyed. What Dick Reasoner </p><p>promised, he would do. </p><p> When the men sent with Weber reported</p><p>that the smoke had driven them out, and </p><p>that Weber had gone on alone, Reasoner </p><p>guessed what had happened, for he knew </p><p>that the men of the second did not intend </p><p>to risk much to save Dugan, and that in the </p><p>smoke it would be difficult to find stateroom </p><p>twelve. So he went to the rescue himself, </p><p>and thought he was lucky when he found </p><p>Weber and Dugan in the passage. As </p><p>Weber went on at his orders, he picked up </p><p>the heavy man in the approved first-aid </p><p>manner, and bore him to comparative </p><p>safety on deck. The officers of the Senator </p><p>were rounding up the last members of the </p><p>fire-fighters, and getting them into the </p><p>boats. All felt that it was barely a ques- </p><p>tion of minutes till the magazines blew up, </p><p>and that hurry was necessary. </p><p> “See if your men are all out,” directed</p><p>the first officer. “We are abandoning.” </p><p> A sailor helped Reasoner down the gang-</p><p>way with his burden, where he turned </p><p>Dugan over to the hospital steward, and </p><p>mustered his crew. The four who had failed </p><p>to follow Weber kept their eyes in the boat, </p><p>and Reasoner did not speak to them. He </p><p>felt that when the whole story of Weber’s </p><p>heroism came out, they would be punished </p><p>enough. </p><p> With temporary bandages in place,</p><p>Dugan lay in the stern-sheets of the boat. </p><p>Reasoner had the tiller, and Weber, too </p><p>weak to pull an oar, sat aft also. For half </p><p>the trip over, Dugan was silent, then he</p><p>spoke to Weber. </p><p> “Kid, I’ve been all wrong about you.</p><p>The rest of this second division is a bum </p><p>lot, but you’re a little man. Don’t be </p><p>worryin’ about these punctures. Pills’ </p><p>striker tells me that I’ll make it O. K.” </p><p>Then he turned his eyes to Reasoner. </p><p>“Dictionary Dick,” he said, smiling </p><p>wanly, “I’ve made a lot of fun of you and </p><p>your queer notions, but you’ve called the </p><p>turn ever}' time, and I’ll have to hand it to </p><p>you. Your system has mine skinned a </p><p>Dutch knot. Now I’m goin’ to save your </p><p>old bean a lot of worry. As soon as I </p><p>spill this little yarn to the captain I’m </p><p>askin’ for transfer. This second division </p><p>wouldn’t ever forget, and sometimes when </p><p>a man’s in a pinch, he needs friends. On </p><p>another ship I’ll start different and see-” </p><p> “I wouldn’t talk so much, Dugan,”</p><p>interrupted the hospital steward, “it might </p><p>start the bleeding again.” </p><p> Dugan glared at him.</p><p> “Shut up yourself,” he said, with a flare</p><p>of his old temper. “I stop when I’m </p><p>through.” Then in a moment he asked </p><p>humbly enough, “Could I speak one more </p><p>word to Weber?” </p><p> The steward nodded, and Weber bent</p><p>over to hear the low-spoken words. </p><p> “Tell Alice for me that she can go on</p><p>and live her life in peace, and that I’ll live </p><p>mine.” </p><p> Then the injured man settled back, and</p><p>neither Reasoner nor Weber heard his </p><p>muttered comment- as they went alongside </p><p>the Dixie, and a dull roar behind them </p><p>heralded the last of the Senator. </p><p> “Gone!” he said. “That’s what almost</p><p>happened to me, only I’ve been given </p><p>another chance.” </p><p>THE Dixie steamed at full speed </p><p>for the nearest port, where the </p><p>passengers from the Senator and </p><p>the wounded were landed. Slim Higgins </p><p>and Reasoner were at the rail as the boat </p><p>shoved off with Dugan aboard.</p><p> “Well, Dick,” said Slim, “what’s the</p><p>good word?” </p><p> “Reverse,” answered Reasoner. “I’ve</p><p>looked it up carefully, and it means to </p><p>turn backward; to change entirely.” </p><p>“Reverse,” repeated Slim. “I follow </p><p>you, old worm. To shift gears. Well, my </p><p>fond hope is that Dugan’s clutch don’t </p><p>slip, and that he can keep right on backin’ </p><p>up to ‘reverie’ and ‘reverence.’ He needs </p><p>’em both.” </p><p> Slim turned away to keep his face</p><p>straight, and Reasoner looked at him with </p><p>a puzzled frown, for how could Reasoner </p><p>know that Slim had raided his sea-chest </p><p>and found the little cross-marks by the </p><p>words in the well-thumbed dictionary? </p><p>Author of “The Magic Arrow” “Yancey of the Rangers,” etc. </p><p>HE CLOSE of the Revolutionary </p><p>War found many venturesome </p><p>spirits unwilling to return to the </p><p>humdrum of farm and mercantile </p><p>•life. Early in 1800 adventurers exploring </p><p>the Southwest learned that Mexicans in </p><p>Santa Fe were eager to pay two and three </p><p>dollars a yard for cheap cotton cloths. </p><p>When this information had filtered back </p><p>East thrifty New Englanders, restless </p><p>Southerners and bold frontiersmen were </p><p>quick to try their luck as merchants. The </p><p>enormous profits taken by those who eluded </p><p>the wild-riding Comanche, fierce Apache, </p><p>blood-thirsty Kiowa, and numerous other </p><p>plains tribes resulted in the introduction </p><p>of Pittsburgh-made wagons to the old Santa </p><p>Fe Trail in 1824. </p><p> Some three centuries before this Coro-</p><p>nado, Cabeca de Vaca, and the survivors </p><p>of the ill-fated De Soto expedition had </p><p>tramped the Indian highway in rusty mail, </p><p>lured on by legends of golden cities. Al- </p><p>though conquistador gave way for Ameri- </p><p>can merchants the bait remained the same, </p><p>Mexican silver being substituted for gold. </p><p>Trapper, trader, missionary, hunter, soldier </p><p>and colonist, in the order named, began </p><p>fulfilling the destiny of the new continent </p><p>by blazing the way for steam-propelled </p><p>commerce. </p><p> The first wagons, “prairie schooners,”</p><p>had a capacity of a ton and a half, each </p><p>being drawn by eight mules or as many </p><p>oxen. They were a marvelous improvement </p><p>over the old pack-mule trains and quickened </p><p>trade to an amazing degree. They were </p><p>soon doubled in capacity and required ten </p><p>or twelve mules or oxen to haul them. And </p><p>as the vehicles increased in size and num- </p><p>bers so did the Indians increase the ferocity </p><p>of their opposition, till the trail was fringed </p><p>with raw scalps. The red man’s lust for </p><p>plunder was succeeded by the conviction </p><p>the influx of traders meant an end to the </p><p>buffalo. </p><p> The Old Trail was loyal to the red man.</p><p>From Missouri up the Arkansas and beyond </p><p>the Great Bend as far as the Cimarron </p><p>Crossing it was a broad and obvious route, </p><p>easily followed by the unsophisticated so </p><p>far as any topographical disadvantages </p><p>were concerned. In the mad rush for Mexi-</p><p>can silver many amateurs at the frontier </p><p>game accepted the first half of the trail </p><p>as an earnest for the whole, and set forth </p><p>without, proper guides. </p><p> Once the Cimarron Crossing was reached,</p><p>however, the dusty ribbon of travel van- </p><p>ished and in its place were innumerable </p><p>buffalo trails radiating in all directions </p><p>from the river. Ordinarily the tenderfeet </p><p>and greenhorns sought to push on, and thus </p><p>the trail frequently became a trap, with red </p><p>Red Toll </p><p>107 </p><p>toll accumulating in many savage tepees. </p><p>Nor were ignorant Easterners the only </p><p>victims. </p><p> It is recorded that veteran trappers from</p><p>the Rocky Mountains, egotistical in having </p><p>surmounted the obstacles of the upper </p><p>Platte and Yellowstone, laughed at the </p><p>suggestion of danger and voted the monot* </p><p>onous plains country a child’s playground. </p><p>Often such men became lost beyond the </p><p>sparkling Crossing. </p><p>WHEN “Silent” Leroux drifted </p><p>into Fort Larned to secure a job as </p><p>posthunter he made a favorable </p><p>impression by the respect he paid, the </p><p>trail. </p><p> Famed for years of travel through the in-</p><p>accessible portions of the West he was one </p><p>of a few of a vanished race who did not </p><p>treat the trail contemptuously. He studied </p><p>it from all angles and never was deceived </p><p>by superficial appearances. </p><p> It might have been a strange, fierce</p><p>animal found alive in one of his traps from </p><p>his cautious manner of approaching its </p><p>various phases. </p><p> From 110-Mile Creek to Pawnee Rock,</p><p>to the Cimarron Crossing, and thence to </p><p>the Purgatory River country and Bent’s </p><p>Fort, he examined it in detail. By patience </p><p>and wariness he learned the trap before it </p><p>could close upon him. </p><p> He was typically American, although the</p><p>veneer of civilization was long since sloughed </p><p>off. He used to declare that he “thought </p><p>in Injun.” His nickname resulted from </p><p>no inherent trait of taciturnity. When </p><p>young and callow he was one of the first </p><p>white men to penetrate the wonders of the </p><p>Yellowstone region. He was loquacious </p><p>enough in those days and zestfully in- </p><p>formed a trappers’ camp and hunters’ </p><p>bivouac about the mud volcanoes, steaming </p><p>geysers, boiling springs and petrified </p><p>forests. </p><p> It naturally followed he was ridiculed</p><p>unmercifully. As he was not enough of a </p><p>philosopher to ignore such treatment and</p><p>wait contentedly for Time to substantiate </p><p>his stories he changed into an exceed- </p><p>ingly close-mouthed man; hence his so- </p><p>briquet. </p><p> As a hunter he was worthy to precede</p><p>Kit Carson, prince of frontiersmen, whom </p><p>Fate already was grooming to tread these </p><p>same scenes. </p><p> The post commander early observed that</p><p>in addition to supplying sufficient meat </p><p>for the fort and passing trains he never </p><p>came in from the hunt without some </p><p>laconic, correct report as to the move- </p><p>ments of the various tribes. His value as </p><p>a scout soon overshadowed his work as a </p><p>hunter. </p><p> When “Texas” Charlie, chief of scouts,</p><p>leaped from his exhausted pony and re- </p><p>ported the finding of a brother scout killed </p><p>at Ash Creek the commander sent for </p><p>Leroux. </p><p> As the old man slouched in the com-</p><p>mander hurriedly began: </p><p> “Texas Charlie just arrived with bad</p><p>news, Silent. Two Birds, one of our Crow </p><p>scouts, has been wiped out on Ash Creek. </p><p>Those-Kiowa you reported as moving </p><p>north of the Republican Fork to hunt </p><p>buffalo on the Platte swung back.” </p><p> It was customary to blame the Kiowa</p><p>on general principles, as they were the most </p><p>bloodthirsty and cruel of all the plains </p><p>Indians. In proportion to their numbers </p><p>they probably killed more whites than any </p><p>other one tribe. </p><p> Silent thoughtfully twisted his wisp of</p><p>gray beard and frowned. </p><p> “Th’ Kiowy was movin’ north o’ th’</p><p>Republican Fork,” he slowly insisted. </p><p>“They’ve patched up a peace with th’ </p><p>Pawnee. Goin’ to hunt together, them </p><p>two. I reckon I know what I know. If </p><p>they done f’r Two Birds it’s th’ work </p><p>of a few young bucks keen to git their </p><p>feathers.” </p><p> “Kiowas did it,” declared the com-</p><p>mander, pulling something from his pocket.</p><p>“Of course you couldn’t know they would </p><p>swing back after crossing the Fork. But </p><p>swing back they did.” </p><p> “-it! Don’t I know Injuns?” broke</p><p>in Silent, with the independent scout’s </p><p>disregard for rank. “Reckon I knowed </p><p>Injuns afore ye was born. I say it could be </p><p>th’ work of only a handful o’ young braves. </p><p>It wouldn’t take th’ whole Kiowy nation to </p><p>wipe out a Crow scout.” </p><p> The commander heard him patiently, and</p><p>quietly replied— </p><p> “This tells the whole story.”</p><p> He handed over a fragment of deerskin,</p><p>cut from a hunting shirt. It contained a </p><p>picture-writing done in black. </p><p> “Texas found it near where Two Birds</p><p>was killed,” added the commander. </p><p>io8 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Silent stared incredulously at the picture</p><p> message and beheld:</p><p> The old hunter was an expert in the sign-</p><p>language of the plains, an indispensable aid </p><p>to interpreting the drawings made by In- </p><p>dians to convey a message. There was no at- </p><p>tempt at artistic skill in the picture; simply </p><p>an effort to announce a fact. It was as </p><p>readily comprehensible to him as though </p><p>he had been an eye-witness of the tragedy. </p><p> “Two Birds surprised at th’ crick an’</p><p>didn’t have time to run for it,” Silent read </p><p>aloud. “Th’ up ’n’ down line is th’ bank </p><p>behind which he hid. Keeps low an’ </p><p>sees a big number o’ Kiowy comirr’. They </p><p>don’t know he’s there yet. There was a </p><p>whalin’ big bunch of ’em, as showed by th’ </p><p>hoof-tracks. He don’t know whether he’ll </p><p>git clear or be wiped out. So he makes this </p><p>report hopin’ ye’ll git it and larn th’ Kiowy </p><p>is on th’ war-path in big numbers. </p><p> “Th’ two birds over his head ’dentifies</p><p>him; but to make sure he stripes off his </p><p>ha’r to show th’ Crow custom o’ usin’ red- </p><p>clay. To leave no doubt ’bout they bein’ </p><p>Kiowy he makes th’ reg’lar picter f’r that </p><p>tribe—a man wavin’ both hands foolish- </p><p>like.” </p><p> And he mechanically gave the sign-</p><p>language designation of the Kiowa by </p><p>raising his right hand level with his head </p><p>and revolving it, to signify “rattle brained,” </p><p>or “crazy.” Thus the gesture would be </p><p>interpreted by every plains Indian from </p><p>Mexico to Canada. </p><p> “The poor devil made it all plain enough,”</p><p>said the commander. “I want you and </p><p>Texas to follow and learn their direction.” </p><p> Silent grunted wrathfully and com-</p><p>plained : </p><p> “I snum! that gits me. There ain’t</p><p>no doubt but what there was a big band </p><p>of ’em; an’ yet I was sure they was off </p><p>f’r a buf’ler hunt. Yep; th’ whole dad </p><p>b’ilin’ of ’em must have swung back.” </p><p> “A blind man could see that,” tersely</p><p>remarked the commander. “After Texas</p><p>has had a sleep you two must locate the </p><p>band. They must be taught a lesson. </p><p>Too many of our scouts are being wiped </p><p>out. The men are beginning to get ner- </p><p>vous.” </p><p> “Th’ Crow makes six inside a month,”</p><p>mused Silent. “There was Cayuse at th’ </p><p>Cimarron, Big an’ Little Rusty at Pawnee </p><p>Forks near where this happened, th’ breed </p><p>at th’ Walnut, an’ Little Irish at th’ Rock </p><p>(Pawnee).” </p><p> “Lean Wolf is behind it,” fumed the</p><p>commander. “He’s made his brags he’ll </p><p>wipe out all our scouts. I’ll give two </p><p>hundred dollars for his scalp—if he has to be </p><p>taken dead.” </p><p> “I opine that’s th’ way he’d have to be</p><p>took,” muttered the old hunter, his faded </p><p>gray eyes twinkling. “Leastways some one </p><p>in his neighborhood would have to lose a </p><p>scalp if I ever met up with him. I’ll be </p><p>ready when Texas is.” </p><p> “He stayed long enough to bury Two</p><p>Birds; then rode without a break here. </p><p>It’s his nerves more than anything. He </p><p>thinks every scout is being dogged. But as </p><p>soonashecan sit a saddle he’ll go with you.” </p><p>Silent returned to studying the picture. </p><p>Finally he asked: </p><p> “Why two of us? We’d cover more</p><p>ground by splittin’ up.” </p><p> The commander laughed harshly, saying:</p><p>“You haven’t any Indian in your blood. </p><p>Texas’ grandmother was a Cheyenne. His </p><p>father was a white trader at Bent’s. He’s </p><p>superstitious. Says he won’t take a trail </p><p>alone again till after Lean Wolf has been </p><p>killed. </p><p> “Wal, Texas don’t show his Injun blood</p><p>any, an’ a man don’t have to be a breed to </p><p>feel that a-way,” drawled Silent. “Reckon </p><p>I’ll feel better f’r havin’ a good man by my </p><p>side. It’ll git on my nerves if any more </p><p>of us is killed. I’ll be ridin’ out a bit.. Be </p><p>back time Charlie’s fit to climb a saddle.” </p><p>THE post commander was in a rare </p><p>rage when the old hunter rode in </p><p>after an absence of nearly two days. </p><p>But the high scout mortality forced him</p><p>to swallow his wrath. He greeted: </p><p> “Now that you’ve finally returned I</p><p>suppose you will have to take a rest. First </p><p>one man, then another.” </p><p> “Oh, I’m all hunky,” mildly assured</p><p>Silent. “Thought I’d scared up some new </p><p>signs, but they sort o’ petered out. I’m </p><p>fit’s a fiddle. Where’s Texas?” </p><p> “Inside, trying to drown his blue devils</p><p> with whisky,” growled the commander.</p><p> “You’ve stayed away too long to follow</p><p> up the Ash Creek trail. Tried to get Texas</p><p> to go out alone yesterday, but he refused.</p><p> Now, new work has turned up. A big</p><p> train is due to arrive at the Cimarron</p><p> Crossing any day. You two must get there</p><p> and give warning that the Kiowa are out in</p><p> force.”</p><p> “If some one else can go I reckon Texas</p><p> an’ me can still pick up th’ Ash Creek trail,”</p><p> penitently replied Silent.</p><p> “There’s no one else to go—all the rest</p><p> are out. The train must be warned. Be-</p><p> sides, the band that killed Two Birds is</p><p> probably down the trail by this time, laying</p><p> for the train.”</p><p> “We’ll warn ’em, all right,” assured</p><p> Silent. “I’ll take a snack with Texas, then</p><p> we’ll make th’ Cimarron hell-flukin’.”</p><p> He found Texas Charlie seated at a rough</p><p> table in the mess-room with a plate of</p><p> untouched venison before him and the bottle</p><p>*	half empty. It was obvious the scout’s</p><p> nerves were demoralized. Silent saluted</p><p> him with a cheerful grin and poured himself</p><p> a drink. Texas, slim and wiry and showing</p><p> no trace of his Cheyenne blood except in his</p><p> small black eyes, returned the amiable'</p><p> glance with a scowl and reached for the</p><p> bottle. A breed brought in a platter of</p><p> meat which the hunter attacked hungrily.</p><p> As Silent made no offer to talk Texas</p><p> finally demanded—•</p><p> “Scouting?”</p><p> “Yep; didn’t find nothin’. Reckon Lean</p><p> Wolf an’ his braves is pretty far north by</p><p> this time.”</p><p> “And I reckon you’re very much mis-</p><p> taken,” sullenly retorted Texas. “I feel</p><p> it in my bones he’s near, ready to strike.</p><p> I’ll be number seven.” The last with a</p><p> faint shudder and a lunge for the bottle.</p><p> “Dod rot it!” angrily exclaimed Silent.</p><p> “Can’t I read signs? Don’t I know a thing</p><p> or two ’bout this game? Think ye know</p><p> it all jest ’cause ye can talk book English?</p><p> I tell ye Lean Wolf’s off to hunt with th’</p><p> Pawnee. He sent ’em a peace talk an’ a</p><p> pipe more’n a month ago. I know that.”</p><p> “I’m not casting any reflections on your</p><p> knowledge,” stiffly replied Texas. “But</p><p> Lean Wolf’s band wiped out Two Birds,</p><p> the sixth of our scouts since the sending</p><p> of the calumet to the Pawnee. The hunting</p><p> trip to the Platte is a ruse; or as you say,</p><p> ‘all in your eye.’ ”</p><p> “Hold on a minute!” gasped ^Silent,</p><p>suspending his eating to gaze in admiration </p><p>at the slim and dapper figure. “Jest </p><p>lem’me corral some o’ that language. Is it </p><p>halter-broke?” </p><p> Flashing his white teeth in a shadow of a</p><p>smile, Texas apologized: </p><p> “I can’t help it. I was educated in the</p><p>best schools in St. Louis from the age of </p><p>eight to twenty-one.” </p><p> “I swow! Ye didn’t hear much Injun in</p><p>St. Looey,” remarked Silent. </p><p> Texas’ face took on a deeper bronze.</p><p>He never spoke of his ancestry. </p><p> “I was bred to speak only English,” he</p><p>curtly replied. “If I’d gone East instead </p><p>of returning to this cursed country—and </p><p>yet I wouldn’t have fitted in there. Well, </p><p>I’m here—the bottle’s here. We’ll drink </p><p>to the trail.” </p><p> “Don’t ye git touchy, Texas, at what an</p><p>ol’ man says. Reckon I talk lots o’ foolish- </p><p>ness every time I open my yap. Jest keep </p><p>on spillin’ good English. I hanker to hear </p><p>it. Makes me think how I mighter larned </p><p>to talk it if I’d stayed where I belonged </p><p>in place o’ chasin’ out here to larn th’ </p><p>sign-language of a parcel o’ red beggars.” </p><p>“Not very complimentary to the noble </p><p>Indian,” observed Texas with a bitter </p><p>laugh. “Six in a month! Looks as though </p><p>the cards were stacked against us. And a </p><p>wagon train is due at Cimarron Crossing </p><p>and we must ride to give it warning—bah! </p><p>There’s no bite to this post whisky. My </p><p>nerves still feel all unraveled.” Rising, he </p><p>pushed back the bottle in disgust. “I’ll be </p><p>in the corral.” </p><p> Silent bolted his food and soon followed</p><p>his brother scout to the horse-corral. Texas </p><p>was ready to mount. The old man flung </p><p>his saddle and blanket roll on a vicious pony</p><p>and the two rode out on the trail. </p><p> “After giving the word, scout back on</p><p>both sides of the river and look for fresh </p><p>signs,” the commander called after them. </p><p> The men nodded and cantered away, a</p><p>strange contrast in types. Texas was </p><p>immaculate in fresh buckskin. His glossy </p><p>black hair, worn long, was carefully groomed </p><p>and accented the suggestion of dandyism. </p><p>His weapons were inlaid with silver, after </p><p>the Mexican fashion, and were the last word </p><p>in efficiency. </p><p> The old hunter was shaggy and di-</p><p>sheveled, roughly clothed, indifferently </p><p>armed, and grotesquely mounted. The ax </p><p>no </p><p>Adventure </p><p>in his belt gave a touch of the primitive. </p><p>A stranger to his history would never have </p><p>picked him as being the one of the two who </p><p>came from the East. </p><p> “About as much alike as an apple and a</p><p>cactus,” commented the commander as he </p><p>watched them disappear down the trail. </p><p>“Contradictions at every point; and yet </p><p>the two best men I’ve got.” </p><p>H SILENT was inclined to conversa- </p><p>tion as he and his companion neared </p><p>the Caches without having discov- </p><p>ered any new signs. Texas, too, seemed to </p><p>have discarded his nervous mood and spoke </p><p>frankly of his life in St. Louis. </p><p> “Even now I can’t make it seem real,”</p><p>he morosely declared as they slowed down </p><p>at the Caches. “I spent nearly all my life </p><p>there, and yet it seems as though it was a </p><p>dream, that I had never quit the trail.” </p><p>“Injun talk come natural to ye?” timidly </p><p>asked Silent. </p><p> “I absorbed it,” sighed Texas. “I speak</p><p>English according to the book, but I always </p><p>feel as though I was repeating something </p><p>I had memorized.” </p><p> “By jing! Reckon no one could talk it</p><p>so O. K. ’less he done a mighty big heap o’ </p><p>mem’rizin’,” admiringly cried the hunter. </p><p>“Reckon I’m too old to larn it as she </p><p>should be spoke.” </p><p> “It was my father’s orders that I should</p><p>have it hammered into me—it was.” </p><p> “Wal, I wish my father'd fixed it so it</p><p>could ’a’ been hammered—hi! I count a </p><p>coup!” And leaping from his pony Silent </p><p>held aloft a small deerskin pouch. </p><p>“Medicine bag?” curiously queried Texas. </p><p>Silent took out several fragments of black </p><p>micaceous iron and made soft black marks </p><p>on the back of his wrinkled hand, and </p><p>corrected: </p><p> “War paint. Paint-bag.”</p><p> “If a Kiowa dropped it, it proves the</p><p>hunting trip to the Platte was merely</p><p>a cover for a raid along the trail,” Texas </p><p>forcefully declared. </p><p> “Bead work says Kiowy,” slowly ad-</p><p>mitted the hunter after studying the pouch </p><p>closely. “Represents Sci-Manzi, th’ ‘Mes- </p><p>cal Woman.’ I’ve seen it on th’ sacred </p><p>gourd rattles used in th’ mescal ceremony; </p><p>but never on a paint-bag afore.” </p><p> “Wish I were as well versed in reading</p><p>their picture-writing as you are,” said </p><p>Texas. </p><p> “An’ I wish I could swap what I know</p><p>f’r yer knack o’ tossin’ th’ English lingo </p><p>’round. Funny world. Camp here or push </p><p>on to th’ Crossing?” </p><p> “Neither,” was the prompt reply. “I’ll</p><p>ride a half circle on this side of the river </p><p>while you do the same on the other side. </p><p>We’ll meet five miles below here at the big </p><p>patch of sage-brush. We ought to hit the </p><p>trail of the war party that lost that pouch.” </p><p>“Good talk,” grunted Silent. “I knew </p><p>yer nerve would come back once ye hit </p><p>th’ trail. S’long.” And wheeling his pony </p><p>he dashed through the shallow ford and sped </p><p>away in a wide detour. </p><p> Although it lacked two hours of sunset</p><p>and he had no need for haste he used the </p><p>quirt liberally and maintained a sharp pace. </p><p>Traveling rapidly he passed the rendezvous </p><p>of sage-brush and galloped a mile before </p><p>turning back to the river. Then instead </p><p>of riding back to the brush he crossed the </p><p>stream and continued due north. Two </p><p>more miles were covered in this direction; </p><p>then he dismounted, and, leading his pony, </p><p>turned his back to the setting sun and </p><p>proceeded slowly, his head bowed low, his </p><p>eyes searching the ground. </p><p> Descending a low ridge covered with</p><p>a coarse scrub grass he halted and dropped </p><p>on his hands and knees. The light was </p><p>failing and in the hollow it was difficult to </p><p>pick up signs. Lowering his head like a </p><p>hound he cautiously crawled about, his </p><p>pony keeping at his heels. At last he </p><p>grunted contentedly and rapidly described </p><p>a circle. When he had finished he sprang </p><p>to his feet, displaying an agility not to be </p><p>expected of his years, and vaulted into the </p><p>saddle. This time he raced southwest, </p><p>heading for the Crossing.</p><p> The pony responded to the demands of his</p><p>master as though his very ugliness were </p><p>converted into fresh speed and endurance. </p><p>It lacked an hour of midnight when the </p><p>hunter splashed into the Crossing and as- </p><p>cended the opposite bank. </p><p> Near the river glowed smoldering camp-</p><p>fires. His noisy crossing had attracted </p><p>attention, and as he became a silhouette </p><p>against the sky-line a sharp voice called out: </p><p>“Red or white? Quick, or I’ll fire.” </p><p>“Gov’ment scout from Fort Lamed in a </p><p>hell-of-a-hustle,” bawled back the hunter. </p><p>“What train’s this?” </p><p> “Colonel Vrain’s. Who are you? Ad-</p><p>vance, or I’ll fire.” </p><p>£ </p><p>Red Toll </p><p>hi </p><p> Silent could hear men crawling from</p><p>beneath the prairie schooners, their rifles </p><p>rattling against the wheels. But he had </p><p>no time to waste in visiting. </p><p> “I’m the Gov’ment scout from Lamed,”</p><p>he repeated. “I’ve a long ride afore me. </p><p>I’m sent to warn ye that ye’ll be jumped </p><p>by a small band o’ Kiowy at sunrise. </p><p>There’s ’bout thirty of ’em. Corral yer </p><p>wagons an’ double yer guard. How many </p><p>rifles have ye?” </p><p> “ ’Nough to handle any thirty reds,”</p><p>was the suspicious reply. “Just ride for- </p><p>ward, or I’ll plug ye.” </p><p> “Ye’ll be jumped at sunrise, or a leetle</p><p>before. Make yer own medicine.” </p><p> With that he turned and dashed into the</p><p>stream and rode like mad along the south </p><p>side of the Arkansas. </p><p>THE east was beginning to redden </p><p>when he leaped from his blown pony </p><p>at the cover of sage-brush. Texas </p><p>quickly emerged, crying: </p><p> “Where have you been? I thought</p><p>they’d got you.” </p><p> “Struck signs of a war-party an’ rode on</p><p>to th’ Crossin’ to warn th’ train. It’s </p><p>Colonel Vrain’s outfit,” wearily replied </p><p>Silent as he turned his pony loose and </p><p>entered the brush. </p><p> “Of all the fool moves!” gritted Texas.</p><p>“Why didn’t you come back here to meet </p><p>me? Then both of us could have gone </p><p>and stayed to help the train if it came to a </p><p>fight.” </p><p> “Reckon I got nervous. Then ag’in, it</p><p>was some ride from here. Didn’t even </p><p>know as I’d find ye here. Thought ye </p><p>might ’a’ struck th’ same signs an’ foller’d </p><p>’em up.” </p><p> “I’ve sweat blood waiting here alone,”</p><p>growled Texas. “Believed you’d been </p><p>wiped out. Then decided it would be my </p><p>turn before morning.” </p><p> “Wal, it’s done an’ th’ train’s warned.</p><p>I didn’t go very near as I was keen to git </p><p>back. Feller offered to shoot me f’r my </p><p>pains—cussed tenderfeet let loose to raise </p><p>Cain on th’ trail!” </p><p> Texas remained standing, nervously</p><p>twisting his black mustache, his eyes </p><p>turned toward the Crossing. Silent </p><p>dropped to the ground with a grunt of </p><p>content and examined his long rifle. </p><p> “You need sleep. I’ll stand guard,”</p><p>snapped Texas over his shoulder. </p><p> “No more’n ye do,” reminded Silent.</p><p>“Ye’ve been awake all night a-worryin’. </p><p>Lawdy! Wish I knowed English like what </p><p>ye do. I’d quit this life an’ go back to </p><p>th’ States an’ be a gen’l’man.” </p><p> Texas laughed harshly.</p><p> “You’d need something besides book</p><p>English to be accepted as a gentleman,” </p><p>he bitterly informed. “You’d need money, </p><p>lots of it. You’d be a gentleman as long </p><p>as it lasted. It wouldn’t make any differ- </p><p>ence how you got it so long as you had it— </p><p>there are no poor gentlemen.” </p><p> “Shucks! Ye don’t say! Did ye ever</p><p>try it out, Texas?” </p><p> Still facing the west the scout monot-</p><p>onously replied: </p><p> “So long as my father lived I had plenty</p><p>of money. I was invited to places, made </p><p>much of. Rich trader’s son. When he </p><p>died the money stopped. Very few invi- </p><p>tations. Then again-” </p><p> “Yep; then ag’in—’’softly prompted</p><p>Silent. </p><p> “It was noised about I was neither white</p><p>nor red—I had no folks!” gritted the scout. </p><p> “What odds could that make?” puzzled</p><p>Silent. </p><p> “What odds? Why, you doddering—I</p><p>forgot. You’ve been lost out here all your </p><p>life. The plains are kinder than the East </p><p>in that respect. It makes this difference, </p><p>old man. If you wish to marry, people </p><p>suddenly get very curious about your</p><p>history and insist on knowing all about </p><p>your parents—I learned my lesson once. </p><p>And I came out here.” </p><p> “Ye know th’ East better’n I do,” wist-</p><p>fully admitted Silent. “An’ come to think </p><p>of it I reckon I couldn’t stand bein’ shet </p><p>up in a wooden house. Still there’s times </p><p>when I git mighty sick o’ buf’ler an’ Injuns </p><p>—meanin’ fightin’ Injuns. So ye jumped </p><p>back to th’ trail an’ went right to scoutin’ </p><p>eh?” </p><p> “I’ve been a Government scout for some</p><p>time. Big train?” </p><p> “Not very—all tenderfeet.”</p><p> “Then if you can’t sleep we’ll ride to the</p><p>Crossing. Our guns will be neede^l.” </p><p>And the scout whistled shrilly to his pohy. </p><p> “Be ye crazy?” protested Silent. “My</p><p>cayuse is dead beat. Ain’t they got their </p><p>warnin’? It’s up to them—an’ we never </p><p>could make it in time. Th’ sun’s due in </p><p>a few minutes. We’d only run into th’ </p><p>Injuns an’ be scalped.” </p><p>112 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Texas hesitated, complaining—</p><p> “But to remain here when our help is</p><p>needed-” </p><p> “Hark!” broke in Silent, lifting his hand.</p><p>“Hear that? Guns, by th’ Etarnal!” </p><p>“They’ve jumped it already!” hoarsely </p><p>cried the scout, striding bade and forth in </p><p>much agitation. </p><p> A splutter of rifle fire, coming faintly</p><p>down the river, indicated the beginning of </p><p>a battle. Silent’s face twisted with anxiety. </p><p>The rifle fire was a code he could skilfully </p><p>interpret. The scattered shots evidenced </p><p>a surprise attack successfully carried out. </p><p>The same thought was in Texas’ mind, </p><p>for he muttered— </p><p> “No backbone in that shooting.”</p><p>“Hooray!” yelled the hunter, drawing </p><p>his ax and brandishing it exultingly. </p><p>“But there’s backbone in that.” This as </p><p>the rifle fire suddenly increased in volume </p><p>and became marked with well-defined </p><p>regularity. “That ain’t no Injun shootin’. </p><p>Th’ red devils thought they’d worked a </p><p>game an’ they’re hooked! Hear ’em! </p><p>I must ’a’ been mistook ’bout their bein’ </p><p>tenderfeet. There’s some ol’ hands in </p><p>that train—firin’ in squads, so’s not to </p><p>unload all their guns at th’ same time.” </p><p>“Our help may be needed! Come along,” </p><p>cried the scout, making for his pony. </p><p> Silent held him back by clutching his</p><p>fringed sleeve. </p><p> “Be ye crazy?” he demanded. “It’ll be</p><p>all over afore we can make it. My pony’s </p><p>winded. Th’ train’s either beat ’em off an’ </p><p>will be rollin’ along here in a few hours, or </p><p>else it’s wiped out. No matter who’s </p><p>won we’d be sure to run into th’ Injuns </p><p>an’ lose our ha’r.” </p><p> The logic of this could not be gainsaid.</p><p>Texas returned to the little opening in </p><p>the heart of the brush, mumbling: </p><p> “It sounds cold-blooded, but it’s common</p><p>sense. It will be finished before we can</p><p>make it. The fire seems to be dropping.” </p><p>Both pricked their ears. Only occa- </p><p>sional shots were being fired. Either the </p><p>Indians were retreating or finishing off the </p><p>wounded. Silent’s withered face became </p><p>distorted with fear. Then all doubt was re- </p><p>moved when there came a staccato volley. </p><p>Waving his ax the old hunter yelled: </p><p> “That tells th’ whole story! Th’ -</p><p>beggars got a bellyful an’ are runnin’ away.' </p><p>They’re beat so bad th’ train ain’t skeered to </p><p>let off all their guns at once!” </p><p> “They’re whipped,” assented Texas,</p><p>dropping to the ground. “But we ought </p><p>to have made a try for it. Go to sleeps </p><p>I’ll watch till the train comes up.” </p><p> Silent stretched his arms in a yawn and</p><p>rose and procured his blanket roll, sur- </p><p>rendering— </p><p> “Reckon I will snooze a bit now th’</p><p>’citement’s over. Feel sort o’ peaked.” </p><p>Reseating himself he fumbled with a thong </p><p>of rawhide tied ’round his blanket, then </p><p>paused to remark, “Say, Texas, d’ye know </p><p>that picter-writin’ ye found up Ash Crick </p><p>way worried me a heap? Made me think </p><p>I was jest a dad blamed ol’ fool.” </p><p> Texas jerked up his head in surprise and</p><p>demanded— </p><p> “How so?”</p><p> “Wal, it showed Two Birds had plenty</p><p>o’ time to make his writin’ afore th’ Injuns </p><p>jumped him. He made it so’s to give th’ </p><p>fort warnin’ ’bout th’ Kiowy if he should </p><p>be wiped out.” </p><p> “Of course.”</p><p> “But if he had time to do that why’n</p><p>sin didn’t he make a run f’r it?” </p><p> “He was on the east side of the creek.</p><p>They were between him and the fort. </p><p>Probably his pony was winded.” </p><p> “That’s prob’ly it,” drowsily agreed</p><p>Silent, unfastening the second thong and </p><p>removing his belt and placing his ax upon </p><p>it. “He must ’a’ been a mighty smart Injun. </p><p>Smarter’n I’d reckoned on. It ain’t in</p><p>Injun natur’ to figger things out that way. </p><p>It would ’a’ been more natural if he’d give </p><p>a war-whoop once he saw he was cornered, </p><p>start singin’ his death-song an’ pitch into </p><p>them. But he took time to make a writin’ </p><p>like a white man would do who knew he </p><p>was done f’r an’ wanted to send a last word </p><p>to th’ world. I kicked him once f’r stealin’ </p><p>my whisky—wish I hadn’t. He wa’n’t no </p><p>artist, but he was strong f’r gittin’ in th’ </p><p>facts.” </p><p> “Indian picture-writing shows no knowl-</p><p>edge of perspective. Proportion is never </p><p>considered,” impatiently reminded Texas. </p><p>“Better turn in, or the train will be here </p><p>before you can get any rest.” </p><p> “I’m goin’ to—I’m dead tired. Pro-</p><p>portion? Wal, I reckon not. Say, d’ye </p><p>notice how he made his head bigger’n th’ </p><p>whole flock o’ hoss-tracks? He sure showed </p><p>th’ Injun conceit when he come to draw </p><p>hisself. Th’ two birds was ’nough, but he </p><p>even took time to stripe off his long ha’r </p><p>Red Toll </p><p>ii3 </p><p>like th’ Sioux do when they want to mean a </p><p>Crow.” </p><p> “I see nothing in that to make you feel</p><p>worried,” snapped Texas, tearing up little </p><p>tufts of grass between his crossed legs. </p><p>“Better turn in.” </p><p> “Jest what I’m goin’ to do—I’ll sleep like</p><p>a top, too. Ye see, it fussed me up because </p><p>th’ picter showed there was a heap o’ </p><p>hossmen. He jest wanted to hammer that </p><p>fact home.” </p><p> “He saw them. He knew how many he</p><p>saw.” </p><p> “An’ there’s th’ nub what fussed me.</p><p>F’r jest afore he was wiped out I scouted </p><p>that region some keerful an’ larned Lean </p><p>Wolf an’ th’ bulk of his men was off to </p><p>j’in th’ Pawnee in a big buf’ler hunt. </p><p>That’s what I reported back to th’ fort. </p><p>Th’ commander must think I’m an ol’ </p><p>fool.” </p><p> “Any scout is apt to read signs wrong at</p><p>times,” mumbled Texas. </p><p> “I’d overlook it in another, but in my</p><p>own case it hurt my feelin’s,” said Silent, </p><p>beginning to open the blanket. “Why, I </p><p>even was so upsot at my mistake I jest </p><p>took a scout up th’ crick arter ye arrived </p><p>with th’ picter.” </p><p> “You did?”</p><p> The query shot out like a bullet, the</p><p>scout drawing his heels beneath him as </p><p>though to rise, his gaze narrowing. </p><p> With a raucous laugh Silent gathered</p><p>his feet under him and continued— </p><p>“That’s what I done—an’ I couldn’t </p><p>find nary a sign o’ th’ Kiowy what Two </p><p>Birds marked down in his picter.” </p><p> “So? But it’s only a guess that he made</p><p>the drawing. I picked it up some distance </p><p>from where I found him. It may have </p><p>belonged to a Kiowa, who had it to use when </p><p>he made up his Winter count (calendar of </p><p>tribal events).” </p><p> Silent shook his head, dissenting:</p><p>“Scurcely possible, seein’ as how it </p><p>pictered Two Birds. Either he made it, </p><p>or th’ Injuns, what wiped him out, made </p><p>it. But if Injuns done it th’ picter would </p><p>show him killed. No; th’ Kiowy couldn’t </p><p>’a’ made it. An’ yet it was made with th’ </p><p>same kind o’ paint that I found in th’ pouch </p><p>at th’ Caches—cur’ous.” </p><p> “Who, then, but Two Birds could have</p><p>made it?” hoarsely demanded Texas. </p><p> “Lawd bless ye! I don’t know, ’less it</p><p>was some one who hated white folks an’ </p><p>8 </p><p>their Gov’ment scouts because he, hisself, </p><p>was neither white nor red,” retorted Silent </p><p>as he smoothed out the blanket. </p><p> With a sharp intake of breath Texas</p><p>leaned forward and glared at the blanket. </p><p>For nearly a minute the two sat rigid and </p><p>silent, then the scout whispered— </p><p> “Where did you get that?”</p><p> “From th’ body I dug up,” gritted Silent,</p><p>balancing on the balls of his feet as he met </p><p>and returned the ferocious gaze. “Two </p><p>trails led to th’ east bank o’ th’ Ash. Only </p><p>one quit it. Two Birds was killed in his </p><p>sleep; murdered inside his blanket by some </p><p>one he trusted.” </p><p> He paused and pointed at the tell-tale</p><p>hole made by the mortal knife-blow. Then </p><p>he loudly cried: </p><p> “Ye-renegade, neither white nor red,</p><p>ye done f’r him jest as ye done f’r th’ scouts </p><p>at th’ Cimarron Crossing, at th’ Rock, at </p><p>Pawnee Forks, at th’ Walnut, an’ as ye’d </p><p>planned to do f’r me. Ye made believe </p><p>ye didn’t dare take th’ trail alone along o’ </p><p>fearin’ Lean Wolf. Yer book English made </p><p>ye cute, but not cute ’nough to fool th’ ol’ </p><p>man, who knows more Injun than ye do. </p><p>I knew somethin’ was wrong th’ minute </p><p>I see that picter-writin’. </p><p> “Ye made a mistake when ye put in so</p><p>many bosses. I’ve been watchin’ ye all th’ </p><p>time. I follered ye yesterday. I found </p><p>th’ signs where ye met a small band o’</p><p>Kiowy after quittin’ me. I found where </p><p>yer trail j’ined theirs. Ye had a pow-wow </p><p>with ’em an’ rigged it f’r ’em to jump th’ </p><p>train-” </p><p> With an animal shriek of rage the lithe</p><p>body of the scout lengthened out in a </p><p>murderous leap, his right hand flashing </p><p>a long knife. But Silent was a second the </p><p>quicker, his left hand flirting Two Birds’ </p><p>blanket into the breed’s infuriated face </p><p>while his right swung back the heavy </p><p>ax. </p><p>“COLONEL VRAIN’S train </p><p>jumped by thirty Kiowy at Cimar- </p><p>ron Crossin’. Injuns licked. Lost </p><p>fifteen braves—Texas Charlie wiped out </p><p>near th’ Caches!” </p><p> “My God! The seventh!” gasped the</p><p>commander. </p><p> “Ye should thank th’ Lawd,” corrected</p><p>Silent, dropping from his pony. “F’r </p><p>Texas makes th’ last. Come inside an* </p><p>I’ll tell ye why it’s a blessin’.” </p><p>HiddenTrails </p><p>APIVE-PAR.T STORY , Part 2 </p><p>^ "V^iUiaro Tatterson WLilfe </p><p>Author of “Paradise Bend," “Longhorns," etc. </p><p>The first part of the story briefly retold in story form </p><p>TN THE longhorn country, when one gentleman </p><p> bestows baneful glances upon another, it be-</p><p>hooves the innocent bystander to be vigilant. </p><p> So when Johnny Ramsay, of the Cross-in-a-box,</p><p>observed a red-headed individual glance sourly in </p><p>through the door of the Happy Heart Saloon at a </p><p>brown-bearded stranger drinking at the bar, he sat </p><p>upright. A few minutes later the red-head entered </p><p>and sat in at a game of poker. </p><p> One of the players being forced to retire, the red-</p><p>head invited Brownbeard to take the empty place. </p><p>Brownbeard would rather not. Red-head insisted </p><p>and insinuated. Brownbeard strode to the table and </p><p>sat down. </p><p> The deal passed around the table and came to</p><p>Brownbeard. As he flipped the first card to the </p><p>red-head, the latter’s gun flashed while he sent the </p><p>cards flying. Brownbeard sank in a heap. </p><p> “He tried to skin us, the-tinhorn! Didya see</p><p>him deal from the bottom of the deck?” exclaimed </p><p>the red-head indignantly. </p><p> No one had—but no one could prove otherwise.</p><p>“Slim” Berdan, the town marshal, settled the case </p><p>quickly. </p><p> “Stranger,” said he, “yuh got twenty minutes to</p><p>pull yore freight out o’ Farewell, or we’ll hang yuh </p><p>some.” </p><p> Before the body was buried Jake Rule, Sheriff of</p><p>Fort Creek County, arrived and identified the dead </p><p>man as Mat Neville, a Wells-Fargo detective, a man </p><p>who had never been known to cheat in his life. </p><p> REAK and jangle! Hoofbeat and bump! The</p><p>through stage from Paradise Bend to Marys- </p><p>ville pulled in with the guard killed and “Whisky” </p><p>Jim, the driver, creased on the head. </p><p> “Road-agents again,” he explained simply. This</p><p>was the tenth time he had been stopped. </p><p> An hour later Bill Stahl, Sheriff of Sunset County,</p><p>arrived and posted notices to the effect that the </p><p>Territory would pay one thousand dollars apiece </p><p>for the delivery, dead or alive, of the bandits who </p><p>were operating in Simset County. The Wells- </p><p>Fargo Company duplicated the offer. </p><p> At Sheriff Rule’s home, Johnny interviewed both</p><p>Rule and Sheriff Stahl, but learned nothing more of </p><p>the road-agents. </p><p> “Yeah, she sounds a heap interestin’. I guess</p><p>I’ll just go after that reward,” he concluded. </p><p> Then entered smilingly Racey Dawson and Tele-</p><p>scope Laguerre. </p><p> “We heard yuh through the window,” they an-</p><p>nounced, “an’ we decided to go with yuh, so we can </p><p>sort o’ look after yuh an’ horn in on the two thou- </p><p>sand wheels a bandit.” </p><p> So they laid their plans. The sheriffs were to</p><p>tell nothing of the scheme to any one, but just to </p><p>greet the three casually as before. Two of the trio </p><p>were to secure jobs as stray men, probably from </p><p>“Scotty” Mackenzie, of the Flying-M; the third </p><p>was to work at the stage depot. Already they were </p><p>counting the reward-money. </p><p> Two days later the three met again and Johnny</p><p>Ramsay look the road to Paradise Bend, the others </p><p>to follow at intervals. </p><p> As he was picking his way along a difficult trail</p><p>three mornings later, three shots cracked ahead of </p><p>him. Where the trail turned into a grove of cotton- </p><p>woods he found their cause—two dead men in a </p><p>buckboard, and a dead horse. In the distance three </p><p>riders were rapidly fording a stream. Johnny aimed </p><p>and fired, but the horses, two chestnuts and a black- </p><p>tail dun, were already out of range. </p><p> The murdered men he found had been robbed.</p><p>Just as Johnny discovered the place from which </p><p>they had been ambushed, hoofbeats sounded on the </p><p>114 </p><p>Hidden </p><p>road. He drew into the bushes. When the care- </p><p>fully dressed rider drew up, Johnny stepped from </p><p>his place of concealment. Together they examined </p><p>the bodies. Then the stranger suggested: </p><p>“We might as well go back to the Bend together. </p><p>They’ve got too much of a start to do anything.” </p><p>“Howdja know I’m goin’ to the Bend, anyhow?” </p><p>questioned Johnny. </p><p>“This is how,” came the answer and he stared </p><p>into the twin-barrels of the stranger’s Derringer. </p><p>Johnny, disarmed, riding in front, the Derringer </p><p>in the rear, they rode to Paradise Bend. </p><p>^JHEN the town was reached the captor an- </p><p>nounced he had caught a road-agent red- </p><p>handed. </p><p>“I’ll getcha my rope!” yelled a citizen and the </p><p>crowd pressed forward. </p><p> While Johnny was trying to yell his explanations,</p><p> “Soapy” Ragsdale and Jim Mace, two old friends of</p><p> his, edged their way forward and took their places</p><p> by his side.</p><p>“I got my finger on the trigger,” Ragsdale an- </p><p>nounced, pointing his carbine. “I don’t like this </p><p>here bellerin’ for ropes an’ I don’t give a-who </p><p> knows it.”</p><p> The crowd remained at a respectful distance.</p><p>Then arrived the marshal who ordered a trial and </p><p>picked Dave Dusenbury’s store as the court-room. </p><p>Constituting himself judge, the marshal chose </p><p>twelve jurors, although he declared “a jury ain’t </p><p>really necessary,” and proceeded to the trial. </p><p>Trails	115</p><p> While every window of the store was jammed with</p><p>people, Harry Slay, the man who had brought </p><p>Johnny into town, told his story, twisting fact and </p><p>argument so cunningly that the two appeared as one. </p><p> But the light came to Johnny. By working</p><p>cartridges through his rifle he proved that if he had </p><p>fired the shots, the shell cases must be nicked, for </p><p>all which passed through his gun came out that way. </p><p>Next he declared that the empty shells, if they had</p><p>been thrown out, would be found in the ambush— </p><p>without a nick. One nicked shell would be where </p><p>he had thrown it after shooting at the horsemen. </p><p> In conclusion he declared that if the bullets were</p><p>dug out of the wounds they would be found to be </p><p>38’s while his were 45-90’s. </p><p> But the marshal and jury did not want to lose</p><p>time investigating. A murmur arose. The mar- </p><p>shal coughed, fingered his six-shooter and said: </p><p> “Gents, y’all heard what Harry Slay said. Y’all</p><p>heard what this feller said. What do you say?” </p><p> “Yes, gents, what do you say?” drawled a voice</p><p>from the doorway. </p><p> Scotty Mackenzie and eight of the Flying-M</p><p>riders pressed in and stood by Johnny’s side. </p><p> “Gents, yuh was goin’ to say somethin’. What</p><p>was it?” reminded Scotty. </p><p> “They was a-goin’ to adjourn over to Yaller</p><p>Medicine Crick to look at some evidence,” put in </p><p>the marshal. </p><p> “Oh yeah,” said Scotty. “Guess we’ll trail along.</p><p>Yuh see I was standin’ in that doorway a good ten </p><p>minutes before anybody saw me.” </p><p>CHAPTER VII </p><p>SCOTTY MACKENZIE </p><p>ERE’S a spent shellP’ cried one </p><p>of Scotty’s outfit, a bristle- </p><p>haired young man named “Swing” </p><p>Tunstall. </p><p>He handed the shell to Scotty, and the </p><p>latter held it up for the marshal to see. </p><p>“Yuh’ll notice Swing found her on the </p><p>buckboard side o’ that cottonwood about </p><p>ten feet off the road,” Scotty pronounced </p><p>in a dry tone. “An’ here’s Johnny’s twin </p><p>scratches down the side. Le’s go look for </p><p>the heel-marks.” </p><p>The presence of the heel-marks in the </p><p>soft ground having been verified, twenty </p><p>men, including the jurors, Scotty and the </p><p>marshal, climbed the steep slope to where </p><p>the two boulders snuggled between their </p><p>guardian pines. </p><p>Behind the boulders they found three </p><p>spent shells—two 45-90’s and one 40-65. </p><p>“Not scratched a-bit, none of ’em,” </p><p>observed Scotty. “Dug that bullet out o’ </p><p>Homan yet, Cal?” he called to an earnest </p><p>seeker after light on the trail below. </p><p> “In a minute,” replied Cal. “My knife</p><p>done touched her all right, but she’s kind </p><p>o’ behind a bone. She’s a-comin’.” </p><p> She came and was duly examined by the</p><p>multitude. </p><p> “40-65 bullet,” was Scotty’s remark.</p><p>“So Johnny didn’t fire that cartridge. An’ </p><p>he didn’t fire them two unscratched 45-90’s </p><p>neither. I guess that pretty near settles </p><p>the cat-hop.” </p><p> “Shore it does,” the marshal affirmed</p><p>with forced heartiness. “I guess the </p><p>jury’s satisfied. Gents, yo’re-” </p><p> “But I ain’t satisfied—yet,” interrupted</p><p>Scotty smoothly. “Yuh forget Johnny </p><p>seen three jiggers cross the creek. We’ll </p><p>slide down and look at the tracks. An’ </p><p>while we’re about it, we might just as well find </p><p>out where they tied their hosses while they </p><p>was bushwhackin’ Old Man an’ Bill. All </p><p>them li’l things help like-, yuh know,” </p><p>he added plaintively. </p><p> No one was deceived by his tone. All</p><p>accompanied him without demur. After </p><p>quartering the ground for fifteen minutes </p><p>Scotty and his followers halted in a pocket </p><p>among the pines. </p><p> “Here’s where they tied their hosses,”</p><p>ii6 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>announced Scotty. “Three hosses, an’ by </p><p>the looks o’ the ground they was standin’ </p><p>here a while. Le’s go down to the creek.” </p><p>They traced the tracks from the pocket </p><p>to the creek, up the opposite bank, and </p><p>out across the flats. </p><p> “I guess this is most enough,” said</p><p>Scotty, halting a hundred yards from the </p><p>water. </p><p> “She was enough before,” the hard-</p><p>featured Tom assured him. “-, I guess </p><p>we know when everythin’s all right.” </p><p> “I guess—maybe—yuh do,” was Scotty’s</p><p>drawling indorsement. </p><p> But Scotty was not looking at Tom.</p><p>The hard blue stare was directed straight </p><p>into the pale eyes of Harry Slay. The latter </p><p>promptly smiled in a most engaging fashion. </p><p> “This is fine,” he declared without hesi-</p><p>tation. “I am delighted that matters have </p><p>turned out as they have, and that your </p><p>friend gets a Scotch verdict—the benefit </p><p>of the doubt, in other words.” </p><p> “Benefit of the doubt?” Thus Scotty,</p><p>softly, almost tenderly. </p><p> “A slip of the tongue,” beamed Slay,</p><p>with a flash of white teeth. “I should </p><p>have said unquestionably cleared of the </p><p>charge against him ” </p><p> “Yeah, yuh should have,” said Scotty.</p><p>“Funny how folks don’t always think o’ </p><p>the right thing to say.” </p><p> “Surely is,” agreed the good-humored</p><p>Slay. “Have a cigar?” </p><p> “Cigarets kind o’ suit my health better,”</p><p>parried Scotty, fishing out the makings. </p><p> “Better stick to ’em then,” advised Slay,</p><p>and began to walk away from there. </p><p> Swing Tunstall looked at his friend Jack</p><p>McCall and rubbed a solemn chin. Jack </p><p>thrust his tongue into his cheek. Later,</p><p>in the bunk-house, they would recount </p><p>with delight how their employer ran a </p><p>blazer on Harry Slay and forced that plump </p><p>person to say what he had not intended </p><p>to say. </p><p> Scotty gave no evidence that he realized</p><p>what he had done. Mildly he asked Tun- </p><p>stall for a match, lit his cigaret, and plodded </p><p>slowly back to the buckboard with the </p><p>others. </p><p> “Where’s Harry?” queried a citizen</p><p>named Carey. </p><p> “Started back,” replied Cal Mason, busy</p><p>at the buckboard. “Pass the rope under </p><p>his arms, Tug, an’ I’ll tie ’em to the back </p><p>of the seat.” </p><p> “Naw,” objected Tug, “put ’em both on</p><p>the floor. S’pose their feet do hang over— </p><p>what’s the difference?” </p><p> “They ain’t room, I tell yuh!” avowed</p><p>Cal heatedly. “They’s only room for Bill </p><p>Homan on the floor. Old Man’s gotta sit </p><p>alongside o’ yuh. Aw, whatcha beefin’ </p><p>about—he ain’t bleedin’ even a li’l bit! </p><p>Lemme drive then. I can drive yore hoss </p><p>better’n you, anyhow,” Cal added with </p><p>consummate tact. </p><p> Tug drove.</p><p> On the ride back to the Bend, Johnny</p><p>contrived to maneuver Scotty to the tail </p><p>of the cavalcade. </p><p> “Gotta fix my cinches,” Johnny an-</p><p>nounced suddenly, and, catching Scotty’s </p><p>eye, motioned rearward with his head. </p><p>THE quick-witted Scotty halted </p><p>his horse as Johnny slid to the </p><p>ground. When Johnny swung up </p><p>the others were three hundred yards ahead. </p><p>Scotty grinned at Johnny, and Johnny </p><p>grinned at Scotty. They liked dach other </p><p>very well, these two. Johnny knew better </p><p>than to thank Scotty for coming to his res- </p><p>cue. He merely mentioned that Scotty </p><p>had picked a good day on which to ride to </p><p>town. Scotty “guessed” that this was the </p><p>truth, and the subject was closed. </p><p> “Yuh wanna hire two stray men, don’t</p><p>yuh, Scotty,” Johnny began abruptly.</p><p> “Who? Me? Two stray men? What-</p><p>cha talkin’ about, Johnny? This Terri- </p><p>tory ain’t Texas.” </p><p> “Yeah, but yuh want two stray men</p><p>just the same. Yo’re losin’ a lot o’ hosses </p><p>lately, an’ yuh don’t like it nohow.” </p><p> “It’s shore makin’ me madder’n -,”</p><p>said Scotty, falling into the spirit of the </p><p>occasion. “What else?” </p><p> “An’ yuh hire me’n Telescope.”</p><p> “Laguerre!”</p><p> “Shore.”</p><p> “Telescope Laguerre,” chuckled Scotty,</p><p>his face wrinkling with delight. “I’ll shore </p><p>be glad to see Telescope again.” </p><p> “Yo’re hirin’ us won’t cost yuh nothin’,</p><p>but nobody’s gotta know that. To them </p><p>she’s forty a month all reg’lar.” </p><p> “Shore. G’on. Don’t stop. I can see</p><p>times a-comin’.” </p><p> “Our bein’ stray men thisaway ’11 give</p><p>us a chance to ride the range so careless an’ </p><p>so free without folks askin’ questions. </p><p>They’s three of us. While two is ridin’ </p><p>Hidden Trails </p><p>ii 7 </p><p>’round the other’ll get a job in the Bend—• </p><p>at the stage corral, if he can. If he can’t, </p><p>some’ers else where the hearin’s good.” </p><p>“I’m beginnin’ to see,” drawled Scotty. </p><p>“I’m shore beginnin’ to see. Where yuh </p><p>goin’ to start in?” </p><p> “Right where them two fellahs was</p><p>downed. I’m no trailer, myself, but Tele- </p><p>scope is shore one li’l he-angel when it comes </p><p>to readin’ sign, an’ I’m gamblin’ he can </p><p>find out somethin’ from the hoof-marks of </p><p>the hosses them hold-ups rode. If only </p><p>she don’t rain.” </p><p> “She won’t,” declared Scotty. “If she</p><p>rains inside o’ six weeks, I’ll eat my shirt. </p><p>Them hoof-marks is there to stay. When </p><p>yuh goin’ to send for Telescope?” </p><p> “Telescope an’ Racey Dawson are on</p><p>the way now. Telescope’ll drift in day </p><p>after tomorrow likely, an’ Racey a couple </p><p>o’ days after.” </p><p> “Huh? Day after tomorrow?”</p><p> “Shore, day after tomorrow.”</p><p> “Say, how long you been plannin’ this</p><p>thing anyhow?” </p><p> “Since the stage pulled in to Farewell</p><p>after the Hogback hold-up an’ Bill Stahl </p><p>posted rewards for them bandits at a thou- </p><p>sand per. The Wells-Fargo made the same </p><p>play. I figure she beats punchin’ cattle.” </p><p>“An’ yuh come north special for that?” </p><p>Scotty’s eyes took on a terrier-like keenness. </p><p> “Shore, I did come north for that,”</p><p>replied Johnny. “Whadda yuh guess?” </p><p>“Seen Dor’thy?” was Scotty’s apparent- </p><p>ly irrelevant remark. </p><p> “Yeah—say, do yuh s’pose I come all</p><p>the way here to see her?” </p><p> “Why not?” yapped Scotty defensively.</p><p>“She’s one nice li’l gal, an’ any gent—any </p><p>gent, I tell yuh, Johnny—had ought to be </p><p>proud to ride from hell to breakfas’ an’ </p><p>back again to see her.” </p><p> “I dunno as my hoss’d stand the trip,”</p><p>doubted Johnny. </p><p> “Yuh know what I mean. Yuh know</p><p>plenty well what I mean. An’ I don’t </p><p>give a - what yuh say, Johnny, I’m </p><p>bettin’ yuh was thinkin’ o’ Dor’thy all the </p><p>time yuh was plannin’ to come up here </p><p>after them hold-ups. Shore yuh was, an’ </p><p>natural too. -, yes. Whatcha wigglin’ </p><p>’round in the saddle for?” </p><p> “ ’Cause you make me sick!”</p><p> “I’ll make yuh a heap sicker, soon.</p><p>Dor’thy’s one nice gal.” </p><p> “Yuh’ve done said that twice.”</p><p> “O’ course,” pursued the unheeding'</p><p>Scotty, “I don’t cotton to ladies as a rule,- </p><p>I’ve knowed several one time an’ another, </p><p>an’ they’re bad medicine. Yessir, I’ve </p><p>had experience, I have, an’ I’ve been gun-shy" </p><p>of ’em ever since. But Dor’thy Burr an’ </p><p>her ma ain’t nothin’ like the ord’nary run </p><p>o’ female women. Them two are reg’lar </p><p>shore-enough folks, y’betcha. Why, I </p><p>knowed Dor’thy when she wasn’t knee- </p><p>high to a pack-rat an’ said ‘Gug-gug’ when </p><p>she wanted to play with yore watch. </p><p>Busted mine three times, she did, an’ </p><p>throwed it in the stove final. </p><p> “The first time she ever rode a hoss in</p><p>her life was on my saddle with her li’l legs </p><p>a-stickin’ straight out an’ a-yellin’ to make </p><p>the hoss go. An’ look at her now. They </p><p>ain’t a better-lookin’ gal, bar none, north </p><p>o’ Texas. I ask yuh, is they? No, they </p><p>ain’t. O’ course, on forty a month yuh </p><p>hadn’t really ought to ask her, but after </p><p>yuh’ve hawg-tied a bandit or two an’ got </p><p>the money then fly at it. Shore. Wish I </p><p>was twenty years younger. I’d show yuh, </p><p>y’betcha.” </p><p> “Yuh’d shore be welcome to,” grunted</p><p>Johnny. “I ain’t out to get married—not </p><p>yet awhile. An’ I’m surprised at yuh, </p><p>Scotty, a man o’ yore age, talkin’ this way.” </p><p>“Why, yuh pore conceited cow-wrastler!” </p><p>blazed Scotty. “Yuh don’t guess I meant </p><p>what I said about Dor’thy an’ you, do yuh? </p><p>I was funnin’ yuh. If yuh had any sense</p><p>yuh’d see it, but that’s just the way, young </p><p>folks nowadays ain’t got the brains they </p><p>had when I was a boy. No, sir, not by a </p><p>jugful they ain’t, an’ you ain’t in partic’lar, </p><p>Johnny. Not but what y’ ain’t a right good </p><p>feller. I like yuh quite a lot. I dunno </p><p>why exactly. But you ain’t the man for </p><p>Dor’thy Burr. She’s a friend o’ mine.” </p><p>“Ain’t I a friend o’ yours?” demanded </p><p>Johnny, somewhat injured as to his feelings. </p><p> “Shore y’are,” admitted Scotty. “But</p><p>this is different, a heap different. Yuh </p><p>don’t shape up like a married man, Johnny.” </p><p>“I’d like to know why I couldn’t.” </p><p> “I thought yuh said yuh wasn’t out to</p><p>get married.” </p><p> “I mean I’d like to know why I couldn’t</p><p>if I wanted to.” </p><p> “I guess—maybe—yuh could. The)' say</p><p>nothin’s impossible. But it wouldn’t do. </p><p>-, no. Not a-tall nohow. Just you </p><p>forget it an’ think o’ somethin’ else. Be- </p><p>sides, it might be right dangerous.” </p><p>n8	Adventure</p><p> “Dangerous?”</p><p> “Dangerous.”</p><p> Scotty wore an air of supreme indiffer-</p><p>ence. He began to hum a little song. </p><p> “Nemmine dronin’ no tunes. Whadda</p><p>yuh mean by ‘dangerous’?” </p><p> “I was just thinkin’ o’ Harry Slay.”</p><p>“Harry Slay! Him! What’s he got to </p><p>do with Dorothy Burr?” </p><p> “Oh, nothin’, nothin’. How’s Jack</p><p>Richie makin’ out?” </p><p> “Nemmine Jack Richie either. He’ll</p><p>keep better’n that-tune. What’s all </p><p>this here mystery about Dorothy an’ Slay?” </p><p>“It ain’t no mystery. He slimes ’round </p><p>Dor’thy all the time. Goes ridin’ with her </p><p>a lot, an’ most every week the stage freights </p><p>in a big box o’ candy for him for her—all </p><p>the way from St. Paul, too. Why, say, </p><p>he even picks flowers out in the woods for her.” </p><p>Had Slay been in the habit of construct- </p><p>ing bouquets of rattlesnakes Scotty’s tone </p><p>could not have expressed more horrified </p><p>disgust. Johnny was disgusted, too, but </p><p>in a different way. </p><p> “Who is this man Slay?” he demanded.</p><p>“He owns the Broken Dollar S’loon— </p><p>runs six games in there. I thought yuh </p><p>knew.” </p><p> “He’s new since I was here.”</p><p> “Yeah, sifted in less’n two year ago,</p><p>bought the Savin’ Grace off Riley, renamed </p><p>her the Broken Dollar, an’ waded into </p><p>business. I’ll say this for him: he’s an </p><p>educated gent, a stayer over any distance </p><p>with the women, a cold proposition with </p><p>the men, an’ I ain’t got no more use for </p><p>him than I have for a toad. Not so much. </p><p>Yuh can squash a toad.” </p><p> “An’ he’s goin’ to see Dorothy?”</p><p> “Whadda you care?”</p><p> “I don’t—only—only it don’t seem right</p><p>somehow. Not that she’s anythin’ to me </p><p>more’n a friend, but he’s a pup, that</p><p>fellah.” </p><p> “Shore, but how yuh goin’ to stop it?</p><p>He’s acted real decent—so far. An’ if yuh </p><p>plug him or somethin’ Dor’thy mightn’t </p><p>like it. Yuh can’t never tell about a wo- </p><p>man.” </p><p> “But he ain’t the gent to be hangin’</p><p>’round a nice girl like that. He’s got a bad </p><p>eye.” </p><p> “Two of ’em, an’ I ask yuh again, what</p><p>yuh goin’ to do? She’s a free country.” </p><p>“Yeah, but—why don’t yuh talk to Mis’ </p><p>Burr?” </p><p> “An’ get a jawin’? Do I look like a</p><p>fool?” </p><p> “Sometimes,” said Johnny, “but y’ ain’t</p><p>to blame for that. I think it’s yore com- </p><p>plexion or somethin’. Leave my hoss </p><p>alone! Quit it now! We was talkin’ all </p><p>friendly about Dorothy an’ yuh gotta go </p><p>raisin’ - around. What are we goin’ </p><p>to do?” </p><p> “We?”</p><p> “Shore we?”</p><p> “An’ do what, huh?”</p><p> “Show Mister Slay he ain’t wanted.”</p><p>“Not me, Johnny. I’m shore too old </p><p>for them kind o’ fireworks. It’s yore </p><p>play.” _ </p><p> “Seein’ as nobody else wants to pick up</p><p>a hand,” Johnny observed with sarcasm, </p><p>“I guess maybe it is.” </p><p> Scotty said nothing. Having sown the</p><p>seed he was content to await the harvest. </p><p> “Goin’ out tonight?” inquired Johnny,</p><p>when the scattered lights of Paradise Bend </p><p>winked at them across the night. </p><p> “Guess not,” said Scotty. “Too late.</p><p>We’ll go tomorrow.” </p><p> “I’ll be out later—with Telescope,” ob-</p><p>served Johnny. “Not much use goin’ out </p><p>till after he comes. Besides, we gotta look</p><p>at them tracks.” </p><p> “Shore,” concurred Scotty, grinning into</p><p>the darkness. “They’s all kinds o’ reasons </p><p>for yuh to stay in the Bend,” he added </p><p>under his breath. </p><p> “Whatcha say?” Johnny questioned sus-</p><p>piciously. </p><p> “Talkin’ to the hoss.”</p><p>FROM the windows and doorways </p><p>of store, saloon and dance hall, </p><p>flaring fans of yellow light lay across </p><p>the sidewalks and stretched with diminish- </p><p>ing intensity into the dust of the street. </p><p>In the How Come You So Dance Hall two </p><p>fiddlers were dispensing the heartsome </p><p>strains of the “Arkansas Traveler” and </p><p>heavy boots and light slippers were scuffling </p><p>and sliding over the floor. An intoxicated </p><p>gentleman was roaring the “Days of Forty- </p><p>Nine” in the Three Card, and from the </p><p>Jacks Up came the merry cries of the bar- </p><p>tender and the proprietor as they strove </p><p>to eject an unwelcome customer. </p><p>“Good li’l town,” was Scotty’s comment. </p><p>“All o’ that,” said Johnny, watching with </p><p>admiring interest the unwelcome customer </p><p>issue from the Jacks Up, skitter across the </p><p>Hidden Trails </p><p>119 </p><p>sidewalk, and strike the street on the back </p><p>of his neck. </p><p> “Lookit, lookit!” he urged delightedly,</p><p>prodding Scotty. </p><p> “Yeah, that’s Lotta Wallace,” said</p><p>Scotty, who was looking in the opposite </p><p>direction. “Kind o’ fancy, ain’t she?” </p><p> “Huh? Who?” puzzled Johnny, think-</p><p>ing of the unwelcome customer. </p><p> “She’ll strike the light again in a shake,”</p><p>Scotty continued to stare across the street, </p><p>and Johnny, following with his eyes, got the </p><p>range in time to see a woman step into the </p><p>light from the doorway of the Golden Rule </p><p>—a woman of dark and brilliant beauty, </p><p>whose alluring black gown revealed and </p><p>emphasized the charm of throat and </p><p>shoulders, shoulders that should have been </p><p>covered by the white shawl she trailed over </p><p>a bare and perfect forearm. </p><p> Johnny watched the slim figure shuttling</p><p>through the light and darkness of the street </p><p>till it disappeared within the entrance of </p><p>the Broken Dollar. </p><p> “Lookout?” was his question.</p><p> “Sometimes,” Scotty told him. “But</p><p>mostly she spins the wheel. She’s Slay’s </p><p>sister, Mis’ Lotta Wallace, an’ a widow— </p><p>she says. Yuh can’t tell, it might be true. </p><p>Me, I always like to look at her. She </p><p>makes me think o’ when I was a bar’foot </p><p>kid back East in MacPherson an’ the cir- </p><p>cus come to town an’ for the first time in </p><p>my life I seen a leopard. Yessir, it’s shore </p><p>amazin’ how Mis’ Wallace reminds me o’ </p><p>that leopard.” </p><p> “Did she come here with Slay?”</p><p> “Yep—all the way from Cheecawgo—</p><p>if yuh believe what they say. Me per- </p><p>sonal I got a idea they’re a long time from </p><p>Lake Michigan—a long, long time. They </p><p>was nothin’ tenderfooty about either of ’em </p><p>when they come. Yessir, a gent don’t </p><p>learn to pull a gun like Slay can pull her, </p><p>back East. It ain’t a city trick. An’ </p><p>that Lotta gal was born on a boss.</p><p> “Johnny, I seen her ride Dan Smith’s</p><p>pitcher one day. Which that wall-eyed </p><p>cayuse gave her all he knowed from sun- </p><p>fishin’ to changin’ ends an’ djuh think she </p><p>pulled leather? Nary a pull. She stuck </p><p>to him like grim death to a dead nigger an’ </p><p>loped him through town at the finish like </p><p>nothin’ had happened. But just the same,” </p><p>he added hastily, “she reminds me o’ that </p><p>leopard.” </p><p> “Yeah,” said Johnny, thinking of some-</p><p>thing else. “An’ so Slay’s been here about </p><p>two years, huh? Was it before or after he </p><p>come that they had the first hold-up?” </p><p> “Aw-, yo’re ropin’ at the wrong cow,</p><p>Johnny!” declared Scotty. “I don’t like </p><p>Harry a-tall, but I’ll say he ain’t in them </p><p>hold-ups. Why, every single hold-up ’cep- </p><p>tin’ this last one he’s been here in town. </p><p>I know it, ’cause I thought o’ him that way </p><p>once, an’ I took the trouble to find out. </p><p>Whoever they are, Harry Slay ain’t one of </p><p>’em. Le’s cross over, Johnny. Yo’re stay- </p><p>in’ at the hotel with me tonight.” </p><p>CHAPTER VIII </p><p>DOROTHY BURR </p><p>DOROTHY BURR was lining pie-pans </p><p>when Johnny Ramsay stuck his head </p><p>through the kitchen doorway. </p><p> “You’re a nice one,” was her response to</p><p>his greeting. “Here I waited up half the </p><p>night expecting you’d come and tell me </p><p>everything was all right, and you didn’t. </p><p>And I had to hear it all from Mis’ Mace </p><p>this morning. Lot of consideration you </p><p>have for your friends, I must say.” </p><p> She stared at him with resentful eyes.</p><p>“But, ma’am,” he protested, reddening </p><p>slightly at her naive' announcement, “it </p><p>was late when we rode in—almost mid- </p><p>night.” </p><p> “I sat up till one.”</p><p> “If I’d only knowed! But not knowin’,</p><p>I done what I thought was best. I just </p><p>brought yore hoss back. He’s in the cor- </p><p>ral now. I’m shore obliged to yuh for</p><p>lendin’ him to me, an’ for takin’ care o’ </p><p>mine for me. Which that li’l red hoss was </p><p>shore dead-beat.” </p><p> “Dead-beat!” She smiled whimsically at</p><p>the recollection. “I guess he was. The </p><p>poor chap tried to lie down twice between </p><p>Main Street and here. He’s all right now. </p><p>He was trying to kick Twinkles when I </p><p>watered them this morning.” </p><p> Dorothy pushed back a falling lock of</p><p>brown hair with a floury hand, and reached </p><p>for the bowl of filling. She had a dab of </p><p>flour on the bridge of her pretty nose, her </p><p>waist was open at the neck, and her rolled- </p><p>up sleeves made manifest the dimples in </p><p>her attractive elbows. She looked a very </p><p>delectable young person, as she sat there, </p><p>her smooth cheeks pink w'ith the heat of the </p><p>kitchen. </p><p>120 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Johnny sat down on the door-sill, braced</p><p>his toes against the jamb, and built him- </p><p>self the inevitable cigaret. He stared lazily </p><p>across his humped knees at the lady. He </p><p>did not find her in the least hard to look </p><p>at. She was handsomer than she used to </p><p>be, he told himself. No two ways about </p><p>it, she certainly filled a fellow’s eye. </p><p> “What’s that?” she asked, raising dark</p><p>eyes to his. </p><p> “I—I didn’t say nothin’,” denied Johnny,</p><p>going red to the ears. “She—she’s a nice </p><p>day.” </p><p> “I beg your pardon. I thought you</p><p>said something about eyes.” </p><p> “Who? Me? Nun-no, ma’am.”</p><p> “All right.” Indifferently.</p><p> “Come to think of it, maybe now I did</p><p>say somethin’ about eyes,” he observed, </p><p>imbued with sudden daring. “I was just </p><p>thinkin’ how yore eyes are a plumb dark </p><p>brown, almost black, an’ yore eyebrows the </p><p>same, an’ yore hair is a li’l lighter, an’ yet </p><p>they all kind o’ match.” </p><p> She gazed at him with parted lips, the</p><p>aforesaid almost black eyebrows inquiringly </p><p>arched. Then she smiled adorably and </p><p>spooned up some more filling. </p><p> “The wonders of nature,” she twinkled</p><p>at him. “Keep your eyes open and you’ll </p><p>learn something new every day. You </p><p>never used to be so observant.” </p><p> “My eyesight’s gettin’ better,” was his</p><p>dry comment. </p><p> “I know,” she said, leveling the spoon at</p><p>him, “you’ve been reading novels. You’re </p><p>getting romantic. You stop it, do you hear? </p><p>Eyebrows and eyes and hair, indeed!” </p><p> She sniffed quite audibly.</p><p> “But they look so kind o’ — kind o’</p><p>pretty,” he protested. “I was just tellin’ </p><p>yuh. Why, ma’am, even that smear o’ </p><p>flour on yore nose looks nice.”</p><p> “Never mind about my nose,” said she,</p><p>rubbing the feature in question vigorously </p><p>with the corner of her apron. “Of course </p><p>I know I have a certain element of charm, </p><p>as it were. My perfectly good mirror tells </p><p>me that. But it isn’t at all necessary for </p><p>you to tell me about. I don’t like it, and </p><p>I won’t have it.” </p><p> “Won’t yuh?”</p><p> “No.”</p><p> “Why?”</p><p> “Darn the man! I declare, when it</p><p>comes to fool questions you’re worse than </p><p>a brat! What you need is a little exercise, </p><p>and what I need is some fresh water. The </p><p>pail’s in that corner. Do you think you </p><p>can find the well without being led to it </p><p>by the hand?” </p><p> “I know I can’t,” he declared promptly.</p><p>“Besides, yuh need some fresh air. This </p><p>kitchen’s kind o’ hot. C’mon out.” </p><p> “After. Get a move on with that water,</p><p>and stop your nonsense.” </p><p> When Johnny had gone, Dorothy sat</p><p>looking through the open window at the </p><p>green and distant Government Hills. There </p><p>was a tender little smile on her lips. At </p><p>the sound of his returning step she went </p><p>on with her pie-making. </p><p> “Where’s yore ma?” he asked, suddenly</p><p>bethinking himself of Mrs. Burr as he set </p><p>the full pail in the corner. </p><p> “She’s over at Mis’ Acker’s on Jack</p><p>Creek.” </p><p> “I thought you said yuh done sent Sammy</p><p>Barnes for her,” said he, recollecting what </p><p>Dorothy had told the marshal the previous </p><p>afternoon. </p><p> Dorothy giggled.</p><p> “I sort of told a fib,” she confessed. “I</p><p>didn’t really send for ma. You see, I knew </p><p>Scotty and some of his boys would be </p><p>fencing in that quicksand at Wagon Slue </p><p>on the Dogsoldier yesterday, so I sent</p><p>Sammy for Scotty instead. But I thought </p><p>Dan Smith and the rest of that mob had </p><p>better keep right on believing as long as </p><p>possible that they had nearly two hours </p><p>in which to try you and—and—instead of </p><p>the thirty minutes or so necessary for the </p><p>ride to Wagon Slue and back.” </p><p> “I know what yore ‘an’—an’ ’ means,”</p><p>said he soberly. “They was shore out to </p><p>hang me. They’d ’a’ done it, if it hadn’t </p><p>been for you.” </p><p> “Nonsense!” she exclaimed, sliding the</p><p>pies into the oven and kicking the door </p><p>shut. “Jim Mace and Soapy were there. </p><p>I didn’t really do anything.” </p><p> “I’m thinkin’ different,” he told her</p><p>earnestly, took a step toward her, and </p><p>paused, overcome by sudden shyness. </p><p>“Cue—call me Johnny, will yuh?” </p><p>Dorothy deliberately turned her back on </p><p>him and crossed the room to the tiny mir- </p><p>ror hanging beside the china-closet. Here </p><p>she busied herself in pulling and patting </p><p>her coiffure into shape. Head cocked on </p><p>one side, she surveyed the effect. </p><p> Johnny scraped an uncomfortable foot.</p><p>He thought he had made her angry, and </p><p>Hidden Trails </p><p>121 </p><p>mentally called himself a fool. Yet at the </p><p>time, his request seemed a natural one to </p><p>make. </p><p>DOROTHY turned, still without </p><p>looking at him, walked to the </p><p>table, reached for a can of peas and </p><p>the can-opener, and proceeded to travel </p><p>’round the top of the can. When the peas </p><p>had been neatly slid into a double-boiler </p><p>and the can thrown out the lady fixed </p><p>Johnny with a cool and tantalizing eye. </p><p>The young man was now wishing himself </p><p>elsewhere. But to retire gracefully was </p><p>beyond his powers. He was perspiring a </p><p>little. Dorothy smiled the peculiar smile </p><p>of the entomologist about to impale a rare </p><p>insect on a large pin. </p><p> “How long have you known me?” she</p><p>inquired coldly. </p><p> “Three—three years,” stuttered Johnny.</p><p>“I think not,” she contradicted. “You </p><p>haven’t seen me for at least two years.” </p><p>“But the year before I seen quite a lot </p><p>of yuh,” defended Johnny. </p><p> “Three times,” enumerated she with in-</p><p>creasing chilliness of demeanor. </p><p> “It was more’n that,” he insisted.</p><p> “It was not. Three times exactly—no</p><p>more, no less. And I don’t believe you </p><p>said a dozen words to me during any of the </p><p>three times.” </p><p> “Oh, ma’am, yo’re mistaken!” Johnny’s</p><p>tone was piteously horror-stricken. </p><p> Her lips twitched.</p><p> “I am not mistaken,” she insisted. “I</p><p>am never mistaken—in anything I may do. </p><p>Under the circumstances, having known me </p><p>such a short time and all that, you know, </p><p>don’t you really think it’s the least bit </p><p>nervy to ask permission to call me by my </p><p>first name?” </p><p> “It’d be worse if I called yuh that with-</p><p>out askin’ yuh,” said he matter-of-factly. </p><p> “Answer my question?” The dark eyes</p><p>held him. </p><p> “Y-yes, ma’am, o’ course it would,” he</p><p>affirmed hastily. “I’m sorry. I didn’t </p><p>mean—I guess I’ll go now.” </p><p> “Why not wait a moment? I haven’t</p><p>quite finished.” </p><p> “You’ve made it more’n plain, ma’am.”</p><p>Nevertheless Johnny halted on his way </p><p>to the door. </p><p> “Have I, Mister Blind Man? I was</p><p>just about to say that I think it would be </p><p>very nice indeed to call you Johnny. I’ve </p><p>been wondering how soon you’d ask me.” </p><p>“You have! Then what did yuh make </p><p>all that row for?” </p><p> “Just to tease you. You’re so easily</p><p>teased—even for a boy.” </p><p> “Boy!” he frowned.</p><p> “Oh, very well, Mister Methuselah.</p><p>How’s that?” </p><p> “Well, I ain’t no gran’pa, but I ain’t a</p><p>kid neither. I’ve been roamin’ up an’ </p><p>down this vale o’ tears a long, long time.” </p><p>“My, what a lot you must know!” She </p><p>stared at him, round-eyed. </p><p> “Aw, leave me alone,” he begged. “I</p><p>can’t talk like you can, an’ yuh know it. </p><p>Remember, I’m just a young fellah tryin’ </p><p>hard to get along. I may make mistakes </p><p>now an’ later, but outside o’ that, my heart </p><p>beats reg’lar all same alarm-clock.” </p><p> “I know,” she said seriously, “in some</p><p>ways you’re almost human. You may call </p><p>me Dorothy, if you like.” </p><p> “Thanks,” he observed drily. “I do like</p><p>Dorothy. Has kind of a smooth sound, </p><p>ain’t it? Yessir, I shore always did like </p><p>that name Dorothy. ’Spect I’ll be usin’ </p><p>it quite a lot from now on.” </p><p> “Take care you don’t strain your throat,”</p><p>she answered solemnly, then promptly </p><p>dazzled him with a radiant smile. “Reach </p><p>me down a can of tomatoes from the top </p><p>shelf, will you—Johnny?” </p><p> “All right, Dorothy.”</p><p> There was more than joy in his grin as</p><p>he brought her the tomatoes. </p><p> “A whole can o’ tomatters!” the disap-</p><p>proving voice of Scotty Mackenzie ex- </p><p>claimed from the doorway. “An’ a whole </p><p>can o’ peas! An’ a skillet full o’ hashed </p><p>Hogans an’ ham! I ain’t namin’ no names, </p><p>but they’s such a thing as havin’ a healthy </p><p>appetite an’ they’s such a thing as bein’ </p><p>a hawg. Not meanin’ nothin’ or nobody </p><p>in partic’lar, o’ course.” </p><p> “Of course not, old-timer, we understand</p><p>perfectly,” Dorothy assured him. “You’re </p><p>merely shedding sunshine in your own sweet </p><p>way. Johnny, while you’re setting a place </p><p>for yourself at the table set another for the </p><p>old gentleman with the whiskers.” </p><p> “I didn’t know I was a-goin’ to stay?”</p><p>Johnny strove to inject the correct degree </p><p>of surprise into his tone. </p><p> “Yuh didn’t, huh?” cackled Scotty.</p><p>“That’s a good one, that is. Just as if </p><p>yuh haven’t been sittin’ ’round all mornin’ </p><p>with yore tongue hangin’ out an’ yore </p><p>122 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>mouth open a-honin’ for an invite. Can’t </p><p>fool me. I know.” </p><p> “Is that so?” snarled Johnny. “An’ if</p><p>I was she’s none o’ yore business.” </p><p> “You bet she’s my business. First thing</p><p>I know one o’ you young fellers ’11 be stealin’ </p><p>my gal away, an’ I ain’t a-goin’ to let </p><p>nothin’ like that happen, not while I have </p><p>my health, y’betcha. What a fine an’ </p><p>dandy color yuh got this mornin’, Dor’thv. </p><p>I just noticed it.” </p><p> The terrible old man smirked shamelessly</p><p>at the two of them, straddled a chair and </p><p>sailed his hat into a far corner. </p><p> “Yeah, yo’re shore as nice-lookin’ as a</p><p>li’l red wagon with that color an’ all,” he </p><p>remarked after a space devoted to the </p><p>rolling of a cigaret. </p><p> “You leave my color alone,” Dorothy</p><p>told him, forking over the sizzling ham, </p><p>“or I won’t feed you.” </p><p> “Can’t scare me that way,” declared</p><p>Scotty tranquilly. “Yuh know I never </p><p>eat nothin’ here. I don’t dast. If I did, </p><p>I wouldn’t have no appetite for ranch </p><p>chuck, an’ that’s whatever.” </p><p> “I merely wished to be polite,” sniffed</p><p>disdainful Dorothy. </p><p> “That’s all right. I don’t mind. Be</p><p>as polite as yuh like, Johnny, while Dor’thy </p><p>is wrastlin’ that ham ’round the pan s’pose </p><p>you’n me traipse over to the corral. I </p><p>wanna show yuh somethin’ on my saddle.” </p><p>At that particular moment, a saddle was </p><p>not Johnny’s idea of something to look at. </p><p>He greatly preferred remaining with Doro- </p><p>thy. He accompanied Scotty in silence. </p><p> “Yo’re a fine detective,” remarked Scotty,</p><p>as they approached the Burr corral. </p><p>“Who said I was?” yapped Johnny. </p><p>“Not me,” Scotty told him. “I always </p><p>tell the truth. There, there, crack yore </p><p>face an’ smile. Yuh look so gloomersome </p><p>yuh hurt my feelin’s.” </p><p> “- yore feelin’s. Whatcha wanna</p><p>come mussin’ ’round here for makin’ fool </p><p>remarks? She don’t like ’em.” </p><p> “Do you?”</p><p> “No, I don’t.”</p><p> “All right, all right, I was just wonderin’.</p><p>It shore beats - how a well-meanin’ </p><p>gent gets tromped on nowadays. It wasn’t </p><p>like that when I was a kid back East in </p><p>Macpherson. No sirree, a pore ol’ feller </p><p>like me was respected in them days.” </p><p>Scotty gurgled out a sob and affecjpd to </p><p>wipe away a tear. </p><p> “Yuh got somethin’ to say,” accused</p><p>Johnny. “Y’always have when y’act more </p><p>like a fool than usual. Spit her out.” </p><p>“Spit her out!” groaned Scotty. “Such </p><p>language! An’ my Johnny raised a Chris- </p><p>tian! Djuh know where you’ll go when you </p><p>die, huh? You’ll go to hell, that’s where </p><p>yuh’ll go. Yessir, yuh’ll fry. An’ it’ll be </p><p>yore own fault. Gawd knows I’ve warned </p><p>yuh till my neck’s as dry as a covered </p><p>bridge.” </p><p> “Stop it!” commanded Johnny. “What-</p><p>cha goin’ to say?” </p><p> “Yuh don’t deserve to hear me say it.</p><p>But me, I’m a forgivin’ sport. Yessir, yuh </p><p>won’t find a more forgivin’, Gawd-fearin’ </p><p>individjul in ten days’ ride. Look, darlin’, </p><p>look at this.” </p><p> Scotty Mackenzie fished something from</p><p>the staple pocket on his cantle and held it </p><p>toward Johnny. The latter took it won- </p><p>deringly. “It” had- once been a cheap </p><p>silver watch. Now it was smashed beyond </p><p>all hope of repair. It lay in Johnny’s palm, </p><p>a battered glassless case, sprouting a tangle </p><p>of springs and cogwheels. </p><p> “Pretty li’l thing,” commented Scotty.</p><p>“What’s it for?” asked the puzzled </p><p>Johnny. </p><p>“It ain’t to keep time, but I thought </p><p>maybe it might come in handy for yuh. I </p><p>found it this mornin’ right at the edge o’ </p><p>that quicksand I’m fencin’ in at Wagon Slue.”</p><p>“Well?” </p><p> “Turn her over.”</p><p> Johnny obeyed. On the back of the case</p><p>had been rudely scratched the initials </p><p>“W. H.” </p><p> “Bill Homan’s initials,” Scotty said</p><p>quietly. “She’s Bill’s watch. I seen him </p><p>look at her more’n once.” </p><p> “An’ yuh found it right at the edge o’</p><p>the quicksand?” </p><p> “Shore, this mornin’.”</p><p> “Did any o’ yore outfit see it?”</p><p> “Nary a one. I was there three minutes</p><p>ahead of ’em. An’ here this thing lay. An’ </p><p>they wasn’t a hoofmark or heelmark within </p><p>forty feet. I’m tellin’ yuh, Johnny, that </p><p>this timepiece was throwed from across the </p><p>river some time durin’ the night. I know </p><p>she was throwed ’cause she’d dug into the </p><p>ground where she landed an’ they was the </p><p>mark o’ how she’d rolled *a li’l bit after </p><p>landin’. An’ I know she was throwed </p><p>durin’ the night ’cause if she’d been day- </p><p>light the gent who slung her would never </p><p>Hidden Trails </p><p>123 </p><p>have overthrowed an’ missed the quicksand </p><p>—shore. Course he was tryin’ to sink the </p><p>watch in the quicksand. What else?” </p><p> “I guess yo’re right,” concurred Johnny.</p><p>“This watch shore goes to show the road- </p><p>agents live in town or near it.” </p><p> “Shore does,” said Scotty Mackenzie.</p><p>CHAPTER IX </p><p>THE OTHER WOMAN </p><p>JOHNNY spent the afternoon with the </p><p>hospitable Dorothy. The lady, as she </p><p>tidily darned her father’s socks, did not find </p><p>Johnny an inspiring companion. She was </p><p>neither accustomed to silence nor mono- </p><p>syllabic replies. She did not realize that </p><p>her visitor was deep in a mathematical prob- </p><p>lem and making an exceedingly boggy ford </p><p>of it. One and one will simply not make </p><p>four no matter how many times you add or </p><p>multiply them together. But Johnny was </p><p>a persistent soul. He kept right on juggling </p><p>Bill Homan’s watch and his own suspi- </p><p>cions till supper-time arrived and brought </p><p>not the remotest hint of a satisfactory </p><p>answer. Whereupon Johnny put on his </p><p>hat and departed hotelward—to see a man. </p><p> “Yeah, he’s a great friend o’ mine,” he</p><p>told Dorothy. “I’d like to stay to supper, </p><p>honest I would, but I got my own sinful </p><p>pride, an’ moochin’ one meal a day off a </p><p>lady is my limit. G’by.” </p><p> Dorothy was left sputtering indignantly.</p><p>After supper, and a most indifferent meal </p><p>it was in comparison with his dinner, he </p><p>went over to Ragsdale’s store and spent a </p><p>tobacco-laden hour gossiping with Soapy. </p><p>Jim Mace came in and the hour lengthened </p><p>to two, and darkness fell, and it was night. </p><p> About ten o’clock Johnny stood up on his</p><p>feet and yawned and stretched his long arms </p><p>and legs till they cracked. </p><p> “I guess I’ll kind o’ take a look ’round</p><p>town,” he observed. </p><p> “Yeah,” said Jim Mace, his eye lighting.</p><p>“Is that a saloon across the street, or do my</p><p>eyes deceive me?” </p><p> “You, Buster!” bawled Ragsdale. “C’min</p><p>here an’ take the store. I gotta go out on a </p><p>li’l business.” </p><p> Johnny’s chief wish at that moment was</p><p>to be about his own business. But his two </p><p>friends did not seek to further that wish. </p><p>Their earnest desire was to make it a large </p><p>evening. To which end they hung Johnny </p><p>and themselves over the bar of the Three </p><p>Card and invited all and sundry to join </p><p>them. </p><p> Johnny took a small part of one drink,</p><p>after which, by the exercise of some strategy </p><p>and all his natural agility, he contrived to </p><p>escape through a rear window. </p><p> Standing well back and to one side of the</p><p>splayed light from the window, Johnny </p><p>heard Soapy and Jim call on him by name, </p><p>and finally leave hurriedly by the front door. </p><p> “Let ’em hunt,” he grinned. “Me, I got</p><p>business.” </p><p> He turned and looked along the irregular</p><p>line of rear elevations. There was the </p><p>Golden Rule—those three small glowing </p><p>windows. Beyond it the houses were dark </p><p>—private residences. Beyond these again </p><p>was a dim light—the stage station. The </p><p>dark bulk adjoining the stage station was, he </p><p>knew, the rear of the Broken Dollar saloon </p><p>and gambling-joint. There were six win- </p><p>dows and a doorway in the rear wall of the </p><p>Broken Dollar’s back room, but all were </p><p>dark. </p><p> “Slay’s shore economical o’ light in that</p><p>back room,” was Johnny’s idle comment, as </p><p>he started toward the stage company’s </p><p>corrals. </p><p> Johnny’s objective was the Broken Dol-</p><p>lar, which palace of chance he intended to </p><p>surreptitiously approach from the other end </p><p>of Main Street in order that his friends </p><p>might not see him enter. For, should they </p><p>see him, they would undoubtedly join him </p><p>for his better protection. And Johnny </p><p>wished to study his enemy unhampered by </p><p>any one. That Slay was his most vindictive </p><p>enemy was certain. </p><p> Why? Johnny could not understand</p><p>why, and he intended to know why. That </p><p>there was a certain element of risk attached </p><p>to such close-range observation was true. </p><p>But Johnny held to the cheerful opinion </p><p>that hostilities would be riskier for Slay </p><p>than for himself. As has been stated, </p><p>Johnny was no marvel on the draw, but he </p><p>possessed the ability to shoot accurately </p><p>from the hip and through the bottom of his </p><p>holster. </p><p> Johnny, skirting the rear of the stage</p><p>company’s two corrals, turned the corner of </p><p>the second enclosure and fell over the pro- </p><p>jecting tongue of a tiltless freight-wagon. </p><p>He arose, swearing softly and rubbing </p><p>barked shins. His hat had fallen off. He </p><p>felt about for it in the darkness, and swore </p><p>124 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>some more. He found it, and straightened </p><p>just as the six windows in the back room of </p><p>the Broken Dollar sprang into dusty radi- </p><p>ance and a line of light showed yellowly at </p><p>the bottom of the door. </p><p> “That door always did hang slanchways,”</p><p>observed Johnny, and thoughtfully edged </p><p>behind the freight-wagon. </p><p> The door opened. For an instant the</p><p>form of a woman was silhouetted against </p><p>the light within, then the door closed behind </p><p>her. </p><p> From the freight-wagon to the Broken</p><p>Dollar was not more than seventy yards. </p><p>Johnny heard the tink of a kicked tin can. </p><p>A high heel clicked on a flat stone. A tri- </p><p>angular splotch of white, gliding toward the </p><p>freight-wagon, gradually took shape in the </p><p>darkness. The white splotch reached the </p><p>hind wheels, and Johnny heard the pleasant </p><p>whisper of silk. Noiselessly Johnny scut- </p><p>tled to the safer shelter of the corral stock- </p><p>ade. Body flattened against the posts, he </p><p>waited. </p><p> The white splotch appeared at the fore</p><p>wheels of the freight-wagon, and bobbed up- </p><p>ward as the woman swung herself into the </p><p>driver’s seat. </p><p> Followed then the scratch of a drawn</p><p>match. Johnny stared. The woman was </p><p>lighting a cigaret. The pulsing flame re- </p><p>vealed the face of Slay’s sister, Mrs. Lotta </p><p>Wallace. </p><p> At this close range her extreme beauty</p><p>was more than ever apparent. The black </p><p>hair growing low in a widow’s peak on the </p><p>forehead, the finely arched eyebrows, the </p><p>long and curving eyelashes, the straight </p><p>nose, the wide, full-lipped mouth, and the </p><p>firm and pointed chin above the round, </p><p>smooth throat and lovely shoulders, were </p><p>individually sufficiently striking. In com- </p><p>bination with each other the effect was </p><p>bewildering. Yet Johnny was left cold. </p><p>He remembered Scotty’s leopard and be- </p><p>came colder. </p><p> The situation was becoming impossible.</p><p>The spark that was Mrs. Wallace’s cigaret</p><p>was not twenty feet distant. At any mo- </p><p>ment the lady might climb down, walk </p><p>along the stockade and discover him. Nat- </p><p>urally, she would think he was spying on </p><p>her, and to be suspected of that by such an </p><p>unknown quantity as Slay’s sister was un- </p><p>thinkable. Why hadn’t he kept on going </p><p>along the stockade when he had the oppor- </p><p>tunity? Scotty was right. He was a fine </p><p>detective, making mistakes this way. </p><p>Johnny sweated clammily and breathed as </p><p>little as possible. </p><p> Suddenly he saw Mrs. Wallace’s cigaret</p><p>describe a firefly arc in the air and strike the </p><p>ground in a sputter of sparks. There was </p><p>no sound of a movement on the driver’s </p><p>seat. Wasn’t the woman ever coming </p><p>down? </p><p> A long minute’s silence, then a whisper—</p><p> “My God, what a life!”</p><p> The exclamatory sentence was followed</p><p>by a pronounced sniffle, then more sniffles, </p><p>and finally choky little sobs. It was evi- </p><p>dent that Mrs. Wallace was striving to fight </p><p>down her emotion. But her grief was too </p><p>great to be stifled easily. </p><p> “I wish I were dead!” she moaned, and</p><p>began to cry quietly and steadily. </p><p> Johnny, hating himself acutely, began to</p><p>itch between the shoulders. The itch wore </p><p>itself out after centuries of torture and a </p><p>cramp fastened sullenly on the muscles of his </p><p>left foot. Something alive and many-legged </p><p>fell off the stockade and landed on his </p><p>shoulder. The something crawled along </p><p>the shoulder to his neck and tickled his ear. </p><p> With infinite caution he raised a nervous</p><p>hand, removed a night-riding spider and en- </p><p>deavored to drop the loathsome thing at a </p><p>distance. With the perversity of vermin it </p><p>clung whole-heartedly to his finger, and he </p><p>was forced to slat it off against a post of the </p><p>stockade, detaching in the process a loose </p><p>piece of dry bark. The bark fell with a </p><p>rustle. Johnny caught his breath, and </p><p>tensed his muscles for a flying start. But </p><p>the sound of weeping abated not. </p><p> Johnny took heart of hope and a long</p><p>breath. The taking of the latter was inju-</p><p>dicious. For many months dust of the cor- </p><p>ral, stirred into action by the hoofs of the </p><p>stage-horses, had been sifting and settling </p><p>behind that loose piece of bark. The fall </p><p>thereof released an atomic cloud that, at the </p><p>intake of the long breath, promptly smote </p><p>the sensitive membrane of Johnny’s nos- </p><p>trils. </p><p> Johnny gritted his teeth, violently rubbed</p><p>his nose, and otherwise by main strength </p><p>and a robust will contrived to suffocate the </p><p>sneeze before it was born. He almost </p><p>strangled in the effort, and was left with </p><p>tear-wet eyes and throbbing temples. But </p><p>he had made not the slightest sound. And </p><p>Mrs. Wallace wept on forlornly. </p><p> Johnny’s gambling spirit urged him to</p><p>Hidden Trails </p><p>125 </p><p>take a chance on departure. Between </p><p>spiders and itchings and incipient sneezes </p><p>the locality was fast losing its charm. But </p><p>knowledge of the many tin cans held him </p><p>back. There was an ancient cast-off stove </p><p>somewhere about, too. If he should fall </p><p>over that! </p><p> Centuries became eons, and eons became</p><p>eternity before there was an appreciable </p><p>lessening of that distressful sobbing on the </p><p>wagon-seat. Johnny’s first-formed esti- </p><p>mate of Mrs. Wallace had been gradually </p><p>altering. By the time her sobs gave way to </p><p>long-drawn gasping breaths his opinion </p><p>utterly opposed that of Scotty. He could </p><p>not understand how she could remind Scotty </p><p>of a leopard. Why, she was just a little </p><p>wretched girl, crying her heart out, and that </p><p>was all. Johnny felt quite sorry for her. </p><p>Which, could he have but known it, is a </p><p>most dangerous feeling when the lady con- </p><p>cerned is as beautiful as was Mrs. Wallace. </p><p>THERE WAS a deep sigh from the </p><p>aforesaid lady, and then a rustling </p><p>and a scraping as she swung down </p><p>over the double-tree to the ground. White </p><p>shawl trailing across one shoulder she headed </p><p>back toward the Broken Dollar. Johnny </p><p>stretched legs and arms in aching relief and </p><p>dodged ’round the pole of the freight-wagon </p><p>to where he could follow her with his eyes. </p><p> He saw her figure become one with the</p><p>darkness and then reappear with magic- </p><p>lantern abruptness under one of the lighted </p><p>windows of the Broken Dollar. Here she </p><p>halted, produced from her bosom a small </p><p>glittering object, held it before her face, and </p><p>dabbed at her features with an article the </p><p>size and shape of a small apple. </p><p> “Powderin’ her face, poor li’l thing,”</p><p>commented Johnny. “I’ll bet her eyes are </p><p>some swole.” </p><p> The back door of the saloon opened. Slay</p><p>stood in the doorway. </p><p> “Lotta! Lotta!” he called.</p><p> “Here I am,” she replied, almost at his</p><p>elbow. “There’s no need to yell your head </p><p>off.”</p><p> “Didn’t see you,” he said crossly. “Come</p><p>in here quick. What’s the matter with </p><p>you? Why did you leave the wheel?” </p><p> “Because I felt like it!” she flung back,</p><p>smoothing a perfect eyebrow with the ball </p><p>of her thumb. </p><p> “Oh, I see. Suppose you come in then—</p><p>if you feel like it.” </p><p> “When I feel like it, I will.”</p><p> She powdered her nose again with mad-</p><p>dening deliberation. </p><p> “Come in here at once!” The command</p><p>lost most of its force because Slay pettishly </p><p>stamped his foot. </p><p> “Of course, you frighten me to death</p><p>when you do that,” she observed sweetly. </p><p>“Why don’t you drag me in by the hair?” </p><p>“Are you coming in?” </p><p> “I meant to, but since you’ve been so</p><p>pleasant, I think I’ll go home.” </p><p> Slay stepped back and slammed shut the</p><p>door. Mrs. Wallace returned mirror and </p><p>powder-puff to their hiding-place, blew a </p><p>kiss at the closed door, and walked slowly </p><p>’round the corner of the building. </p><p> “Shore got a mind of her own, that one,”</p><p>remarked Johnny. “Maybe she ain’t such </p><p>a poor li’l tiling after all.” </p><p> Pondering the unexpectedness of woman,</p><p>Johnny cautiously diagonaled across the </p><p>open ground to where, beyond the outer- </p><p>most shack, Main Street became a trail. </p><p>Here he turned townward and, walking lei- </p><p>surely, came to the Broken Dollar, pushed </p><p>open the door, and entered. </p><p> The long wide barroom was filled with</p><p>tobacco-smoke and customers. The to- </p><p>bacco-smoke hung in layers in the atmos- </p><p>phere. The customers hung in suspense </p><p>upon the turn of the cards and the caprice </p><p>of a tiny ball dancing within a sunken wheel </p><p>of many pockets. </p><p> Johnny did not pause at the door. He</p><p>walked without haste between the tables to </p><p>the bar at the other end of the room. There</p><p>were only three men standing at the bar. </p><p>One was the hard-faced Tom Keen, he of </p><p>the two guns, Ganev of the dyed mustache, </p><p>and a sharp-featured citizen known as Spill </p><p>Harper. These three turned and surveyed </p><p>him as he approached. Johnny gave them </p><p>stare for stare, fronted up to the bar, rang </p><p>down a quarter and called for whisky. The </p><p>bartender shoved forward a bottle and a </p><p>glass. Johnny poured out a scant two fin- </p><p>gers, cupped his left hand ’round the glass, </p><p>and leaned sidewise against the bar. </p><p> His attitude was lazy and his demeanor</p><p>careless, but his half-shut sardonic eyes </p><p>missed no detail of what was passing under </p><p>the hanging lamps in that big room. He </p><p>perceived that fully half the men in the place </p><p>were neglecting their play to watch him. </p><p>Some of them nudged each other and whis- </p><p>pered among themselves, but when his eyes </p><p>126 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>fell upon these they ceased nudging and </p><p>whispering and affected an air of extreme </p><p>unconcern. </p><p> As Johnny’s gaze fell upon the roulette</p><p>table he smiled slightly. He understood </p><p>Slay’s anger at Mrs. Wallace’s defection. </p><p>Harry Slay was behind the table now, and </p><p>the patronage was slim. With his sister to </p><p>spin the wheel roulette would have been </p><p>the most popular game in the room. </p><p> The gambler’s face as he dropped the ball</p><p>and worked the lever was wooden. He paid </p><p>and took in bets without once lifting his eyes </p><p>above the level of the table. Abruptly he </p><p>turned to a friend. </p><p> “Spin her, will you, Bill?” he asked. “I</p><p>have a little matter of business to </p><p>arrange.” </p><p> “Shore,” replied friend Bill, and Slay</p><p>stepped out from behind the table and </p><p>walked straight toward Johnny Ramsay </p><p>standing at the door. </p><p> Johnny had not been expecting any such</p><p>sudden move as this, but he was in readi- </p><p>iness. The heel of his right hand just </p><p>touched the butt of his gun. Slay’s hands </p><p>were swinging at his sides, but this meant </p><p>nothing. Johnny had seen Slay throw </p><p>down once before. </p><p> As Slay approached Johnny the room,</p><p>following the hasty shuffling of folk intent </p><p>on leaving the zone of fire, became as still as </p><p>midnight in a church. Johnny wondered </p><p>where Slay’s bullet would make its little </p><p>hole. He himself intended to put as many </p><p>pieces of lead as he could into Slay’s abdo- </p><p>men. Johnny had killed three men since </p><p>beginning to punch cows for a living. But </p><p>he had killed them in an impersonal way, </p><p>that is, at long range, with a rifle. He had </p><p>borne^no special animosity against these </p><p>men. He had shot them simply as a mat- </p><p>ter of course. They had been rustlers, out- </p><p>laws of the range, wolves to be destroyed </p><p>on sight. And he had not seen them die. </p><p> But here was a man he must shoot at</p><p>close range with a six-shooter. How would </p><p>it feel to perforate an enemy and watch him</p><p>pass out under one’s very eyes. It sud- </p><p>denly struck him that he himself would in </p><p>all likelihood be too dead to observe with </p><p>any thoroughness the demise of another. </p><p>The idea tickled his sense of humor, and he </p><p>chuckled audibly. </p><p> Not ten feet away Slay halted, his hands</p><p>held well away from his sides. </p><p> “Looking for me?” Slay asked, his pale</p><p>slanting eyes meeting Johnny’s fixed gray </p><p>stare. </p><p> “I never hunt trouble,” replied Johnny.</p><p> “Any hard feelings?”</p><p> “Never use ’em.”</p><p> “Have a drink?”</p><p> “Shore.”</p><p> The bartender made ludicrous haste to</p><p>serve the boss and Johnny. Eye to eye the </p><p>two men drank off their liquor. Johnny, as </p><p>etiquette required, called for another round. </p><p>They drank again. Then Slay nodded to </p><p>Johnny, mentioned that he would see him </p><p>later, and went back to his roulette table. </p><p>The incident was closed, and the spectators </p><p>resumed their pursuit of pleasure with noisy </p><p>avidity. </p><p> Johnny, standing alone at the bar—Tom</p><p>Keen, Ganey and Spill Harper had gone </p><p>elsewhere—sought to probe the true inward- </p><p>ness of the gambler’s motive in seeking peace. </p><p> “Trying to make me believe he’s willin’</p><p>to be friendly,” he reflected. “But he shore </p><p>is a bigger man than I took him to be, cornin’ </p><p>right out an’ facin’ it thisaway. Nerve an’ </p><p>slickness—he’s got ’em both. An’ yet not </p><p>ten minutes ago he stamped his foot at his </p><p>sister, which is shore one kid’s trick.” </p><p>CHAPTER X </p><p>THE LIGHT THAT LIES </p><p>*	I 'HE following afternoon Johnny, en-</p><p>sconced on the Burr doorsill, saw </p><p>Slay and his sister coming up the street. </p><p>Slay, frock-coated in spite of the heat, was </p><p>leading a saddled horse, and Mrs. Wallace,</p><p>radiant in gray and old-rose, held a parasol </p><p>between her complexion and the sun. She </p><p>was talking animatedly to her brother. </p><p> “Here come some friends o’ yores,”</p><p>Johnny announced, tapping the back of the </p><p>chair on which Dorothy sat darning re- </p><p>ligiously. </p><p> “Who’s with Harry?” she asked calmly.</p><p> “Yuh knowed he was cornin’!” he accused.</p><p> “Why, of course,” she told him with a</p><p>quick sidewise glance. “We’re going riding </p><p>today.” </p><p> “So that’s why yuh’ve got yore boots on.”</p><p>Johnny was not in the least pleased, and his </p><p>tone showed it. </p><p> “My dear man, what would you have me</p><p>wear?” </p><p> “I don’t rnean yore boots. I mean yuh</p><p>might ’a’ told me.” </p><p>Hidden Trails </p><p>127 </p><p> “What?” she teased.</p><p> Johnny glared his displeasure at her</p><p>levity. Dorothy smiled. </p><p> “What does it matter about me?” in-</p><p>quired J ohnny bitterly. “I was only spend- </p><p>in’ the afternoon. I’d like to know why </p><p>yuh couldn’t ’a’ gone ridin’ with me, </p><p>Dorothy.” </p><p> “ ‘You never asked me, sir, she said.’</p><p>There, there, Johnny, you’ll rum your per- </p><p>fectly good features if you persist in frown- </p><p>ing that way. Who’s with Harry?” </p><p> “His sister.” Glumly.</p><p> “She is?” Dorothy’s dark eyes sparkled.</p><p> She bit off a thread with a vicious click of</p><p>white teeth. The color in her cheeks </p><p>deepened. Johnny was totally oblivious </p><p>to these manifestations of feminine interest. </p><p>He was too busy feeling abused. </p><p> The Slay tribe arrived. The gambler and</p><p>Johnny were gravely restrained in their </p><p>greeting. Not so the ladies. They kissed </p><p>each other with great fervor and “My dear” </p><p>before and after, and bestowed compliments </p><p>with a buttery lavishness. </p><p> The gambler introduced Johnny to Mrs.</p><p>Wallace, and asked Dorothy if she was </p><p>ready. </p><p> “Right away,” she told him, reaching in-</p><p>side the doorway for her quirt. “Be with </p><p>you in three shakes. You go on and saddle </p><p>up.” </p><p> Slay lifted his hat to his sister and Johnny</p><p>and departed for the corral. Dorothy fol- </p><p>lowed a moment later, after strictly enjoin- </p><p>ing Mrs. Wallace and Johnny to make </p><p>themselves at home till she returned. </p><p>Johnny trailed Dorothy with sulky eyes. </p><p>He hated Slay. W'hat right had the man </p><p>to take Dorothy riding? </p><p> “Won’t you?” Mrs. Wallace was saying.</p><p> “Won’t I what?” He stared at her</p><p>without friendliness.</p><p> “Won’t you talk to me? I’ve already</p><p>asked you three times.” </p><p> She had closed her parasol and now stood</p><p>with her hands clasped over the round </p><p>handle. There was a talented patch of </p><p>court-plaster on her left cheek-bone. Her </p><p>lips were slightly parted and her eyes were </p><p>warmly pleading. She was very lovely, </p><p>and she wanted him to talk to her. W'hat </p><p>small hands she had. The prospect of a </p><p>long afternoon, full of empty hours and </p><p>shimmering heat, decided Johnny. </p><p> “Ma’am, I’d shore admire to talk to yuh,”</p><p>he declared solemnly. </p><p> “It’s dear of you to say that,” she said.</p><p>“I know you don’t mean it, but I really </p><p>would like to make up to you for Dorothy’s </p><p>absence if—if I could and you’d let me.” </p><p>This was spreading the jam rather thick- </p><p>ly, but man is an obtuse animal. Johnny </p><p>grinned. </p><p> “I guess now you an’ I’d oughta get along</p><p>together real well,” was his hearty endorse- </p><p>ment. </p><p> Mrs. Wallace smiled, and a fugitive</p><p>dimple showed for an instant in her right </p><p>cheek. </p><p> “Suppose we go over to my house,” she</p><p>suggested. “It’s near the river, and there’s </p><p>almost always some breeze.” </p><p> “That shore listens well,” said Johnny.</p><p>“Let’s go.” </p><p> They went. Half Main Street saw them</p><p>go, and the whole town knew it ten minutes </p><p>later. </p><p> “Just watch her grin at him!” urged Mrs.</p><p>Mace, flattening a snubby nose against a </p><p>window-pane in her kitchen. </p><p> “That’s the first time I ever seen her out</p><p>walkin’ with a man,” declared Mrs. Rags- </p><p>dale. “Move over, dear. I can’t see a </p><p>thing. She’s wearin’ the gray again, ain’t </p><p>she? Makes her look hump-shouldered, </p><p>don’t it?” </p><p> “Shore does, an’ that rose-color ain’t fit</p><p>for a sallow thing like her to wear. She</p><p>hasn’t color enough. Look! Look! See </p><p>her walk close to him. The brazen </p><p>creature!” </p><p> “I always knew she was a hussy for all her</p><p>quiet ways. The cat!” </p><p> “Oh, she’s a sly minx. They’re the ones,</p><p>Ella. The putty-faced things who act as </p><p>if butter wouldn’t melt in their mouths, </p><p>they’re the ones to look out for.” </p><p> “She’s skinny as a rail,” contributed Mrs.</p><p>Ragsdale, holding resolutely to the main </p><p>road. “I’ll bet her legs ain’t thicker’n </p><p>matches.” </p><p> “Whose legs ain’t thicker’n matches?”</p><p>asked Jim Mace, entering at the moment. </p><p> “None of your business,” his wife told</p><p>him. “Didja see that widow woman an’ </p><p>Johnny Ramsay?” </p><p> “Y’betcha. Johnny always was a lucky</p><p>jigger.” </p><p> “Oh, is that so? Well, if you think so,</p><p>Jim Mace, I’ll just thank you to keep such </p><p>opinions to yoreself, an’ don’t you forget it </p><p>neither! C’mon, Ella, let’s go in the side </p><p>room. I believe she’s takin’ him home, an’ </p><p>128 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>if they sit on the porch we can watch ’em </p><p>fine.” </p><p> But Mrs. Wallace and Johnny did not sit</p><p>on the porch. The fascinating widow knew </p><p>all about a small town, and she took her </p><p>guest into the house. The puncher’s eyes </p><p>widened at sight of the sitting-room and its </p><p>appointments. There were several water- </p><p>colors and three small paintings on the walls. </p><p>Above the door the mounted head of a </p><p>buffalo bull faced a splendid Sioux war- </p><p>bonnet hanging on the opposite wall. </p><p>Chairs, broad and deep, a wide table, a long </p><p>sofa covered with fat pillows, a book-case </p><p>full of books, and a thick, soft carpet com- </p><p>pleted the picture. Even the sitting-room </p><p>at the Bar-S was not so fine as this </p><p>one. Johnny moved cautiously. Spurs are </p><p>scratchy things. </p><p> Mrs. Wallace excused herself and van-</p><p>ished through a doorway hung with a pair </p><p>of striped Zuni blankets. Johnny slid </p><p>across the carpet to the nearest chair. He </p><p>sat, having care to his spin's, and absent- </p><p>mindedly pulled out the makings. He re- </p><p>membered his manners as he was on the </p><p>point of striking a match and disgustedly </p><p>shot the white roll out of the window. He </p><p>began to wish he hadn’t come. It was no </p><p>fun sitting alone this way. Where was Mrs. </p><p>Wallace anyway? </p><p> At that moment she pushed aside the</p><p>Zuni blankets and came toward him, </p><p>smiling delightfully. She was carrying a </p><p>small tray. There were two tall glasses and </p><p>a square bottle on that tray. Times im- </p><p>mediately began to improve. Johnny’s </p><p>somber eye brightened. </p><p> “You may not like this,” she said, hold-</p><p>ing out the tray. “It’s something I invent- </p><p>ed myself. I call it Texas Pete.” </p><p> Texas Pete was of a light brown color and</p><p>both glasses were full of him. Johnny’s </p><p>fingers wrapped themselves ’round one of </p><p>the glasses. Mrs. Wallace took the other, </p><p>set the tray on the table, and sat down on </p><p>the sofa. She tucked one leg under her, </p><p>and swung the other child-fashion. Rais- </p><p>ing the glass to her lips, she looked at </p><p>Johnny across the rim and sipped slowly.</p><p> Johnny did not sip slowly. He was not</p><p>accustomed to drinking that way. He </p><p>lowered the half-emptied glass to the arm </p><p>of the chair and grinned cheerfully. </p><p> “Reg’lar shore ’nough drink,” he assured</p><p>her. “What’s in it?” </p><p> She told him. He stared aghast at the</p><p>tale of ingredients, and looked down at his </p><p>glass with sudden respect. </p><p> “One more o’ this here Texas gent an’</p><p>I’d shore push the bridge over,” said he. </p><p>“No, ma’am, no more. I’ll just finish this </p><p>an’ call it a day.” </p><p> “You’re not going yet!” she exclaimed</p><p>piteously. “Oh, you mustn’t! I’ll be so </p><p>lonely if you do.” </p><p> Once more the jam and the trowel. Such</p><p>flattery would have held Johnny even if he </p><p>had intended going, which he hadn’t. </p><p> “I wasn’t thinkin’ o’ goin’,” he told her</p><p>with an ease born of Texas Pete and the </p><p>lady’s blandishments. “Can I smoke?” </p><p>“Surely. Try one of mine.” </p><p> He did, and she taught him how two ciga-</p><p>rets may be simultaneously lit by the one </p><p>match. Besides being economical this </p><p>method of starting a smoke has a charm all </p><p>its own. Of course it necessitated Johnny’s </p><p>moving to the sofa. He did not return to </p><p>the chair. With every passing minute he </p><p>was feeling more at home. He almost for- </p><p>got that the lady’s brother was his enemy. </p><p>He watched her leaning back among the </p><p>puffy cushions. Her eyes were deep as </p><p>wells. Then it suddenly struck him that </p><p>for the last hour he had been doing most of </p><p>the talking. She had asked questions, </p><p>apparently casual questions, but they re- </p><p>quired lengthy answers. </p><p> “Well,” he said with a slight laugh, “I’m</p><p>shore warmed up to-day. Bet I’ve talked </p><p>an arm off yuh.” </p><p> “Don’t stop,” she begged, in her earnest-</p><p>ness leaning forward and clasping her hands </p><p>’round her silken knee. “I’m enjoying it so. </p><p>I just love to hear how men do things.” </p><p> “Do yuh?”</p><p> “Of course. Tell me some more about</p><p>those Indians. Did they keep right • on </p><p>stealing horses?” </p><p> “Nobody keeps right on stealin’ hosses,</p><p>ma’am. He steals one hoss too many an’ </p><p>gets stretched. An’ them Injuns did an’ </p><p>they was.” </p><p> “I suppose it always turns out that way,”</p><p>said she softly. </p><p> “Yes’m, an’ it’s always that one hoss too</p><p>many does it,” he moralized. “If a gent </p><p>would only be satisfied. But ‘No,’ he says, </p><p>‘when it comes to stealin’ hosses I’m the </p><p>original Solomon forty ways from the Jack,’ </p><p>an’ out he prances, foolish an’ certain, an’ </p><p>gloms on to that extra cayuse. It’s the </p><p>same in everythin’ else thataway, ma’am— </p><p>Hidden Trails </p><p>129 </p><p>killin’, hold-ups, an’ all. They ain’t no </p><p>difference.” </p><p> “And yet nothing seems to stop the road-</p><p>agents in this county.” She was looking up </p><p>into his face with brilliant eyes. </p><p> “No,” he admitted, “they seem to be</p><p>playin’ in right good luck. But you wait. </p><p>Maybe yuh’ll have to wait a year or two, </p><p>maybe longer, but you wait. They’ll be </p><p>got, ma’am.” </p><p> “I’m sure I hope so,” she declared, lean-</p><p>ing back and patting her hair with long, </p><p>slim fingers. “I had some silk for a gown </p><p>coming all the way from Chicago, and the </p><p>stage was stopped that trip, and it was </p><p>raining, and they ripped open the package </p><p>and left it there in the mud. I could have </p><p>wept when the agent told me. My pretty </p><p>yellow silk ruined! I hope they do catch </p><p>them.” </p><p> “That’s shore too bad about yore dress,”</p><p>he sympathized. “Likely them bandits </p><p>didn’t know what it was, or they wouldn’t </p><p>’a’ touched it.” </p><p>HE WAS watching a tiny pulse on </p><p>the side of her round throat. He </p><p>hadn’t noticed it before. The little </p><p>telltale was throbbing steadily and fast. </p><p>Yet the color in her cheeks had not altered </p><p>a shade. It was her own color, too. He </p><p>had made sure of that at the cigaret-lighting. </p><p> “I wish you were the sheriff or a deputy</p><p>or something,” aud she. </p><p> “Me? Why?”</p><p> “Because I believ.e you could catch them.</p><p>I believe you could do more than this </p><p>idiotic sheriff.” </p><p> “He’s doin’ his best, ma’am. Ain’t yuh</p><p>takin’ the loss o’ that dress mighty hard?” </p><p>“Oh, it isn’t the dress. It’s the idea of </p><p>these bandits being able to do what they </p><p>please. They make a perfect joke of the </p><p>sheriff and his men. Oh, if I were a man, </p><p>I’d get out and do something! I’d give </p><p>these road-agents a run for their money. </p><p>You said yourself there’s always one horse</p><p>too many. I’d make the Fane job that one </p><p>horse. There are two thousand dollars </p><p>apiece offered for those bandits. Did you </p><p>know that?” </p><p> “I’d heard.” He nodded a grave head.</p><p>“It would certainly be worth almost any </p><p>man’s while. I should think you’d try it </p><p>out.” The brilliant eyes had narrowed ever </p><p>so slightly, and the little pulse was beating </p><p>quite rapidly now. </p><p>9 </p><p> “I ain’t a fool,” he said seriously. “I</p><p>never hunt trouble, not never. An’ two </p><p>thousand dollars ain’t enough for me to bet </p><p>my life against nohow. S’pose now I lose </p><p>the life. What good’s two thousand wheels </p><p>to me? No sirree, you hear me talkin’, if </p><p>anybody wants to hunt road-agents, let ’em. </p><p>I wouldn’t think o’ spoilin’ their fun. I got </p><p>me a good job at the Flyin’-M, an’ I aim to </p><p>keep it, y’betcha.” </p><p> “What are you doing in town then?”</p><p> “Oh, I ain’t exactly started in yet,” the</p><p>answer came pat. “Yuh see, I figure to </p><p>spend all my money first. Maybe by the </p><p>first o’ next week I’ll go to huntin’ Scotty’s </p><p>strays.” </p><p> “Scotty Mackenzie must be an easy-go-</p><p>ing employer to let you begin work with a </p><p>vacation.” </p><p> “Men are scarce.” This was true. “I</p><p>told him I wouldn’t ride for him less’n </p><p>I could have these few days off. Shucks, I </p><p>don’t draw wages till I start, so what’s the </p><p>differ to Scotty? Scotty he said he wished </p><p>I was twins.” </p><p> “Twins?”</p><p> “Shore, so’s he could hire the other. He</p><p>wants another man. They’s a whole heap </p><p>o’ country to cover—more’n one stray man </p><p>can swing. I tell yuh what, ma’am, yuh </p><p>ride when the Flyin’-M hires yuh.” </p><p> Was the little pulse beating less strongly</p><p>now? He thought it was. Mrs. Wallace </p><p>turned her eyes away and inspected the </p><p>pink tips of her pretty fingers. </p><p> “Do you know,” she remarked suddenly,</p><p>“I like you.” </p><p> “That’s—that’s fine,” said he lamely, for</p><p>he was somewhat taken aback. </p><p> “Yes,” she continued, “you tell funny</p><p>stories, and you aren’t fresh. I—I like it. </p><p>There’s not much for a woman to do in this </p><p>town. Of course, I’m busy here in the </p><p>mornings, and the Broken Dollar fills in the </p><p>evenings, but the afternoons are awfully </p><p>long when there’s no one to play with. I’m </p><p>pretty lonely sometimes.” </p><p> “That’s shore a fright, ma’am.” He did</p><p>not know what else to say. </p><p> “Will you come to see me sometimes?”</p><p>She gave him another of her straight looks. </p><p> “I’d admire to,” he declared, and meant</p><p>it, too. </p><p> And in a little while he said good-by and</p><p>walked away up Main Street. </p><p> “Is she, or ain’t she?” he asked himself.</p><p>“-, I shore dunno. One thing, she’s </p><p>130 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>a shore ’nough lady, even if she did show me </p><p>that new way o’ lightin’ a cigaret. An’ she </p><p>likes me ’cause I don’t get fresh, huh? I’d </p><p>like to see myself. Bet she’d smack my face </p><p>good if I did.” </p><p> He turned in at Ragsdale’s. The store-</p><p>keeper was alone in the place and greeted </p><p>him with a portentous wink. </p><p> “I ain’t got no sofys nor goose-hair pillers</p><p>nor stuffed-up chairs to offer yuh,” Soapy </p><p>observed, “but yuh can sit on the counter </p><p>if yo’re a good boy.”	#</p><p>Johnny stared coolly at the storekeeper. </p><p>“Yuh seem to know a lot,” he drawled. </p><p>Ragsdale put his head on one side and </p><p>looked Johnny up and down. Then he </p><p>scratched his ear. </p><p> “Nobody ever called you good-lookin’,</p><p>did they, Johnny?” asked Soapy anxiously. </p><p> “What’n -,” Johnny began indig-</p><p>nantly. </p><p> “Well, I was wonderin’,” explained his</p><p>friend. “Yuh know, Johnny, my eyes are </p><p>good. I can always see where I’m lookin’, </p><p>an’ I never seen nothin’ beautiful about yuh, </p><p>’ceptin’ the way yuh handle a rifle. But </p><p>she ain’t seen yuh handle a rifle.” </p><p> He paused in evident perplexity and</p><p>scratched the other ear. </p><p> “It’s that butter yuh don’t sell,” re-</p><p>marked Johnny. “She’s gone to yore head. </p><p>I don’t wonder neither. The smell’s thick </p><p>enough to cut. Why dontcha open an- </p><p>other window?” </p><p> “It ain’t the butter,” denied Soapy.</p><p>“It’s yore looks, an’ you ain’t got none, so </p><p>that ain’t possible. She’s magic, that’s </p><p>what she is, magic. No offense meant, an’ </p><p>I know it ain’t none o’ my business, but I’m </p><p>a married man an’ maybe I can use the in- </p><p>formation. Howdja do it? Be a good </p><p>feller an’ tell.” </p><p> “How’d I do what?”</p><p> “Howdja get to go see Mis’ Wallace?”</p><p> “What’s unusual in that?”</p><p> “Nothin’, only yore the first gent ever</p><p>went to her home to see her. An’ walkin’ </p><p>up with her, too. That’s why I say it’s </p><p>magic.” </p><p> “Don’t nobody ever go see her?”</p><p>“Plenty’d like to, but she won’t have ’em. </p><p>Not that she’s standoffish. No sirree, it’s </p><p>‘Good mornin’ ’ with her an’ ‘H’are yuh, </p><p>ma’am?’ an’ she smiles an’ bows pleasant </p><p>as yuh please an’ twice as pretty. An’ </p><p>that’s all. She’ll take yore money or pay </p><p>bets at the wheel with a word for all the boys. </p><p>But it’s always ‘Not tonight, I’m sorry,’ or </p><p>‘Some other time,’ when a gent only wants </p><p>to walk home with her. An’ she does it all </p><p>without hurtin’ a feller’s feelin’s. So this </p><p>here is yore lucky day, Johnny. I’ll bet </p><p>if you was to go down to the Broken Dollar </p><p>yuh’d break the bank.” </p><p> The only man she had ever allowed to</p><p>call. And she had asked him to call again. </p><p>What was her purpose? There was one. </p><p>She was not the woman to break her custom </p><p>for a mere whim. Johnny wore his best </p><p>poker face, but his eye was sardonic. </p><p> “For a storekeeper, Soapy, yo’re one wise</p><p>Abraham,” said Johnny Ramsay, and </p><p>changed the subject with a request for rifle </p><p>cartridges, caliber 40-65. </p><p> But Soapy Ragsdale did not stock the</p><p>odd calibers. Johnny departed for the </p><p>Golden Rule. Again he was out of luck— </p><p>40-65’s were apparently a dead card in </p><p>Paradise Bend. Johny reflected that there </p><p>were other towns and other stores and </p><p>took heart of hope. </p><p> That evening Johnny went to see Dorothy</p><p>Burr. Her greeting was casual—elaborate- </p><p>ly so. There was a five-pound box of candy </p><p>on the table. </p><p> “Have some,” invited Dorothy.</p><p> Johnny thought he wouldn’t eat any</p><p>candy, thank you just the same. A tooth </p><p>had been troubling him. He feared to ex- </p><p>cite the little brute. Dorothy smiled </p><p>oddly. </p><p> “You weren’t here when I got back,” she</p><p>remarked, the smile becoming a trifle </p><p>fixed. </p><p> “Why no, I wasn’t,” confessed Johnny.</p><p>“I was some’ers else.” </p><p> “Isn’t Lotta a dear?” The tone was in-</p><p>genuous, but the smile was now quite </p><p>fixed. </p><p> “Mis’ Wallace? Shore, she’s all that.</p><p>Just as folksy as yuh please. Nothin’ </p><p>stuck-up about her.” </p><p> “I heard she took you home with her.”</p><p> “I guess she thought I was lonesome.”</p><p>“All the same, it was rather a conspicu- </p><p>ous thing to do, I think. She never has </p><p>any one to call.” </p><p> “So I heard.” Dryly.</p><p> Dorothy stared at Johnny open-mouthed.</p><p>“Well,” she burst out, “of all the smug, </p><p>conceited men you’re the smuggest and </p><p>conceitedest!” </p><p> Then she laughed. But the laughter did</p><p>not ring true. </p><p>Hidden Trails </p><p>131 </p><p>CHAPTER XI </p><p>VERY STRAY MEN </p><p>“TLTE SHORE wanted me stretched— </p><p> *	bad,” conceded Johnny.</p><p> “W’at you t’ink—dees Slay she was one</p><p>of dem bushw’ackair?” inquired Laguerre, </p><p>his hard black eyes glittering. </p><p> “He wasn’t one of ’em,” Johnny said</p><p>decidedly. </p><p> “How you know?”</p><p> The half-breed was now wholly the In-</p><p>dian. One saw back of those hard eyes the </p><p>long, long line of relentless hunters of man. </p><p> “In the first place the hosses they rode</p><p>was two chestnuts and a blacktail dun. His </p><p>hoss was a big black. He’s got several— </p><p>two grays an’ a red-’n’-white pinto, too.” </p><p>“Huh,” grunted Laguerre. “I weel look </p><p>at de face o’ dees man. I have de feelin’— </p><p>but I weel firs’ look at hees face, me. How </p><p>far now to de plass w’ere dey keel 01’ Man </p><p>Fane un Beel Homan?” </p><p> “About two mile.”</p><p> “Lemme see dat watch, Johnnee.”</p><p> Johnny handed his friend the shattered</p><p>watch that had once been Homan’s. </p><p> “Dees ees deir firs’ meestak,” observed</p><p>Laguerre. “Bimeby dey mak anudder un </p><p>anudder, un den we catch dem, by gar. </p><p>De meestak, de meestak, alway de meestak. </p><p>I have been de scout, I have leeve wit’ </p><p>Enjun, un I know, me.” </p><p> So, holding converse on the ways of</p><p>malefactors, red and white, they came to </p><p>the scene of the murders and their attendant </p><p>robbery. Three parts eaten by wolves, an </p><p>offense to eye and nostril, Fane’s dead </p><p>horse lay by the side of the road. Breath- </p><p>ing through their mouths, the two men </p><p>forced their mounts up the side of the spur </p><p>to the pocket among the pines where the </p><p>road-agents had tied their horses.</p><p> The sign was more than seventy-two</p><p>hours old, and it had been partly oblitera- </p><p>ted by the feet of Scotty and the investiga- </p><p>ting committee, yet Laguerre looked quite </p><p>pleased. </p><p> “Dey tie two pony to dat pine,” said</p><p>he. “She ees de same pine un dem cayuse </p><p>nevair move. One of dem'stand on t’ree </p><p>leg un point de off toe. See how deep ees </p><p>de mark o’ dat toe. She was stand dere </p><p>long tam un was not move, dat cayuse. </p><p>Dere was not de skeetair to mak dem move </p><p>mabbeso. Dey was de pony wit’ de good </p><p>nature lak de lamb. Dey was tie wit’ de </p><p>rein. Dey was not even gnaw de bark. </p><p> “But look dere. Look w’ere de odder</p><p>hoss was tie. She was move ’roun’ de tree </p><p>—geet all tangle’ up. She was switch de </p><p>tail—see dem hair on de quakin’ asp. Un </p><p>dem hair ees black. She was de dun hoss. </p><p>She bite de bark. She pull back on de </p><p>rope. How I know dat? Well, den, I </p><p>have de eye, me, un I see w’ere leetle t’read </p><p>o’ de rope ees steeck een de bark. Dey </p><p>ees steeck een hard, un dat ees how I know </p><p>de hoss pull back. </p><p> “Dat dun was kick, too. See de mark</p><p>o’ hees shoe on dat pine. Here w’ere hees </p><p>fore feet stan’. Long way ’tween dem two </p><p>mark. She wras de longleg hoss, dat dun </p><p>cayuse.

Gimme de match, </p><p>my frien’. No hurry goin’ to de Ben’ </p><p>now. I wan’ for geet dere aftair de sun </p><p>have set.” </p><p> “We’ve got somethin’ to go on,” re-</p><p>marked Johnny, when both cigarets were </p><p>burning well. </p><p> “We have got one ’ole lot for go on,”</p><p>softly corrected Laguerre. “We know dat </p><p>one dese men use de 40-65 Winchestair, two </p><p>pony ees de good-nature’ ches’nut un one </p><p>ees de long-leg blacktail dun w’at enjoy </p><p>for bite de tree un keeck un pull back un </p><p>have for be tie wit’ de rope. Dat blacktail </p><p>dun, I tell you, my frien’, she ees anud- </p><p>der meestak. Dere can not be many pony </p><p>lak dees hoss. No, dere can not. You</p><p>will see.” </p><p> Laguerre inhaled with complacency. He</p><p>stretched his arms lazily and blew smoke </p><p>through his nostrils and smiled a slow smile </p><p>and licked his lips cat-fashion. </p><p> Johnny had given his friend a circum-</p><p>stantial account of events at the Bend. </p><p>Which account, it must be said, lacked </p><p>completeness in that Johnny neglected to </p><p>mention Mrs. Lotta Wallace, her actions, </p><p>and his call upon her. Somehow he did </p><p>not feel it was necessary. Why drag her </p><p>in? </p><p> At dusk Johnny and Laguerre separated,</p><p>the latter to ride the trail in to the Bend, </p><p>the former to cross the Yellow Medicine, </p><p>and, ever keeping that stream on his left </p><p>hand, skirt the sprawling length of Crow </p><p>Mountain, strike the Flying-M trail at </p><p>132 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Wagon Slue, and arrive in town from the </p><p>north. </p><p> Between eleven and twelve Johnny dis-</p><p>mounted at the hitching-rail of the Three </p><p>Card. He was to meet Laguerre at the </p><p>Three Card. But the half-^reed was not </p><p>in the saloon, nor was he at the Jacks Up, </p><p>nor at Soapy Ragsdale’s. Buster was in </p><p>charge of the store, but he didn’t know </p><p>where pop was. Guessed he must be ’round </p><p>some’ers. Johnny guessed so too and, on </p><p>his way to the Broken Dollar, looked in </p><p>at the Golden Rule. Cal Mason was there </p><p>buying tobacco, and Dan Smith, the mar- </p><p>shal, was picking out a shirt, a beautiful </p><p>thing of savage orange, thickly besprinkled </p><p>with a chaste design of purple horseshoes. </p><p> Cal Mason greeted Johnny with a grave</p><p>“H’are yuh?” behind which lurked the </p><p>smile of friendship, but Dan Smith did not </p><p>go beyond a stiff nod. Johnny, his sar- </p><p>donic eye fixed on the marshal’s ultra- </p><p>bilious choice, leaned against the counter. </p><p> “Now, that’s what I call a shirt,” he</p><p>observed cheerfully. </p><p> “I dunno as yuh got any license to call</p><p>it anythin’,” said the liverish Dan Smith. </p><p> “I was just admirin’ it, Marshal,” in-</p><p>sisted Johnny. “No offense, but yuh’ll </p><p>shore be right up in style. Back East they </p><p>sell shirts like this here so fast that the </p><p>factories all have to work overtime. Yessir, </p><p>shore do. An’ why, ’cause all the laundry- </p><p>men buy ’em. No soap-wrastlin’ Chink </p><p>o’ the lot thinks he can go out walkin’ </p><p>Sunday afternoons less’n he’s inside one o’ </p><p>these shirts. Funny, ain’t it?” </p><p> Johnny’s eyes were no longer sardonic.</p><p>They were calm and sweetly innocent as </p><p>they gazed into the face of the marshal. </p><p>The latter, very angry, could have slain </p><p>him willingly. But there are times when </p><p>to take offense means to make oneself </p><p>ridiculous. Dan Smith did not wish to </p><p>appear ridiculous. He compromised by </p><p>according Johnny no further attention and </p><p>taking the shirt. </p><p> Johnny, allowing him thirty seconds’</p><p>handicap, followed. He was in time to see </p><p>the marshal pause a hundred feet away, </p><p>swing his arm, and hurl something in be- </p><p>tween two houses. After which the mar- </p><p>shal went into the Jacks Up Saloon. </p><p> Johnny hurried to where the marshal had</p><p>stood and dived into the space between the </p><p>two houses. Groping purposefully in the </p><p>darkness, his fingers encountered a paper- </p><p>wrapped parcel. He swept it up and re- </p><p>turned to the street. In the light from </p><p>an open window he tore off a corner of the </p><p>wrapping. A vivid purple horseshoe backed </p><p>by savage orange stared him out of coun- </p><p>tenance. </p><p> The marshal, drinking with friends at the</p><p>Jacks Up bar, felt a touch on his shoulder. </p><p>He turned to behold the too-familiar fea- </p><p>tures of Johnny Ramsay. The puncher </p><p>laid a parcel on the bar, a parcel from whose </p><p>torn wrapper protruded the tail of Dan </p><p>Smith’s recent purchase. </p><p> “Yore shirt,” Johnny announced dis-</p><p>tinctly. “Yuh dropped it—in the street.” </p><p> The pause between the two halves of the</p><p>explanatory sentence was obvious. The </p><p>marshal knew that he was being maliciously </p><p>badgered, and he knew that Johnny knew </p><p>that he knew. But again this was one of </p><p>those times. Besides, Cal Mason, ex- </p><p>pectantly solemn, was watching from the </p><p>doorway. The marshal mumbled his </p><p>thanks, tucked in the dangling shirt-tail, </p><p>and stuck the package under his arm. </p><p>Johnny went out into the street. There </p><p>the delighted Cal Mason fell into step at </p><p>his side. </p><p> “Yore style suits me,” averred Cal.</p><p>“Let’s licker.” </p><p> So they crossed the street to the Three</p><p>Card and said “How” twice. After which </p><p>ceremony Johnny drifted down to the </p><p>Broken Dollar and Cal went home to tell </p><p>his wife how Scotty Mackenzie’s stray man </p><p>had run a blazer on Dan Smith. </p><p> At the Broken Dollar Johnny found</p><p>Laguerre playing poker with the express- </p><p>agent, hard-faced Tom Keen, and one of </p><p>Slay’s dealers. Johnny smiled inwardly. </p><p>For the half-breed was skilful at cards, and</p><p>his skill was costing the others much money. </p><p>All the blue chips on the table were in front </p><p>of Laguerre, and a blue chip in the Broken </p><p>Dollar was standard at ten dollars. </p><p> Johnny, on his way to the bar, passed</p><p>the roulette table. Mrs. Wallace was be- </p><p>hind the wheel, and business was very brisk. </p><p>Leaning against the wall at her back stood </p><p>her brother. His hands were in his trousers </p><p>pockets and a long black cigar was clamped </p><p>between his jaws. He glanced at Johnny </p><p>with twinkling, merry eyes and nodded. </p><p>Mrs. Wallace did not see the puncher. She </p><p>was busy raking in several bets. </p><p> While Johnny was still eyeing his first</p><p>drink, in marched, to his intense disgust, </p><p>Hidden Trails </p><p>133 </p><p>Racey Dawson. Racey was not due for </p><p>two days, and here he was on the heels of </p><p>Telescope. Johnny yearned to tell Racey </p><p>what he thought of him. </p><p>AS RACEY came through the door- </p><p>way he slapped his side with a full </p><p>sweep of both arms. Dust flew </p><p>from him in a gray cloud. His face was </p><p>ashen with it. Grinning widely, he crossed </p><p>the floor straight to where Johnny stood </p><p>at the bar, and Johnny saw that there </p><p>was dust inside his ears and down his </p><p>neck. </p><p> “Thought you’d get away from me, huh?”</p><p>cried Racey, teetering on his heels in front </p><p>of Johnny. “Tried to give me the slip, </p><p>huh? Just ’cause I had a li’l business over </p><p>on the Two Deer an’ was maybe, now a </p><p>day late, yuh run off an’ left me.” </p><p> Racey in his teetering apparently lost his</p><p>balance and fell forward against the dis- </p><p>mayed Johnny, who foresaw the crumbling </p><p>of his plans under Racey’s blundering. But </p><p>Racey’s hand, flung out to save himself, </p><p>gripped Johnny’s arm, and Johnny felt that </p><p>member squeezed three times before Racey </p><p>regained his equilibrium. </p><p> “Aw, yuh’d oughta come sooner,” Johnny</p><p>said instantly. “Djuh think I got nothin’ </p><p>to do but wait for yuh while yo’re hellin’ </p><p>’round all over the country?” </p><p> Their voices were not pitched low, but</p><p>Laguerre, facing them at his table across </p><p>the room, gave no sign that he heard. </p><p> “Well, yuh might ’a’ waited,” grumbled</p><p>Racey. “Le’s irrigate.” </p><p> While they stood in silence, the bottle</p><p>between them, a man slouched in from the </p><p>street and halted inside the doorway. He </p><p>was a stocky citizen with a sandy mustache </p><p>and an aggressive chin. He pushed back </p><p>his hat and one perceived that his head </p><p>was curiously pinched-in at the temples. </p><p>This characteristic, combined as it was with </p><p>total absence of eyebrows, and a wall-eye, </p><p>did not make for attractiveness. The </p><p>stocky man surveyed the roomful with a </p><p>cold and fishy stare. His oblique gaze</p><p>passed over Johnny and Racey and appar- </p><p>ently fixed itself on a corner of the bar. </p><p>Still looking at the corner of the bar, </p><p>Wall-eye swaggered bow-leggedly up to </p><p>Racey Dawson and suggested drinks. He </p><p>likewise smiled amiably, revealing the lack </p><p>of two upper front teeth. </p><p> “This here’s my friend, Johnny Ram-</p><p>say,” said Racey, flicking a tactful thumb </p><p>at Johnny. “What might I call you?” </p><p>“Now I shore did forget to tell yuh my </p><p>name, didn’t I?” smiled the stranger, his </p><p>crooked eye missing Racey by four feet. </p><p>“Which she’s ‘Bale’ Harper. Barkeep, got </p><p>a lame arm? I’m waitin’ for a glass.” </p><p> The bartender hastily slid a bottle and</p><p>a glass across the bar. As the newcomer </p><p>tilted the bottle Johnny noticed that the </p><p>third finger of his right hand was cut off </p><p>at the second joint. Bale Harper downed </p><p>his liquor at a gulp, and instantly poured </p><p>out another glassful. Two or three fingers </p><p>were not for Harper. He filled his glass </p><p>a-brim and slopping over. </p><p> “Nothin’ like good measure,” said he</p><p>with a leer, and added with emphasis, </p><p>“that’s somethin’ I always aim to get.” </p><p>Johnny made no comment. He did not </p><p>like this Bale Harper. </p><p> “Got a brother ’round here some’ers,”</p><p>remarked Mr. Harper with his gap-toothed </p><p>grin. “Been lookin’ for him ever since I </p><p>drifted in. You ain’t seen him, have yuh, </p><p>Mister Ramsay—feller about my size he is, </p><p>sandy hair an’ face likewise, called Spill?” </p><p>“Ain’t seen him today,” answered the </p><p>puncher, shaking an indifferent head. “Yes’- </p><p>day he was ’round. Him an’ Tom Keen </p><p>was together. There’s Tom over there. </p><p>Maybe he’ll know.” </p><p> But Johnny’s hint did not bear fruit.</p><p>Bale Harper frowned in the general direc- </p><p>tion of Tom Keen and said he guessed he’d </p><p>wait and see Spill later. </p><p> “- good whisky,” he declared, and</p><p>had another. </p><p> “I’m tired,” announced Racey. “Guess</p><p>now I’ll give an imitation of a young feller </p><p>rollin’ in. How about the hotel, Johnny—</p><p>got a bed?” </p><p> “Shore. C’mon.”</p><p> They departed, despite strong urging to</p><p>the contrary by Bale Harper. But they </p><p>did not go to the hotel. For privacy in </p><p>conversation was impossible in that hos- </p><p>telry. The partitions were too thin and </p><p>there were many cracks. Hence it was </p><p>that Johnny and his friend, walking without </p><p>haste, slid silently between Soapy Rags- </p><p>dale’s house and his corral and felt their </p><p>cautious way in among Soapy Ragsdale’s </p><p>neatly corded stacks of Winter firewood. </p><p> “What’s up?” demanded Johnny, when</p><p>they were squatting on their heels between </p><p>two stacks. </p><p>134 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “-was Racey’s answer. “Lute</p><p>Holloway’s downed and Slim Berdan’s shot </p><p>through both legs an’ his shoulder. ” </p><p> “Is that why yuh-”</p><p> “You wait. Lemme tell it my own way,</p><p>will yuh?” </p><p> “Shore, but yore way is such a -</p><p>funny way, Racey. Y’ always travel ten </p><p>mile to go two.” </p><p> “Aw, shut up, I’m travelin’ straight now.</p><p>An’ speakin’ o’ travelin’! Say, if you’d </p><p>done the ridin’ I been doin’ these last three </p><p>days you’d cash, yuh hear me talkin’. My </p><p>hoss is down to a whisper an’ I don’t feel </p><p>like much more’n a short stutter myself. </p><p>Say-” </p><p> “There yuh go, a-whirlin’ that wide loop!</p><p>I’m shore sorry to hear yo’re tired. I’d </p><p>cry for yuh if I could. But I don’t see </p><p>why yuh didn’t wait till it was time to </p><p>start like we planned. The stage’d brought </p><p>the news about Holloway an’ Slim.” </p><p>“Gimme a chance, gimme a chance! My </p><p>Gawd, yuh want the whole thing all at </p><p>once. You lemme alone—who’s talkin’ </p><p>loud? I ain’t. Yo’re doin’ the bellerin’. </p><p>Well, Telescope he sifted out o’ town four </p><p>■days ago in the mornin’. I stayed. That </p><p>:night Bill Lainey an’ me are in the Blue </p><p>'Pigeon about one o’clock listenin' to Mike </p><p>Flynn gas about them South Sea Islands o’ </p><p>his, when Bangety-Bang! goes a rifle down </p><p>street a ways. Bangety-Bangl goes an- </p><p>other, then a couple more mixes in, an’ </p><p>they’s a whole hatful o’ noise. The South </p><p>Sea Islands stopped immediate, an’ we sits </p><p>down on the floor where the counter’s </p><p>thickest. An’ a good thing we did. A </p><p>40-65 comes in a window, grooves the </p><p>counter over my head, busts a can o’ </p><p>peaches on the opposite shelf an’ sticks in </p><p>the wall. An’-” </p><p> “A 40-65, yuh say?”</p><p> “Shore, a 40-65. Lemme tell it, lemme</p><p>tell it—huh? O’ course I know. Mike</p><p>he dug the lead out o’ the wood later </p><p>an’ he told me. Well, that one bullet was </p><p>all that come our way. They’s only a few </p><p>shots, not more’n thirty at the outside, </p><p>then tuckety-luck, tuckety-tuck up the street </p><p>come four jiggers a-ridin’ an’ a-quirtin’ an’ </p><p>a-spurrin’ like they hadn’t a minute to live. </p><p>They wasn’t out o’ town before they’s a </p><p>pile o’ hollerin’ down in front o’ Slim Ber- </p><p>dan’s house. The three of us goes down, </p><p>an’ they’s the two Holland boys carryin’ </p><p>Slim Berdan, bleedin’ like a stuck steer, </p><p>into his house. Across the sidewalk Lute </p><p>Holloway’s lyin’ on his face. They’s five </p><p>holes in Lute an’ one o’ them holes is in </p><p>his heart.” </p><p> “As good a deputy as they ever was in</p><p>Fort Creek County, Lute was,” put in </p><p>Johnny. </p><p> “Shore. Jake Rule was worse’n wild.</p><p>Well, what with Lute downed an’ Slim shot </p><p>up, they’s all kinds o’ friskin’ ’round, but </p><p>we got started in maybe fifteen minutes— </p><p>Jake Rule, Kyle, his other deputy; yores </p><p>truly, ‘Two Spot’ Riley, ‘Piney’ Jackson, </p><p>maybe they’s twenty-five of us—an’ we </p><p>hit the breeze. We knowed they’d headed </p><p>north on the Bend trail an’ that’s all we did </p><p>know.” </p><p> “Didn’t nobody see ’em close?”</p><p> “Slim did, but she was too dark to see</p><p>much. They was all on their hosses, any- </p><p>how.” </p><p> “What did they try to do—rob the ex-</p><p>press office?” </p><p> “They did not. They come in to get</p><p>Slim, an’ Holloway, ’cause he lived with </p><p>Slim, got into the muss.” </p><p> “Howdja know?”</p><p> “Why, they all four come a-gallopin’ up</p><p>to Slim’s house, an’ one of ’em rides up on </p><p>the sidewalk an’ hammers on Slim’s door, </p><p>an’ yells for Slim to come out quick, he’s </p><p>wanted. Slim he says he thought right </p><p>away they was a fraycas in town, so him </p><p>an’ Holloway jumps out o’ bed an’ runs for </p><p>the door. Lute reaches the door first an’ </p><p>runs out. They got him instanter before </p><p>he can even pull. Slim had time to pull</p><p>all right an’ flip the hammer twice before </p><p>they shot the gun out of his hand and </p><p>throwed three bullets into him other </p><p>places.” </p><p> “Then what?”</p><p> “We rode after them {tillers like I said, an’</p><p>it’s night an’ all an’ we over-rode their </p><p>tracks. So we had to work back an’ when </p><p>it come daylight we found where they’d </p><p>left the trail just south o’ Bear Mountain </p><p>an’ headed northwest. That settled it for </p><p>Jake Rule. Northwest meant them killers </p><p>couldn’t be bound nowhere else but thc- </p><p>Emigrant Hills on the Dogsoldier. So we </p><p>spraddled right along, losin’ the trail an' </p><p>findin’ her again, an’ bimbey we lost her </p><p>good an’ proper like I knowed we would </p><p>in a creek. </p><p> “Shore, they rode the water like ducks,</p><p>an’ we never did pick up the trail again. </p><p>Hidden Trails </p><p>135 </p><p>But that didn’t bother Jake Rule. ‘The </p><p>Emigrant Hills, boys,’ says Jake. ‘We’ll </p><p>catch ’em there.’ We stopped at the Anvil </p><p>ranch for fresh horses—but no news. No- </p><p>body stopped there in two weeks, an’ they </p><p>hadn’t missed a single cayuse.” </p><p> “The B-bar-B’s west o’ the Anvil an’</p><p>Hall’s is east,” suggested Johnny. </p><p> “Shore, but we didn’t have time to go</p><p>there. We went on an’ we hit the Emi- </p><p>grants an’ never seen a measly hoofmark </p><p>anywhere. We met Burns, the Wagon </p><p>Wheel stray man, an’ he hadn’t seen no- </p><p>body. I knowed they was behind us </p><p>some’ers—they had to be. But Jake’s </p><p>stubborn like he always is, an’ he combs </p><p>the Emigrants industrious. Where we was </p><p>in the Emigrants wasn’t more’n ninety or a </p><p>hundred miles to the Bend, so I decided to </p><p>come right along on an’ let Jake an’ the </p><p>others scatter ’round all they wanted.” </p><p> But what did yuh con#" bawlin’ out in</p><p>the Broken Dollar for about me not waitin’ </p><p>for yuh, huh?” </p><p>“ON ACCOUNT o’ that Bale Har- </p><p>per feller. This mornin’ at Rocket </p><p>—I spent the last half o’ the night </p><p>at Sinclair’s, an’ he’s there too—he saddles </p><p>up when I do an’ allows if I’m goin’ north </p><p>he’ll trail along. Says he gets lonesome, </p><p>an’ likes to tallj.. Now he ain’t exactly </p><p>curious, this Bale ain’t, but he shore does </p><p>like to talk an’ is one easy sport to make </p><p>friends with. He don’t make it hard for </p><p>yuh to up-end yore whole life’s history into </p><p>his ears if yuh want to. No sir, yuh could </p><p>do it without a struggle. An’ I can’t get </p><p>rid 0’ him. </p><p> “We stopped at a ranch along about</p><p>noon, an’ he wants to rest his hoss, so I </p><p>says I’ll be pushin’ along. He says maybe </p><p>his hoss ain’t so tired after all an’ he strings </p><p>his chips with mine all the way to the Bend. </p><p>So I figured when he come into the saloon </p><p>after me the only thing I could do was to </p><p>bluff him by partly tellin’ the truth. I </p><p>dunno nothin’ about that jigger outside o’ </p><p>what I’m tellin’ yuh, but I’m bettin’ he’s </p><p>a bad actor. He’s got a bad eye more ways </p><p>’n one.”</p><p> “An’ yuh say he didn’t ask any ques-</p><p>tions?” </p><p> “None to take offense at.”</p><p> “No, he wouldn’t, but did he say any-</p><p>thin’ a-tall about any places?” </p><p> “Places?”</p><p> “Shore, places—towns, hills, creeks, the</p><p>like o’ that.” </p><p> Racey thought hard.</p><p> “Seems to me now he did say somethin’</p><p>about the Dogville trail.” </p><p> Now Dogville is an infinitesimal hamlet</p><p>dotting the bluff at the junction of the </p><p>Dogsoldier and the Lazy rivers. Yet an </p><p>occasional freighter goes to Dogville, and </p><p>there is a trail connecting the village with </p><p>the Bend trail north of Cutter. This trail </p><p>runs within a mile of the Anvil ranch-house. </p><p> “What did he say about the Dogville</p><p>trail?” questioned Johnny. </p><p> “Said, ‘Wasn’t she a-ova trail?’ ’or</p><p>somethin’.” </p><p> “What did you say?”</p><p> “I says I didn’t know—never followed</p><p>the trail in my life.” </p><p> “Yuh didn’t!” Painful amazement rode</p><p>Johnny’s tone. </p><p> “Shore, why not?”</p><p> “Tell yuh later. Was the Dogville trail</p><p>all he asked about?” </p><p> “Cutter—yeah, Cutter. Had Tommy</p><p>Mull changed the whisky at his hotel yet, </p><p>an’ I says no, same old whisky she always </p><p>was. Playin’ foxy myself, see—lettin’ him </p><p>think I come through Cutter.” </p><p> “Oh, yo’re a ringtail whizzer, Racey!</p><p>Honest, if yuh had any more sense you’d </p><p>be half-witted!” </p><p> “What’d I do I’d like to know. Didn’t</p><p>I hafta say somethin’ to yuh in the saloon? </p><p>Didn’t I hafta, huh? I’m askin’ yuh, </p><p>didn’ I?” </p><p> “You was all right in the saloon. It was</p><p>before yuh got there yuh was all wrong.” </p><p>“I’d admire to know why,” grumbled the </p><p>offended Racey. </p><p> “This is why: yuh was ridin’ an Anvil</p><p>hoss, wasn’t yuh? An’ yuh said yuh never </p><p>rode the Dogville trail in yore life. Har- </p><p>per met yuh on the Bend trail. All right, </p><p>yuh never seen the Dogville trail, so he </p><p>tries yuh again with Tommy Mull’s whisky </p><p>at Cutter. You told him she was the same </p><p>old whisky, didn’ yuh?” </p><p> “Shore.”</p><p> “Right there he got yuh. Ten days ago</p><p>Tommy Mull got religion an’ run every </p><p>drop O’ whisky he owned out on the grass. </p><p>Since this yuh couldn’t get a drink in </p><p>Tommy’s place if yuh was dyin’. An’ you </p><p>played foxy by blattin’ out — ‘She’s the </p><p>same ol’ whisky’!” </p><p> Racey was dumb for a space.</p><p>136 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “I shore put my foot in it, I guess,” he</p><p>mourned, when Johnny had rolled a scorn- </p><p>ful cigaret. </p><p> “That Anvil hoss showed yuh’d been</p><p>west o’ the Bend trail some’ers,” said </p><p>Johnny, sticking the cigaret in his mouth </p><p>for a dry smoke, “an’ ’cause yuh didn’t </p><p>know nothin’ o’ the Dogville trail nor </p><p>Tommy’s gettin’ religion showed yuh’d </p><p>been romancin’ round the country north </p><p>an’ west o’ Cutter. He could see by the </p><p>condition o’ the hoss yuh’d been shovin’ </p><p>along hard an’ fast. An’ a fellah in this </p><p>country don’t shove his hoss less’n he’s a </p><p>hoss-thief or in a posse.” </p><p> “Maybe he took me for a hoss-thief,”</p><p>suggested Racey hopefully. </p><p> “O’ course if you was yuh’d ride along</p><p>with him the way yuh did an’ yuh’d bring </p><p>the hoss here to the Bend, where the brand’s </p><p>known, wouldn’t yuh?” </p><p> “Well-”</p><p> “Racey, I’ll bet he knows yuh was part</p><p>of a posse.” </p><p> “Can’t help it. How’n - could I</p><p>guess all this?” </p><p> “If we’re a-goin’ to corral these road-</p><p>agents yuh’l hafta guess a lot more’n this. </p><p>Djever stop to think Harper may be one </p><p>o’ the Farewell killers?” </p><p> “He ain’t,” said Racey, eager to be of</p><p>some use. “He was at Rocket nearly a </p><p>week. I heard Dave Sinclair say so.” </p><p>“He was, was he? Guess now I’ll just </p><p>go down an’ have a li’l talk with Dave.” </p><p>“Do yuh think that Bale Harper feller </p><p>is in with the road-agents?” asked Racey </p><p>lugubriously hugging his knees. </p><p> “I dunno. He’s somethin’ off, whatever</p><p>his game is, or he’d never ’a’ made them </p><p>breaks about the Dogville trail an’ Tommy’s </p><p>whisky. Look here, Racey, didn’t nobody </p><p>see nothin’ o’ the jiggers that downed Lute </p><p>Holloway?”</p><p> “It was dark, I tell yuh. All Bill Lainey</p><p>an’ Mike Flynn an’ me could see was so </p><p>many black shadders a-flyin’ past.” </p><p> “Think now. Scratch yore head if yuh</p><p>gotta, but think. You talked to Slim after </p><p>he was shot, didn’t yuh?” </p><p> “Shore, but-”</p><p> “An’ yuh heard him talk, didn’t yuh,</p><p>Now, what-” </p><p> “Everybody was runnin’ ’round, I tell</p><p>yuh, Johnny. How can I remember?” </p><p> “If yuh’ll shut up about a minute an’</p><p>gimme a chance I’ll show yuh how yuh </p><p>can remember maybe. You an’ as many </p><p>as could was all in the room with Slim. </p><p>There was Slim a-layin’ on the bed with </p><p>Doc Kramer swabbin’ at his nicks an’ </p><p>puttin’ on bandages. They’s the lamp lit, </p><p>an’ somebody’s a-holdin’ it so’s doc can </p><p>see to work, an’ Bill Lainey’s breathin’ </p><p>hard an’ shufflin’ his feet, an’ Slim’s </p><p>a-talkin’ kind o’ gaspy, an’ yuh gotta </p><p>scrouge forrard so’s yuh can hear what he’s </p><p>sayin’. Now what did he say besides that </p><p>about they bein’ four of ’em an’ Lute’s </p><p>runnin’ out first? Nemmine how I know </p><p>it. I know. Now, what did Slim say?” </p><p>Thus adjured, Racey strove to live again </p><p>his part in the scene reconstructed by </p><p>Johnny Ramsay. There was Slim lying on </p><p>the blood-stained blankets of the bed. Doc </p><p>Kramer had cut his shirt and trousers away. </p><p>There were tourniquets on both legs. Slim </p><p>was talking—wheezing, rather. YVhat was </p><p>he saying—something about a horse, wasn’t </p><p>it? Yes, that was it. A light-colored </p><p>horse. And one of the riders wore no hat. </p><p>Slim saw him against the stars. Was there </p><p>anything else? Racey Dawson scratched </p><p>his head, closed tight his eyes, but.could </p><p>not remember another word of what Slim </p><p>had said. He opened his eyes and hitched </p><p>nearer his friend. </p><p>“I thought maybe yuh could tell me </p><p>somethin’ if yuh tried,” observed Johnny, </p><p>when Racey had unbosomed himself. “A </p><p>light-colored cayuse, huh? Dun, maybe?” </p><p>“Can’t say. Slim didn’t.” </p><p> “An’ the gent with no hat—was he ridin’</p><p>this light hoss?” </p><p> “He was ridin’ one o’ the others. I</p><p>remember Slim sayin’ that. He seen him </p><p>plain against the stars after he’d fell down </p><p>—Slim fell down.” </p><p> “No hat. Now, why wouldn’t he wear</p><p>a hat, I wonder?” pondered Johnny. </p><p>“Maybe he lost it,” contributed Racey. </p><p>“Maybe he had it tied to his saddle- </p><p>strings. Maybe she was a odd hat or </p><p>somethin’ an’ he was afraid somebody’d </p><p>recognize it. Maybe she was a wide white </p><p>hat with a high crown, higher than most. </p><p>Djever see a hat like that, Racey?” </p><p> “The red-head!” Racey’s whisper was</p><p>sharp. “He had a hat like that!” </p><p> “He shore had, an’ cornin’ back after</p><p>Slim would be what he’d do if he got the </p><p>chance.” </p><p> “Slim did run him out o’ town kind o’</p><p>abrupt.” </p><p>Hidden Trails </p><p>137 </p><p> “That light-colored hoss—yuh can’t tell.</p><p>She might ’a’ been a dun.” </p><p> “S’pose she was. What of it?”</p><p> “A lot maybe. Wait till tomorrow an’</p><p>we’ll go over the whole thing with Tele- </p><p>scope—Oh, that was easy. I guessed it. </p><p>O’ course Slim was a-layin’ on the bed. </p><p>Where else would he lay? An’ somebody’d </p><p>hafta hold the lamp so’s doc could work, </p><p>an’ Bill Lainey always breathes hard an’ </p><p>shuffles his feet when he’s interested, an’ </p><p>Slim couldn’t help talkin’ gaspy if he had </p><p>three holes in him. So there y’are. Le’s </p><p>go to bed.” </p><p>CHAPTER XII </p><p>LAGUERRE TALKS </p><p>“\X7HAT was Mat Neville cornin’ north </p><p> V V for?” demanded Johnny.</p><p> “I know, but-”</p><p> “Aw, yuh make me sick, Racey. It</p><p>stands to reason, don’t it, Telescope?” </p><p>“S’pose now dey fin’ de hat een Farewell, </p><p>un she ees not a w’ite hat?” evaded the half- </p><p>breed. </p><p> “I’m gamblin’ they won’t find it. Any-</p><p>how I’m writin’ to Jake Rule to find out </p><p>for sure. But you can bet she’s them three </p><p>hold-ups an’ the red-head, an’ he tied his </p><p>hat on his saddle so’s she wouldn’t give him </p><p>away. It’s just what he would do.” </p><p> “He would if he did.” Thus cryptically</p><p>Mr. Dawson. </p><p> “An’ three men with him. Where’d he</p><p>get three men together to try an’ down Slim </p><p>an’ Holloway outside o’ the road-agent </p><p>crowd?” </p><p> “Holloway had enemies. So’d Slim.”</p><p>“Shore, but scatterin’. A gent here, an- </p><p>other there, an’ all in different parts o’ the </p><p>county. They might lay for Lute an’ Slim </p><p>separate, but they’d never organize four in </p><p>a bunch. If I could only be sure that </p><p>light-colored hoss was a black-tail dun. Any </p><p>way, one of ’em was usin’ a 40-65. That’s</p><p>somethin’.” </p><p> “One t’ing,” observed Laguerre: “eef de</p><p>red-head she belong to de hold-up outfit, </p><p>w’y don’ she stop de stage wit’ de res’? De </p><p>men w’at have do dat are seex-foot mabbeso, </p><p>but dees man wit’ de red hair she ees seex- </p><p>foot-four, un no one was ever see man tall </p><p>as dat stop de stage or rob de minair.” </p><p> “I know that,” agreed Johnny. “I’ve</p><p>asked a heap o’ folks an’ none of ’em have </p><p>ever seen a gent like this red-head, but </p><p>djever stop to think that the folks he holds </p><p>up might be too dead to talk about it </p><p>afterward?” </p><p> “Dat ees true,” nodded Laguerre.</p><p> “But somebody’s got to see him if he is</p><p>one of ’em,” said Racey. </p><p> “Somebody will—if he is. How about</p><p>that stage-station job, Racey, or would yuh </p><p>rather toss up for the stray man end?” </p><p>“Not me. I’ll get a job in town myself. </p><p>She’s a right nice li’l place—good scenery, </p><p>good folks.” </p><p> “Yeah.” Suspiciously.</p><p> “They’s a right handsome-lookin’ lady</p><p>in the Bend, an’ I aim to meet her. Yessir, </p><p>I’m satisfied to give my hoss a rest.” </p><p>“Who’s the lady?” Acute interest mixed </p><p>with the suspicion. </p><p> “The one behind the wheel at the</p><p>Broken Dollar. Say-” </p><p> “He’s off!” cried the greatly relieved</p><p>Johnny. “When Racey Dawson starts </p><p>talkin’ about a girl, he’s good for all </p><p>day. Le’s go away an’ leave him, </p><p>Telescope.” </p><p> The three had rendezvoused in a thickly</p><p>wooded gulch on the eastern slope of Old </p><p>Baldy. In accordance with their plan John- </p><p>ny and Laguerre rode from there straight </p><p>to the Flying M and Racey Dawson return- </p><p>ed to the Bend. Racey had not informed his </p><p>two friends of his intention to loaf about </p><p>town a few days before starting to work. </p><p>There was no hurry. And roulette is a </p><p>fascinating game. Besides, there was Bale</p><p>Harper to be investigated. He couldn’t </p><p>do that very well if he-was working. Of </p><p>course not. He had more than a hundred </p><p>dollars in his poke, and there wasn’t a cloud </p><p>in the sky. Racey crooked a leg ’round his </p><p>saddle-horn and whistled the “Rakes of </p><p>Mallow” with joy and abandon. An easy </p><p>conscience is a wonderful thing. </p><p> Johnny and Laguerre were openly and</p><p>loudly hired by Scotty Mackenzie ten </p><p>minutes after their arrival at the Flying-M. </p><p>The foreman, Doubleday of the sharp nose </p><p>and sharper eye, took them at their face </p><p>value and sent them down to the bunk- </p><p>house. Doubleday did not fully compre- </p><p>hend the necessity of two stray men, but </p><p>he knew Scotty to be a creature of whims. </p><p>No one ever even dreamed of questioning </p><p>Scotty’s whims. So when the old ranch- </p><p>man said that he himself would give the </p><p>new men their orders, Doubleday merely </p><p>138 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>shifted his quid and dismissed the subject </p><p>from his mind. </p><p> The next morning Johnny and Laguerre</p><p>rode away southward. That men might </p><p>know of the place and manner of their </p><p>employment the two rode Flying-M horses </p><p>and carried open letters signed by Scotty. </p><p> “Guess maybe we’d better stop in the</p><p>Bend, Telescope,” said Johnny when the </p><p>town was less than a mile away. “I—we </p><p>gotta see what Racey’s doin’.” </p><p> “Shore, un I wan’ for see w’at dat Mees-</p><p>tair Slay she was do.” </p><p>“Got any idea what for a gent he is yet? </p><p>I didn’t see yuh look him over very close.” </p><p>“I was look all right. But I do not let you </p><p>see me look, un I do not let heem see me </p><p>look. I am not de-fool, me. She ees </p><p>not easy for tell what she ees lak. I know </p><p>dees, she ees de wan w’at do de beeg t’ing. </p><p>She would not be satisfy wit’ less.” </p><p>“Whatcha mean?” </p><p> “I mean eef she ees de rustlair she would</p><p>not rustle forty cow, she would rustle ’ole </p><p>- herd. Eef she steal de money, she </p><p>would not steal feefty-seexty dollar, she </p><p>would tak ten t’ousan’. Now you see.” </p><p>“I see.” </p><p> “Un she ees clevair, dees man. By gar,</p><p>she have de brain. Dose t’ing I see.” </p><p> The half-breed’s expressive shrug was a</p><p>direct legacy from his French father. </p><p> “But,” he continued harshly, “w’at I</p><p>can not see, I can guess.” </p><p> “That’s easy. So can I guess.”</p><p> “We do not guess de same, mabbeso.</p><p>Leesten. Las’ night I was talk wit’ Scotty </p><p>un she tell me w’at she know about dees </p><p>Slay un hees seestair, how dey was come </p><p>from Cheecawgo, un de seestair she ride </p><p>de pony lak-un was not run ’roun’ wit’ </p><p>de men un Slay she mak money een de </p><p>Broken Dollar. All right, dat ees fine, </p><p>hones’ beesness, but she ees small beesness. </p><p>She ees too small for man lak Slay. Un de </p><p>seestair—Johnny, have you ever see de </p><p>beeg ceety?” </p><p> “I been east to Cheyenne once.”</p><p> “Yeah, Cheyenne ees de ceety, but she</p><p>ees not de beeg ceety. By gar, me, I have </p><p>see Kebec un Montreal un Ottawa w’en I </p><p>was boy, un dere een dat plass I was see les </p><p>grandes demoiselles, not de dance-hall girl </p><p>wit’ de paint un de-smile lak one spi- </p><p>dair, but de great, great lady all dress up </p><p>een de seelk un de feddair. </p><p> “Bon Dieu, I was so close to dem I could</p><p>touch dem, me. But I deed not. I was </p><p>’fraid, un I step off de sidewalk. But I was </p><p>watch, always I was watch, un I was een dat </p><p>plass t’ree year, un I say dat w’en I go </p><p>’way I know de lady w’en I see her. Un dat </p><p>ees w’at Mees Wallace ees. She ees all </p><p>same one o’ dem grandes demoiselles een </p><p>Kebec un Montreal un Ottawa.” </p><p> “You mean you seen her there?” Johnny</p><p>was obviously skeptical. </p><p> “No, I was not see her. I mean she ees</p><p>lak dem. She ees une grande demoiselle, un </p><p>she have de brain behin’ de eye, too. Well </p><p>den, I say, me, w’y a man un a lady, bot’ </p><p>wit’ de brain un de lady a grande demoiselle, </p><p>w’y dey come here to dees plass, dees plass </p><p>w’ere dere ees nuttin’ but de heel un de cow </p><p>un de pony?” </p><p> Johnny bethought him of Texas Pete,</p><p>the two cigarets and the one match. Did </p><p>grandes demoiselles act that way? He won- </p><p>dered. Laguerre misinterpreted his silence. </p><p> “Dere now, you see w’at I see,” he</p><p>exclaimed in triumph, “un you guess w’at </p><p>I guess. Money was bring dem, un eet was </p><p>not de money een de Broken Dollar.” </p><p> “I been thinkin’ some o’ friend Slay</p><p>that way, myself,” admitted Johnny, “an’ </p><p>the more I think of it, the more I like the</p><p>notion. But that ain’t provin’ it’s so none. </p><p>Yuh know it’s plumb easy to believe a thing </p><p>when yuh want to. When I said somethin’ </p><p>to Scotty about Slay an’ the bandits he </p><p>couldn’t see it a-tall. Don’t like Slay none, </p><p>he says, but he’s gotta give him his due an’ </p><p>say they ain’t a thing against him. Slay’s </p><p>always in town when they’s hold-ups, ’cept </p><p>this last one, an’ I know he wasn’t in that.” </p><p>“Deed I not say Meestair Slay she have </p><p>de brain?” asked Laguerre softly. </p><p> “Sort o’ sits back an’ lets the other feller</p><p>work, huh?” </p><p> “We weel see, mabbeso.”</p><p> On their way through town they stopped</p><p>at the Burr house. </p><p> “She ain’t home,” the voice of young</p><p>Sammy Barnes shouted from the corral. </p><p> “Ain’t Mis’ Burr got back from Jack</p><p>Creek yet?” A clever blend of surprise </p><p>and dignity on the part of Mr. Ramsay. </p><p> “You didn’t come to see Mis’ Burr!”</p><p>retorted the turtle in loud, unsympathetic </p><p>tones. “You come to see Dor’thy! What- </p><p>cha bluffin’ for, huh? Can’t fool me! I </p><p>seen yuh! Yo’re stuck on Dor’thy, that’s </p><p>whatcha are!” </p><p> Had the state of being stuck on Dorothy</p><p>Hidden Trails </p><p>139 </p><p>been a most flagitious offense Johnny could </p><p>not have reddened more enthusiastically. </p><p>Mrs. Mace, residing a few houses nearer </p><p>Main Street, hurried outdoors to shake a </p><p>dust-rag. Mrs. Carey and Tug Wilson’s </p><p>sister both had business on their doorsteps. </p><p>Heads appeared at various open windows. </p><p> “Harry—Slay—give her—’nother—box o’</p><p>—candy—yest'day—why—don’tchu—give </p><p>—her—some?” </p><p> Which breathless combination statement</p><p>and question was delivered in the childish </p><p>squawk of Mrs. Carey’s eight-year-old. </p><p>Mrs. Carey disappeared within. Followed </p><p>then the sound of smackings punctuated </p><p>by anguished wails. An appreciative gig- </p><p>gle ran about the street. </p><p> Johnny Ramsay, illogically hating wo-</p><p>men and small children with cordial inten- </p><p>sity, wheeled his horse and rode off. But </p><p>the giggle followed him to the corner of </p><p>Main Street. </p><p> IT IS true that all the world loves</p><p>a lover. But it does not love two </p><p>lovers. It laughs heartily and makes </p><p>bets on the outcome. Johnny, recognizing </p><p>with mental writhing the factuality of these </p><p>things, failed to comprehend why he should </p><p>be classed as one of the lovers. True, he </p><p>had called on the lady, but not conspicuous- </p><p>ly. True again, he admired the lady, but </p><p>likewise not conspicuously—at least this is </p><p>what he told himself. </p><p>1 i That he should be stirred to disgustful </p><p>irritation by Dorothy’s seemingly compla- </p><p>cent acceptance of Slay’s attentions was </p><p>but natural. The gambler was much loo </p><p>equivocal a character to be comradely with </p><p>a young girl. Johnny’s concern was all for </p><p>the young girl. Of course, she was precisely </p><p>what he had told Scotty, merely a friend. </p><p>Absolutely nothing more. </p><p> Johnny did not forget his declaration to</p><p>Scotty to the effect that, as no one else </p><p>seemed disposed to protect Dorothy from </p><p>the man Slay, he himself would attend to </p><p>the matter. He realized in bitterness of </p><p>soul that he was not making good. </p><p> “Look dere!” Laguerre said surprisedly.</p><p> Johnny looked. Ahead of them the stage</p><p>company’s horses were being driven by a </p><p>hostler to water. Racey, in overalls, mount- </p><p>ed bareback, was talking to the hostler. </p><p> “When yuh get back,” Racey was saying,</p><p>“put on some axle-grease to keep the flies </p><p>off that V-T hoss where he cut himself an’ </p><p>scout ’round after that neck-yoke. Tug says </p><p>she’s near the big corral some’ers.” </p><p> The hostler departed in the dust of his tit-</p><p>tuping charges, and Racey looked into the </p><p>faces of his two friends and smiled—one- </p><p>sidedly, his upper lip being bruised and </p><p>puffed to twice its normal size. Racey’s </p><p>right eye was thoroughly blackened and </p><p>an abrasion marked the left side of his </p><p>jaw. There were scratches on his nose and </p><p>his knuckles were skinned. </p><p> “What hit yuh?” asked Johnny.</p><p> “ ‘Skinny’ Devinney, the station boss,”</p><p>replied Racey. </p><p> “Don’t blame him. What was yuh</p><p>tryin’ to do?” </p><p> “I was just arguin’ with him.”</p><p> “Arguin’?”</p><p> “Shore. I asks him for a job all so pretty</p><p>and polite, an’ he says somethin’ about not </p><p>wantin’ no feller in hair pants a-workin’ for </p><p>him. Then I just had to argue with him.” </p><p>Johnny’s eyes strayed toward the com- </p><p>bined stage station and express office. Be- </p><p>low one of the windows pieces of broken </p><p>glass and splintered sash littered the ground. </p><p> “Looks like the window got busted,”</p><p>hazarded Johnny. </p><p>“He done it—on his way out,” explained </p><p>Racey. “He didn’t want to go,” he added. </p><p>Johnny’s eyes rested on Racey’s features. </p><p>“I expect,” he said drily. “I notice he </p><p>gave yuh a job.” </p><p> “Yeah, he gimme his. Yuh see, after</p><p>he’d went, there was the job left an orphan </p><p>an’ there was me, an’ Tug Wilson he says </p><p>it looked just like Providence. Me, I’m the</p><p>station boss myself.” </p><p> “Lucky for you Devinney didn’t have a</p><p>gun, “observed Johnny. “Yuh better keep </p><p>yore eye skinned, Racey. She’s just pos- </p><p>sible he may organize with one an’ come </p><p>back a-huntin’ him his job.” </p><p> “He—he had a gun,” Racey said in some</p><p>embarrassment. “I kind o’ had to pry it </p><p>away from him before he’d act decent.” </p><p>Laguerre laughed delightedly. </p><p> “Didn’t he try to throw down?” de-</p><p>manded Johnny. </p><p> “Oh, he tried,” admitted Racey.</p><p> “Yuh bat’s-eyed ol’ son-of-a-gun,” John-</p><p>ny drawled in keenest admiration. </p><p> “See yuh later,” grinned Racey. “Gotta</p><p>take this accordeen to the blacksmith.” </p><p>Johnny stared after Racey, and his brows </p><p>drew together. </p><p> “More I think of it,” he observed to</p><p>140 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Laguerre, “the less I like this wrastlin’ </p><p>’round with Skinny Devinney. Seems like </p><p>she was kind o’ unnecessary an’ a heap </p><p>likely to come high for Racey. I’ve heard </p><p>Skinny was a hard customer.” </p><p> “Le’s go see heem,” said Laguerre.</p><p> But the ex-station-boss was not to be</p><p>found in the Bend. Skinny Devinney had </p><p>saddled a horse and pulled his freight. </p><p> “An’ I always thought Skinny was a</p><p>fighter,”. their bartending informant re- </p><p>marked with disgust. “After gettin’ his </p><p>cork pulled thataway he can’t never show </p><p>up in this town again, that’s a cinch. </p><p>Shore, but throat’s a leetle raw this mornin’. </p><p>I’ll take a cigar ’f yuh don’t mind.” </p><p> “Help yoreself. We’ll take about twenty-</p><p>five apiece. I like a good smoke, I do, an’ </p><p>I don’t guess we’ll run up on any cigars like </p><p>these in the Yellow Medicine country.” </p><p>“Ridin’ there, huh?” </p><p> “Between the Medicine an’ Dry Creek.</p><p>Seven an’ four-bits? Here y’are. Le’s </p><p>wander, Telescope.” </p><p> “Good morning, Mister Ramsay.”</p><p> It was a gay and Sunday morning voice</p><p>that spoke, and Johnny, in the act of mount- </p><p>ing, slid his foot from the stirrup and turned, </p><p>dragging off his hat. Mrs. Wallace smiled </p><p>up into his face with eyes and mouth. </p><p> “G’momin’, ma’am,” said Johnny, and</p><p>wished Telescope would go away. </p><p> But the half-breed had no intention of</p><p>doing any such thing. He sat quite still in </p><p>the saddle, rolling a cigaret, and unobtru- </p><p>sively observing the lady from under his hat </p><p>brim. Johnny, greatly against his will, was </p><p>forced to introduce him. </p><p> “You haven’t forgotten about coming to</p><p>see me?” she said to Johnny in a low tone. </p><p>“Now, ma’am, how could I?” </p><p> “Tonight?” The black eyes pleaded.</p><p>I’m not working tonight. I take a vaca- </p><p>tion now and then. This evening will</p><p>be then. Do come. I’ll be all alone.” </p><p> “I’d shore like to. But I ain’t a-goin’ to</p><p>be in town. I’m workin’ for Scotty now.” </p><p>“It isn’t far from the ranch if—if you </p><p>really want to come.” The long curving </p><p>lashes were lowered and she was poking </p><p>with her parasol at a crack in the sidewalk. </p><p> “It ain’t a case o’ want, ma’am,” pro-</p><p>tested Johnny. “But by tonight I’ll be in </p><p>Rocket. Tomorrow me an’ my friend’ll </p><p>be over east o’ the Yellow Medicine some- </p><p>’ers. We’ll work back to the Flyin’-M by </p><p>way of Dry Creek, the Seven-Lazy-Seven, </p><p>an’ Cavalry Valley. Two weeks, ma’am, </p><p>’fore I’ll see the Bend again.” </p><p> “Oh, I am sorry,” said she; “but you’ll</p><p>come to see one when you return?” </p><p> “Shore will.”</p><p> Again the red lips parted in their fascinat-</p><p>ing smile. She inclined head and shoulders </p><p>in a little bow that included Laguerre, </p><p>swung her parasol and strolled away. </p><p> “You know Mees Dor’ty Burr, huh?”</p><p>asked the half-breed, when they had passed </p><p>from Main Street to the Farewell trail. </p><p>“Shore, I know her. Why?” </p><p> “She un Slay dey was ride by w’ile you</p><p>was talk wit’ de»grande demoiselle.” </p><p> “Yeah.” Outwardly uninterested.</p><p> “Yeah, she look at you leetle, den she was</p><p>look at Slay, un laugh un talk fas’.” </p><p> “Huh.” Still the outward lack of interest.</p><p>“Eet ees hard for drive two pony.” </p><p>“What’s drivin’ two cayuses gotta do </p><p>with me, I’d like to know?” </p><p> “I was jus’ say so.” Laguerre shrugged</p><p>Gallic shoulders. “I have been de scout, I </p><p>have leeve wit’ Enjun. I see w’at I see.” </p><p>“Say, Telescope, whatcha talkin’ about?” </p><p>“I was jus’ talk,”, evaded Laguerre, drop- </p><p>ping his off eyelid. “You deed not say you </p><p>was know dees Mees’ Wallace w’en I was </p><p>talk about her de firs’ tarn.” </p><p> “Guess I must ’a’ forgot. Don’t make no</p><p>difference, does it?”</p><p> “She ees smart,” Laguerre sidestepped.</p><p> “Well?”</p><p> “You have tell her w’ere we go.”</p><p> “Shore I did. I had to. We may be</p><p>trailed. If we say before we start where </p><p>we’re a-goin’ to, an’ then go there, they </p><p>won’t be so suspicious. They’ll never </p><p>think we’d say right out where we was </p><p>lookin’ for evidence, would they now?” </p><p> “I unnerstan’. You have walk een de</p><p>watair by tellin’ de trut’. But deed I not </p><p>say dat lady she ees smart? She weel t’ink </p><p>dat ees jus’ w’at you would do, mabbeso.” </p><p>“She ain’t as smart as that,” Johnny </p><p>denied vigorously. </p><p> “She ees - sight smarter dan dat.</p><p>I tell you dat lady ees hard for fool.” </p><p>“Yo’re always lookin’ on the black side, </p><p>y’ ol’ wet blanket.” </p><p> “Aw right, you weel see,” said Laguerre,</p><p>nodding sagely. “Gimme de match.” </p><p>TO BE CONTINUED </p><p>Captain, T^^^’sjLast "Vbgage </p><p>HIS is a story of the sea, the great </p><p>inexplicable sea, a tale of the </p><p>strangeness of life, of the trickiness </p><p>of chance, of heat and the East and </p><p>the vagaries of a man’s mind; but primarily </p><p>of the sea, for it could have happened no- </p><p>where but at sea. It required the setting of </p><p>the sea, the loneliness of the sea, the brood- </p><p>ing power of vast spaces that inevitably and </p><p>inexorably takes possession of the human </p><p>soul, kneads it, molds it, goads it to a pre- </p><p>destined goal. </p><p> The sea is the fate, the master, the Neme-</p><p>sis of those that follow it; the sea is the </p><p>great Kismet. And it is more. It is the </p><p>unalterable past and a sham future; in its </p><p>stillness, its loneliness, its vastness, mem- </p><p>ories are mirrored back; and in its depths, </p><p>in its reposeful beauty, are dreams not of </p><p>what will be, shall be, but of what ought to </p><p>be, should be. </p><p> This story is not my story; I was merely</p><p>an onlooker, a supernumerary, you may </p><p>say; I had no vital part in this drama, this </p><p>fifth act of a man’s destiny. This is the </p><p>story of the sea and of Captain Horace </p><p>Findlay and his ship, the Aladdin. </p><p> During my life at sea I have sailed under</p><p>many commanders, and of them all Captain </p><p>Findlay was the strangest, his picture stands </p><p>out vividest, sharpest-drawn against the </p><p>background of the past. That last impres- </p><p>sion of him, alone on the bridge in the night, </p><p>is eternal. But even at first he had an </p><p>unreal mystifying fascination. </p><p> He seemed to be at once an appeal and a</p><p>command. He was heavy-set and taciturn, </p><p>a little up in years—about sixty—rather </p><p>shortish, bald, keen-featured, sailow-com- </p><p>plexioned. He wore a full beard, black in- </p><p>terwoven with gray, black that had lost </p><p>its color in places, a beard long and square </p><p>that gave him a religious, almost patri- </p><p>archal appearance. But his eyes were most </p><p>impressive—no, impressive is not the word </p><p>—they were disconcerting, bewildering as </p><p>a strange child’s. </p><p> Their color was black, a color not uncom-</p><p>mon or remarkable; but the strangeness, I </p><p>might almost say the weirdness, was in their </p><p>expression. Imagine a perpetual painful </p><p>frown, thick eyebrows, long, dark eyelashes,</p><p>and a look that seemed troubled and ap- </p><p>pealing as if questioning Fate. And with this </p><p>a spasmodic restlessness. At times the eyes </p><p>hardened. If they were turned at one, they </p><p>seemed bright and probing, abnormally so; </p><p>but mostly they looked beyond one as if seek- </p><p>ing something, as if seeing into the unseen. </p><p> In the Spring of 1907 I signed on as second</p><p>mate in the Aladdin at Liverpool, where the </p><p>ship was owned, and took the train across </p><p>the country to Newcastle where she was </p><p>loading. I was excited. It was to be my </p><p>first long trip; the itinerary that the owners </p><p>had mapped out to me was:Newcastle, Bom- </p><p>bay, Colombo, Hongkong; textiles and ma- </p><p>chinery from Newcastle to Bombay, rice </p><p>from Bombay to Colombo, tea from Co- </p><p>lombo to Hongkong. </p><p>141 </p><p>142 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> I was becoming aware of the vastness of</p><p>the world; I was going to the vast mys- </p><p>terious Orient. The very name had a charm </p><p>and a fear; it was as far removed from the </p><p>commonplaces of existence as the stars are </p><p>from the moon. </p><p> I left Liverpool late one evening, curled</p><p>up in my seat and slept soundly through the </p><p>night. Before dawn I woke up feeling sick, </p><p>a curious smell was assailing my nose, an </p><p>insidious pungent smell. I roused myself </p><p>and looked out into the departing night. </p><p>Gas lamps burned feebly in the gloom; two- </p><p>story houses, steep-roofed and desolate, </p><p>huddled close together along the embank- </p><p>ment. They seemed dead, blind and dead. </p><p>The windows were dark; black niches in the </p><p>pervading gloom, empty eye-sockets look- </p><p>ing out upon the world unseeing. </p><p> Farther off somber chimneys reared</p><p>against the sky from which rose slowly thin </p><p>clouds of smoke, soaring heavenward like </p><p>prayers from burning hearts. Farther still I </p><p>saw glimpses of the dirty gray of the river </p><p>where small smoke-emitting things crawled </p><p>back and forth incessantly. Above to the </p><p>north lay the city, clinging to the high </p><p>hillside, and above all, the jagged, serrated </p><p>skyline of Newcastle. </p><p> The city had awakened when I stepped</p><p>off the train. Slowly I sauntered through </p><p>the streets toward the docks. The squalor </p><p>of the place was unthinkable; concentrated </p><p>ugliness everywhere, and fog. Busses rum- </p><p>bled along the pavement, horse-drawn </p><p>trucks clattered and screeched ’round cor- </p><p>ners, soot-smirched houses crowded the </p><p>streets. At long intervals there were breaks </p><p>in the lines of grimy buildings as if here and </p><p>there a tooth had rotted down to the jaw- </p><p>bone of rock in the city’s multiple rows of </p><p>teeth. </p><p> Passing along I saw interminable vistas</p><p>of whisky signs, gaudy clothing shops, pub- </p><p>lic-houses, restaurants, forbidding ware- </p><p>houses. Fat, florid, old women, baskets on </p><p>arms, strutted about importantly; sailors </p><p>strolled along, leisurely, hands tucked far </p><p>into the horizontal pockets of their dun- </p><p>garees; dirty children, barefooted, bare- </p><p>headed, ran about in the March slush at a</p><p>pretense of play. The squalor seemed to </p><p>be slowly strangling me. I longed for the </p><p>sun, for the East, for the Orient. </p><p> At last I came to the docks. Here, too,</p><p>the squalor persisted. The Tyne was in- </p><p>credibly dirty, yellowish brown and slug- </p><p>gish, a slovenly prostitute of commerce. A </p><p>pall of fog and smoke hovered over the </p><p>water and hid the farther side. Black im- </p><p>posing bridges, rooted in granite, hung sus- </p><p>pended in the air like fingers pointing ac- </p><p>cusingly into the mist. </p><p> Swift, powerful tugs scooted from fog-</p><p>bank to fog-bank, sometimes alone, some- </p><p>times with blunt-nosed barges in their </p><p>wake. An irregular fence of masts and </p><p>funnels lined the wharves beyond the </p><p>ramparts of the dock-sheds, and a noise </p><p>as of a carnival of devils rose from the </p><p>loading and unloading ships. </p><p> Again commerce, the strident discords</p><p>that constitute the symphony of commerce: </p><p>the heavy rumbling of trucks, the clanking </p><p>of chains, the screeching of whistles, the </p><p>pounding of winches, the clanging of bells, </p><p>the groaning of donkey-engines, the hiss of </p><p>escaping steam. Ships of all nations con- </p><p>tributed to the turmoil, ships not only from </p><p>all parts of Britain, but from Germany, </p><p>from France, from Norway, from Russia, </p><p>from Denmark, from Spain, from the Colo- </p><p>nies. </p><p>IN THIS international exposition </p><p>of industry and enterprise I found </p><p>the Aladdin, of Liverpool, a fine </p><p>ship, a ship to be proud of; long, beautiful </p><p>lines, a bow that bespoke speed—twelve </p><p>knots at least—as fine a two-thousand-ton </p><p>steamer as I have ever seen. She was </p><p>loading—it was somewhat of a shock— </p><p>printing-presses for Bombay. I did not </p><p>like it; it did not harmonize with my con- </p><p>ception of the East. Printing-presses spell </p><p>the death of mysticism, of romance, of </p><p>adventure. Printing-presses mean hard </p><p>logic and dry facts. </p><p> Most decidedly I did not like this inva-</p><p>sion of the charmed Orient by Occidental </p><p>civilization. I liked the other part of our </p><p>cargo—textiles—better; it suggested adven- </p><p>turesome trips into the jungle, trading with </p><p>savages, pioneering. Aboard the ship the</p><p>longshoremen held sway; all was bustle; </p><p>they worked as if anxious to forestall an </p><p>impending doom, as if their lives depended </p><p>on the quick loading of the disillusioning </p><p>printing-presses for Bombay. </p><p> Dodging up the gangway like an escaped</p><p>thief I made my way amidships and knocked </p><p>on a door that I guessed led to the captain’s </p><p>quarters. I heard a gruff voice say, </p><p>“Come in!” and entered cap in hand. </p><p>Captain Findlay’s Last Voyage </p><p>143 </p><p>Captain Findlay was sitting on a settee </p><p>at the back of the room, under the port- </p><p>hole, an open book, a Bible, in front of </p><p>him. </p><p> He gave me a look from under those</p><p>frowning eyebrows of his that sent the </p><p>jumps through me and made my eyes dance </p><p>about the room; in the next second I looked </p><p>at everything, at the ceiling, the walls, the </p><p>floor, everything except those eyes. There </p><p>wasn’t much to be seen, to be sure: a white </p><p>ceiling, sea-blue walls, a green carpet, a </p><p>chair, a bunk half hidden behind curtains, </p><p>charts, chronometers, a bookcase, a picture </p><p>of the Aladdin, a picture of the company’s </p><p>new offices in Liverpool, and a large photo- </p><p>graph of a girl, rather plump, stupid-look- </p><p>ing, with abundant hair handled with Puri- </p><p>tanical firmness, and wearing the redundant </p><p>flounces of forty years ago. </p><p> “Well,” he said sharply in a deep bass</p><p>voice, “what do you want?” </p><p> He was looking impatiently into his Bible</p><p>again, and I introduced myself awkwardly, </p><p>hurriedly. </p><p> “All right,” he said without looking up,</p><p>“your cabin is down the passage, the second </p><p>from the end. Get your duds aboard as </p><p>quickly as you can and report to—to the </p><p>mate. We sail in the morning.” </p><p> He resumed his reading; I was dis-</p><p>missed. </p><p> I installed myself in my cabin—my lug-</p><p>gage had arrived by this time—and went </p><p>to look for the mate. I didn’t find him; </p><p>he was ashore spending his last day in Eng- </p><p>land with his wife; but I found the chief </p><p>engineer, Duncan, a big easy-going, fath- </p><p>erly Scotchman, who took me about and </p><p>introduced me to the ship. </p><p> He was immensely proud of her; she</p><p>might have been some near relation of his </p><p>the way he gloated over her perfections. </p><p>It was with unconcealed relish that he </p><p>pointed to a brass plate that bore this in- </p><p>scription : </p><p>Harland &amp; Wolf, Belfast, 1904.</p><p> “Just three years old,” he said, shouting</p><p>above the din of the docks, “and a beauty— </p><p>cuts through the water like a liner—made </p><p>four trips to the East already.” </p><p> He crossed the deck, walking in true</p><p>sailor fashion, slippered feet far apart, his </p><p>big body swaying gently, slowly from side </p><p>to side like a square-rigger becalmed. </p><p> Some coolie stokers squatted in a corner</p><p>of the deck, yellow and fantastic, watching </p><p>the fracas at the hatches, the apparent </p><p>death-struggle between the dockers and </p><p>the unwieldy crated machinery, and chat- </p><p>tering at an incredibly rapid pace, that to </p><p>the uninitiated seemed like nothing but a </p><p>child playing with castanets. A bit of </p><p>Eastern mystery amidst the brutal plain- </p><p>ness of European civilization. </p><p> “How long has Captain Findlay had this</p><p>ship?” I asked when we had reached the </p><p>comparative quiet of the saloon-deck. </p><p> “He just joined the ship a month ago on</p><p>her return home to be overhauled. Barker, </p><p>who had her before him, was transferred to </p><p>a bigger boat.” </p><p> “And who is the first officer?” I inquired.</p><p>“Is he a new man, too?” </p><p> “Pennington? ‘Penny’ we call him. No,</p><p>he used to have your job—we didn’t </p><p>think he had it in him to get a mate’s berth, </p><p>but the owners evidently thought other- </p><p>wise—well, some queer things happen.” </p><p> He sighed meditatively.</p><p> A tall, angular individual, oil-bespattered,</p><p>his face like a clown’s decorated with black </p><p>smudges, appeared at the end of the passage </p><p>waving his arms excitedly, windmill fash- </p><p>ion, his black hair hanging in a disorderly </p><p>mass over the caverns of his eyes like a </p><p>thatch. He screamed nervously— </p><p> “Oh, Chief, we want you in the engine-</p><p>room!” </p><p> Then he disappeared.</p><p> Duncan looked after him with benevolent</p><p>contempt. With a gesture expressive of</p><p>good-humored despair and of irritated </p><p>resignation he said apologetically: </p><p> “That’s the second engineer—he seems</p><p>to be excited—I suppose he can’t fit a nut </p><p>to a bolt down there. Well, I have to see </p><p>what is the matter anyway.” </p><p> And he waddled off at a toad’s pace.</p><p> The voice of the harbor bellowed,</p><p>moaned, groaned, shrieked and hissed </p><p>throughout the day, far into the night. </p><p>Only in the few darkest hours after mid- </p><p>night did it rest, exhausted, while the men, </p><p>the pawns of this tremendous activity, </p><p>snatched the sleep that would sustain </p><p>them through another day, just another </p><p>day. Long before dawn the clamor began </p><p>again. Commerce blared her trumpets, </p><p>beat her drums, shrilled her sirens, rattled </p><p>her tambourines, and the strident discords </p><p>of the symphony sent the men like ants </p><p>back to their work. </p><p>144 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> I ROSE with the dawn, surprised</p><p>Bfrgd that I had slept in the tumult, </p><p>rose to work and adventure. I </p><p>looked out of the port-hole, saw that the </p><p>weather was clear, dashed some water in </p><p>my face, swore at the obstinacy of my hair, </p><p>hurried into coat and cap, bounded out of </p><p>the door and—stopped. Outside I saw a </p><p>strange sight. </p><p> The mate—I guessed it was he—was in</p><p>the passage, in his shirt-sleeves, his cap </p><p>balancing on the back of his head and a </p><p>blubbering female hanging about his neck. </p><p>He was a broad, middle-sized fellow, bow- </p><p>legged, blond, blue-eyed, with a loose </p><p>insolent mouth under a thick mustache. </p><p>Of the woman I saw only the back, a large, </p><p>formless, gaudy back. She was his wife, </p><p>he told me later; and I believed him. </p><p> She had spent the night aboard and was</p><p>now engaged in bidding him an effusive </p><p>farewell. When he saw me, he shot me </p><p>an irritated, ominous glance over the </p><p>woman’s heaving shoulder, and I hurried </p><p>aft out of sight. </p><p> The boatswain already had the crew on</p><p>deck, and we worked with a will battening </p><p>down hatches, clearing the decks of debris </p><p>and coal-dust, making ready for departure. </p><p>At length the pilot appeared on the bridge </p><p>along with the captain who, stern, patri- </p><p>archal, enigmatical, was the inspiration of </p><p>awe and uneasiness. </p><p> The blubbering female stood on the dock</p><p>clutching a much-used handkerchief. The </p><p>watchman ashore threw off the last hawsers; </p><p>we swung into the river and followed the </p><p>tide down-stream. Bridges opened before </p><p>us and closed behind, shutting out the </p><p>docks, shutting out the clamor, shutting </p><p>out England. </p><p> After we were well out of the harbor, the</p><p>two engineers, the mate and I breakfasted </p><p>together in the mess-room. It was our </p><p>last indulgence in sociability before sub- </p><p>mitting ourselves to the inexorable routine </p><p>of the sea. With the captain on the bridge </p><p>and the donkey-man in temporary charge </p><p>of the engine-room, we enjoyed our irre- </p><p>sponsibility. The meal was fine—we had</p><p>ham and fresh eggs, I remember—and </p><p>the easy motion of the ship brought on a </p><p>luxurious feeling of well-being, of content- </p><p>ment with life. </p><p> The mate alone was grouchy; he hadn’t</p><p>gotten over his irritation of the morning, </p><p>his embarrassment at the sight of me in the </p><p>passage. He grumbled continually, against </p><p>the ship, against the captain, against every- </p><p>thing in general. And the engineers taunted </p><p>him mercilessly. </p><p> “I wish they had transferred me, too,”</p><p>he said, scowling at nothing in particular, </p><p>the “they” referring to the owners, “I wish </p><p>they had put me in a decent-sized ship; </p><p>I have sailed in this tub about long </p><p>enough.” </p><p> “Of course,” jeered Thompson, the</p><p>second engineer, beaming with derision, </p><p>“they ought to have made you skipper </p><p>of that new boat instead of Barker.” </p><p> “She is a pretty good sort of tub all the</p><p>same, Penny,” said the chief consolingly. </p><p> “It’s the captain I object to—” the</p><p>mate resumed his declaration of grievances </p><p>—“I don’t like to sail under a man who </p><p>does nothing but read his Bible. It isn’t </p><p>natural. It’s uncanny. Why, it seems </p><p>that he is deathly afraid of the East.” </p><p> “Why?” I cut in, mystified.</p><p> He shrugged his shoulders.</p><p> “Nobody knows—perhaps because he lost</p><p>a ship out there in a collision five years ago. </p><p>She was the biggest ship the company </p><p>owned at the time, four thousand tons if </p><p>I remember right. Since then he has </p><p>never been east of Suez. He is afraid,” he </p><p>added contemptuously. </p><p> Duncan smiled broadly and drawled</p><p>blandly, insinuatingly— </p><p> “I have known mates who are not over-</p><p>brave.” </p><p> His assistant exploded with laughter.</p><p>He laughed violently, raucously, thrusting </p><p>his long lank jaw far in the direction of the </p><p>mate.</p><p> “That was a good one, wasn’t it, Penny?”</p><p>he rasped. “Do you remember that night </p><p>in Calcutta?” </p><p> The mate glowered at him viciously,</p><p>turned coppery red, glared at me and </p><p>bounded out of the mess. </p><p> “What happened that time in Calcutta?”</p><p>I asked. </p><p> “Nothing,” Duncan lied.</p><p> Meanwhile the Aladdin gathered speed,</p><p>sped on swiftly, silently, heedless of the </p><p>eccentricities of those that manned her, </p><p>demanding only her sacrifice of coal and oil </p><p>from her coolie minions in the stoke-hole. </p><p>She sped on. To the east was the sea, </p><p>merging into the horizon; to the west the </p><p>British coast, low, flat, criss-crossed with </p><p>hedges and dotted with houses, like dark </p><p>Captain Findlay’s Last Voyage </p><p>145 </p><p>scratches and pock-marks on the dismal </p><p>brown-gray March landscape. </p><p> Toward evening of the next day we</p><p>steamed into the Channel, sneaked in </p><p>between the sentinel chalk-cliffs of Dover </p><p>and Calais, by the age-stained, weather- </p><p>worn walls of Dover Castle ablaze in the </p><p>sun high upon the rocks, a relic of the </p><p>mystery of dark ages, of ancient adventure. </p><p>A flock of wild geese flew overhead—other </p><p>adventurers, the vanguard of Summer. </p><p> The scenes changed; pictures changed.</p><p>Ships passing in the night; abrupt gleams </p><p>from lighthouses piercing the darkness; </p><p>the swish of parting water before the bow </p><p>sounding startlingly loud. Night passed. </p><p>Again glimpses of land, black masses of </p><p>rock in the distance. Then the far stretches </p><p>of the sea, unbroken, limitless, eternal, </p><p>bridging the abysses of the earth. </p><p>BIN THE ordered monotony of our </p><p>first week at sea nothing happened; </p><p>but the atmosphere aboard assumed </p><p>a gloomy aspect. The uneasiness that was </p><p>to characterize this voyage was noticeable </p><p>already the first morning and threatened </p><p>to become &lt; chronic. It was undefinable </p><p>but undeniable. I had a great deal of </p><p>time to wonder about it, though I did not </p><p>discuss it with any one. </p><p> I saw the mate only when I relieved him</p><p>on the bridge—a fact which I considered </p><p>a Heaven-sent boon—and the second engi- </p><p>neer only when he happened to be delayed </p><p>in the engine-room and came popping out </p><p>on deck while I was on duty. Duncan </p><p>I saw oftener; he was on my watch, and </p><p>he had the habit of hanging over the rail </p><p>staring into the water for half-hours at a </p><p>time deeply immersed in contemplation </p><p>of the receding waves. Occasionally when </p><p>I passed he spoke to me. </p><p> The captain was all but invisible; he</p><p>kept to his cabin, ate there, slept there, </p><p>in the company of his Bible, his charts, </p><p>his chronometers, and that absurd picture </p><p>of the girl that had lived in another age. </p><p>He was, however, a good sailor; when </p><p>orders were needed, he emerged from his </p><p>seclusion like an omniscient spirit.</p><p> At times in the night he would appear on</p><p>the bridge, his sallow face looking un- </p><p>earthly white above his black flowing </p><p>beard, immovable, staring into the dark- </p><p>ness. His presence and his absence were </p><p>alike disconcerting; his absence as well as </p><p>10 </p><p>his presence dominated the ship. He was </p><p>an object for speculation, a background of </p><p>mystery. </p><p> We coaled at Gibraltar. Late one night</p><p>we approached the harbor. From afar we </p><p>saw the glow of lighthouses that stood </p><p>like blinking watchmen on either side of </p><p>the strait. Streams of light crept down </p><p>from the searchlights on the mountain </p><p>and crawled about on the water as if seek- </p><p>ing something inestimably precious. The </p><p>Aladdin slid slowly, timorously into the </p><p>harbor, nosed her way up to the dock, made </p><p>fast and rested for the first time since she </p><p>steamed out the Tyne. </p><p> When Pennington appeared in mess the</p><p>next morning, he looked even more in- </p><p>solently overbearing than usual, as if he </p><p>were the confidant of some grand per- </p><p>sonage, bearing State secrets locked in his </p><p>brain. He sat down in triumphant silence. </p><p>Outside on the dock a huge steam-shovel </p><p>groaned and exerted itself, feeding coal into </p><p>a chute that led to the belly of the ship. </p><p> “Did you see the captain last night?”</p><p>said the mate at length, unable to retain </p><p>at the same time his superiority and his </p><p>secret. </p><p> “No,” said I.</p><p> “Well,” he said in a confidential whisper,</p><p>“he was off his head last night, plumb </p><p>crazy. He kept muttering, ‘She will ram </p><p>us, she will ram us!’ and there wasn’t a ship </p><p>within half a mile.” </p><p> He surveyed his audience with provoking</p><p>condescension. </p><p> “What side did you sleep on last night?”</p><p>asked Duncan sympathetically. </p><p> “I’m telling the truth,” flared back the</p><p>mate.</p><p> “Of course,” mocked the second engi-</p><p>neer. “Was he as scared as you were the </p><p>time you ran afoul of that blooming Sikh </p><p>in Calcutta?” </p><p> He let loose his high-pitched, comic-</p><p>opera laugh, pointing his long ridiculous </p><p>jaw in Pennington’s face. </p><p> The mate put down his cup of tea with a</p><p>clatter, sputtered impotently, turned livid </p><p>with rage. </p><p> “How often do I have to tell you,” he</p><p>roared, “that I was not afraid of that </p><p>blasted Hindu! I didn’t want his woman! </p><p>I ran because I had an appointment to keep, </p><p>not because I was afraid! You—you— </p><p>you—you-” </p><p> He choked and coughed violently.</p><p>146 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “And to think,” chuckled the vindictive</p><p>Thompson, “that that blooming Sikh only </p><p>looked at you after you kissed his woman. </p><p>Was it your tender conscience that got </p><p>into your legs? Do you remember, Dun- </p><p>can, the beautiful tumble he took when </p><p>he turned the corner of the bazaar?” </p><p> And he laughed again his star-comedian</p><p>laugh, loudly, insinuatingly, mercilessly. </p><p>I, too, smiled; I could see bow-legged, </p><p>blustering Pennington running for his life. </p><p> Meanwhile he sat there dark as a thun-</p><p>der-cloud, fuming and sputtering invectives, </p><p>ludicrous, a caricature of some heathen god </p><p>of wrath. </p><p> These squabbles were common and never</p><p>quite settled; they were certain to break </p><p>out on the least provocation. The warfare </p><p>was continual, a sort of guerrilla warfare of </p><p>words. But I was little concerned, I was </p><p>a non-combatant. The East beckoned, </p><p>the lure of the East; I was interested only </p><p>in that; I had eyes but for the changing </p><p>scenes. • </p><p> Gibraltar was left behind; the cliff grew</p><p>smaller, less awesome; the cluster of palms </p><p>on the African shore retreated into the </p><p>landscape; the Mediterranean, blue, im- </p><p>mense, Summery, predominated, was our </p><p>world. And beyond that India was dream- </p><p>ing, a fascinating mystery overshadowing, </p><p>to me almost obliterating, the mystery of </p><p>the Aladdin, the strange uneasiness ema- </p><p>nating from the captain. </p><p> The low Egyptian shore hove into view,</p><p>beautiful, bathed in the sunlight, nour- </p><p>ished by the Nile, green as a pasture in </p><p>paradise. But soon this beauty passed </p><p>like a splendid dream; the desert ap- </p><p>proached, low, desolate, dismal, and in the </p><p>midst of this desolation, Port Said. </p><p> At this noisy, dirty outpost of the Orient,</p><p>this caravansary for Eastern trading-ships, </p><p>we coaled again, and then with our bunkers </p><p>filled steamed slowly into the canal and </p><p>through this gap in the desert passed like </p><p>proud emissaries of Occidental civilization </p><p>into the Red Sea, the hallway of the Orient. </p><p>A new kind of squalor revealed itself: arid</p><p>sand-swept plains flanked by bleak hills and </p><p>ruled over by a merciless sun. The heat </p><p>became almost intolerable; the iron decks </p><p>burned at the touch; distant objects, the </p><p>coast and the mountains beyond the coast, </p><p>seemed to waver and dance in the shim- </p><p>mering haze that overhung the sea. </p><p> It was degenerating. We became too</p><p> lazy, positively too lazy, even to eat. The</p><p>hurricane deck, covered imperfectly by </p><p>an awning, was the only comfortable spot </p><p>on board. As for the stoke-hole, with no </p><p>breeze blowing into the ventilators, it must </p><p>have been about unbearable; but some- </p><p>how the coolies bore it. </p><p> The lights of Mecca gleamed low over</p><p>the water on the port side. A P. &amp; O. </p><p>liner, homeward bound, had just passed </p><p>us, silently, like a thought born of the </p><p>darkness. The air was calm and cool </p><p>after the intense heat of the day. The </p><p>night was beautiful; the stars shone with </p><p>a lustrous brilliancy peculiar to desert and </p><p>sea. They seemed to have a touch of </p><p>humanness ; they seemed highly intellec- </p><p>tual, understanding, and almost femi- </p><p>ninely vain mirroring themselves in the </p><p>shining placid sea. </p><p> I was leaning over the railing in front</p><p>of the wheelsman, musing, dreaming about </p><p>the East, when I heard steps behind. It </p><p>was the captain, very correctly dressed </p><p>in a white cotton suit and white uniform </p><p>cap. He walked slowly, haltingly, a pain- </p><p>ful frown on his face and a look in his eyes </p><p>that had fear, terror in it. Suddenly he </p><p>exclaimed, almost screamed to the helms- </p><p>man: </p><p>“PORT the helm! Quick! Don’t </p><p>you see her lights? Do you want </p><p>her to ram us?” </p><p> Surprised, shocked by my carelessness</p><p>I looked about, rubbed my eyes, looked </p><p>everywhere—there were no lights! Some- </p><p>thing akin to a chill crept down my spine. </p><p> “Sir,” I said, “you are mistaken. There</p><p>are no lights.” </p><p> He looked at me, through me, beyond</p><p>me, with those awful eyes of his. </p><p> “What the devil!” he roared, then check-</p><p>ed himself with a convulsive effort and </p><p>looked away. “Well,” he said. “All right.” </p><p> He turned and left the bridge.</p><p> I stared after him in an imbecile fashion,</p><p>I fear; then resumed my former position. </p><p> “Sir,” said the sailor.</p><p> “Yes—what is it?”</p><p> “You don’t happen to know if the cap-</p><p>tain keeps liquors in his cabin, do you, </p><p>sir?” </p><p> “That is none of your business,” I said</p><p>as harshly as I could. </p><p> “Aye, aye, sir.”</p><p>This incident troubled me, worried me </p><p>Captain Findlay’s Last Voyage </p><p>147 </p><p>for a time; it seemed to bear out Penning- </p><p>ton’s hints; but soon it lost its freshness, </p><p>and while I did not forget it, it ceased to </p><p>worry me. I ascribed it to the heat, or </p><p>drink, or dope; thought it of little im- </p><p>portance. The nearness of the East was </p><p>responsible for this easy optimism; it was </p><p>the charm of the unknown, the singular </p><p>attraction of the unseen. </p><p> Through the current of the Strait of</p><p>Bab-el-Mandeb we escaped into the Ara- </p><p>bian Sea, and after coaling again at Aden, </p><p>a desolate cluster of houses and huts </p><p>roosting in the crater of an extinct volcano, </p><p>stood out to sea for India. India! I felt </p><p>like shouting. Bombay! The name had </p><p>a singular foreign flavor; it savored of </p><p>beauty and adventure and grotesque pagan </p><p>gods. Just a week more at sea. </p><p> The weather was fine, a clear sky and a</p><p>blazing sun most of the time, and a little </p><p>sea after we got into the trade-winds. On </p><p>the whole the trip was pleasant and un- </p><p>eventful, though I noticed a gradual change </p><p>in the captain. He seemed more restless; </p><p>he sought the bridge more, began to haunt </p><p>it in fact—I suppose his cabin was too hot </p><p>for comfort, even though it contained his </p><p>charts and chronometers and that old </p><p>picture, that picture of the Puritanical </p><p>girl. </p><p> It was disconcerting to have him on the</p><p>bridge; he disturbed my mind, but still— </p><p>still I could not help feeling sympathetic </p><p>toward him. There was something very </p><p>pathetic about him, that fixed expression </p><p>of wo about the eyes, for instance; and </p><p>that fearful searching of the sea, especially </p><p>at night, for some unseen danger. </p><p> The mate, too, had changed somehow.</p><p>His manners had become ingratiating; he </p><p>treated me like the proverbial long-lost </p><p>brother. Since there was no apparent </p><p>cause for this change, I concluded there </p><p>was something he wished me to do, some- </p><p>thing that for some reason or other he </p><p>didn’t want to do himself. I wasn’t </p><p>wrong. </p><p> Early in the morning on which we sighted</p><p>land, he joined me on the bridge. I was</p><p>on duty; the captain was below. He </p><p>began to talk—his chief business in life, it </p><p>seemed. </p><p> “So,” he said, “you have never been in</p><p>India before.” </p><p> I expressed a superfluous negation.</p><p> “It’s a fine country,” he said medi-</p><p> tatively. “Lot of women — first-class</p><p>whisky-” </p><p> For a moment he lost himself in antici-</p><p>pated joys, then regretfully returned to </p><p>the ship. </p><p> “I want you to be candid with me,” he</p><p>said confidentially. “What do you think </p><p>of the captain?” </p><p> “I suppose he is all right,” I replied</p><p>guardedly. </p><p> “That is what he isn’t,” he wagged his</p><p>head to emphasize the statement. “He is </p><p>off his head. It’s plain as daylight.” </p><p> After waiting in vain for an answer he</p><p>continued smirkingly: </p><p> “If I were you I would report him to the</p><p>harbor commission at Bombay. I would </p><p>•do it myself if I hadn’t a wife at home.” </p><p>This last was an obscure point. His </p><p>wife at home seemed to me to be an irrele- </p><p>vant factor that had nothing to do with </p><p>the affair; but I did not contradict him; </p><p>for the moment I had forgotten everything </p><p>concerning the ship. India, the paradise </p><p>of my dreams, was taking shape, becoming </p><p>real, rising out of the ocean, meeting me. </p><p>All that I had hoped it to be it seemed to </p><p>be; beautiful, full of mystery, fraught with </p><p>an unfathomable meaning. </p><p> Slowly it came nearer. Soft velvety</p><p>greens became visible everywhere; palms </p><p>and a luxuriant undergrowth of jungle </p><p>hedged in the coast, the city, the islands </p><p>in the bay, the shelves of rice-fields that </p><p>like steps for a mighty god mounted to the </p><p>inland hills. </p><p> The captain was on the bridge, calm,</p><p>efficient, patriarchal. I began to doubt</p><p>the soundness of my memory; the incident </p><p>in the Red Sea seemed preposterous, un- </p><p>believable; yet still, still .... </p><p> Duncan, whose attitude toward me had</p><p>assumed a benevolent fatherliness, volun- </p><p>teered as my guide on my first excursion </p><p>ashore in this land of beauty and mystic </p><p>dreams. The first glance of the inner </p><p>harbor had been disappointing. It re- </p><p>minded me of that hotbed of commerce, </p><p>Newcastle. Vistas of wharves and quays; </p><p>ships of many nationalities: English, </p><p>Dutch, French, Norwegian and a solitary </p><p>steamer flying the Stars and Stripes of the </p><p>United States. </p><p> The noise and the bustle were here, too,</p><p>the discordant symphony of trade. Only </p><p>the dockers were different. They were </p><p>children of the East, sandaled, turbaned, </p><p>148 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>dark, sinuous in their movements and </p><p>mysterious. One wondered whether they </p><p>felt like white men, thought like white men, </p><p>died like white men. They were a profound </p><p>enigma. </p><p> The city itself was Eastern, unmistakably</p><p>so, picturesquely so; even the Victoria </p><p>railway terminus, with its opulent archi- </p><p>tecture, its lavish decorations, its towers </p><p>and minarets,»*even to the statue perched </p><p>high on its dome, was Oriental, Indian; it </p><p>might have been the palace of some fabled </p><p>maharajah. </p><p> Near this terminus I received one of my</p><p>strongest impressions of this first intimate </p><p>view of the East. Curious that a beggar </p><p>should make such a profound impression, </p><p>but he did. He seemed to typify the </p><p>dignity, the fatalism of the East. He was </p><p>old, his straggly beard white, his eyes </p><p>sightless. His turban was a medley of </p><p>colors; a kaftan of white cotton covered </p><p>his lean body. But it was the bearing of </p><p>the attenuated figure that gripped me. </p><p> He seemed more like a statue, a statue</p><p>with a hoarse mechanical voice, than a </p><p>human being. His spirit seemed to have </p><p>left the body leaning against the wall, </p><p>while it flew untrammeled to other spheres. </p><p>He seemed at once to be a true representa- </p><p>tive of the East and a contrast to the </p><p>motley crowds that passed him by with </p><p>graceful, gliding, rhythmical movements. </p><p>LATE in the afternoon something </p><p>happened that rather marred our </p><p>keen enjoyment in the pilgrimage </p><p>ashore; certainly it disturbed our minds. </p><p>We were drinking tea in the Kapad Bazaar, </p><p>sitting near the main entrance, when a </p><p>person we knew well came in. He didn’t </p><p>appear to be looking for company, so we </p><p>remained silent, unseen. </p><p> He looked about furtively, as if ashamed</p><p>to be there, sneaked up to a fakir’s booth </p><p>and hurriedly bought a heathen charm. </p><p>It was guaranteed, so an inscription in bad </p><p>English above the booth said, to avert </p><p>danger from evil spirits, bad luck, wild </p><p>animals and several other more or less </p><p>fantastic things, besides reserving for the</p><p>bearer a berth in the Mussulman’s paradise. </p><p> The buyer was Captain Findlay. He</p><p>sneaked out again, pushing his way rapidly </p><p>through the throng. We stared after him, </p><p>nonplused. Why did he want the charm? </p><p>Why the secrecy? What new inconsistency </p><p>had arisen in his character? Hitherto he </p><p>had pored over his Bible, now he bought </p><p>heathen charms! The two things did not </p><p>seem to harmonize. The incident awakened </p><p>fresh misgivings, fed the old uneasiness. </p><p> “Wonder what ails Findlay?” I said to</p><p>Duncan when we were at last making our </p><p>way back to the ship, away from the </p><p>fascinating life of the city. </p><p> He pondered awhile, lifted his cap and</p><p>scratched his head. </p><p> “I don’t know,” he confessed. “He</p><p>seems sane enough whenever I happen to </p><p>see him. I don’t like it though. I feel </p><p>in my bones that something is wrong.” </p><p>“The mate wants me to report him to </p><p>the harbor commission,” I said. </p><p> “Don’t you do it, my lad. Do what</p><p>Penny orders you to do—you have to do </p><p>that, you know—but never do what he </p><p>asks you to do. He is a cheap edition of </p><p>a man, a sixpenny affair. I never could </p><p>stand him since that time in Calcutta.” </p><p>“Well,” said I, “I don’t think Findlay </p><p>is quite rational.” </p><p>“We will watch him, and if he goes off </p><p>his head entirely, we will cable the owners.” </p><p>It never occured to the honest Scotchman </p><p>that there might not be time for that; </p><p>that something might happen suddenly. </p><p> “It is all Penny’s business, anyway,”</p><p>he grumbled irritably. </p><p> Bombay was wonderful but too hot for</p><p>comfort. I explored the city and the </p><p>environs; and I watched the coolie dock- </p><p>hands struggle with the clumsy crated </p><p>printing-presses just as I had watched </p><p>the longshoremen at Newcastle. Again </p><p>I felt a sharp disappointment. </p><p> I foresaw the time when the enchantment</p><p>of the East would become articulate, would </p><p>become commonplace, staring at one from</p><p>between the covers of books. Hardly were </p><p>the holds emptied, before they were filled </p><p>again, this time with rice for Colombo, </p><p>and chests of opium for Hongkong. </p><p> Bombay dropped behind, sank slowly</p><p>below the horizon, shrouded with palms. </p><p>Other beauties arose, other pictures were </p><p>unveiled, as beautiful, as grand. The </p><p>Malabar coast was a revelation of soft </p><p>luxuriance, a mute eloquent splendor. The </p><p>palm-fringed coast; the terraced table-land; </p><p>and farther back, lofty wooded hills. And </p><p>with this a faint aroma, a tropic languor, </p><p>heat and a limpid blue sea. </p><p> Captain Findlay behaved strangely.</p><p>Captain Findlay’s Last Voyage </p><p>149 </p><p>Possibly he wasn’t mad yet—at least he </p><p>had moments of sanity—but if ever I saw </p><p>a hunted, haunted man it was he. I think </p><p>he realized his strange behavior and fought </p><p>against it, blindly, hopelessly. He began </p><p>to read his Bible again, shut up in his cabin </p><p>with his charts and chronometers and that </p><p>picture on the wall. Somehow I could not </p><p>forget that picture; it seemed to be a part </p><p>of this slow silent tragedy. </p><p> Findlay was sick, deathly sick—with fear.</p><p>Fear of madness, and then at times the fear </p><p>of the other thing that I couldn’t see, a </p><p>phantom ship that seemed to pursue us, </p><p>that he was always watching for and fleeing </p><p>from. He seemed hardly to sleep; most </p><p>of the night he spent on the bridge, pacing </p><p>restlessly to and fro, sometimes muttering </p><p>incoherently, thinking aloud in snatches, </p><p>and in these mutterings two names were </p><p>ever recurring: “Estelle” and “Martha.” </p><p>But generally he was silent, brooding, </p><p>melancholy. </p><p> Only once did he speak to me directly.</p><p>As usual in the dead of night he emerged </p><p>from his den and began to pace the deck </p><p>irresolutely with sporadic flashes of deter- </p><p>mination, always scanning the sea with </p><p>painful vigilance. Suddenly he joined me </p><p>at my post ahead of the pilot-house. His </p><p>eyes wandered from me to the ship, to the </p><p>sky, to the sea, resting at last on the </p><p>distant retreating horizon. </p><p> “How is it with your soul?” he asked in</p><p>low unearthly tones that conjured up </p><p>visions of death and damnation. </p><p> Confused and irritated I murmured</p><p>something, some stupid conventional re- </p><p>mark about not having thought of it, </p><p>had no opinion in fact, which was the truth </p><p>as far as it went. </p><p> “A sailor’s life is full of dangers,” he said</p><p>hesitatingly as if reciting a half-forgotten </p><p>lesson. “We live today and are dead to- </p><p>morrow. The sea, the sky, the wind are </p><p>alike our enemies, aye, even the hands of </p><p>man and God are raised against us. I have </p><p>seen men, aye, and women, aye, and chil- </p><p>dren, hale and hearty at sunset that never </p><p>lived to see the dawn of another day.</p><p>Prepare your soul, young man, before— </p><p>before-” </p><p> He broke off, his eyes dilated, and an</p><p>agonized whisper was wrung from his </p><p>lips: </p><p> “There she is again! God, will she never</p><p>let me be!” </p><p> “You are mistaken, sir,” I said, oddly</p><p>stirred, “there is nothing there.” </p><p> He looked at me, his eyes abnormally</p><p>large and feverish, wiped his forehead </p><p>with a trembling hand, smiled a ghastly </p><p>smile like a soul in torment, and left the </p><p>bridge. </p><p> “What do you think of it?” I asked</p><p>Duncan the morning of the day we were </p><p>due to arrive at Colombo. </p><p> We were messing together before going</p><p>on duty. He ate his bacon reflectively, the </p><p>depth of; his thoughts revealed by the </p><p>thoroughness of his chewing. </p><p> “Well,” he said finally, “the whole thing</p><p>is queer, no doubt. But after all nothing </p><p>has happened.” </p><p> “It gives one a mighty uncomfortable</p><p>feeling, though,” said I. </p><p> “I agree with you,” he admitted re-</p><p>luctantly. “I don’t know why, but it </p><p>seems to me that Findlay is living two </p><p>lives, sailing in two ships at the same time; </p><p>that is, when he is rational, he commands </p><p>the Aladdin, and when he isn’t—well— </p><p>quite normal, he seems to think he has </p><p>charge of quite another ship. It makes </p><p>a fellow lose his appetite.” </p><p> He laid down his knife and fork dis-</p><p>gustedly. </p><p> “I suppose,” I said, “we can put up</p><p>with it.” </p><p>“It won’t kill us at any rate—by the </p><p>way, what is Penny saying to you about it?” </p><p>“Nothing. I suppose he is offended </p><p>since I didn’t report the captain to that </p><p>commission at Bombay.” </p><p> “Well, he has said a lot to me, and I</p><p>shouldn’t be surprised to hear he has been </p><p>pestering Thompson, too. That fellow is </p><p>as cheap as his nickname and as brave as a </p><p>cuttlefish.” </p><p> He was indignant. He hauled out a</p><p>piece of tobacco, bit into and tugged at it, </p><p>energetically, with his teeth. </p><p> “I am not,” he continued as an after-</p><p>thought, “so sure I’d rather sail with a sane </p><p>man like Penny, for instance, as skipper, </p><p>than with a man like. Findlay, though no </p><p>doubt he is crazy.” </p><p> The coast of Ceylon came nearer, grew</p><p>magically, green, picturesque, magnificent, </p><p>washed by white surf at the shore, low, </p><p>rising gently to the abrupt slopes of verdure- </p><p>clad peaks, its beauty screened by dense </p><p>jungle broken 'occasionally by inlets lead- </p><p>ing like gateways into the heart of the </p><p>150 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>enchantment. Crude native catamarans </p><p>with bamboo masts and cotton sails </p><p>scooted along the coast. Small thatched </p><p>huts, hardly larger than dogs’ kennels, </p><p>were disclosed in the jungle by the nearer </p><p>view. </p><p> Suddenly the Aladdin curved ’round a</p><p>palm-covered promontory, and we entered </p><p>the harbor of Colombo. Again the shock </p><p>of disappointment, the loading and un- </p><p>loading vessels, the smoke-belching tugs, </p><p>the clamor, the strife, the mad rush of </p><p>trade. But also the exquisite charm of </p><p>the East, the domes and spires, the gor- </p><p>geous temples for grotesque gods. </p><p> Thompson was standing in the engine-</p><p>companion when I went forward after the </p><p>ship was moored to the wharf. </p><p> “Hello!” he called out shrilly, “do you</p><p>know what Penny has been telling me?” </p><p>“No,” I lied, “what has he been telling </p><p>you?” </p><p>“He wants me to make a fool of myself. </p><p>He says the captain is crazy, and wants </p><p>me to notify the harbor authorities, or </p><p>cable the king, or something of that sort.” </p><p>“Well, are you going to do it?” </p><p> “I am going to attend to my business*</p><p>and that means taking care of the engines </p><p>in this ship and not reporting the captain.” </p><p>He walked forward with me. </p><p> “Penny only wants the command of the</p><p>ship anyway,” he continued, “and I’d </p><p>rather be hanged than help him. He </p><p>expects some one else to do his dirty work </p><p>and get the glory himself—the sneak!” </p><p> He swore viciously.</p><p>AFTER a week in port, the Alad- </p><p>din started on the last leg of her </p><p>long trip half-way around the globe. </p><p>The coast of Ceylon, the palms, the pictur- </p><p>esque rocks of the southern shore, sank </p><p>into the ocean behind. The lighthouse </p><p>of Great Bassas gleamed fitfully, sleeplessly, </p><p>in the night until that, too, disappeared. </p><p>The heat was intense, relentless, in spite </p><p>of the monsoon, in spite of the sea, in spite</p><p>of the swift sure motion of the ship. </p><p> It was bearable for a well man, but hell,</p><p>and worse, for the sick. And Captain </p><p>Findlay was sick. Daily it became more </p><p>apparent, more irremediable. And we were </p><p>helpless. We knew how to handle a ship, </p><p>but a man, like Findlay—no—that we had </p><p>not learned. The only remedy for illness </p><p>we knew was quinine, and one can’t admin- </p><p>ister quinine for a sick mind, a mind haunted </p><p>by phantoms. </p><p> I have seen men in physical agony, seen</p><p>them suffer, seen them die; but nothing </p><p>that I had seen before was so pitiful, so </p><p>tormenting as this unfounded, growing </p><p>terror in the captain. It seemed to grip </p><p>his soul with inquisitorial mercilessness, to </p><p>put it on the rack, to quarter it. It became </p><p>steadily worse, nourished as it was by the </p><p>heat; but still it did not kill. </p><p> The look of profound misery on his face</p><p>deepened, became like a mask in fixedness. </p><p>He ate little; he slept not at all; he read </p><p>his Bible in the daytime without getting </p><p>any apparent comfort, and spent his nights </p><p>on the bridge pacing back and forth rest- </p><p>lessly, always searching the sea with </p><p>strained, glowing eyes. For long periods </p><p>he would remain silent, then he would </p><p>talk incoherently, fragmentarily, about </p><p>“Estelle,” “Martha,” “my wife,” and “my </p><p>children.” The strong man babbled like </p><p>a child. </p><p> I was puzzled about “Estelle” and</p><p>“Martha” and their connection with “my </p><p>wife” and “my children.” They were </p><p>always associated in his speech; a con- </p><p>nection there was, obscure, but vital. I </p><p>asked Duncan. He didn’t know. I asked </p><p>Pennington. He professed to be ignorant. </p><p> It was Findlay himself who solved the</p><p>riddle, partly at least. He seemed more </p><p>cheerful that night, though not more sane. </p><p>He talked to me, slowly, confidentially, </p><p>staring at me with bright feverish eyes </p><p>that sent chills crawling down my spine. </p><p> “I was reading in the Bible today,”</p><p>he said, leaning over to me, “and I came </p><p>upon a great passage. It said that those </p><p>that seek shall find. It was immensely </p><p>comforting. You know,” he lowered his</p><p>voice perceptibly, “you know I have my </p><p>wife along on this trip, and my grand- </p><p>children, Alice and Winton. They are </p><p>Mary’s children—Mary is my daughter— </p><p>and they are going to England to go to </p><p>school. </p><p> “But I have been much distressed lately</p><p>for the children are hiding from me. I </p><p>can’t find them. I have been looking for </p><p>them a long time. They are playing a </p><p>prank on their granddad, the little beggars. </p><p>I am worried about my wife, too. She </p><p>looks funny. She looks just as she did </p><p>forty years ago when I first met her. Her </p><p>hair is combed straight back, and she is </p><p>Captain Findlay’s Last Voyage </p><p>151 </p><p>dressed in a large flounced crinoline—all </p><p>starched, you know. She is always with </p><p>me in my cabin, but won’t come out on </p><p>deck. </p><p> “But I am worrying most about the</p><p>children; they ought not to hide from me. </p><p>I will find them, though, when we get to </p><p>England. It won’t take long; the Martha </p><p>is a good ship; she will make it in six </p><p>weeks. I will find them, the Bible says it. </p><p>Don’t you think so?” </p><p> “Yes,” I assented, humoring him, “I</p><p>think you will, sir.” </p><p> “The Bible says it,” he repeated, his</p><p>eyes wandering over the sea. “And be- </p><p>sides I have a charm.” </p><p> He chuckled slyly.</p><p> He became silent, and when he spoke</p><p>again he had forgotten my presence. </p><p> “It was all a dream,” he whispered.</p><p>“My wife and children were not drowned; </p><p>we were not run down that night in the </p><p>Strait of Singapore.” </p><p> The mate was jubilant. He considered</p><p>himself vindicated, upheld by Providence. </p><p>His insolent mouth, his bristling mustache, </p><p>his blue watery eyes, even his out-caving </p><p>legs assumed a what-did-I-tell-you attitude. </p><p>He seemed to think that Findlay’s madness </p><p>was due as a reparation for all he had </p><p>endured at the hands of the engineers. </p><p> His manners became exasperating, atro-</p><p>cious. He forgot everything but his own </p><p>perspicacity. He cut his watches below </p><p>short so that he might parade his unpre- </p><p>possessing personality on deck the more. </p><p>He made himself a nuisance, an eve-sore; </p><p>but he lacked the gumption to take the </p><p>command away from Findlay. </p><p> The weather continued hot and the</p><p>captain continued to get worse; that </p><p>haunting obsession became stronger; it </p><p>occupied his mind, dominated him. He </p><p>became grayer, thinner; the fire of his eyes </p><p>more feverish. He was an awesome, yet </p><p>a pathetic figure, a perpetual reminder of</p><p>man’s changeful fate, of the tyranny of </p><p>time and of memory, and of the infectious </p><p>melancholy of the sea. </p><p> He was a monument, an ironic monument</p><p>of life, to life, by life. It was pitiful to see </p><p>him lose his mind; but it was infinitely </p><p>worse to watch him lose his dignity, the </p><p>respect of his crew. He did, finally; and </p><p>it was by no means strange. </p><p> He seemed to be obsessed with the idea</p><p>that we were all going to die. Like a half- </p><p>crazed, hell-and-damnation evangelist, he </p><p>went about saying to the men in that </p><p>grave-like, even voice of his: </p><p> “How is it with your soul? Are you</p><p>ready to die?” </p><p> His insistence on the subject was un-</p><p>canny, demoralizing. It gave us the creeps </p><p>to hear that patriarchal madman like a </p><p>uniformed Jeremiah utter his doleful“ Wo, </p><p>wo.” To the superstitious sailors he was </p><p>a prophet of evil, despised and feared. It </p><p>broke down the discipline; we had difficulty </p><p>handling the men. </p><p> I tried to save him once—but only once.</p><p>Afterward I thought it advisable to leave </p><p>him alone, to pursue the road of his per- </p><p>verted fancies. He was talking to the </p><p>man at the wheel that night. I could hear </p><p>the sepulchral voice and that horror- </p><p>pervaded question: </p><p> “How is it with your soul? Are you</p><p>ready to die?” </p><p> “Sir,” I said impatiently, determined</p><p>if possible to divert his attention from the </p><p>subject of death, “sir, there is a ship </p><p>yonder.” </p><p> I was not prepared for what followed.</p><p>As if in a trance he came toward me, his </p><p>face livid, his eyes fixed and staring, his </p><p>limbs atremble, his lips moving can- </p><p>vulsively. </p><p> “Is it she?” he whispered hoarsely, “is</p><p>it the Estelle of Bristol? Why is she always </p><p>following me? Why can’t she leave me </p><p>alone? </p><p> He broke down, actually sobbed.</p><p> “Save us, oh Lord,” he prayed, “save us.</p><p>It’s the children she wants; she wants to </p><p>kill the little children. May she be </p><p>damned, damned, damned!” </p><p> He raised his clenched hands toward</p><p>heaven, but in doing so his eyes fell upon </p><p>the steamer, a German liner, and he </p><p>dropped his arms again, relieved, as if his </p><p>prayer had been fulfilled, and muttered: </p><p>“No, no, it isn’t she! Not yet, not </p><p>yet-” </p><p> It was with a deep sense of relief that</p><p>we entered the Strait of Malacca. Singa- </p><p>pore meant the end of the agony. The </p><p>case would be reported, investigated, re- </p><p>ported again, and, when all the red tape </p><p>was exhausted, finally settled. It was </p><p>odious but preferable. </p><p> The Malay Peninsula emerged from the</p><p>sea, coming nearer, rising higher. We saw </p><p>it first as a long dark streak, then as a low </p><p>152 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>mountain range, then as a dense impene- </p><p>trable jungle. The coast was low and ugly, </p><p>stretches of sandy beach, dim foliage of </p><p>mangrove-swamps, hideous mud-flats suc- </p><p>ceeding one another in a sordid dishearten- </p><p>ing panorama, a slum of the magnificent </p><p>East. </p><p>THEN the unforeseen happened </p><p>as it always will. When all seems </p><p>well and safe, something turns up </p><p>that entirely overthrows the firmest ex- </p><p>pectations, as if Providence delighted in </p><p>playing pranks with men, in tormenting </p><p>them, in letting them go their own ways, </p><p>mold their own destiny, until an expecta- </p><p>tion is assuming the guise of reality, when </p><p>suddenly the incalculable factor appears </p><p>and in a moment destroys forever the </p><p>equation. </p><p> It was about four in the morning. I</p><p>had just relieved Pennington on the bridge. </p><p>The captain was there as usual, an in- </p><p>auspicious figure in white flannels pacing </p><p>the deck restlessly on the port side. Now </p><p>and then he stopped to stare into the water. </p><p>The night was calm and clear, the sky </p><p>bright, the sea almost mirror-like. We </p><p>swung into the Strait of Singapore; its </p><p>long narrow reach lay like a river before us, </p><p>an inland river with magnificent woods on </p><p>the banks. </p><p> The lights and the shadowy outline of a</p><p>steamer appeared in the darkness ahead of </p><p>us, hugging the northern shore. As far as </p><p>I could make out she was a ship of about </p><p>three thousand tons, seemed heavily loaded, </p><p>and moved at a rather slow speed; a com- </p><p>mon type of freighter. There was nothing </p><p>distinguishing about her, and nothing inter- </p><p>esting. </p><p> I watched her idly; she was a con-</p><p>venient object on which to rest my eyes. </p><p>In comparison with the Aladdin she was </p><p>abnormally clumsy; she also seemed neg- </p><p>lected, like an abused wife. I remember </p><p>distinctly the last thought I had before </p><p>the commotion started. I was thinking </p><p>that if I were aboard her, I would have </p><p>her lanterns cleaned, especially the one </p><p>forward on her masthead. </p><p> Her course lay about a hundred yards</p><p>off our port side, and she might have been </p><p>about two hundred and fifty yards ahead of </p><p>our bows, when all suddenly a sharp com- </p><p>mand rang out behind me— </p><p> “Starboard the helm!”</p><p> I turned instantly, doubting my hearing.</p><p>A ship bearing down on our port side and </p><p>a command to starboard the helm! It was </p><p>an insane order given by a madman. Of </p><p>course it was Findlay. But a different </p><p>Findlay. </p><p> This man was not childish, irresolute,</p><p>full of fear, any longer; terror evidently </p><p>had at last shocked him into determination; </p><p>the spirit of his better days had arisen to </p><p>reinforce his frenzy. He was formidable </p><p>that night; he was dangerous. I felt it, </p><p>and the sailor at the wheel felt it. </p><p> “Aye, aye, sir,” he said, and actually</p><p>swung the ship over a point or two. </p><p> “Hold your course!” I roared, and turning</p><p>shouted to the man on the forecastle head </p><p>to call the mate. </p><p> But Findlay would not give in; he was</p><p>dominated by his single mad idea. Snatch- </p><p>ing a hatchet from the pilot-house wall he </p><p>brandished it aloft like a medieval warrior </p><p>and shouted in stentorian tones: </p><p> “I will save my ship! I will save my</p><p>ship!” And exultantly—“I have her at </p><p>last; she sha’n’t kill the children; she sha’n’t </p><p>pursue me any more!” </p><p> The wheelsman, terrified, in fear of his</p><p>life, ducked away and fled down on the </p><p>lower deck. Findlay grabbed the wheel </p><p>and swung it over. He had dropped the </p><p>ax. I jumped at him. He was strong, </p><p>however, stronger than I had thought. </p><p>I expected him to weaken, to back away: </p><p>but he didn’t; he fought. We struggled </p><p>madly, and even as we struggled I knew </p><p>the ship was obeying her rudder, turning </p><p>across the channel, heading for the vul- </p><p>nerable side of the other ship. I tried to </p><p>break away, made a rush for the wheel, </p><p>but stumbled. </p><p> A terrific blow hit me in the face, flusli</p><p>on the jaw; and the next instant I sprawleci</p><p>on the deck, dazed, helpless; but stili </p><p>somehow, able to think, to imagine things. </p><p>I knew the other ship could not suspeci </p><p>the truth; when she noticed our altered </p><p>course, she would swerve over, try to gt </p><p>nearer the shore, and expose her entire side </p><p>I tried to get up, but couldn’t. </p><p> I could think, I could plan, but my limb;</p><p>refused to obey, my nerves seemed para- </p><p>lyzed. The agony increased; each moment </p><p>each fraction of a moment, brought a fullei </p><p>realization of the impending tragedy. Ii </p><p>seemed a horrible dream, but I knew it wa </p><p>the terrible truth. </p><p>Inducement </p><p>153 </p><p> Then there was a moment, eternal it</p><p>seemed, of still intensity, of maddening </p><p>suspense, of growing horror. A voice </p><p>shrieked into the night— </p><p> “Are you mad?”</p><p> A siren shrilled. Then a deafening</p><p>crash, a rending of steel plates. </p><p> The impact threw me against the railing</p><p>in front. The shock restored me somewhat; </p><p>I rose unsteadily and scrambled to the </p><p>wheel. I signaled the engine-room for full </p><p>speed ahead. I had but one thought, to </p><p>keep the nose of the Aladdin in the side </p><p>of the other ship until she sank. There </p><p>was a wild scramble down on the deck, </p><p>curses, cries, orders—and Findlay? I shall </p><p>never forget it </p><p>He stood near the starboard life-boat, </p><p>in his spotless but somewhat wrinkled white </p><p>uniform, his sallow upturned face and bald </p><p>head gleaming white and ghastly like a </p><p>dead man’s, his arms stretched outward </p><p>and upward as if in rapturous prayer. </p><p>Then he began to chant, slowly, solemnly— </p><p>the doxology! I hope I shall never hear it </p><p>again under such circumstances! The </p><p>bustle, the cries, the curses and then that </p><p>solemn chant— </p><p> “Praise God from whom all blessings</p><p>flow-” </p><p> It was ludicrous and awful.</p><p> Finally he stopped, dropped his arms</p><p>to his sides, and I heard him pray, wearily </p><p>but distinctly— </p><p> “Now let Thy servant depart in peace.”</p><p> He went aft, hesitatingly, and disap-</p><p>peared forever. A sailor said afterward </p><p>that he had seen him at the taffrail, and </p><p>that later he had heard a splash. </p><p> The strange ship sank slowly; the</p><p>Aladdin clung to her side, tenaciously, like </p><p>an obstinate bulldog. But at last she </p><p>foundered; the yawning hole back of her </p><p>funnel would not be denied. Her crew </p><p>was safe aboard the Aladdin; we backed </p><p>away and stood by watching her go</p><p>down. </p><p> First she listed over to port, lay there</p><p>irresolutely for a moment, then she dis- </p><p>appeared swiftly, her masthead lights stick- </p><p>ing out of the sea, forlornly, long after the </p><p>hull had vanished. </p><p> But as she glided down into the water,</p><p>her after part rose high in the air, and I saw </p><p>in the sheen of the water and the glow of </p><p>the stars her name written in large letters </p><p>over her stern. It was the Estelle of </p><p>Bristol. </p><p> Call it chance if you like, but I call it</p><p>Fate. </p><p>INDUCEMENT </p><p> BY IRA SOUTH</p><p> THEIR songs all sing the open road,</p><p> And yet, by curious turn,</p><p> It’s not for the endless trail at all</p><p> That the wandering brethren yearn.</p><p> They make the ports unknown to call,</p><p> But dream in every clime</p><p> Of spreading wide their peaceful tents,</p><p> In some far happy time.</p><p> It’s searching out this resting-place</p><p> Their roving lives are spent;</p><p> They would lay a hearth and dig them wells</p><p> In the country of content.</p><p> And just behind yon sea-blue hill,</p><p> No man can surely say—</p><p> May lie the blessed slopes they seek,</p><p> To settle down for aye.</p><p>THE MAN WHO </p><p>WHIPPED A CITY </p><p>Author of “The Wise Man," “The Cross at Purgatory Fork,” etc. </p><p>thoroughfare were called North Riverside </p><p>and South Riverside. </p><p> The less fortunate lived in scrupulously</p><p>clean, honeysuckle-bordered little houses </p><p>that climbed the two slopes of the valley </p><p>in a very orderly fashion. A dozen manu- </p><p>facturing plants on the river below town </p><p>furnished employment for those who had </p><p>to work with their hands; the wealthy of </p><p>Westover owned those plants. </p><p> When the five years were almost gone,</p><p>Peter Huntley left Indiana and started </p><p>back to Tennessee to see whether his </p><p>Marian had forgotten. He feared she </p><p>had. A girl of eighteen, he told himself, </p><p>was too young to make promises covering </p><p>five years of time. </p><p> Peter arrived in Westover at noontime</p><p>on the fateful day. When he had had </p><p>luncheon at the inn, he dressed himself </p><p>smartly all in white save for a gray Norfolk </p><p>coat, and set out for a great sycamore tree </p><p>that stood on the river’s north bank at the </p><p>upper edge of town. All along the main </p><p>avenue he met people whom he instantly </p><p>recognized, but none of them recognized </p><p>him. Even old Judge Urhart, who had </p><p>known him exceedingly well, stared at </p><p>him blankly as he bowled past in a purring </p><p>six-cylinder car. </p><p> Huntley reached the shrine of his boyhood</p><p>154 </p><p>f "1HERE is nothing that a man may </p><p>hate so bitterly and at the same </p><p>t‘me l°ve so devotedly as his home </p><p>town. Young Peter Huntley hated </p><p>Westover because it had named him a </p><p>ruffian and a brawler when he was only a </p><p>good and quick fighter, and because it had </p><p>fleeced his father of the price of a mag- </p><p>nificent plantation. He loved Westover </p><p>because it was the home of his boyhood </p><p>and of the sweetheart who had agreed to </p><p>wait for him for five years without even an </p><p>exchange of letters. </p><p> Huntley had asked for five years in</p><p>which to make something of himself. No</p><p>letters were to be exchanged because all </p><p>Westover postmasters were tools of “Judge” </p><p>Urhart, who was Marian’s father and the </p><p>Big Boss of the entire county. </p><p> Westover was a beautiful little city.</p><p>Along a crystal-clear river it lay, in a </p><p>rather narrow valley. It had many stately </p><p>old maples, and many handsome old resi- </p><p>dences; in the warmer months it was a </p><p>veritable fairyland of roses and lilies and </p><p>honeysuckles. There was hardly a middle </p><p>class. Most of the people, by far, were </p><p>either rich or poor. All the former lived </p><p>on an avenue an eighth of a mile broad, </p><p>through the center of which the sparkling </p><p>river flowed; the halves of this pretty </p><p>The Man Who Whipped a City </p><p>155 </p><p>an hour before the appointed time, and </p><p>sat down on a stone to wait. The old </p><p>sycamore was to him the same gaunt, good </p><p>friend it had been in his earlier youth; the </p><p>only change he noticed was that the initials </p><p>and the date he had cut in the white bark </p><p>exactly five years before were now grown </p><p>over and dim. Peter rose, took out his </p><p>knife and renewed the letters and </p><p>figures. </p><p> Then he sat down and began to watch</p><p>his gold repeater religiously. He tried to </p><p>prepare himself for disappointment by </p><p>saying over and over: </p><p> “A girl of eighteen doesn’t know herself.</p><p>I needn’t hope. It’s silly.” </p><p> And each time there came, like an echo,</p><p>this from his memory: </p><p> “If I’m alive, Peter, I’ll meet you here</p><p>at three o’clock, five years from today.” </p><p>When at last his watch told him it was </p><p>three, he rose disheartenedly. Though </p><p>he had tried hard to brace himself for the </p><p>blow, he hadn’t done it; it staggered him. </p><p>He became bitter. What a fool’s paradise </p><p>he had been living in! All women were </p><p>like that, of course. Not only this woman, </p><p>but all women. . . . </p><p> There was the sound of dragging foot-</p><p>steps out to his right, and his heart paused </p><p>in its beating. He half turned and </p><p>looked. </p><p> “Marian!”</p><p> And then he stood aghast at that which</p><p>he saw. It was Marian who stood there </p><p>before him, but it was not the Marian </p><p>that he had known. The other Marian </p><p>had been supple and roundish, bright-eyed </p><p>and laughing, full of life as a robin, pretty </p><p>as a dawn in June. This girl was death- </p><p>white and pitifully thin; she was like the </p><p>ghost of the other Marian. </p><p> “I’ve had typhoid, Peter,” she explained,</p><p>in a voice that he barely heard. “Peter, </p><p>dear,” she went on in the same weak voice, </p><p>“I told you I’d be here to meet you at three </p><p>this afternoon if I were alive, didn’t I?</p><p>Well, I am here; but I’m afraid you’ll </p><p>have to carry me back. I got out of bed </p><p>and stole away—I could hardly dress </p><p>myself—Peter, I didn’t forget my promise </p><p>to you--” </p><p> She was in his arms long before she</p><p>finished speaking. Then she collapsed. </p><p>Huntley was a strong man; he carried her </p><p>as he would have carried a baby, only </p><p>more tenderly. And as he went down the </p><p>river, he swore at himself because he had </p><p>doubted that she would come. </p><p> When he reached the big brick and</p><p>granite home of Judge Urhart and his </p><p>daughter, the neighborhood had been </p><p>alarmed by the nurse. Word had been </p><p>telephoned to Marian’s father, and he was </p><p>just arriving, with the doctor beside him, </p><p>in his automobile. Huntley carried the </p><p>limp figure to a bed the nurse showed him, </p><p>and put it down carefully. The doctor </p><p>stepped to the bedside, and at that moment </p><p>the girl opened her eyes. </p><p> “I’m all right now,” she said.</p><p> Urhart hastily questioned the nurse.</p><p> “She must have been delirious,” the</p><p>white-clad woman told them. “She sent </p><p>me on an errand, and went out while I was </p><p>gone.” </p><p> Urhart seemed satisfied with the explana-</p><p>tion; but the doctor narrowed his gaze </p><p>and shook his head. </p><p> “She was getting along so well,” he</p><p>muttered. “I don’t see how she could </p><p>be delirious at this stage.” </p><p> After receiving assurance that his daugh-</p><p>ter was not much the worse for her exertion, </p><p>Urhart motioned to Huntley to follow and </p><p>then led the way to the library. The old </p><p>ex-judge was a tall, lean man with mutton- </p><p>chop whiskers, a sharp profile and a hard </p><p>mouth. In the library he turned upon </p><p>Huntley with a frown that would have </p><p>disconcerted a lesser man. </p><p> “Whom,” he asked, “have I to thank for</p><p>this service?” </p><p> “Don’t you know me, Judge?” smiled</p><p>Peter. </p><p> That smile was like pulling front teeth,</p><p>but the other happened to be Marian’s father. </p><p> “I’m Peter Huntley.”</p><p> The older man had not forgotten—and,</p><p>indeed, few other Westoverites had for- </p><p>gotten—the youthful peccadilloes of Peter </p><p>Huntley, whom they had named a brawler </p><p>and a ruffian because he had fought so </p><p>much. But now Urhart forced himself to </p><p>appear both grateful and glad to see Hunt- </p><p>ley. They shook hands. The rather </p><p>strained situation was relieved a few </p><p>minutes later by the abrupt entrance of </p><p>the Urhart family physician. </p><p> “Miss Urhart wishes to see the gentleman</p><p>who brought her back,” he said. </p><p> “She wishes to thank you personally,</p><p>Huntley,” the girl’s father chose to believe. </p><p>“Go on.” </p><p>Adventure </p><p>ANOTHER minute found Huntley </p><p>in Marian’s room. When she saw </p><p>him, Marian smiled and pointed </p><p>to a chair. </p><p> “Draw it up, Peter,” she invited, “and</p><p>sit down.” </p><p> Peter did so. He bent toward her.</p><p>“Maybe you shouldn’t talk, Marian.” </p><p>“I’ve got to, Peter. A little. Now tell </p><p>me about yourself. Tell me what you did </p><p>in those five years.” </p><p> “First,” Huntley began, “I tried to make</p><p>a business man of myself. But I couldn’t </p><p>do it. It made me fidgety to sit still all </p><p>the time. Then I went in for electricity. </p><p>I am now a very capable electrical engineer. </p><p>Are you—” he glanced toward the nurse, and </p><p>whispered this—“very much disappointed?” </p><p>Marian smiled. </p><p> “Oh, no, Peter. Listen: you can get a</p><p>position here, maybe. You see, we’re </p><p>putting in a dam and power-plant four </p><p>miles up the river. It’s to be municipally </p><p>owned and controlled. The city floated a </p><p>hundred thousand in bonds for it. Father’s </p><p>at the head of it; he’s mayor of Westover </p><p>again. See father, get the place, and—” </p><p>in a whisper—“try to make him like you </p><p>well enough to give us his permission— </p><p>I’m tired, Peter—I’ll have to let you go. </p><p>The nurse isn’t looking, Peter-” </p><p> Huntley kissed her slyly, bade her good-</p><p>by, and hurried back to the library. Old </p><p>Urhart seemed displeased at the length of </p><p>his stay. </p><p> “Your daughter,” Peter explained, “was</p><p>telling me about the new dam and power- </p><p>plant.” </p><p> Westover’s Big Boss brightened at once.</p><p>“It’s going to make money for us, Hunt- </p><p>ley. You see, we’re going to furnish juice </p><p>to two other towns besides this. Every- </p><p>thing is nearly ready now. By the time </p><p>we can locate a good engineer to take charge </p><p>of the plant—•—” </p><p> “I’m your man,” Huntley interrupted;</p><p>he couldn’t help it. “I’m a first-class </p><p>electrical engineer, if I do say it myself.</p><p>And I’ll work for you and old Westover </p><p>just a little cheaper than I’d work for </p><p>anybody else.” </p><p> For a moment Urhart seemed at a loss</p><p>to know what to say. At last he blurted: </p><p>“You’ll have to see Alden, Huntley. </p><p>He’s the contractor, and he is to find the </p><p>electrician. You remember Farnsworth </p><p>Alden, of course?” </p><p> At the mention of the name, the younger</p><p>man’s face clouded. Certainly, he remem- </p><p>bered Farnsworth Alden, contractor. </p><p>Alden had been one of the chief men of </p><p>that ring that had robbed his good old </p><p>father to the very bone of him—it had </p><p>been done mostly within the law, but to </p><p>the bone just the same. </p><p> Huntley controlled his feelings as well</p><p>as he could, and told Judge Urhart good-by </p><p>for the time being. </p><p> He was undecided as to just what he</p><p>was going to do. He believed that Marian’s </p><p>father would see that he did not get the </p><p>position he wanted, simply because he was </p><p>Peter Huntley. Moreover, he very heartily </p><p>disliked having to ask a job of a man whom </p><p>he detested as he detested Farnsworth </p><p>Alden. The Huntleys had a high old pride </p><p>in them, and Peter had as much of it as any </p><p>of the rest. </p><p> He went back to the inn, changed his</p><p>clothes, and shortly afterward boarded a </p><p>train for a neighboring town to visit his </p><p>parents. He found his father running a </p><p>little grocery store almost at a loss because </p><p>of the big heart he had in him. </p><p> When the evening meal was over, the</p><p>three of them, father and mother and son, </p><p>gathered in the sitting-room. Though it </p><p>was in June, the evening had fallen with a </p><p>chill, which was due to a recent rain, and </p><p>there was a fire in the grate. Old John. </p><p>Huntley lay back in his armchair and </p><p>stared silently and thoughtfully into the </p><p>glowing coals. His wife sat beside him; </p><p>and on the floor at her feet sat Peter, who </p><p>to her was a far greater person than a mere </p><p>king. </p><p> “I wish you’d tell me, dad,” Peter said</p><p>suddenly, “exactly how Westover fleeced </p><p>you. I’d like to know all about—the</p><p>details, you know.” </p><p> “I’d much rather not go over it, Peter,”</p><p>was the quick reply. </p><p> Almost immediately afterward, John</p><p>Huntley made an excuse to leave the room. </p><p>When the door had closed behind him, </p><p>Mrs. Huntley bent forward and put a </p><p>tender hand on Peter’s dark-brown head. </p><p> “You touched a sore spot when you</p><p>mentioned that, son,” said she. “He can’t </p><p>bear to even think about it. And if I were </p><p>not your mother, you probably wouldn’t </p><p>believe me when I tell you the reason: </p><p>It’s his great disappointment in humanity, </p><p>Peter. He went to Westover a gentleman, </p><p>The Man Who Whipped a City </p><p>157 </p><p>and he took it for granted that Farnsworth </p><p>Alden and the others were gentlemen too. </p><p>He trusted them too far. </p><p> “As to their methods of getting our</p><p>money,” she went on, “they induced him </p><p>to build a number of dwelling-houses, a </p><p>storehouse, and a factory, and they loaned </p><p>him about half of the necessary money; </p><p>then the Alden-Urhart bank failed very </p><p>shrewdly, and the crash came. But your </p><p>father’s lack of business sense was partly </p><p>to blame. He was a gentleman planter, </p><p>and not a business man. </p><p> “The thing I tried hardest to forgive is</p><p>this Peter: Alden and Judge Urhart—the </p><p>judge, Peter, was in it too—found certain </p><p>scoundrelly enemies of ours who were glad </p><p>to swear in court that they wouldn’t believe </p><p>your father’s oath; this was when he en- </p><p>tered suit to try to regain something of that </p><p>which we had lost.” </p><p> It was fortunate for her peace of mind,</p><p>perhaps, that she couldn’t see her son’s </p><p>face when she had finished speaking. It </p><p>was so white that it looked ghastly in the </p><p>ruddy firelight. Judge Urhart had done </p><p>that! His Marian’s father had done that </p><p>unspeakable thing! </p><p> Sitting there at his mother’s knee, there</p><p>at the first altar of life, big young Peter </p><p>Huntley told himself firmly that those </p><p>who had wronged his father must make all </p><p>the amends possible. It had to be done </p><p>for his father’s sake, to restore his father’s </p><p>faith in humanity; there was not the </p><p>tiniest scrap of cheap red vengeance con- </p><p>nected with it. </p><p> For he knew that a man, no matter how</p><p>good, who had lost his faith in his fellows </p><p>was little better than dead. . </p><p>ON THE following day, Peter </p><p>Huntley went back to the West- </p><p>over that he had both loved and </p><p>hated. He meant to put his pride in irons, </p><p>so to speak, and see Farnsworth Alden </p><p>immediately, to ask for the position at the </p><p>new power-plant; he would accept it at </p><p>any salary. That would give him a reason </p><p>for being in Westover; he could then work</p><p>at the gigantic task of righting the wrong </p><p>unsuspected, if it were necessary. He did </p><p>not yet know how he was going to under- </p><p>take that task, but he did know that he </p><p>was going to undertake it. </p><p> Peter walked up the river to the dam.</p><p>Four miles is no distance for such a man </p><p>as Peter Huntley—who never smoked and </p><p>never drank and who slept eight hours </p><p>every night. The little journey required </p><p>but an hour of his time. </p><p> Alden was not there when he arrived,</p><p>and he began to look over the work. The </p><p>dam was about three-fourths finished. </p><p>The power-plant was all ready except for </p><p>the setting up of the switchboards and </p><p>the adjustment of the turbines and gen- </p><p>erators. And when Huntley had seen all </p><p>there was to see, every nerve in him was </p><p>tingling because of a most amazing dis- </p><p>covery that he had made. That discovery </p><p>was this: </p><p> The material of the dam contained less</p><p>than half the percentage of cement it </p><p>should have had to make it safe; the </p><p>power-plant was cheaply erected; the </p><p>machinery, turbines and generators and </p><p>all, was second-hand and of old types and </p><p>painted and polished to deceive inex- </p><p>perienced eyes. </p><p> Marian Urhart had acquainted him with</p><p>the fact that a hundred thousand dollars </p><p>of the people’s money was going into the </p><p>project; but it was not really costing </p><p>much more than fifty thousand—the same </p><p>ring that had robbed his father was now </p><p>preparing to rake down at least forty </p><p>thousand in graft! </p><p> “The fools!” said Huntley to himself, when</p><p>the truth had fully dawned. “They’ve </p><p>built this rotten sand dam above the town </p><p>instead of below—and the first high water </p><p>is sure to break it, and the town will be </p><p>swept away!” Peter Huntley knew. He </p><p>added — “I’d have thought Alden had </p><p>better judgment than he’s shown here, sure.” </p><p> But Alden was essentially a builder of</p><p>buildings, and not a builder of dams. </p><p> The contractor arrived in his six-cylinder</p><p>runabout half an hour later. Instead of</p><p>Huntley’s finding him, he found Huntley. </p><p>He was a big and pudgy, ruddy-faced man, </p><p>and his countenance was peculiar in that </p><p>it was both piggish and shrewd. </p><p> “What’s your business here?” he wanted</p><p>to know. </p><p> There was a hostile light in his pale gray</p><p>eyes. </p><p> “I’m looking for an electrician’s job,”</p><p>was the very prompt answer. “Judge </p><p>Urhart suggested that I see you.” </p><p> “Is your name Huntley?”</p><p> Alden, like most of the other Westover-</p><p>ites, had failed to recognize him. </p><p>158 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Peter Huntley. I can get fine letters of</p><p>recommendation from two big Indiana </p><p>corporations, and I’ll take the place at a </p><p>very reasonable figure. You see, Westover </p><p>is my home town.” </p><p> “You’re too late,” Farnsworth Alden said</p><p>sourly. “I’ve got a man coming from Vir- </p><p>ginia. If you’ve no further business with </p><p> He had lied. He had no man coming</p><p>from Virginia, and the other knew it. </p><p>Huntley went white with anger. Alden </p><p>might have remembered that the big </p><p>young man there before him had been a </p><p>quick fighter all his life, but he didn’t. </p><p>With a burning insolence, he went on: </p><p>“You’d better be going. We’ve got noth- </p><p>ing here for you.” </p><p> They were standing on the river’s bank,</p><p>just below the new building. Huntley </p><p>took a step forward and seized Alden’s </p><p>coat lapel. </p><p> “But I’ve got something for you, you</p><p>-grafter!” he growled. “And it’s this: </p><p>I’m going to tell the people of Westover </p><p>of your graft scheme; I’m going to tell </p><p>them all about this rotten dam that will </p><p>be a constant menace to them, about the </p><p>old and worn-out machinery, about every- </p><p>thing; and I’m also going to wire the </p><p>State’s committee on public safety! You </p><p>may hoodwink people who don’t know </p><p>anything about dams and power-plants, </p><p>but you sure can’t hoodwink the authori- </p><p>ties—you lying, stealing, villainous grafter!” </p><p>Farnsworth Alden went guiltily purple. </p><p>“Graft scheme?” he throated. “Hunt- </p><p>ley, you’re crazy!” </p><p> “Oh, am I?”</p><p> The younger man’s smile was white and</p><p>dangerous. </p><p> “I know something about graft schemes,</p><p>crazy or not. The rest of the ring lets the </p><p>contract to you for a hundred thousand; </p><p>it costs you sixty, with a handsome profit </p><p>in that for yourself; then you split the </p><p>remaining forty with the rest of the ring.</p><p>It’s polite robbery, which is on a par with </p><p>holy murder. Would you mind telling me </p><p>just how much I missed it in my figures, </p><p>Mr. Farnsworth Alden?” </p><p> If only he had thought of Marian, he</p><p>would have been more careful. But he </p><p>didn’t think. Alden had called his hand, </p><p>and he had been too intensely human to </p><p>resist the temptation of showing that it </p><p>was a big one. </p><p> Alden had by this time recovered his</p><p>presence of mind. </p><p> “What do you know about machinery and</p><p>dams?” he roared. He really believed the </p><p>dam would hold in any water. “You </p><p>scapegrace, I remember the reputation you </p><p>used to have in Westover. Do you think </p><p>I would put a man like you in charge of </p><p>this plant? Not on your life! About the </p><p>first thing we knew, you’d be entering suit </p><p>against us, like your whining father-” </p><p>THAT was as far as he was per- </p><p>mitted to go with it. Peter Hunt- </p><p>ley struck the sneering fat mouth </p><p>so hard that he knocked out two teeth and </p><p>splintered a bone in his hand. Alden </p><p>reeled backward, and before he could fall </p><p>Huntley had driven home another blow. </p><p>This sent him into the river, which was </p><p>shoulder-deep at that point. He came up </p><p>puffing and sputtering. Huntley, blind </p><p>with the pent-up anger of years, sprang </p><p>to the water and hammered the pudgy, </p><p>piggish face again. </p><p> But in all that he had been unwise.</p><p>He had but let himself fall into a trap that </p><p>the resourceful Alden had laid for him— </p><p>but Alden, it is safe to say, hadn’t dreamed </p><p>that he would fall so quickly and so hard! </p><p> The grafting contractor had been cor-</p><p>nered tight. He saw the State peni- </p><p>tentiary looming gray ahead of him. The </p><p>easiest way out of that corner was to goad </p><p>Huntley to fight him, and then have Hunt- </p><p>ley tried and imprisoned on a charge of </p><p>assault. A ring magistrate would do it. </p><p> Once in the Westover jail, the trouble-</p><p>maker would have no opportunity to com- </p><p>municate with the State authorities or </p><p>alarm the populace. Within two weeks </p><p>the dam would be finished and therefore</p><p>proof against investigations, and the people </p><p>would be too well pleased with their elec- </p><p>trically-lighted town to pay any attention </p><p>to a howler of calamity. </p><p> A score of workmen rushed to their</p><p>employer’s aid. They dragged him, gasp- </p><p>ing for breath, from the water. Huntley </p><p>calmly waded out and began to look for </p><p>his hat, which he had lost. </p><p> “Hold him!” thickly blustered Alden.</p><p>“Hold that man—he’s a lunatic—he must </p><p>be arrested!” </p><p> Half a dozen men ran to Huntley and</p><p>clapped their sand-plastered hands on his </p><p>shoulders and arms. </p><p>The Man Who Whipped a City </p><p>159 </p><p> “Keep off!” Peter ordered sharply, throw-</p><p>ing them aside. </p><p> “Hold him, I say!” cried Alden.</p><p> At that the men, a round twelve of them</p><p>this time, sprang determinedly upon Hunt- </p><p>ley. There was a lively struggle, but it </p><p>lasted for less than a minute. One man, </p><p>especially if he be handicapped by a shat- </p><p>tered finger-bone, can not hope to hold his </p><p>own long against a dozen sturdy laborers. </p><p> They tied Huntley’s hands behind him,</p><p>and one of them struck him brutally at the </p><p>enraged contractor’s command when he </p><p>protested. Then they bound him hard and </p><p>fast in Alden’s runabout, and Alden </p><p>whisked him to Westover and to Magis- </p><p>trate Gurland’s office without arousing </p><p>the notice of the people. </p><p> Immediately after a hastily whispered</p><p>conference between Farnsworth Alden and </p><p>the magistrate, Peter was given a semblance </p><p>of a trial. There was small need of wit- </p><p>nesses, Gurland said; the contractor’s still </p><p>bleeding face furnished all the evidence </p><p>necessary. Huntley endeavored to present </p><p>his side of the affair, but a deputy-sheriff </p><p>promptly hushed him. </p><p> “Assault with intent to kill,” droned</p><p>the magistrate. “Eleven months and </p><p>twenty-nine days.” </p><p> The deputy started away with his pris-</p><p>oner. Alden bent toward Magistrate Gur- </p><p>land and whispered a reminder. </p><p> “In solitary confinement,” added Gur-</p><p>land. “Watch him. He’s dangerous.” </p><p> Into the dingiest, most dismal cell of the</p><p>Westover jail went well-dressed Peter </p><p>Huntley, and the heavy lock clicked behind </p><p>him. This cell was in the jail’s basement, </p><p>and the only light it had struggled in </p><p>through a horizontally narrow, barred </p><p>window set on a level with the ground </p><p>outside and facing a blank stone fence. </p><p> The only furniture was a wooden box</p><p>and a narrow and musty-smelling bed. On </p><p>the whitewashed wall opposite the iron door</p><p>some former occupant of that solitary cell </p><p>had whimsically written with a piece of </p><p>charcoal: </p><p>VISITORS MUST NOT FEED OR ANNOY THE </p><p>ANIMALS </p><p> Began for Peter a series of days and</p><p>nights that were full of that acute misery </p><p>that any manner of confinement brings to </p><p>live and red-blooded men. No privileges </p><p>whatever were granted him save those of </p><p>going three times a day, always under the </p><p>close guard that is sent with the most </p><p>untrustworthy criminals, to the lavatory </p><p>and then to the eating-room. </p><p> He tried to buy the sheriff and the jailer,</p><p>but his money wouldn’t touch them. He </p><p>tried to tell them about the dangerous </p><p>dam—for Marian’s sake he refrained from </p><p>mentioning the graft scheme—but they </p><p>had been warned in advance that his mind </p><p>was twisted on such questions as those of </p><p>power-plants and dams. </p><p> Peter grew sullen, and his face became</p><p>darkened with a stubby beard and lean. </p><p>But never for a moment did he give up his </p><p>aims or lose hope, though it required in him </p><p>the indomitable courage of a superman. </p><p> All along he had been wondering whether</p><p>Marian knew of his incarceration. She </p><p>would come to see him when she was able </p><p>to be out, he was sure, if she had learned of </p><p>his plight. </p><p> But Marian didn’t know of it. The</p><p>grafting ring had taken care that very </p><p>very few knew of it. Peter had guessed </p><p>too shrewdly in the figures he had presented </p><p>to Alden just before the “assault.” </p><p> Three weeks from the date on which the</p><p>iron door swung shut between Huntley </p><p>and liberty, the dam was completed and </p><p>the high tension wires were connected with </p><p>the distributing station. The streets and </p><p>almost every house in Westover had been </p><p>wired and made ready. The evening that </p><p>saw the town flooded with electric light </p><p>was a time of general rejoicing. The band </p><p>played, speeches were made in the court- </p><p>house, the populace cheered wildly. Down </p><p>in his dungeon-like cell Peter heard some- </p><p>thing of it dimly, and he understood.</p><p> A month passed, and during those four</p><p>weeks the stores stopped handling kerosene </p><p>and most of the people foolishly threw away </p><p>their oil lamps and used the oil they had for </p><p>building fires. </p><p> Also during that month, a scourging</p><p>epidemic of typhoid struck the town. </p><p> There is nothing on earth, I think, quite</p><p>so uncertain as Tennessee’s weather. On </p><p>the last day of July it began to rain hard </p><p>and steadily. For hours upon hours it </p><p>rained, and the river began to rise. Peter </p><p>Huntley began to rave about the dam. It </p><p>was enough, considering the wear of his </p><p>solitary confinement, to drive him insane. </p><p> The jailer refused to listen. Peter then</p><p>i6o </p><p>Adventure </p><p> tried to shout his warning through the little</p><p> window. The jailer threatened to gag him</p><p> if he didn’t close his mouth of his own</p><p> accord.</p><p> “All right,” agreed Peter. “But first</p><p> let me say this: if there is such a thing as</p><p> reincarnation, you’re the same damned</p><p> scoundrel that stuck the spear into the side</p><p> of the Man they crucified.”</p><p> The keeper of the keys laughed and went</p><p> off whistling. Peter began to pace the</p><p> dank floor. He kept himself from thinking</p><p> of being drowned there in his cell by think-</p><p> ing of his Marian. How he hoped that she</p><p> would escape the devastating flood wall</p><p> that he knew had to come!</p><p> Night fell thick. The street electrics</p><p> made only dim white circles in the misty</p><p> darkness. Two hours, and something failed</p><p> at the power-plant—and Westover with its</p><p> scores of cases of typhoid was plunged into</p><p> impenetrable, Stygian blackness.</p><p>JUDGE URHART tried to sit up </p><p>in the smothering night, and found </p><p>that he was too weak. He lay back </p><p>pillow, waited and listened impa- </p><p>tiently. A few minutes later he heard his </p><p>daughter’s soft footsteps in the near-by </p><p>hallway. She came slowly, groping, feel- </p><p>ing her way with her hands. </p><p> “What did the engineer say?” he wanted</p><p> to know.</p><p> “The telephone worked badly at first,</p><p> and I didn’t get it all,” said Marian, halting</p><p> beside his bed. “There’s something wrong</p><p> with—the generators, I believe he said.</p><p> Maybe the lights will come on soon. I hope</p><p> so, for this is terrible! I wish Peter Hunt-</p><p> ley were in charge up there, father. It’s a</p><p> shame that Mr. Alden wouldn’t give him</p><p> the position.”</p><p> “I’ve already heard too much of Peter</p><p> Huntley,” weakly declared the mayor of</p><p> Westover.</p><p> “If only we knew where to find him!”</p><p>the girl continued. “Do you suppose his </p><p>parents in Faidleysville would know? Did</p><p>he—are you sure he didn’t say where he </p><p>was going when he left?” </p><p> “I—er, I don’t believe he did.”</p><p> The old ex-judge was too sick to lie</p><p>outright very easily. </p><p> The night wore on, and the typhoid</p><p>sufferers suffered on in the blackness. The </p><p>coming of eleven o’clock found half the </p><p>women in Westover hysterical. By mid- </p><p>night the hearts of some very strong men </p><p>were being harassed by that unrelenting </p><p>darkness. </p><p> Farnsworth Alden had been kept busy</p><p>answering telephone calls for hours. Now </p><p>he knew that something had to be done, </p><p>and that done quickly, to get the generators </p><p>to working again; the stricken town had </p><p>to have light. He thought of asking Peter </p><p>Huntley’s aid, but he doubted seriously </p><p>that Huntley would turn over a hand for </p><p>him. In his dilemma, he decided to go </p><p>to the resourceful Judge Urhart for advice. </p><p>Marian met him at the door. </p><p> “It’s Alden,” he said shakily. “I’ve got</p><p> to talk with your father. Please take me</p><p> to him—and let me hold to your arm.</p><p> Marian; I stumble badly in this darkness.’</p><p> He had been drinking in an attempt to</p><p> settle his nerves.</p><p> “You mustn’t worry him, remember,”</p><p>warned the girl. </p><p> She led him to her father’s bedroom.</p><p>When they were inside the door, Alden </p><p>announced himself, then he requested that </p><p>Marian leave him with her father for a few </p><p>minutes. </p><p> Marian pretended to withdraw—and</p><p>didn’t. </p><p> “Well?” said Urhart, impatiently.</p><p> “Do you think you could get Huntley</p><p>to go to the power-plant?” began Alden. </p><p>“Maybe he could give us light. We’ve </p><p>got to have light.” </p><p> “After your treatment of him,” Urhart</p><p>said sourly, “he wouldn’t go. This is </p><p>a sort of unholy vengeance for him. You</p><p>mustn’t forget that he’s been lying there in </p><p>jail for some two months nursing a griev- </p><p>ance.” </p><p> “You sanctioned it,” Alden replied half</p><p> angrily. “You were as deep in the graft</p><p> scheme as anybody else.”</p><p> Marian’s two hands clutched her dress</p><p>at her throat. Peter in jail for two months! </p><p>A graft scheme! In the twinkling of an </p><p>eye, her intuition told her almost the whole </p><p>story. She knew about the ruining of </p><p>Peter’s father; she might not have known </p><p>just how it had been brought about, but, </p><p>all the same, she knew. </p><p> “Mr. Alden,” came her troubled voice</p><p>from the doorway, “please stay here with </p><p>father until the nurse wakes—she’s worn </p><p>out. Peter Huntley will go to the dam for </p><p>me, I know.” </p><p> Without waiting for a reply, without</p><p>The Man Who Whipped a City </p><p>161 </p><p> waiting to ask her father’s permission, she</p><p> hastened for a wrap and went toward the</p><p> garage, which stood just behind the house.</p><p> Three minutes later she was at the wheel</p><p> of the big touring-car and driving at a rapid</p><p> rate toward Westover’s jail. The glare of</p><p> the headlights showed her that the rain</p><p> had ceased.</p><p> At the jail she demanded entrance in her</p><p>father’s name. The jailer had found a </p><p>candle; he opened the strong front door </p><p>and held the flickering light above his </p><p>head. </p><p> “Oh, it’s you, Miss Marian! Is any-</p><p>thing-” </p><p> She interrupted sharply:</p><p> “I’m going to take Peter Huntley to the</p><p>dam to straighten out things there—release </p><p>him, and hurry!” </p><p> She stepped inside the door to wait. The</p><p>keeper of the keys telephoned to the Urhart </p><p>residence, and after a considerable wait </p><p>Farnsworth Alden answered. It would be </p><p>all right, said Alden, to send Huntley to </p><p>the power-plant, but a guard should accom- </p><p>pany him. </p><p> The jailer hastened to the basement and</p><p>unlocked the door of the solitary cell. </p><p> “Come out,” he began; “they want</p><p>you——” </p><p> He broke off short because the light of</p><p>his candle showed him that the prisoner </p><p>was gone! Huntley’s bed, he noted, had </p><p>been demolished; then he saw: Huntley </p><p>had used one of its strong railings as a means </p><p>of prying out two of the narrow window’s </p><p>rusted bars. </p><p> Marian was not disappointed when she</p><p>heard of it. Rather, she was pleased. </p><p> “He’s gone to the dam,” she declared.</p><p> “I’d bet all I’ve got that he hasn’t,”</p><p>replied the jailer. </p><p> Marian ignored that. “There’s a good</p><p>road all the way up there; I’m going up </p><p>to see if I can help him in any way—please </p><p>phone Mr. Alden, and ask him to tell </p><p>father.” </p><p> With that she almost ran from the jail,</p><p>and soon she was driving at a twenty-mile </p><p>clip along the smooth pike that led up the </p><p>river. </p><p> The plant was lighted when she caught</p><p>sight of it. But that came from storage </p><p>batteries, of course. She drew up beside </p><p>the road, sprang from the machine and </p><p>hurried across the few rods that lay between </p><p>it and the big brick building. </p><p>.u </p><p>ON THE main floor she found Peter </p><p>Huntley working like mad over one </p><p>of the old generators. He was </p><p>grimy, and his clothing was soiled and </p><p>untidy, and his face was thin and almost </p><p>black with beard; except for the fine, brave </p><p>glow in his eyes, he had the appearance of </p><p>a tramp. Marian suppressed a sob of pity </p><p>when she saw him. </p><p> For a long half-hour she stood there and</p><p>watched him while he wrestled with dis- </p><p>connected field wires and worn-out bearings. </p><p>He was too intent upon his task to see </p><p>anything else. Finally he finished the </p><p>work, and then he gave a signal to the </p><p>sawmill engineer who called himself an </p><p>electrical engineer because he had taken a </p><p>short correspondence course in electricity. </p><p> “Ready, Wildman!” he said.</p><p> The sallow little man put the big machine</p><p>in motion, and a steady humming sound </p><p>came from it. Then he ran to the breaker </p><p>and threw the current on—and the stricken </p><p>town below had light! </p><p> “Peter!” cried Marian.</p><p> Huntley looked around and saw her.</p><p>She was radiant with perfect health again, </p><p>prouder than ever of him, heart-broken with </p><p>sympathy for him. He went toward her </p><p>with a happy light on his bearded face; then </p><p>he stopped because he felt himself unfit to </p><p>touch her. She understood; she took one </p><p>of his grimy hands, and pressed it to her </p><p>breast.</p><p> “Poor old Peter!” she sobbed. “I—I</p><p>didn’t know. They told me you had gone. </p><p>Then father sent me to a mountain resort </p><p>to recuperate. I’m so very sorry, Peter!” </p><p> “Listen, Marian,” said Huntley, his</p><p>voice grave and hollow. “The river has </p><p>been three feet higher than it is now, and </p><p>the dam held; but the river is now rising </p><p>again, from heavy rains on its headwaters, </p><p>and if it gets higher than it was before </p><p>I believe the dam will break. Let me look </p><p>at the gage again-” </p><p> He turned and ran. A minute later he</p><p>was back, and he was excited. </p><p> “It’s almost as high as it was before!”</p><p>he told her. “I want you to tell that fool </p><p>town down there about it. They wouldn’t </p><p>believe me. Telephone—tell central to </p><p>warn the people to take their sick ones </p><p>and get clean out of the valley! And have </p><p>central instruct them to leave all lights on, </p><p>and when the dam breaks we’ll flash the </p><p>lights three times as a warning. That will </p><p>Adventure </p><p>give the foolish ones some twenty minutes </p><p>to get to safety. In there—” he stretched </p><p>a finger unsteadily toward the plant’s little </p><p>office—“is a phone.” </p><p> Marian transferred his message almost</p><p>verbatim. Half an hour later every soul </p><p>in Westover had received the warning. The </p><p>typhoid sufferers were wrapped in blankets </p><p>and carefully carried to houses that stood </p><p>high and above the danger-line. Those </p><p>who were incredulous enough to remain in </p><p>their threatened homes were not, fortu- </p><p>nately, incredulous enough to put out their </p><p>lights. Neither did they go to sleep. </p><p> The sawmill engineer stood at his post</p><p>before the current-breaker, ready to flash </p><p>the signal in Westover. Huntley stood at </p><p>an open window that faced the dam; and </p><p>beside him was Marian, with her gaze upon </p><p>the muddy, foam-dotted and debris-covered </p><p>waters below. She had wanted to return to </p><p>her father, but Huntley wouldn’t permit it; </p><p>the road to Westover lay in the valley all </p><p>the way down, and it was too hazardous. </p><p> “Peter,” she murmured, when she had</p><p>wrung from him a confirmation of her sus- </p><p>picions and knew everything, “Peter, I </p><p>hope the dam will break, almost.” </p><p>“Marian!” </p><p> “Almost, I said. For then you will have</p><p>whipped your home town, which ruined </p><p>your gentleman father and called you a </p><p>villain when you fought for your rights, </p><p>the town you both love and hate. The </p><p>engineer isn’t looking; if you can take </p><p>your eyes off that dam for a second, you </p><p>may kiss me, Peter, dear.” </p><p>He did it. Just then the droning </p><p>miserere of the mad waters widened into </p><p>a far-reaching, gushing roar, and with it </p><p>came the grinding jar of stone upon stone. </p><p>Peter whirled. </p><p> “Break the current!” he bellowed.</p><p>“Break it! Once—twice—again—good, </p><p>Wildman!” </p><p> With the knowledge that he had suc-</p><p>ceeded in saving the little city he was to </p><p>hate no longer, reactionary weakness over- </p><p>powered him, and he sank to the floor. </p><p>The solitary cell had taken its toll at last.</p><p> They hurried him to his father’s home in</p><p>Faidleysville, and the people of a whole </p><p>county hung upon tidings concerning his </p><p>condition as though it were a matter of life </p><p>or death to them. Peter got well soon. </p><p> Save for a thorough wetting, Westover</p><p>was not very badly damaged by the </p><p>flood. The waters had spread and thereby </p><p>lost much of their force by the time they </p><p>had gone the four miles, and only a few </p><p>houses were swept from their foundations. </p><p>Fortunately, those buildings directly in the </p><p>path of the current were of brick or stone. </p><p>WHEN the cleaning-up was over </p><p>and the people were pretty close to </p><p>happiness again, Westover’s mayor </p><p>called a meeting of certain men in the libra- </p><p>ry of his home. When they were all there, </p><p>Judge Urhart rose beside his littered desk </p><p>and addressed them with a peculiar glint in </p><p>his eyes. </p><p> “Gentlemen,” he began, “we are here</p><p>tonight to organize the Business Men’s </p><p>League of Westover. The league is going </p><p>to begin its business by doing these things: </p><p> “First, it’s going to pay old John Huntley</p><p>back all he lost to us. Second, it’s going </p><p>to build a hundred thousand dollars’ worth </p><p>of dam and power-plant on the river below </p><p>the city—and the job is going to be put </p><p>into the hands of Peter Huntley, the man </p><p>to whom Westover owes its life. Third, </p><p>it’s going to stand behind all the bigger </p><p>damage done by the flood.” </p><p> He spoke with an air of finality. He</p><p>was still the Big Boss. And yet, there was </p><p>one man of those present who dared to </p><p>criticize him. That man was Farnsworth </p><p>Alden. </p><p> “I have just read,” he sneered, “the</p><p>wedding announcement.” </p><p> Judge Urhart went white and stared hard.</p><p> “That has nothing whatever to do with</p><p>it. It’s gratitude, you hog. Peter Hunt- </p><p>ley whipped me, Farnsworth, a little harder </p><p>than he whipped you, only he did it in a </p><p>different way. If you refuse to do your part </p><p>by this amende honorable, by -, sir, </p><p>you’ll go to prison! I may have to go with </p><p>you; but, take my word for it, you’ll go! </p><p>I am waiting for your decision right now, </p><p>sir.” </p><p> “Oh, I—I’ll not refuse,” replied Alden.</p><p> Whereupon Judge Urhart took his right</p><p>hand from his right hip-pocket. </p><p>Authors of "Malena," "With Sharp Sword-Edgesetc. </p><p> vROWDED with warriors in the</p><p>fantastic armor of medieval Japan, </p><p>jvr. a long line of junks and sampans </p><p>rounded the southwest tip of the </p><p>Korean peninsula, and headed north along </p><p>the deserted coast of that war-tortured </p><p>country, so inappropriately called the </p><p>“Land of the Morning Calm.” Sent forth </p><p>upon the seas by the edict of Hideyoshi, </p><p>the C£esar of Japan—who, like his Roman </p><p>prototype, was uncrowned king of a con- </p><p>quering empire—they bore eager reenforce- </p><p>ments to the hundred and ninety thousand </p><p>veterans who were crashing through the </p><p>rotten framework of the Korean kingdom </p><p>as a stone crashes through a paper lantern. </p><p> Hideyoshi’s land campaigns were drawing</p><p>to a triumphant close; there remained only </p><p>to debark these reeinforcements for Kon- </p><p>ishi’s army, which was holding the new- </p><p>captured city of Pyeng-yang. It was the </p><p>Summer of 1592; before Autumn, Hide- </p><p>yoshi would have the peninsula safe behind </p><p>him, as a base and source of supplies for </p><p>his intended conquest of China. </p><p> Kurushima, Daimio or Lord of Tosa, led</p><p>the fleet with a picked squadron manned </p><p>by his own hardy fishermen—veteran sea- </p><p>fighters, every man. Their long, rakish </p><p>craft, mere open rowboats though they </p><p>were, were known and feared from Luzon </p><p>to the China coast. The largest foe that </p><p>sailed the seas shrank from encountering </p><p>them; pulling alongside, they would board </p><p>and carry all before them with the trenchant </p><p>edges of their terrible swords. </p><p> Once at Pyeng-yang, they would land</p><p>and join in the dash on Nanking, with </p><p>which the conquest of China was to begin. </p><p>Kurushima’s stern soul yearned for the </p><p>wind to bear them thither, where there </p><p>waited adventuring enough even for his </p><p>ardent spirit. There would be huge armies </p><p>to overthrow, great cities to storm, the </p><p>vastest kingdom in the world to seize and </p><p>rule. As for the Koreans—they were to </p><p>him as the crushed oyster-shells that paved </p><p>the road to his castle-gate. He was com- </p><p>posing a verse on this thought, when a </p><p>startled cry from the helmsman wiped it </p><p>from his mind. His alert eyes focused </p><p>on the sea ahead. </p><p> From behind the lee of Han-San Island</p><p>shot such a thing as the world had never </p><p>yet seen. It was manifestly a ship—but </p><p>what a ship! The Japanese stared as at </p><p>some incredible monster. She was covered </p><p>with an iron roof; a curved deck of iron </p><p>plates shaped like the back of a tortoise. </p><p>There was neither sail nor mast; beneath </p><p>the protecting overhang of the iron deck </p><p>the oars of many rowers urged her forward </p><p>at stupefying speed. A hideous dragon’s </p><p>head, with wide-open jaws, glared horribly </p><p>above the bows. A raised oar in the stern </p><p>bore the flaming standard of Admiral </p><p>163 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>Yi Sun-sin, the great sea-fighter and in- </p><p>ventor of Korea. </p><p> As the Japanese gazed with open eyes</p><p>and mouths, the dragon’s jaws spat smoke </p><p>and flame, and a heavy cannon-ball tore </p><p>through the crowded waist of one of Kuru- </p><p>shima’s junks. The shrieks of the wound- </p><p>ed rang piteously; but through and above </p><p>them beat a thunderous yell of defiance </p><p>from the whole Japanese fleet. Tall, nar- </p><p>row banners, bright with the insignia of a </p><p>hundred fighting feudal chiefs, were waved </p><p>on high. From junks and sampans swords, </p><p>spears and halberds glistened in the sun. </p><p>The archers of Japan bent their seven-foot </p><p>bows, and a storm of burning fire-arrows </p><p>flew through the air. </p><p> But the thick shafts flew in vain, for they</p><p>only rebounded from the tortoise-boat’s </p><p>iron deck, and fell hissing into the sea. </p><p>Matchlock-men fired their shot, but the </p><p>balls glanced from the Korean’s iron plates </p><p>with a sound like that of hail-stones on </p><p>a metal roof. </p><p> “If we, too, had cannon—” cried Kuru-</p><p>shima’s helmsman; but the Daimio cut </p><p>him short. </p><p> “Why should we use the weapons of</p><p>cowards?” he exclaimed. “We have not </p><p>needed them on the land, why on the sea? </p><p>‘The sword is the soul of the Samurai.’ ” </p><p> It was his favorite proverb; and now he</p><p>and his men, in open boats, were ready to </p><p>put their trust in the sword, even against </p><p>an ironclad. </p><p> By this time the monster was right</p><p>among them. Besides the dragon-mouth </p><p>forward, there were six similar embrasures </p><p>on each side, and another aft. Burning to </p><p>come to hand-grips, the Japanese pressed </p><p>up in their swarming open boats, striving </p><p>to close and board. But one after another, </p><p>they were shattered by crashing broad- </p><p>sides. Between broadsides, while the </p><p>Korean gun-crews rammed home fresh </p><p>charges, the bowmen beside them shot </p><p>fire-arrows into the crowded vessels of </p><p>Japan. The wooden hulls caught fire </p><p>easily, and several were soon ablaze. </p><p> An abortive cheer rang out as one daring</p><p>sampan, carrying a company of eager </p><p>men-at-arms, pulled squarely athwart the </p><p>tortoise-boat’s bows. But the cheer died </p><p>as the Korean’s long, sharp ram cut her </p><p>in two as if the sampan had been a straw, </p><p>spilling her swordsmen into the sea. With </p><p>unchecked speed, the ironclad passed over </p><p>the swirl where her brave enemy had been, </p><p>brained the struggling swimmers with her </p><p>swinging oars, and rammed the largest </p><p>junk in the Japanese fleet. Her side </p><p>crushed in at the water-line, the junk heeled </p><p>over, filled and went down with all on </p><p>board, as the tortoise-boat backed away </p><p>and started for a fresh victim. </p><p> Through the length of the entire fleet</p><p>the ironclad tore her way, mangling helpless </p><p>sampans with her terrible beak, sinking </p><p>great junks with the fearful balls from her </p><p>well-directed cannon. With frantic cour- </p><p>age, the Japanese bore in, hoping against </p><p>hope for a chance to board and avenge </p><p>their butchered comrades. But all was in </p><p>vain. The tortoise forced a path through </p><p>them all, and sped on toward the south, </p><p>as if sated with destruction. </p><p> Undaunted, her surviving enemies put</p><p>about, doubling on their former course, </p><p>and hastened to .pursue their now fleeing </p><p>foe. Soon the Japanese squadron was </p><p>strung out in a long, scattering line ahead, </p><p>as the speedier of tbem outdistanced their </p><p>laboring fellows. But not even the swiftest </p><p>held its own with the tortoise-boat, whose </p><p>well-modeled racing hull beneath the over- </p><p>hanging gun-deck gave the lie to her name. </p><p>On they pressed, pursuers and pursued, </p><p>oars churning the water white; till the </p><p>Japanese line was punctured with great </p><p>gaps. </p><p> Suddenly the ironclad’s speed slackened,</p><p>her oars trailed idly. With loud shouts of </p><p>“Banzai!” the leading Japanese bore down </p><p>upon her. When barely two ship’s lengths </p><p>separated them, the Korean oars struck </p><p>the water again; but with a difference. </p><p>Admiral Yi Sun-sin had built his vessel </p><p>alike at both ends; he had ordered his </p><p>rowers to face about, and what had been </p><p>the stern of the tortoise-boat was now </p><p>her bow. Hardly had his nonplused </p><p>pursuers realized the maneuver, when the </p><p>ironclad, tearing toward them with growing </p><p>speed, rammed and sank the foremost</p><p>sampan, and came back down the line of </p><p>her widely scattered adversaries, striking, </p><p>backing and striking again. </p><p> It was too much. Crying that this sea-</p><p>monster was the work of gods or demons, </p><p>but not of men, the crews of several ships </p><p>hurled their useless weapons into the sea. </p><p>Some, fleeing swiftly, were fortunate enough </p><p>to reach the shore, where they beached and </p><p>set fire to their vessels to save them from </p><p>Two Strong .Meil </p><p>165 </p><p>the victorious Koreans. But most of them </p><p>were slain, fighting or fleeing, so that the </p><p>chroniclers of that day have declared the </p><p>sea was red with their blood. </p><p> But Kurushima did not flee. Inwardly</p><p>raging, but steady and skilful as in victory, </p><p>he took upon himself the honor of Japan. </p><p>Handling his own long, open boat smartly, </p><p>he offered his broadside to the enemy’s </p><p>ram, swung ’round as it came on, and </p><p>brought her right under the overhang of </p><p>the ironclad’s starboard beam. With a </p><p>joyous yell, the men of Tosa swarmed up </p><p>on the turtle’s back, lusting to flesh their </p><p>heavy swords. But their fierce cries soon </p><p>changed to shrieks of agony, for the curved </p><p>iron deck was studded thickly with sharp </p><p>spikes and spear-heads, on which the help- </p><p>less boarders were impaled. </p><p> Kurushima alone was luckier. Leaping</p><p>up at an open port, he succeeded in grasp- </p><p>ing one of the great gilded fangs in the </p><p>lower jaw of the dragon’s mouth before </p><p>his own boat was left behind. Pulling </p><p>himself up with his left hand, he took the </p><p>sword from between his teeth and delivered </p><p>a mighty overhand blow at a dimly seen </p><p>form inside the port. He had the joy of </p><p>feeling his blade shear through flesh and </p><p>bone and seeing it come back dripping. </p><p>Then the reloaded gun was run out through </p><p>the port; the lower lip of its muzzle struck </p><p>the Daimio squarely on his helmeted fore- </p><p>head and knocked him senseless into the sea. </p><p>KURUSHIMA’S eyelids fluttered </p><p>twice, and opened wide. He felt </p><p>weak and faint. His fingers found </p><p>the sleeping-mat on which he lay; his eyes </p><p>saw, but did not comprehend the pine-tree </p><p>which sheltered him, and the six-foot fence </p><p>of canvas raised about the tree on spears </p><p>thrust upright into the ground. For a </p><p>time his brain did not grasp the meaning </p><p>of these things; then, memory and under- </p><p>standing dawning in his mind, he ground </p><p>his teeth in humiliated pride. </p><p> The savage, hopeless battle against the</p><p>tortoise-boat; the crunch of the monster’s </p><p>ram against the ribs of his doomed ships; </p><p>the overwhelming defeat; his own desper- </p><p>ate, futile attempt to snatch victory from</p><p>the teeth of destruction, and the crashing </p><p>blow that had flung him into oblivion—all </p><p>came back upon him now, with accumulated </p><p>bitterness. Japan had relied upon him, </p><p>and he had failed her! Now he lay here, </p><p>rescued he knew not how, cared for by folk </p><p>he had not seen, but alive, alive, when he </p><p>should have died with his brave sailors! </p><p> There was only one course for a beaten</p><p>soldier, a dishonored Samurai. With hands </p><p>that would scarcely obey the command </p><p>of his brain, he fumbled for his dagger, </p><p>fixed in the resolution to commit hari-kari, </p><p>that he might not live continually reproach- </p><p>ing himself for the stain of his defeat. </p><p> But at the sound of his first feeble</p><p>stirring, a little man in a gray kimono </p><p>stepped from behind the pine. He was </p><p>short, this man, even for a Japanese; </p><p>barely five feet tall, and as slightly built </p><p>as a child. His face was that of an in- </p><p>credibly old and wrinkled monkey; but </p><p>the eyes which burned in it were those of </p><p>a god. Whoso met their glance knew </p><p>himself in the presence of his master. </p><p>Kurushima started violently, and turned </p><p>his face away. It was Hideyoshi himself, </p><p>the all-conquering dictator of Japan. </p><p> Reading the Daimio’s intention, as he</p><p>was wont to read the minds of men, Hide- </p><p>yoshi raised two fingers in a gesture of </p><p>restraint. </p><p> “You shall not slay yourself, Kuru-</p><p>shima,” he commanded. “You are to kill </p><p>the crew of the tortoise-boat instead, and </p><p>sink their iron monster in the sea.” </p><p> “But how?” gasped the astonished Kuru-</p><p>shima. “How can I do this, when I have </p><p>already failed?” </p><p> “By returning to your province of Tosa</p><p>and playing go in your castle at Urado,” </p><p>Hideyoshi replied enigmatically, and sat </p><p>on the floor beside the sleeping-mat. “Do </p><p>not try to rise, for the fever has scarce left </p><p>you. It is a fortnight since you were </p><p>brought here. One of your sailors kept </p><p>you afloat in spite of all your armor, and </p><p>drew you to a piece of floating wreckage, </p><p>whence you were taken into the ship of </p><p>Miyosi of Izumo. That is how you were </p><p>saved, and this is how you may serve</p><p>Japan: </p><p> “We must have a great, strong ship,</p><p>carrying heavy guns, to sink the tortoise- </p><p>boat; otherwise the war can not go forward. </p><p>We build no such vessels of our own. I </p><p>have tried to buy two from the Portuguese </p><p>in Macao, but they will not sell. Only one </p><p>other source remains. </p><p> “Every year, at this time or a little later,</p><p>a huge ship like a castle in the sea sails </p><p>northward past the coast of Tosa. This </p><p>2 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>ship comes from Manila, richly laden, and </p><p>goes to another Spanish city called Aca- </p><p>pulco. The Spaniards in Manila have </p><p>many such vessels; but their king, fearing </p><p>lest they grow too rich, lets them send only </p><p>one a year. Five years ago a tempest </p><p>drove one of those Spanish ships into your </p><p>port of Urado.” </p><p> Kurushima nodded, his despair forgotten</p><p>in eager attention. </p><p> “She tarried for a week,” he affirmed,</p><p>“filling her water-casks and waiting for the </p><p>wind to moderate, for it was a very great </p><p>storm.” </p><p> “This year’s ship,” said Hideyoshi,</p><p>tapping his finger-tips together to em- </p><p>phasize his words, “will come to Urado, </p><p>whether there is a storm or not.” </p><p> Kurushima was too polite to look in-</p><p>credulous; but the dictator sensed his </p><p>doubts and thought it best to dispel </p><p>them. </p><p> “There are many Japanese in Manila,</p><p>and they tell me much,” Hideyoshi ex- </p><p>plained graciously. “One of them, a Chris- </p><p>tian named Ichio, sails with this year’s </p><p>ship. Her course from Manila lies through </p><p>many islands, where the Christian priests </p><p>and their converts wait for her coming </p><p>and row out to her, bearing gifts of fresh </p><p>meat and fruit. To certain ones of these </p><p>converts on the nearer islands I have </p><p>already sent orders which they will repeat </p><p>to Ichio when the ship arrives. </p><p> “Now Ichio is keeper of the water-casks</p><p>aboard her. Off the coast of Tosa he will </p><p>report, quite truthfully, to his captain </p><p>that the casks are leaky and nearly empty, </p><p>and he will praise the spring that flows </p><p>under the wisterias above your beach. </p><p>The ship’s captain will have no choice but </p><p>to put into Urado, if he would keep his </p><p>crew from perishing of thirst. </p><p> “Then you must get possession of the</p><p>ship. If possible, do so without violence; </p><p>for I do not wish to begin another war </p><p>till this one is finished. If you give the </p><p>Spaniards a fair opportunity, they may </p><p>give up without a struggle. The Spaniards </p><p>in Manila are few and fear us greatly;</p><p>they are merchants, loving gain and hating </p><p>to fight. Probably you can bribe the </p><p>captain to sell the ship; Ichio has been </p><p>told to study his weaknesses and report </p><p>them to you. </p><p> “Remember, if it comes to fighting, that</p><p>the ship is to be captured, so far as possible, </p><p>without injury. Her crew are of no im- </p><p>portance, except the sailing-master and </p><p>the gunners. These you will try to take </p><p>alive. </p><p> “The hulls of these Manila ships are of</p><p>teak, thick enough to withstand stone or </p><p>iron shot from the heaviest cannon in all </p><p>Japan or Korea. That is why I wish for </p><p>one to fight the tortoise-boat. If you </p><p>succeed, you shall take the great ship into </p><p>battle for the conquest of China. Never- </p><p>theless, stout as she is, I forbid you to use </p><p>either cannon or fire-arrows when you </p><p>capture her, lest mischance occur.” </p><p> “We of Tosa despise such cowards’</p><p>tools,” Kurushima answered scornfully. </p><p>“The brave man knows no weapon but the </p><p>sword.” </p><p> With a smile that beautified his wrinkled</p><p>face, Hideyoshi reached within the folds </p><p>of his kimono, and handed to Kurushima </p><p>the Daimio’s own beloved blade. At the </p><p>familiar feel of the sharkskin grip, tears </p><p>burst from Kurushima’s eyes, and a great </p><p>flood of health and strength poured through </p><p>his fever-wasted veins. </p><p> “Even the Sea-God failed to wrest it</p><p>from your grasp,” said the dictator. “May </p><p>you die with it in your hand!” </p><p>“WHAT manner of man, then, is </p><p>this captain of yours?” demanded </p><p>Kurushima crisply. </p><p> Through a loophole in the wall of his</p><p>castle he could see the great Manila galleon </p><p>San Gregorio riding at anchor in Urado </p><p>Bay. The flaming banner of Spain flew </p><p>from her lofty poop, and beneath it sparkled </p><p>the blue gleam of Western armor. </p><p> Ichio, the mask-faced secret agent of</p><p>Hideyoshi, looked at the fighting eye and </p><p>panther-like body of the Daimio—now </p><p>fully recovered from the effects of his</p><p>fever—and replied— </p><p> “Oh Lord of Tosa, he is even such a man</p><p>as yourself!” </p><p> “What, Christian dog!” cried the angry</p><p>Daimio, his eyes flashing terribly. “Do </p><p>you compare this barbarian, this sea- </p><p>merchant, with one of the honorable class </p><p>of Samurai?” </p><p> “Forgive my heedless tongue, most</p><p>mighty lord!” wailed Ichio, his forehead </p><p>scraping the matting and the back of his </p><p>neck tickling with apprehension. “I mean </p><p>that he is no merchant, but a warrior— </p><p>a caballero, which is to say, a Samurai of </p><p>Two Strong Men </p><p>167 </p><p>Spain. Bom of the most ancient and im- </p><p>poverished house of de Torres, my captain, </p><p>Don Diego, thinks never of gain, but always </p><p>of honor. The Spaniards in his crew boast </p><p>of the many battles he has fought with the </p><p>English, the Moros and other pirates. So </p><p>great is his skill and valor that he has never </p><p>lost a ship entrusted to his care. And so </p><p>wonderful is his honesty that, though he </p><p>has had charge of whole cargoes of silver </p><p>and gold, he is still poor.” </p><p> “There can be no question, then, of</p><p>bribing such a man,” said Kurushima, with </p><p>much satisfaction. </p><p> The idea had been utterly repugnant to</p><p>his straightforward, hard-hitting nature; </p><p>but Hideyoshi’s commands had been ex- </p><p>plicit. Now, however, the Daimio could </p><p>go ahead after his own methods, with his </p><p>conscience free. </p><p> Obedient to the dictator’s will, he had</p><p>proceeded with the utmost caution. No </p><p>sooner had the San Gregorio entered Urado </p><p>harbor, early that morning, than he had </p><p>seen to it that certain effective but unob- </p><p>trusive methods had been taken to bar </p><p>her exit. Moreover, out from the mist- </p><p>shrouded shore had darted a dozen chal- </p><p>lenging guard-boats, crammed with picked </p><p>swordsmen, ostensibly to demand the reason </p><p>for the stranger’s intrusion. Had there been </p><p>evidence of panic or unpreparedness on </p><p>board the galleon, she would have been </p><p>boarded and captured then and there. </p><p> But a culverin had roared from a lower-</p><p>deck port, and an eighteen-pound solid </p><p>shot struck the water so close to the bows </p><p>of the leading guard-boat that the column </p><p>of spray it raised fell on and drenched the </p><p>startled rowers as they instinctively backed </p><p>water. So there was a halt and a parley, </p><p>in which Ichio served as interpreter. And </p><p>when, as a result of that parley, the guard- </p><p>boats withdrew and some of the galleon’s </p><p>crew rowed ashore as the sun drank up </p><p>the mist, to begin the all-day task of filling </p><p>the water-casks, Ichio came with them and </p><p>presently slipped away to the castle to </p><p>make his report to the Daimio. </p><p> “It is true that Don Diego can not be</p><p>bought with gold,” he said regretfully. </p><p>“But he has one weakness: he is in love. </p><p> “On the last voyage from Acapulco to</p><p>Manila, we had as passenger the Lady </p><p>Ysabel, daughter of the Governor of the - </p><p>Philippines. Never, oh Lord of Tosa, have </p><p>I seen so beautiful a maiden. All on board </p><p>worshiped her—the very Lascars made </p><p>verses in her praise, which the lookout sang </p><p>as he walked in the bows at night. And </p><p>from the high poop, Don Diego and the </p><p>Lady Ysabel would look down together at </p><p>the moonlight on the sea. Long before </p><p>we reached Manila, we knew, from the way </p><p>those two looked at each other, that they </p><p>were in love.” </p><p> “What have this captain’s private affairs</p><p>to do with me?” Kurushima inquired. </p><p> “This: there is in them a means for</p><p>getting this ship into your hands, Most </p><p>Mighty One.” </p><p> “Go on then,” the Daimio commanded.</p><p> “When we reached Manila,” the spy</p><p>continued, “we found no fleet of trading- </p><p>junks from China, as there should have </p><p>been, with silks and porcelains for the </p><p>galleon’s return voyage to Acapulco. The </p><p>fierce Moro pirates from Sulu had frightened </p><p>them all away. Great was the clamor of </p><p>the Manila merchants to the governor, </p><p>who talked loudly but did nothing. It was </p><p>a great calamity to all in Manila, for in the </p><p>China trade lies all their wealth, and they </p><p>live but for the fat profits from the sale </p><p>of those goods in Acapulco. </p><p> “As soon as we had discharged our lading</p><p>of Spanish goods and Mexican silver, Don </p><p>Diego went to the governor and offered to </p><p>sail the San Gregorio into the Sulu Sea, </p><p>destroy the pirates, and re-open the China </p><p>trade. This was a voluntary service on his </p><p>part, for he is not an officer of the governor </p><p>of the Philippines, but of the viceroy of </p><p>Mexico. Overjoyed, the governor bade </p><p>him name his own reward; and Don Diego </p><p>asked for the hand of the Lady Ysabel. </p><p>This was overheard by one of my comrades, </p><p>a servant in the Palacio. Nothing is said </p><p>or done in Manila that we servants of Japan </p><p>do not know. </p><p> “Now there was in Manila a cunning</p><p>rogue who called himself Don Feliz de </p><p>Arruego, and who had grown rich by secret </p><p>speculation in billetes. These billetes are </p><p>pieces of paper, each entitling its bearer to </p><p>ship the fourth part of a bale on the yearly </p><p>galleon. They are distributed among the </p><p>merchants of Manila, according to the </p><p>wealth and standing of the merchant, and </p><p>their value fluctuates greatly.” </p><p> “What do I know or care of merchants</p><p>and their papers?” interrupted the impa- </p><p>tient Kurushima. “What has this to do </p><p>with capturing a ship?” </p><p>168 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> “Patience, oh Mighty One, and I will</p><p>make all clear. “If anything occurs to </p><p>prevent the yearly shipment to Acapulco, </p><p>the billetes decline greatly in value, and the </p><p>merchants face ruin. One day a fisherman, </p><p>employed by this Feliz de Arruego, came </p><p>to Manila with a most terrible tale. Blown </p><p>by contrary winds into the Sulu Sea, he </p><p>had there, so he declared, seen the San </p><p>Gregorio grappled by a whole fleet of proas, </p><p>and the fierce Moros swarming up her sides </p><p>by hundreds. Then, so the fisherman </p><p>swore, the galleon’s powder-magazine ex- </p><p>ploded, and she was blown to pieces with </p><p>all on board. </p><p> “At this fearful news, all Manila was</p><p>plunged into the deepest despair. There </p><p>would be no shipment; the billetes were </p><p>worthless; it was a terrible blow to the </p><p>island trade. </p><p> “Deepest of all was the grief of the Lady</p><p>Ysabel, many were her tears, and many the </p><p>masses she had said for the repose of her </p><p>lover’s soul. </p><p> “Then came another suitor for her hand:</p><p>Don Feliz de Arruego. Going to the gov- </p><p>ernor, he revealed the truth, which was </p><p>that Don Diego was alive and returning </p><p>victorious in the San Gregorio, with the </p><p>heads of three pirate dattos hanging from </p><p>the bowsprit, and a rich Chinese trading </p><p>fleet astern. The governor cursed himself </p><p>because, like all others in Manila, he had </p><p>sold all his billetes when the false news had </p><p>made them worthless. </p><p> Don Feliz assured him that there was</p><p>none who had not done the same, and </p><p>revealed himself as the purchaser. There- </p><p>fore he was now the sole owner of the cargo- </p><p>space in this year’s galleon, and was in </p><p>consequence made fabulously rich by his </p><p>own knavery and the valiant exploits of </p><p>his rival. In consideration of his wealth, </p><p>he asked the governor to let him marry the </p><p>Lady Ysabel.” </p><p> “And did not the governor instantly</p><p>order him to be crucified?” demanded the </p><p>virtuously indignant Kurushima. </p><p> “No, for Don Feliz offered him a half-</p><p>share in the profits. It was that or poverty </p><p>for the governor, who had received by the </p><p>San Gregorio unexpected orders to return </p><p>at once to Spain. And, because he had been </p><p>so eager to fight the pirates, Don Diego </p><p>had not tarried for a formal, public be- </p><p>trothal to the Lady Ysabel, without which </p><p>he had no guarantee of her father’s good </p><p>faith. When he came back triumphant to </p><p>Manila, he found her betrothed to Don </p><p>Feliz de Arruego. </p><p> “And now, oh Lord of Tosa, they are</p><p>all—Don Diego, the governor, Don Feliz, </p><p>and the Lady Ysabel—returning to Aca- </p><p>pulco in the San Gregorio out there in your </p><p>harbor.” </p><p> “Then why,” exclaimed the Daimio,</p><p>“when he has them all on his ship, does not </p><p>this wronged and valiant captain cut the </p><p>two knaves’ heads off and marry the </p><p>maiden?” </p><p> “Doubtless he would do so if there were-</p><p>any place where he could go afterward; </p><p>but there is not, for he could not return </p><p>home, and he is too honorable a man to </p><p>turn pirate. But if he were offered high </p><p>rank in your service with his ship, oh </p><p>Ruler of the Southern Sea, why should he </p><p>not slay his enemies, and accept?” </p><p>“YOU do well to take precautions, </p><p>Captain. Hidden among those </p><p>houses are troops to the strength </p><p>of half a ter da.” </p><p> So spoke pedantic little Lieutenant</p><p>Pablo Gomez, as he stood on the quarter- </p><p>deck of the San Gregorio and studied the </p><p>beautiful, mountain-girt shores of Urado </p><p>Bay without a suspicion of their beauty. </p><p>He was in command of the handful of time- </p><p>expired infantrymen returning to Spain on </p><p>the galleon; and his eye was that of a </p><p>trained soldier—and nothing else. </p><p> But the tall man beside him was not</p><p>looking at the land; his eyes were fixed </p><p>on five small fishing-junks, moored close </p><p>together in the fairway, just inside the </p><p>entrance of the harbor. </p><p> “I am more concerned, Don Pablo, with</p><p>those fishermen yonder. They have caught </p><p>nothing all day, yet they remain in the</p><p>same spot.” </p><p> “Why should those wretched smacks</p><p>concern you more than a host of heathen </p><p>soldiery?” asked Lieutenant Gomez, in </p><p>wonder. </p><p> “It would be hard to make you under-</p><p>stand why, Don Pablo,” replied Diego de </p><p>Torres, smiling. “You are a soldier and </p><p>I am a seaman.” </p><p> He was that rarest of sixteenth century</p><p>types, a Spanish naval officer who knew </p><p>and loved the sea. Born in a crumbling, </p><p>spray-drenched castle on the craggy head- </p><p>land where for five centuries his ancestors </p><p>Two Strong Men </p><p>had looked out over the Bay of Biscay, </p><p>Don Diego had literally learned the taste </p><p>of salt water in his cradle. The children </p><p>of fishermen and smugglers had been his </p><p>playmates; and later, his teachers had been </p><p>the buccaneers of Holland, France and </p><p>England, in the grim schools of the North </p><p>Sea and the Caribbean. </p><p> Young as he was, he had commanded</p><p>a ship in the Great Armada of 1588, and </p><p>had been one of the few commanders to </p><p>bring his vessel safely back to Spain. </p><p>He had served with high distinction in </p><p>the galleons of the Indian Guard before the </p><p>viceroy of Mexico sent him to the Southern </p><p>Seas. </p><p> Yet, in spite of his plebeian knowledge</p><p>of sheets and braces, cross-staffs and </p><p>astrolabes, no one could deny that Don </p><p>Diego de Torres looked and bore himself </p><p>like the caballero he was. His slender, </p><p>shapely figure, in its perfectly fitting sheath </p><p>of black and silver, was as straight and </p><p>supple as the long rapier by his side, and </p><p>as finely tempered. His handsome, deli-_ </p><p>cately-featured face would have seemed </p><p>that of an ineffectual dreamer to one who </p><p>failed to notice the strong chin beneath </p><p>the short, pointed beard, or who had never </p><p>seen the light of battle glow in those dark, </p><p>melancholy eyes. </p><p> Up the poop-ladder from the waist came</p><p>a young girl, astonishingly beautiful. She </p><p>was a Spanish blonde, blue-eyed and fair </p><p>as any Englishwoman, but with all the </p><p>grace and lire of the South. Perched on </p><p>her wrist sat a small, gay-feathered Borneo </p><p>parrot, which her father, the ex-governor, </p><p>had bought for her on the assurance that </p><p>it could “play tricks and talk like a Chris- </p><p>tian.” </p><p> “Has it spoken yet, Dona Ysabel?”</p><p>asked Lieutenant Gomez, as he did at least </p><p>ten times daily. </p><p> “Not yet, Don Pablo.”</p><p> A suspicious gleam of polished metal in</p><p>one of the temple groves ashore caught the </p><p>watchful lieutenant’s eye. The tide was </p><p>ebbing, and the galleon lay head on to </p><p>shore; Don Pablo bowed and went forward </p><p>for a closer view.</p><p> For the first time since the galleon had</p><p>cleared from Manila, Diego and Ysabel </p><p>were alone together. Though he had </p><p>longed to speak with her, to be near her, </p><p>the caballero's rigid sense of honor had </p><p>forced him to maintain a formal distance </p><p>between himself and the betrothed of </p><p>another man. Burning with resentment </p><p>at the trick that Don Feliz had played </p><p>upon him, his heart tortured with hopeless </p><p>love, he was man and gentleman enough </p><p>to play the game as he understood it, cost </p><p>him what it might. But now he was face </p><p>to face with Ysabel herself; the blood </p><p>throbbed in his temples, his stern face and </p><p>tense lips showed the strain under which </p><p>his self-control was laboring. Ysabel </p><p>watched him with anxious, tender eyes. </p><p> Suddenly, before either of them could</p><p>utter a word, a strange shrill voice spoke </p><p>from the empty air between them. </p><p> “Diego!” it cried, softly and plaintively,</p><p>as if its heart were breaking. “Diego of my </p><p>soul, come back to me!” </p><p> “It is the bird,” said Diego, his voice</p><p>under control, but his cheeks white beneath </p><p>the sunburn. “It is the bird—I have heard </p><p>the like in the West Indies.” </p><p> Ysabel trembled and caught at the poop</p><p>rail for support. The parrot, shaken from </p><p>her wrist, flew to the top of one of the </p><p>great, heavily leaded stern lanterns, whence </p><p>it cried again— </p><p> “Diego of my soul, come back to me!”</p><p>Through the open cabin skylight came the </p><p>clink of glasses and a snatch of a drinking- </p><p>song in a high-pitched, unpleasant voice— </p><p>the voice of that successful speculator in </p><p>billetes, Don Feliz de Arruego. </p><p> “No!” said Ysabel, her voice on edge</p><p>with loathing, her features firm and re- </p><p>solved. “No! I will not go back to Spain </p><p>and marry that beast down there!” </p><p> Diego’s heart leaped with a hope that he</p><p>dared not acknowledge. </p><p> “You must not say this,” he cautioned</p><p>her. “It can do no good.” </p><p> He knew that her greedy-souled father</p><p>would hold her to the bargain, as by Spanish </p><p>law he had every right to do. And he knew </p><p>that the parrot was repeating what it had </p><p>heard her cry out, over and over again in </p><p>the night watches, innocent as she was of </p><p>the terrible imitativeness of parrots. </p><p>Henceforth the bird would cry it out all </p><p>over the ship—and the voyage to Acapulco </p><p>was five months long! </p><p> The cold sweat was standing out on</p><p>Diego’s forehead. But Ysabel was smiling, </p><p>radiant with happiness. </p><p> “Listen, Diego!” she cried softly, so that</p><p>those in the cabin might not hear. “Listen! </p><p>I have found a way!” </p><p>170 </p><p>Adventure </p><p> "No, no,” he protested. “I can not</p><p>listen—you can not, in honor—oh, what </p><p>can I say to make you understand? We </p><p>must not think of that which has been— </p><p>you are his betrothed!” </p><p> “His betrothed!” she breathed scorn-</p><p>fully, her eyes twin points of blue flame. </p><p>“His purchase, together with the bales of </p><p>spices in the hold! Let him keep ship and </p><p>merchandise—you and I will go ashore in this </p><p>strange land and live there forevermore!” </p><p>“Ysabel! You would stay in Japan, a </p><p>hostile and a heathen land! You would </p><p>spend your life among barbarians to be </p><p>with me?” </p><p> “But there are thousands of Christians</p><p>in Japan, so Ichio of the water-casks has </p><p>told me,” the girl replied; “and good </p><p>priests from Portugal, who—” her voice </p><p>sank to a whisper, but she finished bravely, </p><p>with crimson cheeks—“who would marry </p><p>us, Diego.” </p><p> Her lovely eyes looked up into his, her</p><p>face was very near. Here, on this same </p><p>corner of the poop where they now stood, </p><p>he had first spoken to her, one moonlit </p><p>night in mid-Pacific, of his great love. </p><p>That love had filled his heart ever since, </p><p>mastering him with its sweet madness, </p><p>torturing him with its hopelessness, and now </p><p>he felt it rise within him in a great, glad flood </p><p>that swept away all doubts, all scruples. </p><p> Why should he give her up? She was</p><p>his, his in spite of the vile trickster who </p><p>had stolen her from him, but who had not </p><p>won her heart. She loved him, Diego, </p><p>loved him enough to give up home, friends, </p><p>riches and live in exile, so she might only </p><p>live with him! And why not? Why </p><p>should they not land on that beautiful </p><p>shore before him, and there live happily as </p><p>long as life was theirs? He bent toward her, </p><p>beside himself with her beauty, and </p><p>stretched out his arms to take her to him. </p><p> But before he could put his thought into</p><p>word or action, a loud challenging hail rang </p><p>out from the forecastle: </p><p> “Boat ahoy! Keep off or we fire!”</p><p>Diego’s arms dropped to his side; the</p><p>madness swept from his brain by the </p><p>urgency of duty, he turned to look out </p><p>over the rail. A gorgeously painted barge, </p><p>crowded with Japanese officials in strange </p><p>ceremonial costumes, had put out from the </p><p>shore and was approaching the anchored </p><p>galleon. </p><p> “But it is the honorable ambassadors of</p><p>the Lord Kurushima,” came the reply in </p><p>Spanish and in the familiar voice of Ichio, </p><p>“with a most weighty message to the </p><p>valiant Captain Don Diego de Torres.” </p><p> “Bid the ambassadors come aboard,”</p><p>Diego replied shortly. </p><p> His half-hostile reception when he entered</p><p>the harbor, the massing of troops on shore, </p><p>and the semi-piratical reputation of the </p><p>Tosa coast, had caused him to stand on </p><p>his guard and keep off all shore craft at a </p><p>safe distance. He had wanted nothing </p><p>better than to be left alone till he could </p><p>complete the tedious task of refilling the </p><p>water-casks and put out to sea. </p><p> But a formal embassy demanded formal</p><p>and proper reception—even if he were not </p><p>now thinking of making a welcome in </p><p>Japan for himself and Ysabel. </p><p> “Lower away the starboard gangway,</p><p>smartly, there!” Diego commanded. </p><p>“Boatswain, lay aft with your sideboys, </p><p>drummers and trumpeters. Lieutenant </p><p>Gomez, your musketeers and pikemen will </p><p>form a guard of honor. Have them present </p><p>arms as the ambassadors come overside.” </p><p> Loud boomed the saluting guns; the</p><p>trumpets sounded, the drummers beat a </p><p>ruffle and the boatswain piped the am- </p><p>bassadors aboard. There were bows and </p><p>greetings on both sides; the ambassadors, </p><p>all men well past middle life, with gor- </p><p>geously embroidered silk kimonos and oiled </p><p>black top-knots, almost swept the decks </p><p>with their foreheads; and the courteous </p><p>Spaniards drew off their plumed caps with </p><p>a stately flourish and a crooking of velvet </p><p>knees. </p><p> Beautiful gifts of curiously carved ivory</p><p>were brought forward by the ambassadors; </p><p>boxes of perfumed sandalwood, inlaid </p><p>bronze-lacquer caskets, and rich pieces of</p><p>raw silk, were presented in token of the </p><p>friendly esteem of the Daimio. In ac- </p><p>knowledgment, Diego had his servants </p><p>bring out food, and tall glasses of Spanish </p><p>wine, of which his guests partook sparingly. </p><p>He offered no gifts in return, for he knew </p><p>that would have offended the ambassadors. </p><p> Ichio, maestro de los factories de agua,</p><p>proved himself also a master of the lan- </p><p>guage and etiquette of both nations. After </p><p>an hour’s hard work, he reached the point </p><p>where he could deliver the Daimio’s urgent </p><p>invitation to Captain Diego de Torres to </p><p>visit him in his castle, and advise him how </p><p>to combat the terrible tortoise-boat. </p><p>Two Strong Men </p><p>171 </p><p> Diego’s somber eyes lit up with interest.</p><p>Here was the very opening he was looking </p><p>for; moreover, the description of the </p><p>strange Korean warship which had in- </p><p>flicted disaster upon the fleet of Japan </p><p>aroused his professional interest. So Diego </p><p>went ashore with the highly pleased and </p><p>very deferential ambassadors. By his own </p><p>orders, none of his countrymen went with </p><p>him; he wanted no witnesses to that which, </p><p>might occur. </p><p>CS223 KURUSHIMA’S castle proved to </p><p>r■*1 be a huge rectangular enclosure of </p><p>1 1 gray stone, hardly more than a </p><p>crenelated wall twelve feet high, sloping </p><p>outward in a massive escarpment, and pro- </p><p>vided with wide, strong gates and a moat. </p><p>Passing through ihe south gate with his </p><p>escort, between two fantastically-armored </p><p>sentinels in black war-masks, Diego was </p><p>ushered in between bowing functionaries, </p><p>and discovered himself in a court containing </p><p>half-a-dozen picturesque wooden buildings, </p><p>richly finished and grotesquely carved. </p><p>His guides led the way into the largest of </p><p>these, and departed. </p><p> A powerfully built man with command-</p><p>ing eyes rose from a padded mat at the </p><p>further end of the hall, and approached him, </p><p>bowing low. Though no word was said, </p><p>Diego recognized that he was in the pres- </p><p>ence of the Daimio, so obviously was this </p><p>Japanese the master of the place. Ichio, </p><p>entering behind his captain, confirmed his </p><p>impression by prostrating himself with </p><p>marked humility. Diego looked his host </p><p>over with frank, though courteous curiosity. </p><p>Kurushima was still young, plainly an </p><p>athlete and a soldier. His gaze was lion- </p><p>like and frank, his gestures those of a born </p><p>leader of men. </p><p> After tea had been brought in and served,</p><p>with much ceremony, in handleless cups </p><p>of gay Chinese porcelain, the Daimio </p><p>began to talk easily and fluently, Ichio </p><p>translating with a mounting air of impor- </p><p>tance. Diego listened intently, without </p><p>comment. As calmly as if he had been </p><p>discussing an event of ancient history, </p><p>Kurushima told the tale of the tortoise- </p><p>boat, describing his own defeat in vivid, </p><p>concise terms.</p><p> “And this is the ship,” he concluded at</p><p>length, drawing a roll of stiffened silk from </p><p>one capacious sleeve. </p><p> Seated upon a chest—the nearest ap-</p><p>proach to a chair in all Urado—Don Diego </p><p>received the roll, unfolded it and gazed </p><p>with great interest at a spirited painting </p><p>of the tortoise-boat, drawn by Kurushima </p><p>from memory. The Daimio was an artist </p><p>of no mean ability, and had reproduced </p><p>every detail of the monstrous craft with </p><p>wonderful accuracy. </p><p> “A new type—a galley with broadside</p><p>guns as well as bow-chasers!” exclaimed </p><p>the Spaniard. “In that point it resembles </p><p>the galleasses of Don John of Austria at </p><p>Lepanto—but those were no true galleys, </p><p>for they were ship-rigged as well as oared. </p><p>I should like to see a squadron of these </p><p>tortoise-boats built for the Mediterranean </p><p>service, and sent against the rovers of the </p><p>Barbary Coast.” </p><p> “This curved deck, Don Diego, is covered</p><p>with plates of iron,” explained Ichio. </p><p>“The Lord Kurushima wishes to know if you </p><p>have ever heard of an iron-plated ship </p><p>before?” </p><p> Diego nodded.</p><p> “When I was at the siege of Antwerp, the</p><p>Hollanders sent against our blockading </p><p>fleet a large galleon whose sides they had </p><p>covered over, even to her cage-works, with </p><p>plates of iron. They expected great things </p><p>from this craft, and named her the Finis </p><p>Belli, which signifies in Latin ‘The End of </p><p>the War.’ But she steered badly, ran </p><p>aground on a shoal, heeled over at low </p><p>tide till she was helpless, and so was cap- </p><p>tured by the ship which I then had the </p><p>honor to command.” </p><p> Swiftly Ichio translated this into Japan-</p><p>ese, and presently put the Daimio’s next </p><p>question into Spanish: </p><p> “Since you have captured one iron ship,</p><p>Don Diego, could you not capture another? </p><p>Could you fight the tortoise-boat with a </p><p>galleon like the San Gregorio?” </p><p> “Yes, in the open sea. Galleys are good</p><p>only in sheltered waters. With her over- </p><p>hanging topsides and narrow hull, this </p><p>tortoise-boat would roll vilely in any sort </p><p>of sea, so that good gunnery would be </p><p>impossible. Her iron sheathing can not </p><p>be more than quarter-inch plate; other- </p><p>wise its weight, carried so high above the </p><p>water-line, would capsize and sink her even </p><p>in a calm. The San Gregorio’s culverins </p><p>would smash her thin plating like glass.” </p><p>“How much does a galleon like the San </p><p>Gregorio cost?” </p><p> “She was built at the Cavite shipyards,</p><p>172 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>three years ago, for eight thousand pesos. </p><p>Her guns and tackle cost as much more,” </p><p>Diego replied. </p><p> “The honorable Daimio would buy her</p><p>for sixty thousand pesos—more than three </p><p>times what she was worth new,” said </p><p>Ichio. </p><p> “I shall forward his Excellency’s most</p><p>liberal offer to the viceroy at Mexico City,” </p><p>Diego assured them, wondering where the </p><p>Japanese could find a captain capable of </p><p>commanding a Western war-galleon. </p><p> “And to you, oh Don Diego,” continued</p><p>the interpreter, “he offers lands worth ten </p><p>thousand koku a year, and the fair castle </p><p>of Kobugara, to you and to your heirs </p><p>forever, if you will stay and be his admiral.” </p><p> Diego’s face was unmoved, but his heart</p><p>bounded within him. Here was the chance </p><p>he had been hoping for, which he might </p><p>even have been moved to suggest himself, </p><p>had not the Japanese played into his hand. </p><p>It was a princely offer. Should he accept </p><p>it, then he could go back to the San Gregorio </p><p>with a light heart, and return to shore with </p><p>Dona Ysabel. Her father and Don Feliz </p><p>would doubtless object, but what could </p><p>they do? He himself was free to resign </p><p>from the service of Philip of Spain; and </p><p>Gil Robles, the mate, was fully competent </p><p>to take the galleon back across the Pacific. </p><p> Moreover, from the moment he had en-</p><p>tered the hall and looked into the Daimio’s </p><p>frank young face and fearless eye, Diego </p><p>had felt himself strongly attracted to </p><p>Kurushima. Friendships had been few </p><p>in Diego’s lonely life; here, he knew in- </p><p>stinctively, was a man who would make </p><p>him a strong and loyal friend. Unknown </p><p>to Diego, the same thought was in Kuru- </p><p>shima’s mind, as he sat on the cushioned </p><p>mat and looked at his outland guest. </p><p>Shrewd little Ichio glanced from one to </p><p>the other, read their minds, and silently </p><p>congratulated himself and his master, </p><p>Hideyoshi. </p><p> “Tell the Lord Kurushima that I accept,”</p><p>said Diego, rising, “for his service seems </p><p>one in which a man may gain much honor.</p><p>Now I must go to the ship and come back </p><p>with a friend, before the galleon resumes </p><p>her voyage to Acapulco. When she has </p><p>returned to Japan; as my Lord Kurushima’s </p><p>ship, then will I begin my duties as his </p><p>admiral. Till then, I crave his hospitality </p><p>for myself and one other person now on </p><p>board the San Gregorio.” </p><p> “Oh Don Diego!” Ichio entreated, “his</p><p>Excellency wishes that you and whoever </p><p>you may bring with you may be his guests </p><p>for ten thousand years. But he says that </p><p>he can not wait for the galleon to cross the </p><p>great ocean and return. He must have </p><p>her now, to sink the tortoise-boat as soon </p><p>as possible, that Japan’s armies may cross </p><p>the seas. Delay might mean the ruin of </p><p>our enterprise! The honorable Daimio </p><p>must take possession of the San Gregorio </p><p>today!” </p><p>DIEGO tapped his foot upon the </p><p>floor. </p><p> “That,” he answered calmly, “he</p><p>can not do. I regret exceedingly tbat I </p><p>am unable to dispose of his Majesty’s ship </p><p>without authorization.” </p><p> “But, Don Diego,” protested the voluble</p><p>Ichio, “the crew will do whatever you bid </p><p>them—you have but to order them ashore. </p><p>None of those on board will be injured or </p><p>deprived of anything: the cargo will be </p><p>placed under seal and guarded by its owners </p><p>and the soldiers of Lieutenant Gomez, till </p><p>another ship can come from Manila to </p><p>take everything away. And the great price </p><p>that the Lord Kurushima is paying for the </p><p>ship will surely compensate for the delay </p><p>to those in authority in Mexico and Spain.” </p><p>Diego knit his brows. Polite as the </p><p>Daimio’s assurances were, he felt a veiled </p><p>threat under their silkiness. The Japanese </p><p>needed his vessel now; evidently they would </p><p>not brook delay. Yet his honor would not </p><p>permit him, an officer of the king, to be </p><p>false to his trust, no matter what it might </p><p>cost himself. And that it might cost much </p><p>he knew, for he was familiar with the repu- </p><p>tation of the Japanese. </p><p> And with that thought came realization.</p><p>The quiet, but evident purpose of those </p><p>fishing-smacks—the gleam of armor in </p><p>the temple - groves; the guard-boats </p><p>crammed with swordsmen! He understood</p><p>it all now: the Daimio would not wait for </p><p>a reply from Spain; if he could not get the </p><p>San Gregorio peacefully, he would try what </p><p>force could do! Diego’s stubborn heart </p><p>hardened, and his reply was crisp. </p><p> “Be that as it may,” he said firmly, “I</p><p>can not do this thing his Excellency asks </p><p>of me, for I am not yet in the service of the </p><p>Lord Kurushima. I am, until he is pleased </p><p>to accept my resignation, an officer of his </p><p>Most Catholic Majesty, the King of Spain. </p><p>Two Strong Men </p><p>173 </p><p>And until the sale of the galleon has been </p><p>consummated, the San Gregorio is still the </p><p>king’s ship, which I, who have the honor to </p><p>command her, will defend against any who- </p><p>soever will try to take her by force of arms. </p><p>You will make this clear to the Lord Kuru- </p><p>shima, and add that I have the honor to </p><p>wish him a very good afternoon.” </p><p> And with a courtly bow, he turned and</p><p>walked out of the audience hall, looking as </p><p>unconcerned as if he were taking a stroll </p><p>on the Prado. Inwardly, he was suffering </p><p>all the tortures of the Inquisition. Before </p><p>him rose the white, pleading face of Ysabel, </p><p>doomed by his quixotic action to a hateful </p><p>marriage, sacrificed to a pedantic point of </p><p>honor. But, however willing he might be </p><p>to stay with her in Japan, he could not steal </p><p>the king’s ship. And what was her happi- </p><p>ness or his, compared to the honor of </p><p>Spain? Holding his head high, Diego </p><p>passed on. </p><p> But when he came to the outer courtyard</p><p>of the castle, he found the gateway barred </p><p>by a score of Japanese pikemen with </p><p>lowered points. Other men-at-arms </p><p>guarded the stone steps leading to the </p><p>platform where, in time of siege, archers </p><p>could stand to shoot over the battlemented </p><p>parapet of the castle wall. </p><p> Out of the door of the audience hall came</p><p>Kurushima, attended by Ichio and an </p><p>armed guard. </p><p> “The Daimio regrets, oh Don Diego!”</p><p>cried the interpreter, “that he must detain </p><p>you here till he has seized the San Gregorio. </p><p>And he hopes that you may yet become </p><p>his admiral, and serve him as faithfully as </p><p>you have served the King of Spain!” </p><p> “Tell the Daimio,” answered Diego,</p><p>looking swiftly about him, “that since he </p><p>is coming to visit my ship, I must hasten </p><p>aboard to prepare a welcome for him!” </p><p> Against the wall, hard by the castle gate,</p><p>stood a wooden rack full of long, stout </p><p>bamboo lances. Before any of the sur- </p><p>prised Japanese could stop him, Diego </p><p>had reached the rack and snatched out </p><p>one of the fourteen-foot spears. Bringing</p><p>it to the charge, he ran full-tilt across the </p><p>gravel, not in the direction of the gate, </p><p>but toward a long, blank stretch of the </p><p>outer wall. Just as the spear-head seemed </p><p>about to crash against the granite, Diego </p><p>lowered and thrust it^into the ground at the </p><p>foot of the wall. </p><p> The butt of the shaft, with the man</p><p>clinging to it, rose straight up into the air. </p><p>Letting go of the lance, Diego dropped </p><p>on his side on the broad platform of the </p><p>wall, rose and dived headforemost through </p><p>an embrasure into the deep waters of the </p><p>castle moat. </p><p> A startled shout, half rage, half acclama-</p><p>tion, went up from the astounded Japanese </p><p>in the courtyard. A mounted retainer on </p><p>the road outside reined up his horse at </p><p>the sound, and at the sight of a dripping </p><p>foreigner climbing out of the moat beside </p><p>him. The horseman made the mistake of </p><p>drawing up too close; just as he snatched </p><p>out his sword, Diego was upon him. Put- </p><p>ting one hand under the red-lacquered, </p><p>shoe-like stirrup, the athletic Spaniard </p><p>gave a great heave that lifted the other </p><p>out of the saddle and dropped him, half- </p><p>stunned and wholly bewildered, into the </p><p>middle of the road. Before the retainer </p><p>could scramble to his feet again, Diego had </p><p>mounted and was galloping down the road </p><p>to the shore. </p><p> Behind him, armed men were pouring in</p><p>shouting hundreds out of the castle gate. </p><p>Drums began to beat, conches sounded </p><p>hoarsely; from both the thatch-roofed </p><p>town on Diego’s right and the huge old </p><p>Buddhist temple on his left erupted sudden </p><p>streams' of men-at-arms. A matchlock </p><p>roared; a flight of arrows whirred past </p><p>the fugitive’s head, but the range was long </p><p>and the target far from stationary. Bare- </p><p>legged peasants toiling in the wet paddy- </p><p>fields looked up curiously at the hunted </p><p>horseman, but made no attempt to stay </p><p>him; farming was their trade, fighting </p><p>their masters’. </p><p> Now the beach was very near. Drawn</p><p>up on the sand like a Viking fleet were </p><p>twenty or more great open row-boats, </p><p>ready to be manned and pushed off. Diego </p><p>thought of the flint and steel in his pouch; </p><p>but there was no time to try burning the</p><p>enemy’s boats—the pursuers were too </p><p>close. Straight down the beach and into </p><p>the water he rode the panting pony, till </p><p>the saddle was awash. </p><p> “Saint James be praised!” cried Diego</p><p>fervently. </p><p> Halfway between him and the anchored</p><p>galleon was the San Gregorio’s long-boat, </p><p>with a giant’s rosary of fresh-filled water- </p><p>casks bobbing astern. </p><p>. “Ho, Gil Robles, to me!” </p><p> Standing up in his stirrups, Diego shouted</p><p>174 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>and waved his broad-brimmed felt hat </p><p>with its dripping plume. The stocky </p><p>figure in the stern of the long-boat looked </p><p>'round, waved back, whipped out a gleam- </p><p>ing knife and cut the tow-rope. </p><p> “Even so, we have filled enough casks</p><p>today to last us to the rain-belt of the </p><p>upper latitudes,” thought Diego, as he </p><p>threw away his hat and dived from the </p><p>saddle. “Good man, Gil!” </p><p> ’Round came the long-boat, starboard</p><p>oars backing, port oars pulling, in a smother </p><p>of foam and a crackling roar of Biscayan </p><p>oaths from the mate. Diego swam swiftly </p><p>out to meet it, his long rapier hampered </p><p>him cruelly, but he would not part with it. </p><p>He swam under water as much as possible, </p><p>coming to the surface only for a hastily- </p><p>snatched breath and diving again, for fear </p><p>of arrows from the shore. </p><p> But no arrows fell. Looking back as he</p><p>swam, Diego saw the beach a solid mass </p><p>of excited Japanese soldiery, and, in the </p><p>front rank, archers lowering their bent </p><p>bows at the imperative gestures of Kuru- </p><p>shima, on horseback and in full armor at </p><p>the water’s edge. </p><p> “Heathen though he is,” thought the</p><p>grateful Spaniard, “there breathes not in </p><p>all Christendom a more gallant knight and </p><p>gentleman than Lord Kurushima!” </p><p> THIRTY strokes more, and Gil</p><p>Robles was helping him into the </p><p>long-boat. Away they went for </p><p>the San Gregorio, the boat’s crew pulling </p><p>with every ounce they could throw into it, </p><p>as they saw the swarming Japanese embark </p><p>and push off from the shore. </p><p> Taking a deep breath into his aching</p><p>lungs, Diego stood up in the stern-sheets </p><p>and blew a long call on the silver whistle </p><p>hung ’round his neck. Back shrilled an </p><p>answer from the boatswain on the ship; the </p><p>soldiers’ trumpeter sounded the call to arms. </p><p> Men swarmed up the galleon’s shrouds</p><p>and lay out on the yards. ’Round creaked </p><p>the windlass, as the huge hempen anchor- </p><p>cable writhed in through the hawse-hole</p><p>like a frightened snake. Foresail and main- </p><p>sail, huge single topsails—top-gallants and </p><p>royals there were none—the little square </p><p>spritsail under the high-steeved bowsprit </p><p>and the tall, graceful lateen on the mizzen— </p><p>all were set and the anchor apeak, as the </p><p>long-boat shot ’round the San Gregorio's </p><p>bows and along her starboard side. </p><p> Now the off-shore breeze brought her</p><p>head ’round and her port battery to bear </p><p>on the approaching Japanese flotilla. </p><p> “Let them have it!” shouted Diego, as</p><p>he came over the rail. </p><p> Already loaded and run out, the nine</p><p>culverins on the gun-deck and the light </p><p>pieces on the poop and forecastle thundered </p><p>together. Before the dense cloud of sul- </p><p>furous smoke had lifted, the galleon was </p><p>running, with the wind on her starboard </p><p>quarter, for the open sea. </p><p> “The saints be praised, the heathen are</p><p>all slain!” cried a fat Manila silk-dealer, with </p><p>pious fervor. </p><p> “Two boats sunk, one sinking, the rest</p><p>coming on bravely,” corrected Diego, </p><p>peering through the lifting powder-smoke </p><p>astern. “How craftily they follow in our </p><p>wake—we have not a gun to bear. Lay </p><p>aft the musketeers! Bid the master-gunner </p><p>shift two culverins to the stern-ports!” </p><p>“Why not round to, and give them </p><p>another broadside?” asked Gil Robles. </p><p> “I dare not, in this narrow channel</p><p>betwixt the inner haven and the sea,” </p><p>replied the captain in a low voice. “Should </p><p>we touch bottom, or the wind fail us before </p><p>we reach open water, they will lay us </p><p>aboard. And there are a thousand good </p><p>fighting men in those craft, while we have </p><p>less than three-score fit to bear arms. </p><p> “Gentlemen,” he added in a louder voice,</p><p>to the anxiously listening passengers, “arm </p><p>yourselves and report for duty at your </p><p>appointed stations. Be of good cheer, for </p><p>it may be given us this day to uphold the </p><p>honor of Spain! Rig the waist-cloths, </p><p>there! Send round-shot up to the tops </p><p>and yards! Make ready the bases, minions </p><p>and murderer-guns! Pikemen, stand by </p><p>the rail! Carpenter, make hot the pitch! </p><p>Lieutenant Gomez, the after-castle is your</p><p>charge; Senor Robles, the forecastle is </p><p>your station. I myself will hold the waist.” </p><p>High-built at stem and stern were the </p><p>galleons of those days; the forecastle was </p><p>indeed a castle set in the fore part of the </p><p>ship, the poop was another fortress towering </p><p>aft. The low waist lay like a valley be- </p><p>tween them; to raise its sides and make </p><p>them harder for a foe to scale, strips of </p><p>stout canvas, painted with gay armorial </p><p>devices, were stretched along the top of the </p><p>bulwarks from poop to forecastle. These </p><p>were the waist-cloths, ancestors of the </p><p>nineteenth-century boarding-net. </p><p>Two Strong Men </p><p>175 </p><p> Mounted at the break of poop and fore-</p><p>castle were the bases, minions and mur- </p><p>derers; wicked little breech-loading swivels </p><p>that could sweep any part of deck or rail </p><p>with a storm of small shot.	*3</p><p> “Boy, bring me my armor!” cried Diego;</p><p>but the cabin-boy was below, sanding the </p><p>gun-deck. </p><p> Then, suddenly, some one stood by the</p><p>captain’s side, placing the helmet tenderly </p><p>on his head, buckling on his breast and </p><p>back plates. It was Ysabel, careless of </p><p>who might see. </p><p> “I failed ashore,” he whispered. “It</p><p>was my fault; forgive me, and farewell.” </p><p>Her answer, prompted perhaps by the </p><p>excitement of the moment, perhaps by the </p><p>certainty of betrayal by the parrot, was </p><p>to kiss Diego squarely on the lips, in the </p><p>sight of the whole crew—and of Don Feliz </p><p>de Arruego! Passing by her infuriated </p><p>betrothed as if he did not exist, she went </p><p>into the little chapel of Saint Gregory, </p><p>that opened off the main cabin, and knelt </p><p>before the 'altar, where the priests and </p><p>friars were praying for deliverance from the </p><p>fury of the heat.hen. </p><p> On plunged the galleon, at the top of</p><p>her ponderous speed; the wind was freshen- </p><p>ing, the ebb-tide ran like a mill-race down </p><p>the narrow channel. But the long, many- </p><p>oared craft astern gained steadily, urged </p><p>by the straining efforts of the rowers, till </p><p>they were not quite within musket-shot. </p><p>At that distance they remained, holding </p><p>their position easily, but making no effort </p><p>to gain. </p><p> “I like it not,” said Lieutenant Gomez,</p><p>as Diego came up to inspect the defenses </p><p>of the poop. “Why do the heathen follow </p><p>us so tamely, down this defile to the open, </p><p>where they know we can turn and blow </p><p>them to pieces? Being the swifter, why </p><p>do they not press the pursuit?” </p><p> “Because,” answered the captain, “they</p><p>have blocked the mouth of the channel </p><p>with those fishing-smacks I pointed out to </p><p>you.” </p><p> “But there is much room at either end</p><p>of their line,” said the infantry-officer, </p><p>peering ahead at the little fleet of anchored </p><p>junks. “Why not outflank and march </p><p>past them, on the right or left?” </p><p> “Good tactics for a soldier,” Diego com-</p><p>mented. “But this is the sea. It is too </p><p>shoal. We must hold on and run one of </p><p>them down.” </p><p> “Charge home and trample them under</p><p>foot? I have never fought on the sea, </p><p>but I perceive I shall do so under a wise </p><p>and valorous general. God keep you, Don </p><p>Diego!” </p><p> “And you, Don Pablo!”</p><p> Wringing the simple-hearted little sol-</p><p>dier’s hand, Diego went below to the gun- </p><p>deck, to train, himself, the bow-chasers on </p><p>the line of anchored junks, now nearly </p><p>within range. There were five of them, </p><p>lying squarely across the fairway, broad- </p><p>side on to the approaching galleon. Nets </p><p>were stretched between them; but there </p><p>was not a sign of life on their decks. </p><p> Firing a first shot over them to give fair</p><p>warning—of which they took no heed— </p><p>Diego let drive at the bow and stern of the </p><p>midmost junk, hoping to smash the bitts </p><p>and cut her cables. But that was too </p><p>accurate work for the primitive smooth- </p><p>bores, on a high-built, deep-pitching galleon. </p><p>Down came the junk’s foremast, and a </p><p>cloud of splinters flew from her rotten top- </p><p>sides; that was all. </p><p> “A worn-out, empty hulk,” said Gil</p><p>Robles, as Diego came on deck again. </p><p>“With our weight and speed, we should </p><p>ride right over her.” </p><p> There was no other way. Any attempt</p><p>to check their own ungainly craft in that </p><p>narrow tide-race would have piled her up </p><p>on the sands, a helpless prey to the wolf- </p><p>pack following astern. </p><p> Hold her steady! We are on her!”</p><p> With a great crash of splintering timbers,</p><p>the bluff bows of the San Gregorio crushed </p><p>through the frail hull of the fishing-junk, </p><p>snapping her ribs and deck-beams like the </p><p>veins of a dried leaf. Then the incredible</p><p>happened. Instead of sinking or breaking </p><p>in two, the shattered, distorted wreck </p><p>wrapped itself ’round the destroyer’s fore- </p><p>foot, staying her progress, bringing her, </p><p>inside of ten seconds, from full speed to a </p><p>dead standstill. </p><p> The strain on the San Gregorio’s fabric</p><p>was terrific—no modern wind-jammer could </p><p>have suffered it without losing most of </p><p>her top-hamper. But the Manila-Acapulco </p><p>galleons had small sail area, teak masts and </p><p>massive rigging of pure abaca fiber. </p><p>Though every inch of her shrieked in </p><p>protest, nothing carried away. </p><p> Her plight, however, was hideously ob-</p><p>vious. The wrecked junk plastered ’round </p><p>her bows was held together and made fast </p><p>176 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>by thick grass hawsers to her four consorts; </p><p>and each of the five was double-anchored, </p><p>bow and stern! The galleon’s impact had </p><p>bent the line of junks, causing the two </p><p>nearest the wreck to drag their anchors, </p><p>till the Japanese craft were close up under </p><p>the San Gregorio's forecastle, one on either </p><p>side. </p><p> “Clear away that wreckage! Cut the</p><p>cables!” </p><p>GIL ROBLES and a dozen seamen </p><p>swarmed down over the bows, </p><p>knife and hatchet in hand. But </p><p>before they could sever a single strand, </p><p>there erupted from the holds of the four </p><p>uninjured junks a shrieking horde of naked </p><p>brown men brandishing naked steel. Those </p><p>that were near enough leaped down with </p><p>high-heaved blades; others dived over- </p><p>board and swam round to the wreck, </p><p>holding their swords in their teeth. </p><p> Gil Robles split the first comer’s skull</p><p>with his hatchet. But the odds were too </p><p>great; three of the galleon’s crew were </p><p>literally chopped to pieces there on the </p><p>wreck. Fighting furiously, the mate and </p><p>the rest of his detail made good their </p><p>retreat up over the bows, while the heathen </p><p>hacked at them from below. At last they </p><p>were once more sheltered by the high, </p><p>square-built forecastle. Here they turned </p><p>on their pursuers, and hurled the foremost </p><p>foemen down into the sea. </p><p> “Send forward the musketeers,” implored</p><p>Gil Robles, swinging his dripping hatchet. </p><p>“Swivels and musketeers!” </p><p> But a roar of musketry from the poop</p><p>told him the soldiers were busy aft. Well </p><p>they might be. The Japanese flotilla </p><p>astern was closing in on the trapped galleon </p><p>as-fast as oars could drive it. Trapped she </p><p>was, but not defenseless—the San Gregorio’s </p><p>stern-chasers, loaded with a solid-shot and </p><p>a bag of bullets each, smashed one crowded </p><p>rowboat and made fearful havoc aboard </p><p>three more.	*</p><p> “Well done, Master-Gunner!” shouted</p><p>Diego down the main-hatch. “Cease firing! </p><p>Run in and secure your guns—the boats</p><p>will be too close alongside to hit before you </p><p>can reload. Close and make fast the port- </p><p>shutters; then on deck, all!” </p><p> A savage yell of triumph burst from the</p><p>throats of the bloodthirsty swordsmen </p><p>aboard the two leading Japanese craft. </p><p>One to port and one to starboard, they </p><p>swept up and made fast alongside the San </p><p>Gregorio’s waist. The eager warriors on </p><p>board them took no heed of the galleon’s </p><p>topmen, who, having furled and stowed the </p><p>fore and mainsails, lay out on the lower </p><p>yards. Yet ready to the hands of those </p><p>topmen lurked death and destruction. </p><p>Knives flashed through lanyards, and a </p><p>great iron cannon-ball dropped like a </p><p>thunderbolt from aloft on each boat be- </p><p>neath, smashing huge holes through the </p><p>bottom-boards. Few were the men-at- </p><p>arms of the first two boat-loads that did </p><p>not go down with their shattered trans- </p><p>ports. </p><p> Those Japanese that had the chance to</p><p>leap for the galleon’s main-chains, and the </p><p>luck to get a hand-hold, pulled themselves </p><p>up pluckily and bravely tried to scramble </p><p>aboard. But at each tell-tale inward bulge </p><p>of the baffling waist-cloths, a Spanish pike </p><p>or sword-point would lunge through canvas </p><p>and flesh together. </p><p> Arrows tore through the galleon’s rigging.</p><p>A big negro on the main-yard fell screaming </p><p>into the sea, a gaily-feathered shaft stick- </p><p>ing out from between his shoulder-blades. </p><p>Back scrambled his mates to the shelter of </p><p>the round, high-walled fighting-tops; their </p><p>trick had worked well, but it could be </p><p>worked but once. The rest of the Japanese </p><p>flotilla had now come up, its archers loosing </p><p>swiftly, its eager swordsmen ready to </p><p>board. </p><p> The Spanish musket-balls splintered their</p><p>gunwales and tore through their armor, </p><p>inflicting horrible, tearing wounds; but in </p><p>spite of it, the sampans grappled the San </p><p>Gregorio fore and aft, port and starboard, </p><p>as many as could crowd alongside. The </p><p>rest vomited their swordsmen over the side </p><p>and into the already packed hulls of those </p><p>that were at close grips. Trained to scale </p><p>walls and surmount all obstacles, the </p><p>gallant Samurai, burdened as they were </p><p>with armor, swarmed up the sides of the</p><p>galleon as easily as the naked men from </p><p>the junks. </p><p> Their keen swords slashed away the</p><p>waist-cloths, now sodden with blood and </p><p>stuck full of arrows. Only point or ball </p><p>told against them; no cutlas edge could </p><p>shear through their strange, loose-meshed </p><p>mail of lacquered steel. </p><p> Eight times the Japanese won a footing</p><p>on the deck amidships. Eight times the </p><p>murderer-guns from poop or forecastle </p><p>Two Strong Men </p><p>177 </p><p>tore through the dense mass of them, </p><p>gashing, shattering, till the fearless boarders </p><p>reeled, their ranks decimated. Eight times </p><p>Diego led a handful of weary pikemen </p><p>in a charge that drove the survivors back </p><p>into the sea. His splendid spirit, which </p><p>had trained and inspired the motley crew </p><p>of the San Gregorio—which was more of an </p><p>armed passenger ship than a man-of-war— </p><p>urged them on now to do more than their </p><p>best, to face and hurl back professional </p><p>warriors. </p><p> But no sooner was one boarding party</p><p>swept away than a fresh onslaught rolled </p><p>up over the rail. It was like fighting the </p><p>waves of the sea. Hundreds of the Japan- </p><p>ese remained, and the defenders were now </p><p>very few. Half those that had held the </p><p>waist lay dead or desperately wounded on </p><p>the deck, mingling their blood with that </p><p>of their fallen foes; and ever the heavy, </p><p>two-handed Oriental swords sheared </p><p>through the plates of their dripping armor. </p><p>And now from the forecastle came a de- </p><p>spairing cry. </p><p> “More men!” gasped Gil Robles. “More</p><p>men!” </p><p> Glancing swiftly about to count his</p><p>depleted forces, Diego caught sight of a </p><p>gorgeous, over-armored figure slinking away </p><p>toward the shelter of the cabin. </p><p> “Don Feliz!” he cried roughly. “Back</p><p>to your post! What? Your blade is as </p><p>clean as it was yesterday! Here by me, </p><p>you dog, and show yourself a man, or by </p><p>the saints, I will kill you with my own </p><p>hand!” </p><p> The speculator turned toward him a face</p><p>gray with terror. The flashing Japanese </p><p>swords had frightened from Arruego all </p><p>the little manhood he possessed. His </p><p>diseased imagination pictured those great, </p><p>razor-edged blades shearing through his </p><p>shrinking flesh; but the captain’s eyes </p><p>filled him with a fear more imminent, more </p><p>terrible than the fear of the shouting, black- </p><p>masked Japanese. He staggered over to </p><p>Diego’s side, his rapier trembling in his </p><p>hand. </p><p> “Senor Capitdn,” reported a musketeer,</p><p>saluting with a powder-blackened hand, </p><p>“Lieutenant Gomez bids me say that he </p><p>can not hold the poop without reenforce- </p><p>ments. Thrice have the heathen scaled </p><p>the quarter-gallery and nigh forced their </p><p>way in through the stern-windows of the </p><p>cabin!” </p><p>12 </p><p> “Then we must ply them with the</p><p>murderer-guns,” thought Diego, and beck- </p><p>oned the master-gunner to him. “Shift </p><p>two swivels to the after-rail and two others </p><p>to the forecastle-head!” he commanded. </p><p> But the old master-gunner made a sign</p><p>of negation. </p><p> “They are all too hot to be shifted, or</p><p>reloaded either. The last chamber we </p><p>managed to wedge home exploded with the </p><p>heat of the breech before I could touch fire </p><p>to it. Unless you can hold them off with </p><p>point and edge, you must strike or sound a </p><p>parley.” </p><p> “Never!” replied Diego. “I will fight</p><p>to the end, and then order you to blow up </p><p>the magazine!”	.i</p><p> “And I will obey,” answered the master-</p><p>gunner steadily. “But there are only two </p><p>barrels of powder left.” </p><p> “Then listen,” said the captain, “and</p><p>I will tell you what to do with them. The </p><p>scheme is desperate, but we have no other </p><p>hope.”	.</p><p>“OH LORD OF TOSA,” protested </p><p>Kurushima’s gray-haired second in </p><p>command, “half our men are slain, </p><p>the rest are weary and sorely wounded, </p><p>and this devil-ship is as strong as ever! </p><p>Whenever we win her deck and drive back </p><p>her crew, their high-placed guns sweep us </p><p>away as an angry chess-player sweeps the </p><p>pieces from the board. Their weapons are </p><p>too powerful; their captain, whose sword </p><p>is everywhere, is no mortal but a demon— </p><p>else how could he have flown over our </p><p>castle-wall? Let us give up and row back </p><p>to the shore! This is worse than the </p><p>tortoise-boat!” </p><p> “Let dogs and cowards pull for the shore!”</p><p>cried Kurushima. “Let the true Samurai </p><p>follow me!” </p><p> Without waiting to see if any followed,</p><p>the Daimio sprang from the stern of his </p><p>own disabled boat to that of another, half- </p><p>full of blood-tinged water, whose bow </p><p>touched the San Gregorio’s waist. Pulling </p><p>himself up by the channels, he climbed to </p><p>the gunwale and stood there, slashing away </p><p>the tattered waist-cloths, till he could look </p><p>down upon the deck. </p><p> Before him stood a Spaniard: a sallow,</p><p>effeminate-looking man with cunning, shifty </p><p>eyes and livid face, whose splendid Milanese </p><p>breastplate, cuishes, and morion showed </p><p>no mark of battle. Don Feliz de Arruego, </p><p>i78 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>the successful speculator in billetes, had </p><p>been equally successful in keeping himself </p><p>out of harm’s way till now, just after Diego </p><p>had caught him skulking, and ordered him </p><p>to the rail. And fear of his captain kept </p><p>him there, though nothing could make him </p><p>fight like a man. </p><p> But now up rose before him, framed in</p><p>blood-stained canvas, the fearsome figure </p><p>of a Japanese warrior, whose loose-fitting </p><p>armor made his crouching body seem mon- </p><p>strously misshapen; beneath the crested </p><p>helmet, his face was twisted into a hideous </p><p>war-mask, from which his eyes, black and </p><p>gleaming, shot terror into Arruego’s craven </p><p>soul. Forgetting that he held a sword in </p><p>his own hand, the poor wretch did the </p><p>most dangerous thing possible; he turned </p><p>his back and fled. </p><p> Like a wildcat, Kurushima sprang after</p><p>him from the top of the five-foot bulwark; </p><p>and as he sprang, he raised his two-handed </p><p>sword on high and brought it down with </p><p>all his weight and strength on the other’s </p><p>helmeted head. Through steel and scalp </p><p>and skull the keen-edged blade shore its </p><p>way, till the cloven morion' fell to the deck </p><p>in two pieces. Tottering with hands out- </p><p>flung, Feliz fell dead over the fragments of </p><p>his own morion. </p><p> Wrenching his sword free, the Daimio</p><p>turned to face a seaman who thrust at him </p><p>with a pike. With three strokes of in- </p><p>credible swiftness, Kurushima parried the </p><p>thrust, cut the pike-head from its staff, and </p><p>sent the seaman’s own head rolling after </p><p>it into the scuppers. This was too much— </p><p>the other Spaniards bunched near shrank </p><p>back before him and away from the rail, </p><p>over which more Japanese, encouraged by </p><p>their lord’s example, were clambering in </p><p>growing numbers. </p><p> “Oh, men of Tosa!” shouted Kurushima.</p><p>“The ship is ours!” </p><p> “Hold them five minutes!” rang an</p><p>answering voice in Spanish. “Hold them </p><p>off five minutes, and we are free!” </p><p> And rallying his weary crew, Diego de</p><p>Torres leaped forward and crossed swords</p><p>with Kurushima. Arch-types of the East- </p><p>ern and Western warriors of their day, the </p><p>two engaged in single combat, unhindered </p><p>by the general melee raging ’round them. </p><p>No other Spaniard wished to meddle with </p><p>the terrible Daimio; and no Japanese </p><p>warrior would have presumed to interfere </p><p>in a battle-field duel between two chiefs. </p><p> Diego, fighting for time, stood on the</p><p>defense; but Kurushima attacked with </p><p>desperate speed and fury. He did not </p><p>know what new and terrible means of </p><p>resistance the galleon’s crew might use at </p><p>any moment, and he could see his own men </p><p>look anxiously up at the silent swivels, </p><p>even as they fought. And ever in Kuru- </p><p>shima’s mind was a vision of the San </p><p>Gregorio, under his own command, sinking </p><p>the tortoise-boat and freeing the way for </p><p>Japan’s armies to march on to endless </p><p>conquests. The thought that on the out- </p><p>come of this combat hung the fate of Asia </p><p>nerved his every blow. </p><p> In all Japan, few swordsmen were Kuru-</p><p>shima’s equal. His strokes sheared through </p><p>the stoutest mail, his feints were dazzling, </p><p>his sureness of eye and hand proverbial. </p><p>With all his tremendous strength and skill, </p><p>he cut and slashed, leaping back and forth </p><p>to confuse his opponent. Now he struck </p><p>for Diego’s head, now for his right shoulder, </p><p>now for his left thigh, turning his blade in </p><p>mid-stroke, till it seemed to fill the air </p><p>about him with a shimmering mist. </p><p> But wherever it fell, the Japanese sword</p><p>beat and glanced off the parrying blade of </p><p>the Spanish rapier. Never was the contact </p><p>at such an angle that the edge of the heavy </p><p>two-handed weapon could bite into and cut </p><p>through the slender ribbon of steel which </p><p>always met and turned it. The European’s </p><p>supple wrist-play gave him a freedom and </p><p>length of reach unknown to the Samurai, </p><p>who held his long hilt rigidly with both </p><p>hands. And ever as Diego parried, he </p><p>studied the strength and weakness of Kuru- </p><p>shima’s strange, silk-braided mail, designed </p><p>to turn the edge—but not the point. </p><p> Suddenly, as Kurushima heaved up his</p><p>sword for a mighty blow, a cold, tingling </p><p>pang shot through his exposed breast. His </p><p>stroke stayed in mid-air, he glanced down, </p><p>and saw Diego’s silver hilt pressed firmly </p><p>against his breast-bone, the Spaniard’s</p><p>arm outstretched behind it. With a sharp </p><p>pull, Diego withdrew his rapier. A foun- </p><p>tain of blood spurted after it; the long blade </p><p>itself was bloody to the point. Kurushima </p><p>strove to bring down his own sword, but </p><p>instead, he heaved a long sigh and slid in a </p><p>crumpled heap to the deck. </p><p> At that very moment, two mighty</p><p>columns of water, crested with shattered </p><p>bits of wood, cordage and human fragments, </p><p>spouted high into the air from under the </p><p>An Alaskan to Wild Geese </p><p>179 </p><p>galleon’s bows. The roar of a double </p><p>explosion followed instantly. In obedience </p><p>to the captain’s orders, the old master- </p><p>gunner and his mates had dropped the last </p><p>two barrels of powder, fitted with burning </p><p>fuses, over the bows to blow away the </p><p>tangled mass of wreckage and hawsers </p><p>that held the ship a prisoner. By one of </p><p>those rare miracles that sometimes crown </p><p>supreme daring, the explosion had done its </p><p>intended work without damaging the gal- </p><p>leon. </p><p> The San Gregorio, her bows heaved high</p><p>in the air by the force of the concussion, </p><p>shivered, and brought them down with a </p><p>force that snapped the last strands which </p><p>bound her. Urged by wind and tide, the </p><p>galleon surged ahead, out of the mouth of </p><p>the channel and into the open sea. </p><p> Terrified by this fearful phenomenon,</p><p>and by the fall of their invincible Daimio, </p><p>most of the surviving Japanese turned and </p><p>threw themselves overside. The rest cast </p><p>down their weapons and begged for mercy, </p><p>which was readily granted, for the San </p><p>Gregorio was now too desperately short- </p><p>handed to continue the light. </p><p> “Te Deum Laiidamus!” sang the priests</p><p>and friars in the chapel. </p><p> Diego, kneeling on the crimsoned deck,</p><p>felt two soft arms steal ’round his neck, </p><p>felt a kiss upon his cheek. </p><p> “I saw it all,” whispered Ysabel. “Brave</p><p>man! That other is dead, too; nothing can </p><p>keep us apart any more.” </p><p> “Nothing,” Diego answered; then he</p><p>loosed the clinging arms. </p><p> He had no thought of prayer, of thanks-</p><p>giving for victory; no thought of his ship </p><p>that he had saved; little even of the riches </p><p>and the love he had won with the Lady </p><p>Ysabel. His thoughts were all for his </p><p>gallant foe. </p><p> “He is dying,” he whispered to the girl,</p><p>and turned once more to the prostrate </p><p>Japanese, striving desperately to stanch</p><p>the wound which he had himself inflicted. </p><p> At the touch of Diego’s hand, Kuru-</p><p>shima’s body stiffened, his eyes opened, his </p><p>right arm instinctively raised itself and the </p><p>sword to which his fingers still clung. His </p><p>undaunted will forced the dying hand to lift </p><p>it an inch, two inches, from the deck. </p><p> Then, as his eyes met and recognized</p><p>Diego’s, the battle-light died out of the </p><p>Daimio’s face, and a smile of friendship </p><p>shone faintly in its stead. The tired right </p><p>hand relaxed its grip on the hilt. The </p><p>sword fell clanging on the deck; the soul </p><p>of the Samurai had passed. </p><p>AN ALASKAN TO WILD GEESE </p><p> by ED. L.

If the period in which the tale is </p><p>laid is as interesting and little known to you </p><p>as it was to me, you will find the following </p><p>facts good reading. These two men have </p><p>given us stories laid in many places and in </p><p>many periods of the past. Most of our </p><p>stories “get by” uncriticized as to their </p><p>facts and color, but it is one thing to have </p><p>these correct in a story of modern times, and </p><p>quite another thing to have them correct </p><p>even as to details in tales laid anywhere </p><p>from half a century to several thousand </p><p>years ago. There are fewer who are </p><p>equipped to criticize, but these few are </p><p>zealous and exacting. </p><p>Berkeley, California. </p><p> Irondads, breech-loading artillery and Japanese</p><p>spies in Manila may seem a bit anachronistic in a </p><p>story of the sixteenth century, but all three of those </p><p>things were contemporaries of William Shakespeare </p><p>and Henry of Navarre. The Korean “tortoise- </p><p>boat” and the Dutch armored galleon are described </p><p>exactly as set down in history, both as to appear- </p><p>ance and actions. There is an excellent picture and </p><p>description of the early breech-loadrng swivel on </p><p>page 192, Vol. 20, of the Encyclopedia Britannica, </p><p>in the article on “Ordnance.” And Manila was </p><p>never worse plagued with Japanese spies and the </p><p>fear of Nippon than it was in the last decade of the </p><p>sixteenth century. </p><p>JAPAN had not yet become the “Hermit King- </p><p>dom;” on the contrary, it was sending forth its </p><p>adventurers to every comer of the Far East and even </p><p>across the Pacific. The conquest of Korea was but </p><p>the first step in the ambitious plans of the great </p><p>Hideyoshi, when the tortoise-boat taught Japan a </p><p>lesson in sea-power which it remembered in 1894 </p><p>and 1904-1905. If the Portuguese had been willing </p><p>to sell Hideyoshi those two war-galleons he had </p><p>tried to buy from them, a few years earlier, there is </p><p>no telling what the history of the Far East would </p><p>have been. </p><p> Our having Hideyoshi try to capture a Manila-</p><p>Acapulco galleon is fiction. But in 1596 the gal- </p><p>leon San Felipe was wrecked and plundered in the </p><p>Japanese port of Hurado, and six years later the </p><p>Espiritu Santo was attacked there and fought her </p><p>way out through a Japanese flotilla. Her captain, </p><p>Lope de Ulloa, was a splendid sea-fighter—the </p><p>Diego de Torres of our story. “Of persons of his </p><p>quality and talent,” wrote the Conde de Monterey, </p><p>Viceroy of Mexico, to the King of Spain, “there is </p><p>a great lack in the Southern Sea.” </p><p>JTURUSHIMA is as genuine a Japanese figure </p><p>as the everlasting sneaky spy who is always </p><p>being caught with the plans of Corregidor up his </p><p>sleeve. Personally, I should like to see less of the </p><p>latter in our magazines and newspapers, now that </p><p>we and the Japanese are fighting the same foe.

Nichols, with his first story in our </p><p>magazine, stands up and introduces himself: </p><p> There arc many kinds of adventure, but of them</p><p>all Life is the greatest, the most fascinating, grim, </p><p>uncertain. </p><p>TOOKING back over my own life, I am startled </p><p>by the planlessness, aimlessness, changefulness </p><p>of it; it appears to be a series of haphazard events, </p><p>that only by a magic trick of fate has been re- </p><p>deemed, woven into a harmonious whole. It has </p><p>been adventurous, more so perhaps than the ma- </p><p>jority of lives. Adventure was bred in me. Born </p><p>by one of the prettiest of Norwegian fjords, where </p><p>every knoll was a monument to some ancient hero, </p><p>where every name was an echo of battle-blasts and </p><p>songs of swords, I received as a legitimate heritage </p><p>the roving spirit of the Vikings. </p><p> The intensest recollections of my childhood are</p><p>memories of adventure and dreams of adventure. </p><p>Clearly I recall the long Winter evenings on the </p><p>farm when I sat on father’s knee listening to tales of </p><p>his adventures on sea and land in many countries </p><p>and climes. They were exciting, breathless ad- </p><p>ventures, possible only under the more primitive con- </p><p>ditions of half a century ago. Each tale was a tonic </p><p>to my imagination, stimulated my mind to fantastic </p><p>activities. At night, before going to sleep, I in- </p><p>vented the most gorgeous careers for myself. I was </p><p>not many inches tall when I had irrevocably de- </p><p>cided to leave home “when I grew big.” </p><p>TATER when I was old enough to consider it </p><p>childish and effeminate to sit on my father’s </p><p>knee, other factors nursed my imagination and </p><p>adventurous spirit. There were, for instance, the </p><p>docks of the nearby seaport with their ceaseless</p><p>activities, and the men-of-war, English, German </p><p>and French, that each Summer dropped anchor, </p><p>with much booming of guns, in the roadstead. </p><p>Nothing could be more entrancing to a boy than </p><p>these martial vessels, or the crews with their gay </p><p>irresponsible ways and incomprehensible, strangely </p><p>musical speech. Often of a Sunday morning my </p><p>two brothers and I trudged the eight miles to town </p><p>to marvel at them. At times the sailors would </p><p>take us aboard in their steam-launches, and we </p><p>explored the ships from keel to bridge. An en- </p><p>chanted fairyland they were, with their gleaming </p><p>torpedoes, intricate quick-firers, immense turrets, </p><p>and great sleek guns that seemed alive, seemed to </p><p>long for something to destroy. </p><p>HPHEN there was school, of course, first public </p><p>school, located about three miles from my </p><p>home, and later high school in the city. The latter </p><p>was a private afternoon school and caused me much </p><p>inconvenience. As I continued to live at home, I </p><p>had to go by railroad in to town every day at noon; </p><p>and at night, because of a conflict between the </p><p>schedule and my classes, I was obliged to wait until </p><p>eleven o’clock for a train, arriving at my station half </p><p>an hour later; and then after walking three miles </p><p>along lonely roads, I could finally sit down to my </p><p>supper and go to bed. </p><p>T WAS not yet seventeen years old when I left </p><p>_ home one February evening. I remember </p><p>vividly the train-ride, the dark desolate docks, and </p><p>the shadowy background of the city asleep on the </p><p>hillside, with a starless clouded sky overhead. </p><p>Then followed a two-day journey down the coast </p><p>inside a chain of bleak rocky islands forming a ram- </p><p>part against the ocean; then a trip across the North </p><p>Sea in the steerage in a storm; a page of Dante’s </p><p>“Inferno.” Then England, wonderfully interesting, </p><p>and eleven days on the ocean; then America, and a </p><p>train-ride into the heart of the country. </p><p>RUT this sketch of my life is becoming too long. </p><p> Some day, perhaps, I shall write a fuller ac-</p><p>count, but here I can only hint at the happenings of </p><p>the years that followed. I was a boy alone in a </p><p>strange country, with only a smattering of the </p><p>language, a hounding sense of my own uselessness, </p><p>unimportance, and thousands of miles from home. </p><p>There were years of restlessness, of grim adventure, </p><p>doing odd work in odd places, searching for a posi- </p><p>tion in the order of things. Half of the States in the </p><p>Union are associated with memories in my mind; </p><p>whenever I hear mentioned Nicaragua, Guatemala, </p><p>Costa Rica, Panama, recollections arc brought up; </p><p>talk of the sea and sailing and I can relate personal </p><p>experiences.</p><p> But throughout these first aimless years one pur-</p><p>pose was my constant companion, to master the </p><p>English language. It seemed a hopeless task but </p><p>was too fascinating to be let alone. It was an </p><p>adventure in itself the hunting through books for </p><p>new words, jotting them down, and getting their </p><p>meaning whenever a dictionary was within reach. </p><p> In spite of their harshness, however, those years</p><p>were kind. I became acquainted with life, gained a </p><p>greater knowledge of myself; and out of the chaos </p><p>of my mind grew definite aims which in later less </p><p>outwardly exciting years I have tried to realize. I </p><p>have had a few hard lessons, and I hope I have </p><p>profited by them. Life owes me nothing. Out- </p><p>weighing all disappointments, failures, is the gift, </p><p>the grant of a tomorrow. </p><p>DEFORE I close this confidential but necessarily </p><p>rambling talk with you, the readers of the </p><p>“Camp-Fire,” I wish to mention my work. I am </p><p>new in the fiction field; but in the future I hope to </p><p>devote all my time and energy to it. I do not in- </p><p>tend to write stories because the work is easy. It </p><p>isn’t. I wish to write because I wish to justify my </p><p>existence, to give something of myself to the world, </p><p>to you. And I want to please you if I can; I want </p><p>you to like me; you are necessary to me. And you, </p><p>may be assured I shall never try to impose upon' </p><p>you. Whenever you see my name at the head of a, </p><p>story, I want you to say, “This story may not be </p><p>182 </p><p>Adventure </p><p>great, but it represents the best effort of a man </p><p>who has had his tussle with life, just as I have, and </p><p>therefore there must be something worth while in it.” </p><p>AS FOR the story of mine appearing in this num- </p><p>ber I have little to say. It must speak for </p><p>itself. Doubtless it has many faults, but it was the </p><p>best I could do at the time. I trust I shall do better </p><p>in the future; I trust I shall always do better in the </p><p>future. Accept this first story, then, not as a fin- </p><p>ished, solitary product, but as a promise of a </p><p>beginning.—T. Nichols. </p><p>T'XECEMBER thirteenth I received a </p><p>' letter from our comrade and member </p><p>of our writers’ brigade. Major W. Robert </p><p>Foran, written in India September thir- </p><p>teenth, in reply to a letter written by me </p><p>June thirteenth—the three being written </p><p>three months apart to the day and all on </p><p>the thirteenth. Glad I’m not super- </p><p>stitious, and the hoodoo seems not to have </p><p>settled on him either, for he reports himself </p><p>fit with nothing to kick about except heat. </p><p>Here’s more good luck to him. </p><p>EARLY in the Winter came a letter </p><p>from “Canuck.” which I’ve been </p><p>unable to give until now, but which is as </p><p>interesting and to the point now as it was </p><p>then: </p><p>Ottawa, Can. </p><p> Am back again after four months in the north.</p><p>I’ve had a wonderful time in the last north of </p><p>northwestern Quebec, seen some grand game areas, </p><p>directed probably the finest film of live game </p><p>(moose) in action, etc., yet obtained, am tanned </p><p>like one of my Indians and feeling tuned to a </p><p>Winter’s hibernation. </p><p>T HAVE followed with considerable interest your </p><p>Camp-Fire talks on what all Americans owe </p><p>the United States, and can only say I’m with you </p><p>in all you’ve expressed—just as you’ve said it. </p><p>The snake of treason—an ugly word but the only </p><p>one that fits, unfortunately—must be scotched and </p><p>done with absolutely no compunction; call them </p><p>what you will—pro-Germans or anything else— </p><p>they’re all anti-Americans and their sub-rosa activi- </p><p>ties, to be squelched, must have radical application </p><p>of the National knife. </p><p> The British, including the Canadian, have always</p><p>been prone to allowing too much rope to treasonable </p><p>citizens, and others calling themselves such, of this </p><p>country and of the British Isles. Just in the same </p><p>way is the ordinary American, as I know him, </p><p>similarly unbelieving in his stand that “it’s nothing </p><p>but smoke.” As I know the foreign element, </p><p>whether the ignorant immigrant or the educated </p><p>resident, while you can understand an out-and- </p><p>outer, it is strange but true that many who should </p><p>know better, who are actual citizens of the United </p><p>States, having sworn allegiance to it, renouncing </p><p>their former allegiance to any and all other States </p><p>or republics, are the ones who at present have </p><p>been and still are getting away with un-American </p><p>actions. </p><p>AS I see it, applicable to Canada and to the </p><p>United States, to Great Britain, to France, </p><p>Italy or any of the other nations fighting in this </p><p>war of democracy against the right of might, every </p><p>one is either heart and soul for his own country </p><p>and its allies or else he is an enemy. If the latter, </p><p>why, in the name of common sense is he not </p><p>promptly taken directly into the State’s hands </p><p>and treated as an enemy must be? </p><p> Cutting out newspapers and publications in</p><p>any language other than the national one is a </p><p>primary essential. Over here in Canada the </p><p>danger of permitting any other is seen in French </p><p>Quebec, where rabid anti-British, anti-French, </p><p>anti-Canadian, anti-conscription, all are prevalent </p><p>and all are fed and inflamed by the “Nationalist” </p><p>French press. We have over here much anti-Ally </p><p>underground work that will never be successfully </p><p>disposed of with gloves.—S. E. Sangster. </p><p>TT IS seldom that one of our woman </p><p>members joins our writers’ brigade, </p><p>but Lotta Adele Gannett, with a story in </p><p>this issue, does so and in accordance with </p><p>Camp-Fire custom rises and introduces </p><p>herself. I know she will be warmly wel- </p><p>comed. </p><p> I never quite get used to the fact that so</p><p>many women read Adventure. Yet it is </p><p>not strange, after all. A woman does not </p><p>necessarily prefer soft love-stories forever </p><p>and forever. We all know plenty of women </p><p>whose chief interests do not lie in that direc- </p><p>tion and it is natural that they, too, should </p><p>like to turn to stories dealing more largely </p><p>with other emotions than those of sex. </p><p> Also there are plenty of women who,</p><p>though they like clean love-stories, do not </p><p>care for the kind whose interest is depen-</p><p>dent chiefly upon the physical aspects of sex. </p><p>We keep our magazine as clean and whole- </p><p>some as we can. We want the kind of </p><p>reader who likes to look upon the world as it </p><p>is but prefers not to look at it through sex </p><p>spectacles that tinge everything in the </p><p>world with one color, the kind of reader who </p><p>cares most for the big, clean, fresh-air </p><p>things of life. A magazine generally gets </p><p>the kind of reader it aims for and, of course, </p><p>there is nothing strange in there being many </p><p>women who like exactly what our type of </p><p>man likes. The women members of our </p><p>Camp-Fire can be sure that they get from </p><p>their men comrades exactly the kind of wel- </p><p>come they want from us, a frank, clean, </p><p>“man to man” fellowship. </p><p>Chicago, 111. </p><p> There is so little I’ve done that I’m afraid it</p><p>will not be at all interesting. I was bom of poor </p><p>but respectful parents in the little old State of </p><p>New Jersey—one of a large family who saw to it </p><p>that I did not develop much conceit. I was bora </p><p>The Camp-Fire	183</p><p>in June, married in June and my boy was bom in </p><p>June, the last-named event taking place while I was </p><p>still well within my teens, the second, after I’d </p><p>entered my teens by a very few years indeed. I </p><p>don’t know why I married so young unless some one </p><p>whispered in my ear that men were getting scarce. </p><p>So that now I have a boy who says he is big enough </p><p>to eat pie off my head. </p><p>T TOOK a business course after my marriage </p><p>when reverses came and finished the course in </p><p>three months and three weeks. Have two records </p><p>on the typewriter—nobody gave them to me, I </p><p>took them myself. One is erratic touch and the </p><p>other is the discovery of the greatest number of </p><p>new ways to make mistakes every day. 1 might </p><p>possibly do better work on the machine if I could </p><p>bring myself down to less of a hurry in doing </p><p>things. But—there is so much to do and be seen in </p><p>this little old world and I’ve barely touched the edges. </p><p>T’VIi been from ocean to ocean, dipped in one and </p><p>rode on the other. Love Colorado and am </p><p>going to camp out in its mountains before I’m many </p><p>years older. I started to write five years ago—did </p><p>three stories the first year, three or four the next </p><p>and about the same the next, for two years I’ve been </p><p>working at it fairly regularly for me. </p><p> I came to Chicago seven years ago, weighing</p><p>one-hundred and thirty-three pounds—and look at </p><p>me now, dam it! I’m American to the backbone </p><p>and beyond. Dad served three years in the Civil </p><p>War, entering when he was sixteen, and two mater- </p><p>nal uncles served, one being killed in battle, so I’m </p><p>not a bit neutral now—nor was I before we entered </p><p>this war, and my greatest hope is that it doesn’t </p><p>end till the Kaiser is licked. </p><p> I think I shall remain at thirty-five years old—</p><p>permanently, and 1 love to laugh. </p><p>AS I told you, the incident on the Atlantic </p><p>City pier in my story “When Jim Came Into </p><p>His Own” was taken from an actual occurrence. </p><p>The man who did it is six feet four and weighs two </p><p>hundred and forty pounds, and when the little event </p><p>was finished the only thing to show that he’d been at </p><p>all deeply interested, was that his cigar lay at his </p><p>feet, bitten in two. He nearly converted me to </p><p>spiritualism—or something—for he is the only per- </p><p>son I ever knew who could materialize out of thin </p><p>air. I’ll take a vow that I’ve been on the street </p><p>and no one in sight for two blocks in four directions </p><p>and in an instant he has stood beside me, looking </p><p>about like Billy Penn on the Philadelphia City Hall. </p><p> Here’s hoping to our acquaintance being freely</p><p>and long continued—Lotta Adele Gannett, </p><p>WORD from our comrade, Harry C. </p><p>Winters, now convalescent, from hos- </p><p>pital from England. Tommy need not </p><p>worry. Our boys will, like the Canadians, </p><p>come across with the deeds he’s asking for. </p><p>Hold up your end, Tommy, and our boys </p><p>will hold up theirs. You’ve too many </p><p>deeds behind you to let yourself get worried </p><p>by other people’s words. And I hope </p><p>Comrade Winters, Australian, knows that </p><p>one of America’s—and Canada’s—national </p><p>games is kidding, and that when you play </p><p>that game you don’t let it worry you. </p><p>Also, comrade, don’t forget that the Aus- </p><p>tralians rank as high as talkers as they do </p><p>as blamed good fighters. Nevertheless </p><p>your advice is sound and doubtless needed. </p><p>Stick together? Of course. Live clean? </p><p>You bet it’s necessary. </p><p>Alnwick, England. </p><p> Evidently my last two letters miscarried, prob-</p><p>ably strafed by U-boats. Left hospital and am </p><p>now in the running again, expecting to go back </p><p>to the front shortly. I’m glad Uncle Sam has </p><p>taken a hand. It should expedite matters. The </p><p>first contingent got a very warm welcome; the </p><p>people rose to the occasion. Seem men of fine </p><p>physique; .if they are as good as they look, should </p><p>give a good account of themselves. </p><p>(~)NE thing I'd warn the boys of is this: Don’t </p><p>blow the horn too loud. Tommy is rather a </p><p>queer chap and doesn’t like to be told by new </p><p>arrivals that they have come to finish the war. </p><p>Of course it’s only the - fool youngsters that </p><p>do so. What Tommy wants is deeds, not words. </p><p>Let the men prove worthy by their actions and </p><p>he’ll find in Thomas a friend to tie to, who won’t </p><p>let him down. </p><p> The boys have a high standard to live up to.</p><p>Personally, from my knowledge of the American, </p><p>I know he can and will live up to it, but these few </p><p>words of advice, from one who has had three years </p><p>of it, may not come amiss. If we are to win the </p><p>campaign, it behooves us to stick together, live </p><p>clean. You know what I mean by that. And, </p><p>above all, don’t talk too much, act. </p><p>QLD Fritz is a hard man to beat and has [put</p><p>up a dashing fight and he’s not beat yet. </p><p>Please God, before next Spring we’ll have him where </p><p>we want him. These peace cranks want discour- </p><p>aging, when we have peace we want one on a solid </p><p>and lasting basis and Fritz will not have the dic- </p><p>tating of the terms. Best respects to the boys and </p><p>tell them that, though perhaps unable to answer, </p><p>would certainly enjoy a line from some of them. </p><p>Incidentally, also a little Durham or some sweet </p><p>chewing plug would come in handy.—Pvte. Harry </p><p>C. Winters, 48541, N. F. S., Command Depot, </p><p>Alnwick, Northumberland, England. </p><p>*	I 'HOSE of you on the front, land or sea,</p><p>ought to know how much the rest of </p><p>us are interested in your letters. Drop us </p><p>a line. We know the censor limits you </p><p>but there is plenty left to say and we surely </p><p>want to hear from you. Write to the Camp- </p><p>Fire and reach lots of friends at once. </p><p>T&gt; Y THE time this reaches you the third </p><p>-L* Liberty Loan will probably be calling </p><p>you. Answer the call. Buy bonds. </p><p> I say this to you not as blind, unreasoning</p><p>patriots but as thinking men, and I practise </p><p>what I preach. </p><p>Adventure </p><p> Every minute of the war America needs</p><p>our support. When the Administration </p><p>makes mistakes America needs our support </p><p>all the more. If the Administration asks </p><p>less of some other citizens than it does of us, </p><p>that does not free us from our obligation in </p><p>full. We set up this Administration to </p><p>lead and command us; it stands now for </p><p>our country. We may not like it or ap- </p><p>prove it, but we owe it our loyalty and </p><p>support. </p><p>LOYALTY to America divides sharply </p><p>J into two duties. Our first duty, at </p><p>any minute, is loyal support of whatever </p><p>Administration is at that minute in power, </p><p>unquestioning obedience to whatever laws </p><p>are at that minute in force. Our second </p><p>duty to America is to see to it that what- </p><p>ever Administration we have chosen for </p><p>her does its duty as fully as we should do </p><p>ours, sees and corrects its mistakes when </p><p>possible, sees and removes its incompetents </p><p>always. These two things constitute pa- </p><p>triotism, loyalty to America, to the people. </p><p>But the second duty must wait upon the </p><p>first; we have no right to point out the </p><p>mistakes of the Administration if we </p><p>ourselves have made the mistake of fail- </p><p>ing to support that Administration as it </p><p>stands. </p><p> America needs money now. Buy Liberty</p><p>Bonds. Don’t just complain in advance </p><p>about how the Administration is going to </p><p>use that money. You have no right to </p><p>any voice in that until you have done your </p><p>part and furnished some of that money. </p><p>Your duty now is to buy Bonds. </p><p>WE KNOW that much of our money </p><p>must go to remedy the results of </p><p>the Administration’s stubborn or stupid </p><p>refusal to prepare in advance for the war, </p><p>that trying to do in months what should </p><p>have been done in years means the loss of </p><p>much extra money, time and effort without </p><p>any extra returns. But that colossal blun- </p><p>der of the Administration’s can not now </p><p>be undone. We must not make a blunder </p><p>ourselves by not doing the best we can now. </p><p>Buy Bonds. After that, see to it that as </p><p>many as possible of the Administration </p><p>who were responsible for the tragic blunder </p><p>of Unpreparedness are forced from office </p><p>or at least never again entrusted with public</p><p>office in America. But while they are in </p><p>office, support them. Buy Bonds. </p><p>THROUGH the investigation by Con- </p><p>gress we begin to know who are the </p><p>incompetents responsible for national mis- </p><p>takes and delays. Our duty is to insist </p><p>that power be taken from the hands of </p><p>incompetents. We know, for example, </p><p>if the head of the Ordnance Bureau is </p><p>incompetent, that not only should he be </p><p>removed, but that his incompetency argues </p><p>the incompetency of Secretary Baker who </p><p>retained him, either knowing his incom- </p><p>petency or else so ignorant of the condition </p><p>of one of the most important bureaus of his </p><p>department that he did not know of the </p><p>incompetency of its chief, his direct sub- </p><p>ordinate for whom he is responsible. Sec- </p><p>retary Baker’s incompetency seems suf- </p><p>ficiently established in other ways. A </p><p>pacifist Secretary of War who for three </p><p>years refused to prepare at all because “the </p><p>war was three thousand miles away” is bad </p><p>enough, but a Secretary of War who, after </p><p>nearly a year of American participation, is </p><p>still three thousand miles away from the </p><p>war and three million miles away from any </p><p>real comprehension of its needs is too lim- </p><p>ited mentally for the country’s fate to rest </p><p>so largely in his small hand. If you are </p><p>convinced of the incompetency of officials, </p><p>it is your duty to call for their removal. But </p><p>that is only your second duty to America. </p><p>Your first duty is to do your own part well </p><p>and fully. Buy Bonds. </p><p>WE KNOW that Congress and the </p><p>Administration have not equally dis- </p><p>tributed the financial burden of the war. </p><p>There are those who believe there should be </p><p>no excess profits from war or other industries </p><p>when most of us are losing by the war, not </p><p>profiting from it. In the present upheaval </p><p>of economic conditions, with practical ac- </p><p>complishment dependent so largely upon </p><p>individual effort and stimulus, an eighty per </p><p>cent, tax, as in England, would seem wiser </p><p>and productive of quicker, better and big- </p><p>ger results. But not less than eighty per </p><p>cent. Most of us believe that the hundreds </p><p>of millions of such profits already made </p><p>should be the first money spent for Liberty </p><p>Bonds, since what earned them is so large </p><p>a part of what the war is waged to pro- </p><p>tect. It is our second duty to America </p><p>to force Congress and the Administration </p><p>to distribute the cost of the war more fairly</p><p>and justly. But it is our first duty to </p><p>support the distribution as it stands. </p><p>The Camp-Fire </p><p>185 </p><p> We know that politics and party have</p><p>sometimes been put before patriotism and </p><p>country. Our crisis calls for a leadership </p><p>drawn from the whole people, not chiefly </p><p>from one political party; from the brains </p><p>and energies of the whole country, not half </p><p>of it. It is our second duty to demand a </p><p>coalition Government, but first we must </p><p>guarantee our own full energies and support. </p><p>Buy Bonds. </p><p>WE KNOW that, after two years and a </p><p>half of warning followed by nearly </p><p>a year actually in the war, great America, </p><p>the richest country in the world, with a </p><p>population of a hundred millions, is now </p><p>contributing to the war much money and </p><p>moral support, some brains, a navy smaller </p><p>than it should be, and, at this writing in Jan- </p><p>uary, an army almost the size of England’s </p><p>casualty lists for six or nine months. We </p><p>know that great America is not able to meet </p><p>the vital demand of the crisis for merchant </p><p>ships—which even a neutral and pacifist </p><p>country is free to build—and that at the end </p><p>of a whole year our contribution of ships is </p><p>still chiefly plans and provision for the future. </p><p>We know that great America was so un- </p><p>prepared and so incompetent in the actual </p><p>test that she is not even yet able to equip </p><p>the comparatively small army she has put </p><p>into the field and has had to borrow from </p><p>her Allies what they needed for themselves. </p><p>We know now that William Jennings Bryan </p><p>by his glib and silver-tongued prediction </p><p>that “a million men would spring to arms </p><p>between sunrise and sunset” has written </p><p>himself down as the ass of history. We </p><p>begin to feel now the whole long, bitter, </p><p>tragic proof of the blunder of Unprepared- </p><p>ness. It is our duty to see to it that, so </p><p>long as other nations carry arms, the </p><p>advocates of unpreparedness do not again </p><p>bring us to the brink of catastrophe. But </p><p>we must think of past unpreparedness now </p><p>only as a warning for the future. The </p><p>damage will be repaired, so far as it can be </p><p>repaired, not by complaint but by work, </p><p>loyalty, support. Buy Bonds. </p><p>T&gt; EFORE our troops go into their first big </p><p>battle they have begun to pay the toll </p><p>of eleventh-hour preparation following </p><p>three years of unpreparedness. But they </p><p>who have died for unpreparedness are</p><p>for a later reckoning. They have no] bear- </p><p>ing on our present duty to America. Our </p><p>present duty continues to be one thing—to </p><p>do our part now. </p><p> Buy Bonds. Buy all you can afford,</p><p>and afford all you can by cutting out things </p><p>you do not need. Buy Bonds. But do </p><p>not stop there. By this time each of us </p><p>knows what is asked of him, the ways in </p><p>which he can help win the war. You know </p><p>your duty, do it. In all things. And the </p><p>foremost of these things is support and </p><p>loyalty to our Administration, good or bad, </p><p>so long as it remains our Administration, </p><p>and to each man in it so long as he remains </p><p>a part of it. For the Administration stands </p><p>for America. </p><p>I KNOW that in speaking thus frankly </p><p>I shall bring down upon myself from a </p><p>certain type of American the charge of </p><p>being unpatriotic. Another of the Admin- </p><p>istration’s mistakes has been the building </p><p>up of the idea that any criticism of itself </p><p>is disloyalty. Purely destructive criticism </p><p>of it is disloyalty, at least in its effect, but </p><p>neither honest constructive criticism nor </p><p>a frank facing of the facts is unpatriotic </p><p>in the eyes of any one but fools. </p><p> Any man or institution that denies the</p><p>right of constructive criticism is un-Ameri- </p><p>can and undemocratic. Only a fool or a </p><p>traitor withholds one jot of his loyalty </p><p>because of mistakes that can not be reme- </p><p>died, but only an utter idiot or a more subtle </p><p>and dangerous traitor calls it “patriotism” </p><p>to allow a present mistake to go uncorrected </p><p>or fails to take steps against future mistakes. </p><p> We are at war, and war is facts. A war</p><p>has never yet been won with mistakes. </p><p>Or by incompetents. Or with excuses. If </p><p>we are to win this war we can not listen to </p><p>excuses, we can not leave mistakes unreme- </p><p>died, we can not retain incompetents. </p><p>IT IS truth and frankness we need. </p><p>“Tell the truth and win the war.” We </p><p>want the facts, not the camouflaged facts. </p><p>Whitewash is not war. Claims are not </p><p>accomplishments. Sugar-coating does not </p><p>destroy the bitter pill within. We have </p><p>guts enough for facts, but not stomach </p><p>enough for sweetened infant-food. Let us </p><p>have a man’s diet.</p><p> What disciple of fear and untruth can</p><p>openly maintain that the American people </p><p>will not fight better and make themselves </p><p>better able to fight if they know the full </p><p>need and danger? War makes necessary </p><p>186 </p><p>Adventure’s Free Services and Addresses </p><p>the suppression of information that will </p><p>aid the enemy, if he doesn’t know it already, </p><p>but war also makes necessary the giving </p><p>out of information whose suppression will </p><p>aid the enemy. </p><p>T WILL make no appeal to any man’s </p><p>patriotism if the only kind of patriotism </p><p>I am allowed to invoke is the kind that has </p><p>neither eyes or ears or brains. And if any </p><p>one finds disloyalty in what I have stated, </p><p>I call attention to the fact that it is exactly </p><p>the same kind of disloyalty that, from </p><p>the Summer of 1914 to date, has been </p><p>fighting for national Preparedness while </p><p>certain other very good Americans were </p><p>“too proud to fight” and too pacifically </p><p>asleep to do more than watch waitfully </p><p>behind the barn door until the horse had </p><p>been stolen. </p><p> My platform now is very simple. First,</p><p>let’s all turn to and try to catch the horse. </p><p>Second, let’s see that the barn door isn’t left </p><p>open again. </p><p> In other words, let us do our immediate</p><p>duty immediately. Buy Liberty Bonds. </p><p>After that, let us attend to our next duty— </p><p>see to it that the Liberty Bonds are used </p><p>to America's best advantage. </p><p>Arthur Sullivant Hoffman. </p><p>ADVENTURE’S FREE SERVICES AND ADDRESSES </p><p>These services of Adventure are free, to any one.

I have a chance of getting free passage to </p><p>Sierra Leone and will thank you very much for the </p><p>information.”—Wilbur G. Leekley, Albuquerque, </p><p>New Mex. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Miller:—Your inquiry as to</p><p>climate and employment in West Africa: </p><p> To secure employment write, stating your age,</p><p>schooling and general experience to: </p><p> Niger Company, Surrey House, Victoria Embank-</p><p>ment, London; Lever Brothers, Royal Lever Build- </p><p>ings, Liverpool, England, O. &amp; F. Dept. (Work- </p><p>ing mostly the Congo, also the Niger); The African </p><p>Association, 43 Castle St., Liverpool, England; </p><p>Messrs.

A clean-cut young fellow, </p><p>25 to 30, who can keep simple accounts would not </p><p>have much trouble securing work, especially if he </p><p>turned up at the home office. Whites do not go </p><p>floating around West Africa looking for jobs, but if </p><p>a white did get stranded he would be put to some- </p><p>thing by the local agent. </p><p> The contract usually calls for three years, which</p><p>is about as much as a white can stand of the cli- </p><p>mate in one jolt. The pay is unattractive, but most </p><p>of the companies board their staffs generously, the </p><p>life offers individual freedom, and if a man works out </p><p>well it is usual to grant him a bonus at the end of his </p><p>contract. </p><p> Climate:—The climate of West Africa is notori-</p><p>ous, parts of the coasts being known as the white </p><p>man’s grave. Malaria, canned foods and contribu- </p><p>tory causes, such as isolation—the sudden cutting </p><p>off from newspapers, games, movies, companionship </p><p>and the crowding interests of civilization—and the </p><p>sun, will “get” most whites in time. A few years</p><p>of it, too, unfits one for any home job again. One </p><p>shrinks from one’s fellow creatures, or as Kipling </p><p>says “the jungle has them,” and yet those who have </p><p>been there never shake off the romance of the land </p><p>and the yearning to hear again the tom-toms of the </p><p>“mammy dance,” to live under free skies, close </p><p>down to the primitive, to march at the head of the </p><p>long column of blacks under the low-hung stars— </p><p>the magic and mystery of the land. </p><p> The year is divided into wet and dry seasons.</p><p>For months the bald, cruel sun crawls across steel- </p><p>gray skies and one thinks of a cloud and a breath of </p><p>wind as of Paradise.

He will be signing on for an- </p><p>other three years before his bonus is spent. Whites </p><p>will never colonize in West Africa. It is the land </p><p>of the blacks. The whites will go on exploiting </p><p>them, and the blacks, notwithstanding the fond </p><p>dreams of missionaries and the pet theories of gov- </p><p>ernments, will never climb any height out of their </p><p>ingrained barbarism. </p><p> There are many tribes, many dialects. Some of</p><p>the natives are semi-civilized—notably the Housa, </p><p>who are not negroes proper. The hinterlands are </p><p>fanatically Mohammedan. There are large pagan </p><p>districts where the missionaries of Mohammedanism </p><p>and Christianity compete for converts. </p><p> The U. S. Forestry Service</p><p> Question:—“I am 25 years of age. Would like to</p><p>know something of the Forest Reserve, Ranger </p><p>Service of the Northwest; how an appointment is </p><p>secured, what the requirements are and any other </p><p>useful information.”-, Streator, 111. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Harriman:—The only way to get</p><p>a position with the Forest Service is through taking </p><p>a civil service examination. At the present time </p><p>the service is waiving tests of various kinds, such </p><p>as recognition of various trees by bark or leaf, </p><p>packing a mule, timber cruising and lumber seal- </p><p>ing. This is due to the sending of men to France, </p><p>which has made a shortage of men. The pay runs </p><p>from SI ,100 to SI ,000 a year. </p><p> The usual examination takes in lumber sealing,</p><p>timber cruising, the recognition of all kinds of trees</p><p>by bark, leaf, and general appearance, fire pre- </p><p>vention and fire fighting, certain knowledge of soils </p><p>and of minerals, map making, surveying, riding, </p><p>rifle and revolver shooting, a knowledge of book </p><p>and account keeping, and various minor matters. </p><p> The duties are: watching for fires and fighting</p><p>them, looking after campers to see that they leave </p><p>no fires burning, arresting violators of rules, count- </p><p>ing stock grazed on reserves, settling boundaries for </p><p>grazing, timber cruising, sales of standing timber, </p><p>scaling the cut and collecting pay, killing predatory </p><p>animals, helping game wardens, acting as general </p><p>utility man to the whole reserve; inspecting mining </p><p>claims to pass on their merits and prevent fraudu- </p><p>lent claims being taken up in order to get the tim- </p><p>ber, watching men who fell timber to prevent use- </p><p>less destruction of small trees, building new lookout </p><p>stations in almost inaccessible places, cutting fire- </p><p>breaks through brush, climbing 150 feet high to gath- </p><p>189 </p><p>er pine cones for the seeds; propagating trees forre- </p><p>stocking denuded areas, setting out such new stock, </p><p>packing water to such stock when set, building </p><p>bridges, running telephone wires, etc. </p><p> In addition to the duties named, the ranger is</p><p>always at the beck and call of any settler who is in </p><p>trouble. My nephew, when in the service, had to </p><p>take an insane woman out one time, from 8,000 feet </p><p>above sea level, to a lowland asylum, through forty- </p><p>five miles of the roughest of mountain roads. He </p><p>had help, of course. He and his mate had to carry </p><p>a dead woman seven miles on their backs, over snow </p><p>35 feet deep, taking turns with the burden. He had </p><p>to defend himself with a hastily seized club against </p><p>the attacks of a man armed with an ax, just because </p><p>he refused to let the man cheat the Government </p><p>on a timber deal. He had to fight fire thirty-one </p><p>days in succession, with less than four hours’ sleep </p><p>in every twenty-four. </p><p> He had to arbitrate between angry cattlemen,</p><p>between cattlemen and sheepmen, between settlers </p><p>and campers. He had to ride over 3,000 miles in </p><p>sixty-one days, using two horses. He had to help </p><p>pack all the materials for a lookout hut up Mt. </p><p>Shasta, when it was a matter of crawling a good part </p><p>of the way, clinging to a thousand-foot rope to help </p><p>along, and then helped build the hut where the wind </p><p>blew 40 miles an hour across a glacier. Part of </p><p>the way they dynamited a trail across the glacier </p><p>where the ice lay in ridges ten feet high and from </p><p>one to five feet thick, with spaces between equal to </p><p>ridge. </p><p> These few points will give you a faint idea of the</p><p>job. Most of all, a man must have nerve and initia- </p><p>tive. A soft, easy-going man is worth nothing </p><p>there. He must be self-controlled, alert, able- </p><p>bodied, quick in mind and body, well informed, </p><p>confident. </p><p>Canoeing through the Adirondacks </p><p> Question:—“Two friends and myself are going to</p><p>take a canoe trip through the Adirondacks, stopping </p><p>at Long Lake to camp for a while, then going to the </p><p>St. Lawrence River (near Ft. Covington, N. Y.) and </p><p>home by Lake Champlain, Lake George, and the </p><p>Hudson. </p><p> “Will you kindly tell me the best route to take</p><p>from Albany, also the best and lightest equip- </p><p>ment?”—T. H. Rogers, Yonkers, N. Y. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Spears:—I think perhaps your</p><p>best route to Indian Lake will be up the Hudson to </p><p>Indian River, and thence into the lake, to your </p><p>camping-ground. The way the water has been so </p><p>far this year, you will have ample, but it will be up- </p><p>stream work, of course. </p><p> From Indian Lake I think you would better haul</p><p>across to Raquette River, striking it almost any- </p><p>where from Blue Mt. Lake to Long Lake. I be- </p><p>lieve there are several routes you could take across </p><p>from Indian Lake, involving longer or shorter car- </p><p>ries over the divide. Your route would be through </p><p>some of the wildest of the Adirondacks. </p><p> I would prefer two small canoes to one large one</p><p>—but that is merely choice. It would have advan- </p><p>tage in case of a smash-up, involving three tourists. </p><p>Have yokes for making carries; fit before starting. </p><p> The Conservation Commission, Albany, N. Y.,</p><p>print Adirondack maps which you could obtain, I </p><p>think, through your Assemblyman or State Senator. </p><p>The U. S. Geological Survey prints Topographical </p><p>190	Adventure</p><p>Survey Maps of the Adirondack^ showing contours </p><p>(elevations), and if you write for Adirondack Index </p><p>Sheet and get the sheets covering the route of the </p><p>river, you will have the best maps there are to travel </p><p>by. Paste cheese-cloth on the backs. I cut mine </p><p>on the black rectangular lines, to fold them without </p><p>breaking. </p><p> As to outfit, I enclose a sheet of suggestions.</p><p>Would add that each member could carry a water- </p><p>proof blanket, woolen blanket and hammock, folded </p><p>inside the waterproof. Swing hammocks between </p><p>trees and hang waterproof over hammock, dry bed; </p><p>drip, in rain will follow the lines down into ham- </p><p>mock, unless you warp handkerchief around to </p><p>switch it to the ground. </p><p> Don’t forget fly dope.</p><p>Going to Sea </p><p> Question:—“I am a high-school boy seventeen</p><p>years old and would like to have some information </p><p>about the sea. </p><p> “How can a boy work up to become a ship’s officer,</p><p>and how long does it usually take? What is the </p><p>rate of pay for officers?”-, Superior, Wis. </p><p> Answer, by Captain Dingle:—It matters little</p><p>how you start going to sea in order to become an </p><p>officer, but of course you must enter the Deck </p><p>Department of ships. </p><p> It is not hard in these days for a young man to</p><p>get a job aboard ship; men are badly needed- </p><p>prospective officers are encouraged. Supposing </p><p>first of all that you are healthy, fairly robust, and </p><p>have good eyesight, you can do either of several </p><p>things: enter one of the big lines as a cadet, ship as </p><p>boy in any ship—ocean-going for preference—or </p><p>enter one of the various branches of the Naval </p><p>Reserve Service. All this experience will count. </p><p> You must serve on deck three years usually</p><p>before you are eligible to take the examination for </p><p>second mate. The knowledge in navigation neces- </p><p>sary for this examination must be acquired by your- </p><p>self, either by study aboard the ship in your own </p><p>time, or by attending a school ashore between voy- </p><p>ages. It is by no means difficult. A high-school </p><p>education is more than most sailors have before </p><p>going to sea. Then, when you get the second </p><p>mate’s license, and have served one year in that </p><p>capacity, you can take the first mate’s exam.; and </p><p>with one year’s service as first mate, the master’s </p><p>exam, is open to you.</p><p> You should be at least first mate in four years.</p><p>But in these war days I think a smart man can </p><p>become an officer quicker than the law stipulates. </p><p>Barriers are being lowered in order to secure officers, </p><p> Pay for officers at present is high. Third mates</p><p>are receiving as much as S75 per month. Of course </p><p>they are fed well and gratis; their lodging is in the </p><p>ship, free. Second mates can get up to 8200, and </p><p>mates as much as $300 in the Atlantic Trade. </p><p>Captains are making huge sums, with war bonuses, </p><p>gratuities, etc. But after the war, you will, per- </p><p>haps, realize, these wages can not obtain, unless </p><p>freights are to remain at their present exorbitant </p><p>rates. This can hardly be, I think, since trade can </p><p>not stand such charges. In any case, a steamer’s </p><p>officer is paid well enough to make the profession </p><p>attractive, and the life is good. </p><p> My advice is that you go to your nearest port on</p><p>the seacoast, and apply in person to the chief mate </p><p>or captain of any good-sized ship going anywhere. </p><p>The chief mate usually engages the men, subject to </p><p>the skipper’s approval; but for a youngster to start </p><p>right he should try to select a fairly good-class </p><p>skipper, talk to him in person, and enlist his inter- </p><p>est. Captains in these times are of a superior </p><p>mold to the old-timers, at least in education and </p><p>breeding, though perhaps not better seamen. I’ll </p><p>be glad to know how you succeed, and am always at </p><p>your service.	•_</p><p>The Canadian Northwest </p><p> Question:—“Are conditions good in B. C. or Al-</p><p>berta for a man who is willing to do any work in </p><p>order to live and leam the country? I am not </p><p>destitute, but wish to earn my way while absorbing </p><p>what the country has to offer to soothe an itching </p><p>foot and an imagination that seeks food for a diary </p><p>of adventure.”-, Detroit, Mich. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Carson:—You certainly have the</p><p>right idea of how to come to B. C. or any other place </p><p>which is new to you and where the conditions are </p><p>different from those in the East, since the one way </p><p>to obtain information about a country is to live </p><p>there a while. </p><p> Employment of all kinds is to be had almost any-</p><p>where out here, the larger cities being distributing </p><p>points for the districts in which they are situated. </p><p> Just at present the mills, shipyards and logging-</p><p>camps arc simply howling for help and the pay is </p><p>good, the cost of living rather less than it is in the</p><p>East while so far as I can leam, the relations be- </p><p>tween employer and employee are much pleasanter </p><p>than almost anywhere else. </p><p> By coming now you could leam enough to land a</p><p>job with a surveying party or on the reclamation or </p><p>forestry service in the Spring and for an outdoor </p><p>man these jobs are hard to beat. The war has </p><p>stripped B. C. of her best men, in some instances </p><p>whole districts have been practically depopulated </p><p>which means just that many openings for the new- </p><p>comer. These things have to be learned and the </p><p>one way to do it is to come and take what you can </p><p>get until such time as you can get what you want. </p><p> I can not see a single reason why an independent</p><p>man should hesitate to come to the coast, Western </p><p>Washington being as good a place as any to begin </p><p>gathering experience, since the condilions here are </p><p>almost identical with those across the Line and </p><p>getting more so every day. If there is any particu- </p><p>lar brand of labor which you are partial to, let me </p><p>know what it is and I wifi give you my opinion as </p><p>to which would be the best place to locate. </p><p>Lumbering in Tennessee </p><p> Question:—“Will you kindly give me some in-</p><p>formation regarding the lumbering industry in your </p><p>district? Also advise me as to necessary steps I </p><p>would have to take to get a position in lumbering </p><p>camps.	*</p><p> “I am twenty years old, have high-school educa-</p><p>tion, and two years’ clerical experience in the </p><p>city.”—Frederick C. Roome, New York City. </p><p> Answer, by Mr. Liebe:—Concerning the lumber-</p><p>ing and logging operations in my district, they are </p><p>being carried on chiefly far back in the hills; though </p><p>sometimes the logging outfit is in the hills, and the </p><p>Lost </p><p>sawmill that uses the logs in a town. Our lowland </p><p>timber, in this section, is largely cut out. </p><p> As to the steps necessary to land a position—it</p><p>would be called a “job” here—about all you’d have </p><p>to do would be to let some camp or mill know you </p><p>wanted work. I enclose herewith a late advertise- </p><p>ment for men. If you go in answer to it, don’t </p><p>dress up. Stick to flannel shirts and soft hats. </p><p> Work hard, and don’t have too much to say until</p><p>you get acquainted. There are lots of good fellows </p><p>among timberjacks, but they all have a particular </p><p>hankering after fighting. You may have to put up </p><p>a scrap or two; if you do, fight like the devil, and be </p><p>sure you don’t use any weapons unless the other </p><p>fellow shows a pretty sure sign of using one. </p><p> I’ve given you all this advice because you’re only</p><p>twenty. You are rather young to go into a logging </p><p>outfit for a job. It’s a wild, rough life. </p><p>Jiu-Jitsu </p><p> Question:—“Could you give me any information</p><p>on the subject of Jiu-Jitsu as practised in Japan? </p><p>Where could I obtain some literature dealing with </p><p>the subject. </p><p> “I have several small pamphlets on it but I don’t</p><p>think they treal the subject fully.”—Lenore </p><p>House, Ada, Oklahoma. </p><p>Trails	191</p><p> Answer, by Mr. Ritchie:—In the limits of an</p><p>“Ask Adventure” answer I can not begin to tell you </p><p>all there is to know about Jiu-Jitsu; no more than </p><p>could the well-known Mr. James Corbett reveal </p><p>the science of boxing in anything less than a series </p><p>of articles. Once I started Jiu-Jitsu under a </p><p>licensed instructor in Japan; when I had taken </p><p>lessons for two months he told me—and not before— </p><p>that the full course occupied three years, I quit </p><p>right there. </p><p> “As you doubtless know already, the adept at Jiu-</p><p>Jitsu must possess a knowledge of anatomy almost </p><p>as complete as a surgeon’s, and he can kill an ad- </p><p>versary by a pinch or the blow of his open palm. In </p><p>Japan, therefore, nobody is permitted to learn the </p><p>science of “conquering by yielding” except from </p><p>responsible and licensed instructors. There would </p><p>be no room in Jiu-Jitsu for a Battling Nelson or </p><p>Knock-out Brown; one must have a head for the </p><p>game instead of just a “punch.” </p><p> The pamphlets you mention are positively worth-</p><p>less. I can refer you to two books on the subject </p><p>which could be purchased through Macmillan Com- </p><p>pany, New York: “Japanese Physical Training,” by </p><p>H.	Irving Hancock, and “Jiu-Jitsu Tricks,” by</p><p>K. Saito.
