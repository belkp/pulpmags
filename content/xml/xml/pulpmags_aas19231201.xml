                    <ab>Chehalts, Wash., Oct. 9.</ab>
                    <ab>When I enrolled with you less than a year ago I was a common mechanic earning $25 to $30 a week. Today I am an "Electrical Expert" with a business of my own that gives me a
                        clear profit of over $750 a month.</ab>
                    <ab>I have more work than I can do. The people around Chehalis come to me to fix their starters, generators and ignition troubles because they know that I know how to do it
                        right.</ab>
                    <ab>My success, I owe to you, Mr. Cooke. The thorough practical training which you gave me through your Easily-learned Home Study Course in Electricity has made me an independent,
                        highly respected business man in this community.</ab>
                    <ab>Sincerely yours, W. E. Pence</ab>
                    <ab>Age or Lack of Education No Handicap</ab>
                    <ab>No matter how old or how young you are, or what education you have, there is a real future for you in electricity. If you can read and write I can put you on the road to
                        success. I can help you to a position that will make people admire you and look up to you.</ab>
                    <ab>Cash In on Your Spare Time</ab>
                    <ab>Use your spare time to get a better job. Most of us have enough spare time every day to sell a little at about $10.00 an hour. Sell some to yourself at this price. Watch how
                        quick you will earn the money back if you put the time into study.</ab>
                    <ab>I Guarantee Your Complete Satisfaction</ab>
                    <ab>I am so sure I can make a big pay electrical expert out of you that I guarantee your success. I agree under bond to return every cent you pay me for tuition when you have
                        finished the course, if you are not satisfied that it is the best investment you have ever made. If you don't make good, this million dollar institution will.</ab>
                    <ab>Electrical Working Outfit Free</ab>
                    <ab>Every man who enrolls for my electrical course gets a big outfit of tools, material and instruments free. This includes an electric motor and other things not usually found in
                        a beginners outfit. These are the same tools and the same material you will use later in your work. Everything practical and good right from the start.</ab>
                    <ab>Act Right Now</ab>
                    <ab>Let me send you my big free book of giving details of the opportunities electricity offers you and a sample lesson also free. Mail the coupon and get this at once. Learn how
                        other men "got themselves ready to hold good paying jobs" and how I can help you do the same. This is your big chance -- take it.</ab>

                    <ab>is a novel as scintillant and provocative as its title. It illumines the lives of characters as real as your own social circle. And if you do not already know the heroine, you
                        surely have seen her. She is the girl who turns toward the bright lights as the sunflower to the sun, if not as the moth to the flame.</ab>

                            could hope for was just a job -- and that's what I got, at $60 a month for routine, unskilled work. I stayed at it for three years, with one small increase each year.</ab>
                        <ab>"Then one day I woke up. I found I wasn't getting ahead simply because I couldn't do any one thing well. I decided right then to put in an hour after supper each night
                            preparing myself for more important work. So I wrote to Scranton and arranged for a course that would give me special training for our business.</ab>
                        <ab>"Why, in a few months I had a whole new vision of my work and its possibilities. You see, I was just beginning to really understand it. I made some suggestions to the
                            manager and he was immensely pleased. Said he had noticed how much better I was doing lately and wished he had more like me.</ab>
                        <ab>"Just after that an opening came and he gave me my chance -- at an increase of $25 a month. Then I really began to grow. Six months later I was put in charge of my
                            department and my salary went up again. Since then I've had two increases of $50 a month and now I've got another $50 raise!"</ab>
                        <ab>For 31 years the International Correspondence Schools have been helping men and women everywhere to win promotion, to earn more money, to have happy, prosperous homes, to
                            know the joy of getting ahead in business and in life.</ab>

                    <ab>Maupassant, more than any other writer, dared to rip aside the veil of convention and tell the naked truth. He held the mirror up to nature -- portraying life openly yet never
                        making vice attractive -- never passing judgment. His stories of Parisian high life, of the underworld, the Orient, the high seas, the jungles, are realistic; as delightfully
                        human as they are bold.</ab>
                    <ab>Frankest of Frenchmen</ab>
                    <ab>Maupassant startled the world with his boldness and made humanity gasp because he wrote from first-hand observation and experience. The situations he created are true-to-life
                        situations. His characters are real people -- mostly young people -- like those you see around you every day.</ab>

                    <ab>Thousands Are Now Finding It Easy to Have the Slim, Trim Figure Dictated By Fashion and Admired By All.</ab>
                    <ab>ARE you fat? You shouldn't be. Without rigorous dieting or exercise -- by a simple natural process -- you should quickly and easily be able to have the slender fashionable
                        figure that is so attractive.</ab>
                    <ab>Scientists have discovered that excess fat is often caused by the subnormal action of a small gland. Once this gland is healthy and functioning properly, your weight should
                        reduce naturally and without effort on your part, to the normal amount for your height.</ab>
                    <ab>And science has discovered a simple extract which tends to regulate the gland that controls fat. Without lifting a hand in unnecessary and violent exercise, you should find it
                        a delightfully simple matter to have the ideal, slender figure admired by everyone.</ab>
                    <ab>The wonderful thing about the scientific formula known as Rid-O-Fat is that in losing your superfluous fat you should gain added vigor, health and energy of mind and body.</ab>
                    <ab rend="bold">Feel Young -- Look Young</ab>
                    <ab>There is nothing which adds to a person's age so much as fat. A few extra pounds makes any man or woman look from five to ten years older Not only that, the excess weight and
                        increased heart action saps vitality and energy.</ab>
                    <ab>Once the gland which controls your fat 1s functioning properly your food should be turned into firm, solid flesh and muscle. As your weight comes down to normal you should
                        experience a delightful and amazing improvement in your appearance. You should not only feel and look younger -- you should actually be vounger. You should also be in better
                        health -- a real health of energy -- not the fictitious and deceiving health of fat that insurance companies say shortens the life ten years.</ab>
                    <ab>Complexion, health and figure are improved at the same time. The result is new vitality, magnetism and personal charm that nnba for success. Tasks once hard becomo easy and
                        life worth while.</ab>
                    <ab>Science Discloses Method of Quickly Reducing Excess Weight - Many Losing a Pound a Day Without Starvation Dieting or Exercise -- Greatly Improves Appearance. Generous Sample

                    <ab>Rid-O-Fat, the scientific compound, comes in convenient tablet form, and is practically tasteless. You simply take one at each meal and bedtime.</ab>
                    <ab>Results often surprising in their rapidity. Within a few days you should be conscious of a new feeling of energy and lightness, taking the place of that tired, worn-out
                        feeling.</ab>
                    <ab>Quickly as the fat gland resumes normal functioning you should lose weight in a healthy, normal manner. Many fat, ungainly figures are in this scientific manner helped to
                        regain their normal and idealistic proportions, giving that fashionable slenderness and athletic poise.</ab>
                    <ab>And all this time you live as you please.</ab>
                    <ab>Nature is doing the work. No more irksome exercise -- no more denying yourself of all the things you like. Take just one small, pleasant, Rid-O-Fat tablet after each meal.
                        Could anything be more simple?</ab>

                    <ab>Since the announcement of the wonderful Rid-O-Fat formula it has been used by more than 100,000 people. Twenty to thirty thousand more people are writing for it every month.

                    <ab>INSTEAD of hot water, messy poultices, intolerable plasters, etc., modern medical science today uses a new, clean and in- finitely more effective method of relieving pain.</ab>
                    <ab>It is -- Radiant Heat and Light, as perfectly produced by the Stein-O-Lite.</ab>
                    <ab>Why Stein-O-Lite is more effective</ab>
                    <ab>Old-fashioned hot applications, while helpful, have little penetrative power. They heat the surface but do not touch the seat of pain. Stein-O-Lite's magic rays do! They get
                        right down into the throbbing tissues and break up the congestion thru stimulation. You can actually feel the pa in-shot tissues relax and the pain die out as the warm, mellow
                        rays -- golden as tropical sunlight -- play upon the tender area. Clean as sunlight, safe as sunlight, pleasant as sunlight -- Stein-O-Lite does the work.</ab>
                    <ab>Now Stein-0-Lite can become your first aid</ab>
                    <ab>Because Stein-O-Lite rays cannot burn or irritate the skin (see why in panel text) any individual can use it. For the pains of little ones as well as grown-ups. Think of its
                        convenience, too -- just screw a plug into a light socket, turn the switch and a flood of pain-soothing light starts to work.</ab>
                    <ab>We Invite you to try a Stein-O-Lite treatment</ab>
                    <ab>Special Offer</ab>

                    <ab>JENNY DEVON, manikin in Mme. Lacour's dressmaking establishment in London, is besought by Baroness Luini, lady in waiting to the Archduchess Stephanie of Rosemark, to
                        impersonate the duchess, whom she greatly resembles, for a few days. The archduchess, headstrong and reckless, has eloped with Count Saxt, although she is about to be betrothed
                        to Prince Nicholas of Galmatia. He must not know of her disappearance, as it is hoped to overtake the archduchess and persuade her to return.</ab>
                    <ab>Jenny agrees reluctantly and goes to Argar Castle with the baroness. There she is presented to the exiled Empress Melita, grandmother of Stephanie, who is one of those in the
                        secret, and meets Prince Nicholas. The prince finds her charming and makes love to her. Jenny loses her heart to him. Her visit to Argar Castle is cut short by the return of
                        the real archduchess.</ab>

                    <ab>EX-ROUNDSMAN McCARTY discovers that a man he has seen fall dead in the street has been poisoned. He and his old friend, Denny Riordan, investigate and learn that the murdered
                        man is Alfred Hughes, valet to Henry Orbit, one of the wealthy residents of a block with gates at either end, adjoining the park, known as New Queen's Mall. Inspector Druet, of
                        the police, joins in the investigation.</ab>
                    <ab>Neither Orbit, nor his neighbors, the Sloanes and Goddards, shed any light on the poisoning. McCarty learns from little Fu Moy, nephew of Ching Lee, Orbit's Chinese butler,
                        that Lee and Hughes were enemies and also that there had been a slight fire in Orbit's bedroom. It develops that the valet was a bully, drunkard, and trifler with women, and
                        therefore had other enemies. Several days after the murder, Trafford, tutor of young Horace Goddard, interrupts McCarty and Denny while they are interviewing Orbit to inquire
                        whether Horace has been seen. Later it develops that Horace has disappeared.</ab>

                    <ab>A New Life</ab>
                    <ab>Stop! It's all wrong. There is another life right here before you. A new and a better one. A life that is full of thrills and sunshine. Every day opens new worlds to conquer,
                        new joys, new friends and lasting ones. Come with me and let me guide you to it.</ab>
                    <ab>I have a system that knocks those gloom bugs higher than a kite. I'll put pep in your old backbone that will make you feel like a jack rabbit. I'll put a spring to your step
                        and a flash to your eye so that your own friends won't know you.</ab>
                    <ab>Health and Strength</ab>
                    <ab>That's what you need and that's what you get. Come on now, pull in your belt and throw out your chest. Take a good deep breath of that pure air that's all about you. Give your
                        heart a treat with some rich blood. You will feel so good you will think it's your birthday. Drop me a line and I'll show you how to do it. I'm going to put a chest on you that
                        will make your old ribs strain with the pressure. I'm going to change those skinny arms and legs of yours to a real man's size. You will have the strength and vitality to do
                        things you never thought possible. Come on fellows! Get busy. I don't promise these things -- I guarantee them. Are you with me?</ab>

                        <ab>is probably the greatest handicap anyone can have in life. It keeps you from being your own real self -- from doing your downright best and from getting on in life as you
                            should.</ab>
                        <ab>Personal appearance has a lot to do with the way you feel. Clothes count, of course. But still there is one thing so many people overlook -- something that at once brands
                            them as either fastidious or careless -- the teeth.</ab>
                        <ab>Notice today how you, yourself, watch another person's teeth when he or she is talking. If the teeth are not well kept they at once become a liability.</ab>
                        <ab>Only the right dentifrice -- consistently used -- will protect you against such criticisms. Listerine Tooth Paste cleans teeth a new way. The first tube you buy will prove
                            this to you.</ab>
                        <ab>You will notice the improvement even in the first few days. And, moreover, just as Listerine is the safe antiseptic, so Listerine Tooth Paste is the safe dentifrice. It
                            cleans, yet it cannot injure the enamel.</ab>
