        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">And their hint was no more than the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">called a " psychological physician," a man</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whom others might call a mystic, yet in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">reality no mystic at all, since he proclaimed</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">tical after all; that all is but the result of</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Of those higher forces of nature he was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a student. It was by means of the knowl-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the physician's part to troubled human</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">souls and put straight the tangled strands</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Oh, yes, Dual studied the stars, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">drew from them wonderful knowledge of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">which he used, to bring about his results.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Therefore he first gained his knowledge in</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He was an old man. with graying hair,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">a nearly colorless mask in which burned</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">two dark eyes. I noted that his hands</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But he turned and vanished without a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">word, and I gave my attention once more</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to the room. In a corner formed by the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">saw the hand basin Bancroft had men-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">tioned. A door midway of the latter wall</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">seemed to lead into the room beyond, and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">leaning against the wall between the door</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and the porcelain plumbing in the corner</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was an ordinary folding screen, which I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">fancied was probably used to conceal the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">were two windows in the side wall of the</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">The opening of the door from the hall</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cut my inspection short. I turned my gaze</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">from the room to the woman who came in.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">She was young. Bancroft had said she was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of age, but she carried the atmosphere of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">youth about her. She was of medium</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">height, well formed, brown haired and as I</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">It was arranged that Dr. Young should be</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">We spent half an hour going over the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">house. Miss Balliol picked out a few</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pictures and other things which she would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">like to have, and I promised to pack them</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">up for her. She was planning to stay for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a week or two with the Dawsons.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Althought she did not say it in so many</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">words, I realized that her reason for com-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing here had been to settle the mystery</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which surrounded her brother's death. And</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">she would settle it. There was no doubt</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that within a few days she would find out</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about that note at the bank. The other</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">trouble, the trouble which had smashed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Balliol's nerves and which was somehow</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">So, when she had finished with the house.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I told her frankly what the banker had just</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">telephoned to me. To be more exact. I</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">told it with some additions and evasions,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for I did not think it necessary to say that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">I was paying off the five thousand. 1 got</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">around that by saying that the creditor had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">paid up, having unexpectedly gotten some</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">money, and that the banker had phoned</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Beyond question I got things a little in-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Out of justice to the dead chap, I felt in</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Yes, taking it up and down, it was a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">sorry and a sordid and a dashed brave little</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">story. Balliol was a fool and a coward, per-</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Martha Balliol cried a little, and tried</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">clear and sober understanding of why her</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">brother had killed himself. Then she said</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that she thought I had better take her on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to Dawson's by road, the sun being pretty</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hot on the water; so I went out and got the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">The road, which ran down along the lake</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the Paragon, of course, and we hummed</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">I paused to help myself to a few necta-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">identified itself to his senses was the cot on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">which he lay. His hand, hanging at one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">side of the cot, touched the iron bar of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">frame. A tag was tied to t'ne bar here: and</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he felt the string, and thus knew the cot</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">Therefore, of course, he was dead. He</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">so that he slipped back into a half-sleep,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">half-stupor once more. This stupor per-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Regretfully, at length, he approached</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">thoughts began where they had left off.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He was in his own bed, in his own room.</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">They had told him that if he died, they</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He saw the white oblong of an envelope</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">propped against the mirror. This confirmed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">his first conclusion. He was dead, and</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">But in the end, he remembered. If he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">He could feel no knife in his lungs as he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">were a knife blade there, it would hurt him</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to breathe. To make assurance doubly</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">There was no one he could ask. He</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine">He decided to sleep a little while--he</seg>
