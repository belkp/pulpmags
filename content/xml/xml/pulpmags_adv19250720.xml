            <seg type="columnLine">average to 12.2 knots for the twenty-four</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hours. In itself the few miles lost were</seg>

        <ab><seg type="columnLine">HIS name was "Dogie." Any-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">way that was what they called</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him at home. In school the boys</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">called him "Wart." You re-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">member a dogie is the cow-country word for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a runt, a calf of stunted growth.</seg>
        </ab>
        
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> This boy had eight brothers. Every one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of them was six feet tall or over, but Dogie</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">stopped growing at five foot one. The folks</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">around home thought he was sickly at first.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Even his mother was afraid there might be</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">something the matter with him. But there</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wasn't anything wrong. He was just a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dogie. At that time people didn't know</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">much about what causes dwarfs. It is</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">something wrong with the pituitary gland,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whatever that is. Sometimes it causes</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">giants, too. I read this in a book. The</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> But when Dogie's big brothers played, he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">after he got ouf of his mother's lap, unless he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">And I'll tell you why. There was a colt out</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">let him run every time he wanted to, but</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">after a while we barred him from riding for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">any one else. That was done on the ground</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of his weight. There wasn't a hundred</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">pounds of him even when you included his</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">we didn't like to admit that he was the best</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">against our pride. Dogie's regular price for</seg>

        </ab>
        
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> After a while it occurred to us boys that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">we might be able to recover some of the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">money Dogie had taken away from us by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">backing him against cowhands farther</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">away. The standard wage on ranches in</seg>

        </ab>
        
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> So we picked out some of our best ponies</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and stirred up races in five adjoining</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">counties. Dogie redeemed himself by put-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">we became ambitious; nothing less than the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">county fairs would satisfy us. In the course</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of these local races we had got a pretty good</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">line on our horses; in fact, we settled upon</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">one as the fastest horse in the world, which</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was fair enough since none of us had stop</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">watches. This horse's name was Persim-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">mon, a big stallion with a disposition so sour</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that no other name would fit him.</seg>
        </ab>
        <ab><seg type="columnLine">THE business of getting that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">*brute to a county fair turned out</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to be rather complicated. First</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of all we had to form a syndicate of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">twenty partners to pay the expense. Then</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Dogie went hog wild and demanded a dollar</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">for riding him. Next we had to give up a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">couple of the nearest fairs in order to wait</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">until all members of the syndicate had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">enough money to make bets.</seg>
        </ab>
        
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> During this delay a new complication</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">arose that threatened to leave us without a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">jockey. There was an old horse on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ranch that no one but Dogie could catch.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">This beast had to be harnessed for work</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">every day, so Dogie's father objected to the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">kid's going away. He had been playing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hide-and-go-seek with this horse every</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">morning for several years and was therefore</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">accountable for its bad habits.</seg>
        </ab>
        
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> This horse was a dark bay about ten</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">years old--he'd go down among the trees in</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the lower pasture and stand right still; that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">made it hard to see him. You can't tell me</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he didn't know it, either. Dogie's father</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would send the boy down into the pasture</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">after him and then the game would start.</seg>
        </ab>
        
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Now, nearly every one else would have</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">run his legs off, but Dogie had too much</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">animal sense. He'd pick out a spot where</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he could see a lot of the pasture and wait</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">until his eyes were well adjusted to the light</seg>

        </ab>
        
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> If just one ear was visible Dogie would</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">spot him. The horse always stood so that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he could peek around a tree. If his eyes</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">met Dogie's he'd trot up and take the bridle,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but if Dogie had missed him he'd go on</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">standing still. That was their game. No</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">one else knew how to play it, so the syndi-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cate had to put up two more hard-earned</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dollars to pay for oats so the horse could be</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> However, we finally got Persimmon to the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">that they insist upon at fancy races and we</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">used to a regular saddle or none at all. We</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">were worried. Three horses dropped out</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> In town he met a man named Smith and a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">low Smith was a crook and the horse was a</seg>

        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> His latest outburst had just got Smith</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">into serious trouble. A jockey used his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whip on Geyser when they were coming</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">down the stretch and he jumped clear over</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">As a result Smith dodged a sheriff and man-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">aged to get away with Geyser, but a court</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">order tied up most of his money and two</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">to our town; probably he didn't have much</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">choice of trains. Anyway, there he was,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">trying to sell Geyser, and at the same time</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">keep a string tied to him. His offer was one</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">option to buy him back for two hundred</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">dollars within a month. He needed the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hundred to reach friends and get money.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">But no one wanted his horse. They could</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">to reach a friendly understanding with a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">for about an hour before they set out for</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the ranch, and after that they seemed to</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">speak each other's language. There were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">no apples or carrots or sugar or anything</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">like that in the process of getting ac-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">quainted. They had just made up to each</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Except at meal times Dogie kept out of</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">give him a run for exercise. He told me</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">afterward that Geyser was the first and only</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">horse he ever handled that really had racing</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">instinct. Geyser was a thoroughbred all</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">right, but he was six years old and never had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">settled down. Six years is old for a race</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">horse. He was a gray-beard and still wild.</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> I looked up his record and found that he</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">also come in last several times. In other</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">words, Geyser was one of those crazy animals</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with a yard of pedigree that will run or not</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">just as he pleases. What tickled Dogie,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">though, was his eagerness to run ahead of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Spot, the dog. Spot liked to race. I think</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">rural telephone was out of commission that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">day, so Smith had to come out to the ranch</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> I think that conversation was what put</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the idea into Smith's head to take Dogie</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">with him. The kid was afraid he wouldn't</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">get permission, so he went without asking</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and telegraphed after they were over the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Louisiana State line. He probably thought</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the state line protected him in some way.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">None of us worried about his going, because</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Dogie always had a lot of common sense.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">We knew he could ride and we had heard</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">that a good jockey was better paid than a</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">cow hand. The only uncertain element</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was Smith. He didn't measure up very</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">Geyser. In our set that was pretty heavy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">gambling, so the kid was impressed. How-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ever, it looked to me like a good bet on a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">he'd run on the track or all over the neigh-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">boring counties. People said that some</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> I was watching their heads and tails bob</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">up and down on the far side of the track</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">when Smith came up beside me and began</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to groan. It looked to him like Geyser</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">wouldn't run. I didn't know whether he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">would or wouldn't, but I felt mighty uneasy</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about that hundred dollars when I listened</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to the groans. I told Smith that it looked</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to me like Dogie was keeping clear for the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">inside position and dodging trouble at the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">second turn but Smith just sputtered.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He sounded like a leaking steam valve.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">He said they were going to pocket Geyser</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">on the turn and sure enough they did.</seg>
        </ab>
        
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> It was Dogie's first experience against</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">real track generalship. I don't know much</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">about such things, but I could see that they</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">had worked him away from the rail on the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">turn and at the same time crowded the track</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in front of him. Evidently they judged</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">Geyser was going to run if he got a chance.</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">This maneuver brought seven horses into</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the stretch pretty well bunched, four ahead</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">of Geyser, two behind.</seg>
        </ab>
        
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> And then Dogie lengthened out in that</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">funny way of his, falling forward along the</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">horse's neck. Well, sir, you would have</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">thought a bee had stung old Geyser. His</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">belly drew in and his whole body lengthened</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">out; it actually looked like his neck got</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">longer. The only question after that was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">whether he could overcome a lead of nearly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">two lengths in such a short distance. If he</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">could, Dogie's mother was certainly going to</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">nerves a lot if Dogie had been using a whip,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">but he didn't. Geyser was too temper-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">amental. The whole job was being done by</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">power of suggestion. Geyser shot through</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">a space between two horses just in front of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">him and then went after the favorite, a</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">and clods of dirt began to shoot out behind</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">light bay just closed up like some one shut-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">the finest thing about that race was that it</seg>
