            <ab>3114--Argosy--April 12--i s@3B§S Readers' Viewpoint A S YOU know, we have a half a dozen analysts among our readers, who grade the
                fiction and determine our average by the month or year. One of them is with us this week, a gentle- man who sends in an 'annual
                report. , He doesn't seem to think anyone no- tices his ratings. Now we do, as we've said more than once; we find these scorecards not
                only interesting but helpful. Moreover, our guess is that most readers enjoy seeing estimates of stories they've read. For one thing,
                these ratings give them the opportunity to disagree, and that is a thoroughly normal American jndoor sport. STANLEY HAYNES Although I
                am a bit late with this my fifth annual report on the state and condition of Argosy, I am sure that since nobody would have missed it
                in the first place and in the second place nobody wants it, I will be pardoned. 1940 has, after a slow start, shown Argosy to be a
                much improved maga- zine toward the close, I believe. A number of the old and much-liked authors have been reappearing between its
                covers and some of the younger displayed excellent ability. The find of the year, as far as I.am concerned is a short-story writer by
                the name of Robert Arthur. How about a short biography of him, and others, in future Argosies? "Postmarked For Paradise" was his best.

                tried? Have you ever attempted even the least bit of training, under competent guidance? Or have you been sitting back, as it is so
                easy to do, waiting for the day to come when you will waken all of a sudden to the discovery, "I am a writer"? If the latter course is
                the one of your choosing, you probably never will write. Lawyers must be law clerks. Engineers must be draftsmen. We all know that, in
                our times, the egg does come before the chicken. It is seldom that anyone becomes a writer until he (or she) has been writing for some
                time. That is why so many authors and writers spring up out of the newspaper business. The day-to-day necessity of writing--of
                gathering material about which to write--develops their talent, their insight, their background and their confidence as nothing else
                could. ... That is why the Newspaper Institute of America bases its writing instruction on journalism--continuous writing--the
                training that has produced so many successful authors. Learn to write by writing NEWSPAPER Institute training is based on the New York
                Copy Desk Method. It starts and keeps you writing in your own home, on your own time. Week by week you receive actual assignments,
                just as if you were right at work oji a great metropolitan daily. 3114--Argosy--April 12-- Earns Living Writ- ing--Before Finishing
                Course "I had no job, no chance of getting one. I have always had the desire to write. I saw your ad, borrowed the money to pay for
                the course. Before finishing your course I had become self-supporting as a corre- spondent for the state pa- pers. I believe that if
                any- one wants to be a writer and will apply himself to your course, he will soon know whether his living is coming out of the writing
                market."--Edward Foster, Talihina, Okla. Your writing is individually corrected and constructively criti- cized. Thoroughly
                experienced, practical, active writers are re- sponsible for this instruction. Under such sympathetic guidance, you will find that
                (instead of vainly trying to copy someone elses writing tricks) you are rapidly developing your own distinctive, self- flavored
                style--undergoing an experience that has a thrill to it and which at the same time develops in you the power to make your feel- ings
                articulate. Many people who should be writing become awe- struck by fabulous stories about millionaire authors and therefore give
                little thought to the $25, $50 and $100 or more that can often be earned for material that takes little time to write--stories,
                articles on business, fads, travels, sports, recipes, etc.--things that can easily be turned out in leisure hours, and often on the
                impulse of the moment. A. chance to test yourself--FREE! Our unique Writing Aptitude Test tells whether you possess the fundamental
                qualities necessary to successful writing--acute observation, dramatic in- stinct, creative imagination, etc. You'll enjoy taking this

            <ab>Also, I have a few suggestions for improving Argosy, as I would have it: Give Max Brand a good dose of Kildare's favorite remedy and
                get him writing something else for a change, for example "War for Sale." Disembowel with a sharp sword both Cleve and d'Entreville.
                Ignite ten sticks of dynamite with a short fuse under Roy Horn's bombards. And finally, fill Odin's cup with Tuttle's prune juice
                desert dew and pour down Ketchum's throat Par^jeeville, Wis.</ab>
            <ab>YOU are now well acquainted with the improved Argosy, which offers you a large, clear type and sixteen additional pages. We feel
                confident that the changes we have made will be heartily approved by our readers, and we have definite reason for our
                confidence.</ab>
            <ab>As soon as we announced the change to larger type and the increase in size, letters began to pour into this office. We received
                thousands of them, many from readers who had already expressed disapproval of the small type that was our first experiment. Fine, they
                said in unison; give us a larger type and more pages, and we are with you.</ab>
            <ab>There were so many of these letters that we cannot possibly publish them all; but here are a few excerpts: "I notice in your March 1
                issue an announcement that you are going to print a larger type. I hope therefore that I will again enjoy reading your magazine." ...
                "Your statement announcing the use of larger type changes my mind, and as 1 like all your writers, I shall continue to read Argosy."
                ... "I venture to say that the majority of your old readers would be in favor of the old type."</ab>
            <ab>Clearly we have now solved the difficult problem of Argosy's format. But the solution would never have been reached if we had not
                received the aid of thousands of readers. They showed us the way, and for their loyalty and keen judgment we are deeply grateful.</ab>
