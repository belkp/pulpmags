He looked like anything else but</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dempsey's twin to Jimmy De For»</seg><seg type="columnLine">est, as that canny old trainer of</seg><seg type="columnLine">champs studied him from the ring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side at the Yankee Stadium.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAX SCHMELING is heavy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight champion of the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The title has been conferred</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him because he won on a foul</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Jack Sharkey in the fourth round</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their fight last June.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It may be an unkind thing to say, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is an unquestionably true one: The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Black Uhlan of the Rhine is the poor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est champion we have ever had. More</seg><seg type="columnLine">than that, he is not even best among the</seg><seg type="columnLine">poor crop of big men who are making</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunes in the prise-ring today.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I think that certainly Jack Sharkey</seg><seg type="columnLine">and possibly Primo Camera should rate</seg><seg type="columnLine">above him, so if my judgment of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">is correct, Schmeling--despite his glory</seg><seg type="columnLine">as successor to Corbett, Fitzsimmons</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Dempsey--is only third best in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">class, and a singularly unimpressive</seg><seg type="columnLine">class it is* too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside the ring, Max is a pleasant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unassuming, intelligent young man. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dislike saying anything that would hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feelings or cast a cloud 011 his pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tige, but the only honest thing to do is</seg><seg type="columnLine">to freely speak my mind no matter who</seg><seg type="columnLine">may take offense.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I believe that Sharkey would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">beaten him decisively if he had not un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunately fouled the black-haired Ger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, and it is my conviction that, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">these men meet again, Jack will estab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lish his superiority beyond any question</seg><seg type="columnLine">of doubt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Schmeling has had only half-a-dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">bouts in America. I have seen them all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I have watched him day after day</seg><seg type="columnLine">in training, studying not only his phys-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ical but his mental reactions. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">this observation I know him as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as any outsider can, and it is on these</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">3</seg><seg type="columnLine">4</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">observations that I base my judgment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We can throw out Max's first two</seg><seg type="columnLine">victories--those over Joe Monte and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pietro Corri. Neither are even second-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raters. They know nothing of boxing</seg><seg type="columnLine">and are not hard hitters. Their only</seg><seg type="columnLine">claim to any sort of a place in the ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">is ability to take punishment and willing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness to endure it. Corri had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked out frequently before fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schmeling, and Monte has suffered such</seg><seg type="columnLine">depressing defeats a number of times</seg><seg type="columnLine">since.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe Sekyra was Max's third opponent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe is fairly clever and has a fine pair</seg><seg type="columnLine">of legs. He was in there to stay the</seg><seg type="columnLine">limit, so he ran as fast as he could all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the way. Schmeling chased him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him a two-handed lacing from long</seg><seg type="columnLine">range, but never could quite catch up</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him, at least not well enough to</seg><seg type="columnLine">knock him out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then they booked the Black Uhlan</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Johnny Risko, and this made his</seg><seg type="columnLine">reputation, because he knocked John out</seg><seg type="columnLine">--a feat no one else had been able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">accomplish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Let's study this fight a little. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first place Risko is not a fast man, he is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a clever one, and he cannot hit. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">success has been achieved because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeps crowding an opponent. Hailing</seg><seg type="columnLine">away all the time, never letting the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow get set if he can help it. Fast,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clever fellows like Tommy Loughran</seg><seg type="columnLine">were able to make Risko look pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad. but he won a lot of smashing vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tories over slower and more rugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">figters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Risko isn't smart, but then Schmeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't either. This statement will prob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably surprise a lot of people who figure</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to be pretty shrewd-headed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring. Outside the ring, Max is intelli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gent enough. I make no aspersion</seg><seg type="columnLine">against his brains when I say he isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">smart, for I mean it entirely in a box-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing sense. Put the most erudite college</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor you ever saw in the ring and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would be a complete dumb-bell while</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had the gloves on. Some people have</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instinct for doing the right thing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">when they are boxing. Schmeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasn't.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For one thing, he becomes dazzled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the crowd and the lights and excitement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It takes time for him to get his bear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings. He is too stirred by his imagina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. Before the Sharkey fight, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">physician who examined him found his</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood pressure extremely high and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart action far beyond normal. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Germans are supposed to be phlegmatic</seg><seg type="columnLine">and cold-blooded, but this is not true</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Black Uhlan. I assume that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">has been that way before all his bouts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Risko took the fight to Schmeling just</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he does to everyone else. He never</seg><seg type="columnLine">had any finesse. All his battles are</seg><seg type="columnLine">waged along the same lines. Max knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. He had seen Johnny fight, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the earlier rounds he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know exactly what was the best thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do. This is not an indication that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">German is a good student of the game.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though the records show that Max</seg><seg type="columnLine">scored a knockout in the ninth round,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whole story isn't told by that. Up</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the final minute, Risko didn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">any the worst of it. In spite of the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he is easy to hit, Max didn't land</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him nearly as much as he should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have. He missed plenty. Frequently</seg><seg type="columnLine">Risko made the Uhlan fight the way he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted him to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, zowie! The right hand landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the button. It hit the exact spot</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it would do the most damage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That punch nearly knocked Johnny's</seg><seg type="columnLine">brains out. He was rocky, half blind,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't any defense left. Max had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead target to shoot at. He just whanged</seg><seg type="columnLine">away with both hands at the helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">baker until the referee stopped the fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Schmeling is supposed to have a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">right. I'll admit that he has a good one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he slammed Risko on the chin half</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen times when John was in no</seg><seg type="columnLine">shape to protect himself, and couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop him. You'll have to take some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the credit away from his punch on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">performance. Do you think that Johnny</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have kept on his feet under sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ilar conditions if Dempsey had hit him</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Black Uhlan-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">likc that?--or Bob Fitzsimmons?--or</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jim Jeffries?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not so you could notice it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But my opinion isn't based on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">alone. Schmeling bats hard enough with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right. He can hurt a man plenty with</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, which is more than you can say of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot of other heavyweights who talk big</seg><seg type="columnLine">and do little. But, though he was ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed to the skies for his technical</seg><seg type="columnLine">knockout of Risko, it seemed to me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Max's very evident faults more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">overbalanced his good points at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suppose that wallop had missed. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">that case, Johnny might have won or</seg><seg type="columnLine">gained a draw. Even if he lost the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cision, it wouldn't have mattered much,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he had dropped plenty of others.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But Schmeling would have missed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">biggest ballyhoo of his life. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">what they sold him on--his knockout of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Risko. Without that golden mark in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the record books he would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">just another heavyweight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I don't mean to say it was a lucky</seg><seg type="columnLine">punch. It wasn't. Max had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing right hands all night, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of others had landed. Knock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out an iron man like Risko isn't just</seg><seg type="columnLine">a question of getting to his chin. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow has to be perfectly timed and land</seg><seg type="columnLine">in exactly the proper spot. It did just</seg><seg type="columnLine">that--and made Max Schmeling's for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tune for him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Uhlan showed that he had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful right, but his left was noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to rave about, and the usual flaws of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a comparatively inexperienced boy were</seg><seg type="columnLine">evident in his work. Still he showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to make his friends enthusiastic.</seg><seg type="columnLine">If he could do that well so early in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">career, there were high hopes that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would add a lot to what he had already</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SCHMELING had imitated Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dempsey's style. He fought out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sort of crouch, but wasn't able to bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">and weave as the old Mauler did. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">style seemed suited to him, but it wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed. His handlers wanted to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Champ or Palooka?	5</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">turn him into a more upright fighter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not immediately. Against Paulino, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crouch was still in evidence, but while</seg><seg type="columnLine">training for Sharkey it was almost en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tirely abandoned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There has been too much puttering</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tinkering with Schmeling. He is</seg><seg type="columnLine">essentially a fighter and not a boxer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He should be made to fight and not</seg><seg type="columnLine">box. Sharkey has forgotten more</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the mechanics of fisticuffs than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schmeling will ever know. But skill,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course, isn't essential in the winning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a heavyweight championship. Sulli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">van, Jeffries and Dempsey proved that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But, without boxing ability, you must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have ruggedness, aggressiveness and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">real punch. With the punch must go</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only power but accuracy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Max's next fight was with Paulino.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He won the decision in fifteen rounds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">giving the Basque a terrible beating in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last five, a beating that turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paulino into a bloody and mangled ob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ject. But again the same objections</seg><seg type="columnLine">found in the Risko fight held good here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the first ten rounds it was a miser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able exhibition, with the men standing</seg><seg type="columnLine">head to head and pawing away without</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing much damage. In short, it took</seg><seg type="columnLine">two-thirds of the fight for Max to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">how to penetrate the burly Spaniard's</seg><seg type="columnLine">awkward guard. That doesn't seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me an indication of exceeding smart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still, the interest in foreign fighters,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and particularly the fact that Schmeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the first championship contender to</seg><seg type="columnLine">come out of Germany, helped push him</seg><seg type="columnLine">along rapidly. He has color and an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">teresting style, and his marked physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">resemblance to Dempsey--aside from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his style--added to the publicity that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was given him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Had he kept in harness after his fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Paulino, the Uhlan might have im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved considerably. But trouble with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Arthur Bulow, his former manager, im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pelled him to return home. He didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">want to fight because Biilow held a con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tract that permitted him to collect one-</seg><seg type="columnLine">third of Schmeling's earnings. So in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">6</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of boxing regularly, Max took to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gymnasiums and vaudeville theatres</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Germany.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That year of comparative idleness</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't do him any good. I have said</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequently that a boxer must fight to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep in proper shape. All the sparring</seg><seg type="columnLine">practice in the world can't take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place of a few keenly contested bouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">for getting a man in real trim. Schmel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing didn't have those fights, and he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself a lot of harm by his abstinence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still, his knockout victory over Risko</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought him continued praise. Most of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the boxing writers thought that John</seg><seg type="columnLine">was washed up physically, but his fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">fights with Von Porat, Campolo and</seg><seg type="columnLine">others proved that this was not true.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So Schmeling's triumph began to as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sume greater and greater proportions.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Eventually, Max was recognized as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leading contender for the title Gene</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tunney had left vacant. The New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York State Athletic Commission re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scinded the ban it had placed on him</seg><seg type="columnLine">for refusing a scheduled match with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Phil Scott and decided to recognize the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winner of a STiarkey-Schmeling bout as</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavyweight champion of the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It seems rather extraordinary, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">you stop to think of it, that a man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had really accomplished so little should</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been given that opportunity.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were two reasons of course--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lack of good big men and the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schmeling was the best fighter in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Europe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">T WATCHED the Black Uhlan very</seg><seg type="columnLine">A carefully in training. As a mail</seg><seg type="columnLine">who has conditioned fighters for forty</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, I think I can see what the aver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age observer misses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Max was badly trained. He did little</seg><seg type="columnLine">road work, no bag punching and much</seg><seg type="columnLine">less boxing than he should have done.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I imagine the automobile accident he</seg><seg type="columnLine">suffered in Europe harmed his legs, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was felt that too much road work</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do him 110 good. People who</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what must be done to get a fighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">in shape understand that a training</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">period without lots of road work is so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much wasted time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Certainly Schmeling looked slower.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was nothing impressive about his</seg><seg type="columnLine">foot work, and the man who hasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">spent time on the road will begin to</seg><seg type="columnLine">show what ails him along toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of the bout. Fortunately for Max,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he won 011 a foul in the fourth round,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so his lack of the right sort of work</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't really show up in action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Against Sharkey the German showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">110 improvement over his match with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Risko. As a matter of fact, I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">think he was as good. Jack succeeded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in drawing him in and countering. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">made Schmeling miss a lot--and poor</seg><seg type="columnLine">judgment of distance is inevitable in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighter who has had a long layoff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sharkey was absolutely confident that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could whip Schmeling, and his con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fidence w'as justified by what happened</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ring. Not one of his opponents</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave him less trouble. Jack knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">out Tommy Loughran in three rounds,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but up to the time Sharkey put over that</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightning finishing punch, Tom had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been giving him all he could handle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The German didn't. He was out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxed and out-hit and out-thought from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first bell. The only point on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he surprised me was his ability to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">a punch. He had been knocked out by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larry Gains and Gypsy Daniels earlier</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his career, and in none of his Ameri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">can bouts had he been forced to meet a</seg><seg type="columnLine">real hitter. So, when Sharkey blasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on the jaw with right-handers that</seg><seg type="columnLine">were labeled death and destruction, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a little surprising to see Max throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">them off and come right back for</seg><seg type="columnLine">more.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Schmeling showed one bad hitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">fault in training. He had a habit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocking down his opponent's leads</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his right hand, and then before he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could shoot a punch himself he had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw the arm back. This telegraphed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the punch even to casual spectators at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ringside. There were other faults</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the Uhlan's lx)xing, too, that proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he not only wasn't a finished per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Black Uhlan--Champ or Palooka?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">7</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">former, but had some of the errors of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">novice.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His handlers at that time pressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their efforts to change his style. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had developed it because, as a young-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster, he was a great admirer of Demp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sey. He had studied moving pictures</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the old champion, and once boxed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Jack when the latter was on an</seg><seg type="columnLine">European trip. Of course, he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">have Dempsey's cat-like speed, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is fairly fast; and he hadn't learned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shift, either. But the style was his.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was at home with it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not being in Schmeling's camp, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was none of my business to offer sug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gestions. I am pointing out these facts</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a disinterested observer. As I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, Max showed no improvement</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Sharkey, and I don't believe he</seg><seg type="columnLine">will improve in future bouts, either.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This may seem like a radical state-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. I don't think it is.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Usually, when a boxer fails to better</seg><seg type="columnLine">his performance, it is because he lacks</seg><seg type="columnLine">intelligence; or because he is stubborn</seg><seg type="columnLine">and won't accept advice. I don't think</seg><seg type="columnLine">either of these things is true in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">German's case. He has brains and is</seg><seg type="columnLine">well educated, even though he isn't, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">my opinion, a smart fighter. The draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">back is the injury he suffered last win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. If he, as I think likely, fails to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">ahead, the cause will be physical rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than mental.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before the Sharkey-Schmeling fight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I picked the sailor to win. It seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me that he was a better boxer, a better</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitter with both hands, and had a more</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural ring intelligence despite his hot</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperament and likelihood of going</seg><seg type="columnLine">off at a tangent. Schmeling's perform-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance in training was so mediocre and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sharkey's so brilliant that my belief</seg><seg type="columnLine">was further strengthened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Nothing that occurred in the fight it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self tended to change my opinion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sharkey was far in the lead when he</seg><seg type="columnLine">accidentally hooked that low left into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Max's body. In my opinion, had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight continued, the American would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only have won by a wide margin, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">might have knocked Schmeling out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There is nothing to bolster the conten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion that Sharkey was tiring as Max</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew stronger. Jack was boxing coolly</seg><seg type="columnLine">and well. As a matter oi fact, he never</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked better than he did that night,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though some of his brilliance may have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been due to the Uhlan's mediocre per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formance. Of course, fifteen rounds is</seg><seg type="columnLine">a long way to go and lots of things can</seg><seg type="columnLine">happen, but certainly all the evidence so</seg><seg type="columnLine">far produced is in Sharkey's favor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN they meet again, just about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same thing will happen--bar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring the foul. Schmeling will undoubt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edly turn in the same sort of perform-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance he did the first time, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed then that it wasn't good enough.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is enough, of course, for the Riskos</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Paulinos and Von Porats, but not</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough for a fellow like Sharkey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A first-class fighter must have some</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of defense. It may be a defense</seg><seg type="columnLine">built on first-rate boxing skill such as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Corbett's. It may be a weaving, bob-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bing style such as Dempsey had, but de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fense of some sort must be there. Max</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed little ability to block. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">pinned 011 a left jab and was wide open</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a right cross to the jaw. The few</seg><seg type="columnLine">times that Jack let loose his vicious</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooks for the body, they landed, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some months ago in Fight Stories I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrote an imaginary account of a fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">between Schmeling and Dempsey. Had</seg><seg type="columnLine">they been together in the ring last June,</seg><seg type="columnLine">my story would have been turned into</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact by what happened. Jack has lost</seg><seg type="columnLine">much of his speed, but still has a ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible power in his fists. Old as he is, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been hitting Schmeling as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sliarkey did, the Black Uhlan would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have finished 011 the floor, completely</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked out. Max could not have kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">away from Dempsey's blows, and those</seg><seg type="columnLine">blows would have ruined him in spite</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all his stamina and courage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Tf a fighter lacks defensive ability, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have a furious, ceaseless attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">that takes the place of it. Stanley</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ketchel had. He kept firing with both</seg><seg type="columnLine">8</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hands all the time he was in there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ketchel hit so hard and fast that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other fellow didn't have much chance to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be aggressive himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As an example of a light hitter whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack was his defense, it is only neces-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sary to cite Harry Greb. The Pitts-</seg><seg type="columnLine">burgh Windmill cuffed and slapped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit from every angle, and let loose a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred blows a minute. No single</seg><seg type="columnLine">one was dangerous in itself, but they</seg><seg type="columnLine">came in such a shower that his rivals</seg><seg type="columnLine">were continually off balance and swept</seg><seg type="columnLine">away in the flood of blows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Schmeling, in his attack, is neither a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ketchel nor a Greb. He cannot keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">up such a sustained and furious volley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He hits pretty well with either hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">both his left hook and right cross hav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing lots of power. But, for all that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Max isn't a really good hitter, for he</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacks accuracy against a man who</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows how to box. It didn't mean so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much that he was able to land so easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">on Johnny Risko and Paulino Uzcudun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They have always been targets, even</seg><seg type="columnLine">for less accomplished men than Max</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schmeling. It was lucky for him that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was born in a generation when there</seg><seg type="columnLine">are so few good fighting men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Black Uhlan is a strong fellow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not as strong as Sharkey, who</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">handled him rather easily in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinches. Schmeling has not yet become</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good man in the clinches. He doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know all that a champion should about</seg><seg type="columnLine">this important phase of his business.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It may sound as though I am rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard on Max. I don't mean to be, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">we can't be too easy on a champion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world. He should be an expert, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dubitably the best of all who play his</seg><seg type="columnLine">game. But Schmeling isn't. He is</seg><seg type="columnLine">really still in the experimental stage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even though he is recognized as king of</seg><seg type="columnLine">all the fighters in the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I can say nothing against his courage</seg><seg type="columnLine">or his hitting power, his colorful per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sonality or his ability to keep going in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the face of punishment. These are as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sets that a champion must have, but in</seg><seg type="columnLine">themselves they are not enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he hasn't the boxing skill that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have made him any sort of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">match for Tunney, nor a wallop that</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have permitted him to meet</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dempsey on even grounds. To go even</seg><seg type="columnLine">a bit lower in the fistic scale, he hasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough all-around ability to cope with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sharkey. Mark my word: When these</seg><seg type="columnLine">two men meet again, the German will</seg><seg type="columnLine">take the zvorst thumping of his life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He may be champion of the world--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in name only.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">But, On the Other Hand--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm Stringing With Schmeling"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So says James P.

Shattered were the conventional</seg><seg type="columnLine">illusions; gone the mistaken belief that</seg><seg type="columnLine">a new king's life in the realm of sport</seg><seg type="columnLine">opens with a dash and a splurge and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wild riot of excitement and uncontrolled</seg><seg type="columnLine">celebration.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With Schmeling were his manager,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Joe Jacobs, fiery-faced and highly ner-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vous ; Max Machon, quiet-spoken, pen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sive German, trainer, pal, adviser and</seg><seg type="columnLine">friend; Mushky Jackson, associate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schmeling's during their training camp</seg><seg type="columnLine">life at Endicott, N.

Like many other</seg><seg type="columnLine">critics, I was eager to get Schmeling's</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediate reactions to the possession of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a title as rich in tradition as it is in</seg><seg type="columnLine">financial rewards. It happened that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the first to intrude upon the new</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion's solitude, for that is exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">what it was.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no popping of corks. No</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">blatant turmoil. No overwhelming crush</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hero-worshipers to the throne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Quite the opposite.

A quiet little</seg><seg type="columnLine">family gathering, eh?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was as Schmeling wanted it. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">likes quiet and seclusion; it is the nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal desire of a stolid, retiring, modest</seg><seg type="columnLine">disposition. He was unmarked, physi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally, at the time. He admitted no pain</seg><seg type="columnLine">from Sharkey's blows, and he showed</seg><seg type="columnLine">no bruise. But the following day he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">a growth about the size of a pigeon's</seg><seg type="columnLine">egg between the eyes and directly above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the nose, as a reminder of the battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">which brought him the title. And there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a little discoloration about the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">eye, at the bridge of the nose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I mention this post-battle setting be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause it is a natural part of the story</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a distinct, undeniable reflection of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of Schmeling's nature which is his</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatest ring characteristic. Though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed no surface marks, he was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain nevertheless.

He was not advised to keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">his chin up as an inviting target. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned to take what Sharkey had to</seg><seg type="columnLine">offer in the early rounds to test</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sharkey's emotional reaction. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been suspected that if Sharkey failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">early in a destructive assault, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">grow lethargic to the point of indiffer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence. His morale would fall and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperament would assert itself to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own destruction. In the vernacular of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring, it was suspected by some, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">boldly proclaimed by others, particularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">those of the Schmeling camp, that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sharkey would lose heart if he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not knock Schmeling over with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">death-dealing, fiery outburst.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This is no reflection on Sharkey's</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage. His fearlessness in battle is</seg><seg type="columnLine">established. Rather, it is an indefinable</seg><seg type="columnLine">psychological condition, a temperamen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tal reaction which unknowingly over-</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes a fighter who sees his best efforts</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasted. Few fighters are constructed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to overcome the disheartening experi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence of pounding away without result.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In his appraisal of Sharkey's princi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pal weakness, Schmeling had past per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formances on which to base his conclu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions. He knew that Johnny Risko had</seg><seg type="columnLine">beaten Sharkey at an important time in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the career of the Boston heavyweight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was aware that Tom Heeney, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">immovable rock from "Down Under,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">had cast a painful shadow across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sharkey path in another critical bout,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which ended in a draw. He knew that</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was Sharkey's weakness, and, for all</seg><seg type="columnLine">I know, always will be his weakness, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fail when success means so much to him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">notwithstanding that success in this lat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est instance meant the realization of all</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dreams.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps this very responsibility can</seg><seg type="columnLine">be calculated to contribute to the col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lapse of a Sliarkey battle plan when you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know the temperamental Sharkey. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was the sting of that raucous jeer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to which he was subjected as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the ring for battle, the Stars and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stripes cloaking his shoulders over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blue dressing gown he wears with its</seg><seg type="columnLine">naval insignia, "U.S.N." in gold letters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This reception for Sharkey, an Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ican before a home crowd, about to</seg><seg type="columnLine">launch a battle for a title which has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been almost exclusively an American</seg><seg type="columnLine">possession since the beginning of mod-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ern boxing, moved even Schmeling to</seg><seg type="columnLine">sympathetic impulse.

To</seg><seg type="columnLine">the last-named condition Schmeling nat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">urally experienced a slight nervousness.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But this disappeared when introductions</seg><seg type="columnLine">were over and the men were called to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then Schmeling was the methodically</seg><seg type="columnLine">trained fighter, waging a battle for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause. And his cause was the destruc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of Sharkey and the acquisition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world's heavyweight championship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">PHYSICALLY there was little dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ference between the men. Schmel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing entered the ring something of an un-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">known quantity who was yet known to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a certain degree. He had had five battles</seg><seg type="columnLine">in American rings, after coming, unher-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alded and unsung, to this country in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring of 1928. In succession he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked out Joe Monte, at a time when</seg><seg type="columnLine">110 other heavyweights were knocking</seg><seg type="columnLine">out Monte; gained a decision over Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sekyra in a bout in which the Dayton,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ohio, lad spent the night retreating, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">strategically, but desperately and dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">orderly; knocked out Pietro Corri in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, and Johnny Risko in nine, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">battered his way to a decision over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rugged, stout-hearted Paulino, in fifteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounds of systematic, plodding fighting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Schmeling's gamble was an invitation</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Sharkey to do his best in the first five</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounds. It was as if Schmeling said to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, "I will let him hit me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything early in the fight, and if I</seg><seg type="columnLine">go down and out, so be it. But, I know</seg><seg type="columnLine">I will not go down, nor will I go out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for I am capable of taking his best with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out wilting. Then, after this disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointment he must feel in the failure of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his early work, I will go after Sharkey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he will be mine."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sharkey's past record supported</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schmeling's confidence in this respect.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The German lad had been expertly ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vised by Manager Jacobs of Sharkey's</seg><seg type="columnLine">suspected weaknesses, of which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief was his uncontrollable tempera-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It has been held that Sharkey's battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Jack Dempsey back in 1927 of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fers the best illustration of this condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. It will be recalled that Sharkey,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a fiery outburst of fighting in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening round, had what then remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the once invincible Dempsey reeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">and staggering around the ring under a</seg><seg type="columnLine">volley of powerful right- and left-hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">drives to the jaw. It looked as if Demp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sey must be knocked out in the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, and the great crowd looked on</seg><seg type="columnLine">in amazement tinged with sorrow for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the threatened fall of a ring idol.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Dempsey survived that danger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous situation, and Sharkey's failure had</seg><seg type="columnLine">an unfavorable reaction upon him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">12</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">consequence was that Dempsey plodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">blindly on, fighting against the demor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alized Sharkey until the seventh round,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when his blows aimed for the body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which I have always maintained were</seg><seg type="columnLine">foul, caused the ex-gob's collapse; this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was aided, as he crumpled, by a left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hook to the jaw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The late Leo P. Flynn, for whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">judgment I have always had the highest</seg><seg type="columnLine">respect, said that "heart" won that bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle for Dempsey, disagreeing violently</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me when I protested that Sharkey</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been fouled four times with right-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand drives aimed at the body. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he referred to "heart," Flynn did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not mean that Sharkey was a coward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but that Dempsey was too indifferent to</seg><seg type="columnLine">punishing blows from the ex-gob, who,</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon realizing this, became discouraged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dempsey was a rushing, tearing, fear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less type of fighter, whose object was</seg><seg type="columnLine">to accomplish the downfall of a foe in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minimum time and with a maximum</seg><seg type="columnLine">of satisfaction. He represented a type</seg><seg type="columnLine">against which Sharkey always has had</seg><seg type="columnLine">trouble. The cases of Johnny Risko</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tom Ileeney are advanced in sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">port of this contention. Ileeney built</seg><seg type="columnLine">a career which brought him the title</seg><seg type="columnLine">bout against Gene Tunney, on his fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing heart almost exclusively. He held</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sharkey to a draw simply because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed at him with a consistency that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was discouraging to the ex-sailorman,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and caused Sharkey to forget what he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew about boxing and straight, accu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate, forceful hitting, in his alarm.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnny Risko was another case in</seg><seg type="columnLine">point. The Cleveland ex-baker-boy has</seg><seg type="columnLine">the true fighter's heart. He overcame</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sharkey more by the storm of his fu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rious, ever-pressing style than by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">force of his blows, for Risko is a noto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riously weak hitter--a puncher who</seg><seg type="columnLine">punishes without crushing. Risko won</seg><seg type="columnLine">a decision over Sharkey and robbed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boston heavyweight of a promised</seg><seg type="columnLine">match against Gene Tunney for the title,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and only because Sharkey could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring himself to the belief that a stead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ied, coolly calculated battle would avail</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">against a fighter of this type. Indeed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Risko was so busy on the attack in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle that Sharkey, being constituted</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperamentally as he is, had no time</seg><seg type="columnLine">for thought of an effective counter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">offensive. He just wanted to protect</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself as best he could against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flailing arms of an annoying foe.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It has been argued that Sharkey was</seg><seg type="columnLine">misinformed in his corner as to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">progress of this battle--that he was told</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was leading on points and that vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory was assured, when, as a matter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact, the reverse was the case. But I</seg><seg type="columnLine">place no stock in this explanation, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the simple reason that any man engaged</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a battle knows when he is and when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he is not getting the best of a foe.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Knows it better, indeed, than do many</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the onlookers, because he is in there</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking them and giving them and feel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing an opponent's reaction to blows as</seg><seg type="columnLine">he experiences his own.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SCHMELING had satisfied himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in advance of the battle that stolid</seg><seg type="columnLine">resistance to a Sharkey fire, even with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a determined counter, would ruin</seg><seg type="columnLine">the morale of the American bidder for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the title. He had been told, and it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been impressed upon him, that Orlando</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reverberi had floored Sharkey and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quintin Romero-Rojas had knocked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ex-gob. These facts were particu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">larly stressed for the benefit of the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vading German, and the consequence</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that Schmeling's supreme confi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dence in his own ability was increased</seg><seg type="columnLine">proportionately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I hold that Sharkey's and Schmeling's</seg><seg type="columnLine">bouts with Risko offer the most accu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate indication of their relative fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">qualities. The Risko who scampered</seg><seg type="columnLine">off with a decision over Sharkey in 1928</seg><seg type="columnLine">was knocked out on February 1, 1929,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in nine rounds by Schmeling. The com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parison on actual results is not the guid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing influence in basing deductions, nec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">essarily. But the meter of each battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">offers a concrete basis in favor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schmeling. Whereas Risko simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">overwhelmed Sharkey, the Cleveland</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm Stringing With Schmeling"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">13</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">heavyweight went down to his first and</seg><seg type="columnLine">only knockout at the hands of S'chmel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, at a time when Risko was leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">on points.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For some unexplained reason, the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Risko was leading on points at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he was knocked out is advanced by</seg><seg type="columnLine">many as proof that Schmeling accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plished Risko's downfall with a lucky</seg><seg type="columnLine">punch or a succession of fluke punches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is recalled that Schmeling had Risko</seg><seg type="columnLine">"on the deck," in the first round of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggle; that the German lad floored</seg><seg type="columnLine">his American rival with an early punch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">only to have Risko arise and thereafter</seg><seg type="columnLine">proceed to subject Schmeling to a char-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acteristic Risko lambasting which did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not end until Schmeling knocked out the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Clevelander in the ninth round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In this interpretation, Schmeling is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the victim of a grave injustice. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting determination and methodical</seg><seg type="columnLine">style are not accorded the consideration</seg><seg type="columnLine">they deserve. When he came from be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind to score a knockout, Schmeling ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complished the unusual, and demon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strated his ability to assimilate punish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment without becoming discouraged.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He felt that he could topple Risko when</seg><seg type="columnLine">next he hit him squarely on a vulner-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able spot, and was content to plod along</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the opportunity to hit that vulner-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able spot presented itself. It made no</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference to Schmeling that he exposed</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to seven solid rounds of punish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. It was his plan and his style,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he did exactly what he calculated he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could and would do. And he had his</seg><seg type="columnLine">reward in a victory which projected him</seg><seg type="columnLine">forthwith into the front ranks of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">title-seekers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A contrast is glaringly presented.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sharkey, with every incentive to urge</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on in his fight against Risko, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not overcome his greatest weakness--</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperamental emotion. Schmeling, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other hand, with victory within his</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasp in the first round, refused to be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come excited and press his advantage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rather, he bided his time, protected him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self against a possible injury to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands in punching at a carefully cov-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ered and protected antagonist, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">claimed his reward when it was long</seg><seg type="columnLine">overdue.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Paulino battle offers another con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trast. Schmeling accepted a match with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Spaniard at a time when Paulino</seg><seg type="columnLine">was being advanced as one of the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">dangerous of the title contenders. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">then proceeded to batter and pound and</seg><seg type="columnLine">belabor Paulino through fifteen rounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a style and at a pace to which Paulino</seg><seg type="columnLine">was popularly supposed to be best ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">customed. Sharkey never would fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paulino.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Paulino battle established Schmel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing as the purely methodical fighter he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is. The Risko fight demonstrated</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schmeling's ability to come from behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">and win. And the combination justified</seg><seg type="columnLine">an advance prediction that Schmeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">would conquer Sharkey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AGAINST Sharkey, Schmeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought a battle that was similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the one he waged against Risko. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was cautious at the start, content to feel</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sharkey out and at the same time dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage the American through an abil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity to take his best blows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And Schmeling proved conclusively</seg><seg type="columnLine">in that third round that he could take</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sharkey's best without wilting. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">hammered mercilessly about the ring, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">so it seemed. In one outburst, still fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">in memory. Sharkey cracked a terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">right to the jaw, and then, as Schmel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing went backward toward the ropes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaped after him, pumping one, two,</seg><seg type="columnLine">three more powerful right-hand drives</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the jaw, face and head. Schmeling</seg><seg type="columnLine">said after the battle that he was in 110</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger. But his appearance under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fire justified a contrary illusion. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schmeling was rocked and stung and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt. But he lived through this storm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and through Sharkey's successive</seg><seg type="columnLine">punching outbursts until near the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the round, when he resumed his ag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gressive tactics and hooked a left to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sharkey's Jjody and crossed a grazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">right to the jaw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The finish came in the fourth, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">14</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">prevented a demonstration of the theory</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schmeling was trying to put in practice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Perhaps I should say the finish delayed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a demonstration of Schmeling's theory</seg><seg type="columnLine">that an undying spirit, unflinching de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termination and a fighting heart that</seg><seg type="columnLine">admits of no reverse, will ride to vic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory--because I am convinced that in an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other match Schmeling will knock out</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sharkey, or beat him so badly there will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be no room for doubt as to the German's</seg><seg type="columnLine">superiority.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Schmeling's own account of that third</seg><seg type="columnLine">round is pertinent. After the battle, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">German lad said, in effect:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I knew I could beat Sharkey after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the third round. He gave me every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing he had, and I was not hurt. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit me one clean punch on the chin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">here''--indicating a point on the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">side of his jawbone--"and I felt it, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell you. But I was not hurt. My legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and my head were what you call O. K.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And before the round was over, I was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting him back, rushing at him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitting him to the body and to the jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">with my own punches. When I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my corner after the round, Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jacobs put the smelling salts under my</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose, but I pushed them away and said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">'That is not necessary, Joe; I am all</seg><seg type="columnLine">right.'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "When I came up for the fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, I felt that Sharkey was not the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same man.

I</seg><seg type="columnLine">cannot say what, but there was some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing missing, the way he was hitting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">me. His punches were not so strong,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he did not seem the same. Maybe</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie had lost heart when I did not go down</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the third round. That was the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">he impressed me. And I knew that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had him where I wanted him, and that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I would get him later on."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I am impressed by Schmeling's ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">count of his experiences in the third</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, which we all thought so threat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening for the German lad. He bespeaks</seg><seg type="columnLine">quietly a supreme confidence in his abil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ity to assimilate punishment, as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his punching power--and it cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">be denied that he hits as hard as Shar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">key, if not harder. He is more deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mined than ever, whereas Sharkey has</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause for further discouragement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That he experienced no lessening of</seg><seg type="columnLine">confidence, is reflected in Schmeling's</seg><seg type="columnLine">prompt decision to give Sharkey an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other chance, and without delay. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">this, Schmeling admittedly is in a class</seg><seg type="columnLine">by himself, for the custom is to capital-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ize on the title without regard to public</seg><seg type="columnLine">opinion. Schmeling could have done</seg><seg type="columnLine">this without ridicule, for he won the</seg><seg type="columnLine">title on a decision which called a foul</seg><seg type="columnLine">that could not be overlooked.

He had observed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mental fog that, sooner or later,</seg><seg type="columnLine">envelops the hit-and-take-it boys.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tommy, he does the fighting," he con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded.

Observing closely, picking up</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring gossip wherever it was to be found,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sharpening his wits in constant com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">petition, he avoided dangerous op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponents, secured for Tommy as near a</seg><seg type="columnLine">collection of set-ups as a prelim boy ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">gets, and gradually raised his demands</seg><seg type="columnLine">until Tommy was fighting every fort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night in the semi-finals and several times</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the main bouts, and he battled, ver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bally, with Rosenthal until that hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boiled, but sagacious, individual was</seg><seg type="columnLine">paying the Dugan brothers $250 a fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Which, in the Third Ward, is Important</seg><seg type="columnLine">Money--with capitals, please.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of course, Mike took half of every</seg><seg type="columnLine">purse, and equally of course, Tommy</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned his half over to his mother, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is hard to see just where the profit</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the younger brother came in. How-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, he never stopped to analyze that</seg><seg type="columnLine">question; he wTas earning money and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother was taking care of the house,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so why shouldn't he hand it over to her?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Did Mike turn his half into the family</seg><seg type="columnLine">budget? Laughter from the gallery!</seg><seg type="columnLine">The elder brother plucked the tail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feathers from every eagle and banked</seg><seg type="columnLine">what was left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BOUT the time that Tommy</seg><seg type="columnLine">achieved the distinction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">main bout, he began to notice at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringside a pleasant-faced little black-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haired Irish girl. She occupied the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat at every fight, accompanied by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">young man about her own age, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked like her brother, and she watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">closely, seeming to follow Tommy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortunes with interest and applauding</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a manner half enthusiastic, half bash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When this had gone on for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">three or four battles, Tommy ventured</seg><seg type="columnLine">to look directly at her between two</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounds, and finding her looking at him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he dared a grin. To his utter confusion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">20</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">she smiled and nodded in return,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereat he turned away, overwhelmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ''Who you grinning at, ape?" de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded Mike, following the direction of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy's eyes. "That skirt in the blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">dress ? Can it, dumb-bell, can it! Pay</seg><seg type="columnLine">attention to what you're doing, 'r this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Goldman's going to knock you for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">row of loops."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Tommy was so inspired by that</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile, by the fact that a good-looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl had noticed him, that he knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mr. Goldman, if not for a row of loops,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least for the count of ten. The in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluence of a good woman can lift even</seg><seg type="columnLine">a pork-and-beaner above himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Later, on the way home, Tommy</seg><seg type="columnLine">casually remarked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder who she is ?" He was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious of speaking aloud, but Mike</seg><seg type="columnLine">picked up the words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "S'till thinking about that fluff?" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">inquired, with a slight sneer.

You leave 'em be!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not giving much credence to Mike's</seg><seg type="columnLine">words, Tommy said nothing, but a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">days later, while buying some handker-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chiefs ill the Five-and-Ten, he found</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself standing near the girl of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ringside. He tried to nerve himself to</seg><seg type="columnLine">speak, but couldn't, and was turning</seg><seg type="columnLine">away when she happened to turn toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, and their eyes met. She looked for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an instant, then smiled a bit doubtfully,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and by a tremendous effort of will</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy succeeded in removing his cap.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He didn't realize it, but he looked so</seg><seg type="columnLine">wistful--like a good dog that's trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard to understand--that she took pity</seg><seg type="columnLine">on him; it may be that she was en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">couraged by the fact that he was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">frightened than she. At all events, she</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled again, extended her hand, blushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">charmingly and said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's Mr. Dugan, isn't it?"'</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes'm," babbled Tommy.

The girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had been waiting on him looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">after him, shrugged her shoulders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and laid his bundle on the shelf behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He'll prob'ly be back for it by and</seg><seg type="columnLine">by," she commented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tommy escorted his lady of the ring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side to her home, where, saying good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bye, she invited him to come around and</seg><seg type="columnLine">see her some time, if he cared to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tonight?" inquired Mr. Dugan, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing if not direct.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She seemed mildly amused at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">prompt acceptance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm sorry, but I have a date for to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">night.

For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first time in his life, clothes assumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a more glorified aspect than mere cover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for the body; they became a medium</seg><seg type="columnLine">of decoration. And, as the boys say,</seg><seg type="columnLine">how!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tommy revolved affairs in his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">that evening, and next day, when re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leased from bondage to Mike, he went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his mother and asked for fifty dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars. Mrs. Dugan immediately threw</seg><seg type="columnLine">four conniption fits, but in the end re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lented.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, ye're a good b'y, Tommy," she</seg><seg type="columnLine">said.

"Tommy, b'y, it's not for</seg><seg type="columnLine">drink, is it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He assured her that it was for a suit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of clothes, and she gave him the money,</seg><seg type="columnLine">along with an affectionate love-tap</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would have staggered the ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary man, but only made her son laugh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tommy then -betook himself to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothing store where he collected an out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fit that would have made Solomon in</seg><seg type="columnLine">all his glory look like the last rose of</seg><seg type="columnLine">summer, left blooming alone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tommy had his gorgeousness packed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">took it home, and two nights later ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rayed himself like no lily of the field</seg><seg type="columnLine">that ever was, and with all the modest</seg><seg type="columnLine">inconspicuousness of a lighthouse, pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sented himself at the lady's home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rose Garland received him with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">becoming mixture of shyness and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleasure, introducing him to her father,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who kept a small but flourishing grocery</seg><seg type="columnLine">store on a side street, and to her mother,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the comfortable and pleasant wife of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">small grocer. Also to her brother Jack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who drove a truck, and, being an ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent patron of sport, was staggered by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the honor done the family.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not to drag things out, Tommy in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stituted a campaign directed at Rose's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">affections. He was not conscious of</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing anything of the sort, being at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tracted to the girl as involuntarily as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the steel is drawn to the magnet. At all</seg><seg type="columnLine">events he spent every possible evening</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Garland home, eventually being</seg><seg type="columnLine">accepted as Rose's steady.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her parents were at first inclined to</seg><seg type="columnLine">demur at her intimacy with a prize-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighter, for they held the not uncommon</seg><seg type="columnLine">belief that a fighter is a noisy, profane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunken, brawling savage. This be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lief, like most ready-made ones, is true</seg><seg type="columnLine">in only a very small percentage of</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases; the average fighter is a quiet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">modest, and extremely well-behaved</seg><seg type="columnLine">youth, enthusiastic in his profession as</seg><seg type="columnLine">any doctor or minister, and far less apt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to engage in miscellaneous brawls than</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ordinary citizen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This reluctance is partly due to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fact that fighting is his business, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't mix business with pleasure;</seg><seg type="columnLine">partly to the fear that, fighting with bare</seg><seg type="columnLine">knuckles, he may injure his hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">so incapacitate himself for the ring; and</seg><seg type="columnLine">partly to a chivalrous feeling that it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">unfair for a trained fighter to attack an</seg><seg type="columnLine">untrained man.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rose's family came to understand that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy was a respectable citizen, pain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully shy, but polite and respectful to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his elders, and he shortly became a wel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come visitor. Jack Garland, to be sure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hugely puffed up over being on in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">timate terms with a local celebrity, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">developed a habit, in conversation with</seg><seg type="columnLine">friends, of dragging Tommy's name in</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the ears.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I was talking to Tommy Dugan last</seg><seg type="columnLine">night--" "Tommy Dugan was around</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our house last night," and--</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Tommy Dugan was telling me--" And</seg><seg type="columnLine">so on, until it becamc general knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">in at least one of Harlow's circles that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy Dugan, the fighter, was keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">company with Rose Garland.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ABOUT two months after the affair</seg><seg type="columnLine">began, Tommy was working out</seg><seg type="columnLine">one day in the Dugan barn-gymnasium.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had gone through his chest-weighti</seg><seg type="columnLine">22</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">drill, had punched the light bag and</seg><seg type="columnLine">skipped rope, and now was shadow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxing with an imaginary opponent,</seg><seg type="columnLine">under the watchful eye of his fraternal</seg><seg type="columnLine">trainer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," said Mike, suddenly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Rest."

"What's this I hear about you</seg><seg type="columnLine">running around with a fluff?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tommy colored and kept his eyes on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "She ain't no fluff," he objected.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"She's a swell girl."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Banana oil!" sneered Mike, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cynic.

For all that, though, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not an unattractive face; good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">natured friendliness counts for more</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the regular features and smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">complexion of a movie he-doll.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Tommy was concerned neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the insult to his looks nor with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aspersion on his intelligence; he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">overcome with embarrassment at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reference to marriage, for this was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own private, pet, beautiful dream.

Rose promptly flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">to defend her inarticulate caller, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">delightful oratorical battle ensued, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rose the victor. For once in his life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike was out-talked. Marveling at this</seg><seg type="columnLine">phenomenon, he came off the boil, took</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chair, and spent the evening chatting</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Rose, while Tommy sat and</seg><seg type="columnLine">listened.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This was the first of many evenings</seg><seg type="columnLine">that the invader passed with the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">two. Briefly, Mike found himself as</seg><seg type="columnLine">much taken with Rose as Tommy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">--there is no denying that she was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">attractive youngster--and lie spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to make her like him, not with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was a smooth talker, was clever</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to talk about her rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, and in a good cause could spend</seg><seg type="columnLine">money without apparent pain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He managed to date her up for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of occasions without Tommy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he was wise enough to know that</seg><seg type="columnLine">abusing the kid would do himself no</seg><seg type="columnLine">good with Rose, so he spoke well of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">when absent, and when Tommy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the party he did not, as was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">24</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">custom, treat the younger hoy like an</seg><seg type="columnLine">imbecile chimpanzee. On the contrary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was reasonably polite and considerate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so Tommy found himself torn between</seg><seg type="columnLine">jealousy and pleasure; on the one hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he feared and resented the invasion, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other, it was delightful to have</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike, of whom he was genuinely fond,</seg><seg type="columnLine">treating him like a human being.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As for Rose, she treated both boys</seg><seg type="columnLine">exactly alike, sat between them at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">movies, insisted that Tommy go along</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Mike proposed a trip to the Ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cadia Amusement Park, and showed ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solutely 110 preference; she was unfail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly and uniformly nice to both.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She did discriminate to the extent of</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing oftener with Mike, for when it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to the light fantastic, Tommy</seg><seg type="columnLine">owned two left feet; but she made up</seg><seg type="columnLine">for it by sitting as close as possible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy's corner when he fought, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheering loudly at every success. No,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was not a coquette; she was just a</seg><seg type="columnLine">young, happy, healthy girl, who liked a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     CHAPTER IV</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     Some Pickings!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SIX or eight months went by in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion, with Tommy going on</seg><seg type="columnLine">every fortnight at the Armory, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike gradually working his prices</seg><seg type="columnLine">higher and higher until the Dugan</seg><seg type="columnLine">brothers were drawing down $800 a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight, and their mother, the envy of her</seg><seg type="columnLine">set, was driving a sedan of a popular</seg><seg type="columnLine">but inexpensive make.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Isidor Rosenthal knew his business,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tommy Dugan was the best draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing card he had; the S. R. O. sign was</seg><seg type="columnLine">out every time he fought, for Tommy</seg><seg type="columnLine">not only gave a good show, but shared</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gift of personal appeal with Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dempsey, Babe Ruth, and other no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tables.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was something fascinating</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his good-humored grin, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">chunky body, his queer shuffling gait,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his absolute concentration on the job,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his obvious love for the game. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the fellows whom he beat liked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, for he was utterly free from any</seg><seg type="columnLine">touch of animosity or meanness, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was genuinely distressed if one of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">was hurt, though he never pulled his</seg><seg type="columnLine">punches on that account.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> One day early in May, Mike came to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brother with an announcement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Listen!" he said. "I got you</seg><seg type="columnLine">matched with Sailor Parker, what</seg><seg type="columnLine">kayoed Rocco Bianchi. and you know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what that means."

First</seg><seg type="columnLine">place, I jacked Rosenthal up to paying</seg><seg type="columnLine">sixteen yards for the go--double what</seg><seg type="columnLine">we been getting. Next place, he's go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to have the guy what's matchmaker</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the Garden there, and if we win</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll get to go on over there. Not in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the main bouts at first, o' course, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's a starter. And some pickings, Kid,</seg><seg type="columnLine">some pickings! And all that means you</seg><seg type="columnLine">gotta train like you never done before."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm always in shape," Tommy of-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeh, for these palookas you been</seg><seg type="columnLine">meeting.

He ain't never been kayoed yet;</seg><seg type="columnLine">even the champ couldn't flatten him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And there ain't many holds decisions</seg><seg type="columnLine">over him neither. Believe me, dumb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell, you're going to train, and I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean maybe J"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mike spoke the truth; he put Tommy</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the stiffest course of sprouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter had ever met. Road-work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rope-skipping, bag-punching, shadow-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sons of Sock</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">25</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">boxing, working out with sparring part-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ners--Mike loosened up and hired three</seg><seg type="columnLine">tough prelim boys for this occasion--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy went through them all. And in</seg><seg type="columnLine">spite of driving him so, Mike did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">make the mistake so many inexperienced</seg><seg type="columnLine">trainers stumble over, of letting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">principal go stale.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Watching like a hawk, he eased off</seg><seg type="columnLine">in time, for he seemed to know by in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stinct when Tommy would be on edge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stopped just short of letting him go</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. An occasional cigarette or ice-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cream soda or trip to an amusement</seg><seg type="columnLine">park--these and other things brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy to the big night in as perfect</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical condition as any human being</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever knew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Whatever else one might say about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike, he was a born genius at train-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, and this fact was recognized be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond the limits of Harlow. Unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Mike, some of the big men in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">game had been watching his work with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy, considering the possibilities in</seg><seg type="columnLine">case he should decide to move up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In this work of preparation, Tom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">my's imperturbable nature helped vastly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for he seldom worried; his mind was</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost always at ease. This was partly</seg><seg type="columnLine">due to his unemotional make-up, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">partly to a resolve he had taken. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had for a time been bothered over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike's attentions to Rose, but he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached a decision that set aside this</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry. His share of the purse would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be eight hundred dollars, there would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be more coming in, eight hundred dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars a fortnight was twenty thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight hundred a year--and his mother</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a bit saved up. So Tommy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">decided on a momentous step--contin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gent on his beating the Sailor. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to ask Rose to marry him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THIS resolution cost him no little</seg><seg type="columnLine">debate, but when once it was taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was firmly taken, and he set about</seg><seg type="columnLine">composing his speech of proposal. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">this occupied what time he had left from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his training, kept his mind busy, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">prevented any possible worry over the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">bout from creeping in. Nor, strangely</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, did it cause him any worry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">another sort. He was no egotist, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was so deeply in love with Rose that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">never occurred to him that he might</seg><seg type="columnLine">fail; he could not conceive of an af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fection so deep as his not meeting a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sponse, and his only concern was to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">press himself in language worthy of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl he adored.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A lover is proverbially humble and</seg><seg type="columnLine">dubious of his chances, and it may seem</seg><seg type="columnLine">odd that Tommy was so confident; still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is the truth, and the oddest thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it is that his confidence was wholly</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacking in conceit; it was the child-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">simplicity of a one-track mind. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">there it was; let him win from Sailor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parker, and just as sure as the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes up in the morning he was going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to ask Rose to marry him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They'd have a home somewhere on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of town, and a bit of a lawn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a litle garden in back, and a car,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a couple of kids, and he'd come</seg><seg type="columnLine">home and turn his purses over to her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and she'd keep the house, and they'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">be happy all their lives. Gee! It'd be</seg><seg type="columnLine">grand!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IN this spirit he proceeded to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Armory on the great night. Mike</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be handling him, Jack Garland</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be in his corner--a great honor</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Jack, who appreciated it fully--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rose would be just outside the ring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And when the fight was over Rosenthal</seg><seg type="columnLine">would hand Mike $1,600, and Mike</seg><seg type="columnLine">would give him half, and then--</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At five minutes after ten, one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">runners of the Harlow Sporting Club</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck his head in the dressing-room</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, saying:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let's go, Tommy. Barnato's got</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wilson pretty well softened up; he</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't last more'n another round."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy slid off the' rubbing-table,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathered his bathrobe about him, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">started out. A roar from the crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">notified him that Wilson was through,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with Mike and Jack at his elbows</seg><seg type="columnLine">he moved briskly down the aisle. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">26</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">beaten fighter, supported by his han-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dlers, passed them, his head lolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakly from side to side, and Mike</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned at the spectacle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's the way they'll be taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">Parker out in a few minutes," he said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerking his thumb toward Wilson, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy nodded, his eyes full of pity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ring, the white faces shading off</seg><seg type="columnLine">into obscurity, the glare of light on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canvas, the gray haze of tobacco smoke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bandages, tape, and gloves--all these</seg><seg type="columnLine">were an old story to Tommy Dugan, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he glanced about him, passing over them</seg><seg type="columnLine">indifferently to look for the bright face</seg><seg type="columnLine">and smooth black hair of Rose. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was, in her usual place, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded and smiled at her, feeling a curi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous thrill as she nodded and smiled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">return. When this was over-- But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">referee was beckoning the fighters to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center, and Tommy and Mike went</seg><seg type="columnLine">forward to meet Parker and his man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ager; this, too, was old stuff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "--and make it clean and hard," con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cluded the official. Tommy had spent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time in sizing up his opponent rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than in listening to what he knew by</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Back in the corner, Mike stripped off</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bathrobe, saying:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now mind, this guy's clever, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">can hit. You gotta keep forcing him all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time; try to box him, and your</seg><seg type="columnLine">name's mush. You gotta fight him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Keep after him all the time, and don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">give him no chance to get set, see?" .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tommy nodded; he had heard this a</seg><seg type="columnLine">million times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clang!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE Sailor was as different from</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy as could be. Half a head</seg><seg type="columnLine">taller, smooth-muscled, lithe, active, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">handsome face unmarked by blows, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the ideal of a fast and skillful</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxer, but there was in his features none</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the good nature that distinguished</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy Dugan; thin-lipped, hawk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nosed, with hard gray eyes, it was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruel face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Beautifully put together, he stepped</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">forward with the easy grace of a dancer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and coming within range he planted a</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight left on Tommy's forehead; it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was aimed for the nose, but went a trifle</seg><seg type="columnLine">high. The glove landed with a smack,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a short barking yell came from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd, but Tommy only grinned; that</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of thing could never hurt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ducking his head, Tommy rushed, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Sailor danced easily away, landing a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick one-two as he went, and Tommy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">head rocked under the blows. But they</seg><seg type="columnLine">also were high, and did no harm, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed again, taking two and landing</seg><seg type="columnLine">none; this time the Sailor had got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">range, and connected with Tommy's</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose and jaw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so it went, Tommy trying always</seg><seg type="columnLine">to work in to close quarters, the Sailor</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping always out of range of those</seg><seg type="columnLine">lethal fists and wearing Tommy down</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sharp, stinging blows, none of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which, taken singly, did any perceptible</seg><seg type="columnLine">damage, but whose cumulative effect was</seg><seg type="columnLine">weakening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A hundred times Tommy drove in</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight lefts and rights, swung sav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agely, tried hooks and jabs, but always</seg><seg type="columnLine">his blows were taken on glove or elbow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or passed a head which ducked barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to let the fist go by. And ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">those stinging blows to the face, those</seg><seg type="columnLine">sharp, rib-tearing hooks to the body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">those paralyzing hooks or swings to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the end of the eighth it was clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">to all that the bout could end in only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">fashion; Parker would keep on, strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">as ever, gradually softening the rugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy until the latter was too weak to</seg><seg type="columnLine">land a damaging blow, and then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would tear in, measure his man, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop him. The unbeatable iron man was</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his way. Mike sponged Tommy with</seg><seg type="columnLine">ice-water, massaged him, kept up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steady stream of encouraging words.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You're doing fine, Kid. Keep after</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. You'll get him. One sock's</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to do the business; stay with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him." But somehow Mike's voice</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounded perfunctory; he didn't really</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem to mean what he said--funny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sons of Sock</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">27</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">that! Did Mike think the Sailor was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">going to win?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And with that, a suspicion crept into</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy's mind that all was not well.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Maybe this guy was too fast for him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too clever. And how he could sock!</seg><seg type="columnLine">That last one over the liver--gee, how</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hurt! He'd felt his knees sag when</seg><seg type="columnLine">that blow landed. His face was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffy; looking down his nose, it seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as big as a house. And his right eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">was all bunged up; he could hardly sec</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of it.

Warren</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been taking a thorough beating, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was still strong, and the spectators,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mad with delight, had about concluded</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it would go to a decision, when Ace</seg><seg type="columnLine">Warren staggered out of a flurry of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blows and rocked unsteadily on his feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his left side toward Tommy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Instantly Tommy drove home a</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight right to the angle of the jaw,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the full thrust of his powerful back and</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs behind it, and Warren crashed full-</seg><seg type="columnLine">length to the floor, where he squirmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and twisted in an effort to rise. Tommy</seg><seg type="columnLine">retired to a corner, where he leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the ropes while the referee bent</seg><seg type="columnLine">over Ace, shouting the count to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself heard above the roar that filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Garden.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Warren was game. Savage and</seg><seg type="columnLine">brutal though he wras, lie lacked nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in courage. He got to hands and knees,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rested there, shaking his head to clear</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and at the count of nine was on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, utterly helpless, tottering, hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">down, held erect only by his fighting</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart. Tommy started toward him, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped and looked at the referee. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">official caught Tommy's wrist, lifted his</seg><seg type="columnLine">glove for an instant, and motioned War-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ren's seconds to take the beaten man</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE following afternoon, Tommy</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his manager were closeted in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latter's office.

According to a Chicago</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper one of them occurred recently to George Godfrey, king pin of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">colored heavyweights. The report is that big George was putting on a battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">incognito. George, it seems, has to do that now and then as he is such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror in the ring that few of the top-notch heavyweights will take him on.</seg><seg type="columnLine">So to get fights he has to take on third and fourth-raters. This is all right</seg><seg type="columnLine">with George. He is not exclusive. Knowing what a terror he is, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the third and fourth-raters decline to get into the ring with him if they</seg><seg type="columnLine">know who he is. Hence, the incognito.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The boxer George was meeting in the bout referred to was a husky col-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ored lad. Not knowing George's real identity, he waded into him with zeal</seg><seg type="columnLine">and enthusiasm. As Godfrey hadn't done any serious training for the bout,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he soon found himself having a rough time of it. It was a ten-round bout.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Along about the sixth round George felt he had used up all his available</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam, and still his opponent kept charging in with unabated vigor and</seg><seg type="columnLine">enthusiasm. Going back to his corner at the end of the round, George whis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pered something to one of his seconds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Shortly thereafter an individual entered crying in a loud voice, "Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Godfrey! Mr. Godfrey! Telegram for Mr. Godfrey!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  A startled face reared itself above the flapping towels in the opposite</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner. "Not Mr. George Godfrey?" said George's opponent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Ya-as, boy, that's my name. Godfrey. George Godfrey," drawled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big colored scrapper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  After this announcement the fight became a foot race, with Mr. Godfrey</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite well satisfied to amble around the ring after his lately enthusiastic</seg><seg type="columnLine">opponent, taking care never to crowd him too closely, or to take any chances</seg><seg type="columnLine">of making him forget his newly acquired respect for the man he was boxing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">WATERFRONT FISTS</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By ROBERT E.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a fast hard straight right and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wicked left swing -- oh boy, how he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hit with that left! Seemed like</seg><seg type="columnLine">every time I did anything, 1 got that</seg><seg type="columnLine">right in the eye or the mouth or on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose, and whilst I was thinking about</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, bam! come the left and nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripped my head clean off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The long, lanky mutt--it looked like</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I ever landed solid I'd bust him in</seg><seg type="columnLine">two. But I couldn't get past that long</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight right. My swings were all short</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his straight right beat my left hook</seg><seg type="columnLine">every time. When I tried trading jabs</seg><seg type="columnLine">with him, his extra reach ruint that--</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway, I'm a natural hooker. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight left is got force, but it ain't as</seg><seg type="columnLine">accurate as it should be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the end of the first round my right</seg><seg type="columnLine">ear was nearly mangled. In the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">frame he half closed my eye with a siz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zling right hook, and opened a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">gash on my forehead. At the beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the third he dropped me for no-count</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a left hook to the body that nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">caved me in. The Ruffian's crew was</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting crazier every second and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sea Girl's gang was yelling bloody mur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">der. But I wasn't worried. I'm used to</seg><seg type="columnLine">more punishment than I was getting and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I wasn't weakening any.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But dawg-gone it, it did make me mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to be able to hit Roach. To date I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't landed a single solid punch. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a clever boxer in his way, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">style woulda made Dempsey look like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a one-armed paperhanger carryin' a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bucket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He managed to keep me at long range,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he belted me plenty, but it wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">his speed nor his punch that kept me all</seg><seg type="columnLine">at sea; it was his cruel and unusual ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pearance ! Dawg-gone--them eyes of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly had me batty. I couldn't keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">from looking at 'em. I tried to watch his</seg><seg type="columnLine">waist-line or his feet, but every time my</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze wouldst wander back to his dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">torted optics. They had a kinda fatal at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">traction for me. Whilst I wouldst be</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to figure out where they was look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing--wham! would come that left wing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in from a entirely unexpected direc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion--and this continued.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WELL, after arising from that</seg><seg type="columnLine">knock-down in the third frame, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">was infuriated. And after chasing him</seg><seg type="columnLine">all around the ring, and getting only</seg><seg type="columnLine">another black eye for my pains, I got</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate. With the round half a min-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ute to go, I wowed the audience by clos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing both my eyes and tearing in, swing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing wild and regardless.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was pelting me plenty, but I didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">care; that visage of his wasn't upsetting</seg><seg type="columnLine">all my calculations as long as I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">see it, and in a second I felt my left</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash against what I knew to be a hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man jaw. Instantly the crowd went into</seg><seg type="columnLine">hystericals and I opened my eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked for the corpse.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My eyes rested on a recumbent figure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was not Red Roach. To my</seg><seg type="columnLine">annoyance I realized that one of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">blind swings had connected with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">referee. At the same instant Roach's</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging left crashed against my jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I hit the canvas. But even as I went</seg><seg type="columnLine">down I swung a wild dying effort right</seg><seg type="columnLine">which sunk in just above Red's waist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Waterfront Fists</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">43</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">line. The round ended with all three of</seg><seg type="columnLine">us on the canvas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our respective handlers dragged us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our corners, and somebody throwed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bucket of water on the referee, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to answer the gong with us bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tlers by holding on to the ropes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, as I sat in my corner sniffing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the smelling salts and watching Red's</seg><seg type="columnLine">handlers massaging his suffering belly, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought deeply, a very rare habit of</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine while fighting. I do not believe in</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much thinking; it gives a fighter the</seg><seg type="columnLine">headache. Still and all, with my jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">aching from Red's left and my eyes get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting strained from watching his unholy</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, I rubbed the nose Mike stuck into</seg><seg type="columnLine">my glove, and meditated. A left-hander</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a right-hander backwards. Nine times</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of ten his straight right will beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">your left jab. If you lead your right to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">right-hander, he'll beat you to the punch</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his left; but you can lead your</seg><seg type="columnLine">right to a left-hander, because his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">has as far to travel as your right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So when we come out for the fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, instead of tearing in, I went in</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautious-like for me, ignoring the yells</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Ruffian's crew that I was getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">scared of their man. Red feinted with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right so clumsy even I knowed it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a feint and instantly shot my right with</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything I had behind it. It beat his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left swing and landed solid, but high.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He staggered and I dropped him to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">all fours with a whistling left hook un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the heart. He was up at "Nine" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught me with a wild left swing as I</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed in. It dizzied me but I kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming, and every time he made a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion with his left I shot my right. Some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">times I landed first and sometimes he</seg><seg type="columnLine">did, and sometimes we landed simulta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neous, but my smashes had the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">kick behind them. Like most port-siders</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they're groggy, he'd clean forgot</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had a right hand and was staking</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything on his left swing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I battered him back across the ring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he rallied and smashed over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sledge-hammer left hook that rocked me</seg><seg type="columnLine">to my heels and made the blood spatter,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> but I bored right in with a sizzling left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hook under the heart. He gasped, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">iknees buckled, then he steadied hisself</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shot over his left just as I crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in with a right. Bam! Something ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploded in my head, and then I heard the</seg><seg type="columnLine">referee counting. To my chagrin I</seg><seg type="columnLine">found I was on the canvas, but Roach</seg><seg type="columnLine">was there too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The still weaving and glassy-eyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">referee was holding onto the ropes with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand and counting over us both, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I managed to reel up at "Six!" Me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Red had landed square to the button at</seg><seg type="columnLine">just the same second,, but my jaw was</seg><seg type="columnLine">just naturally tougher than his. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hadn't twitched at "Ten" and they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cariy him to his dressing room to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring him to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, a few minutes' work 011 me with</seg><seg type="columnLine">smelling salts, ammonia, sponges and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">like made me as good as new. I couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">hardly wait for Bill to dress my cuts</seg><seg type="columnLine">with collodion, but the minute I got my</seg><seg type="columnLine">clothes 011 and collected my winnings</seg><seg type="columnLine">and bets from the bartender, who'd come</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ring under escort from both ships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I ducked out the back way. I even left</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mike with Bill because he's always</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrapping with some other dog on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">streets and I was in a big hurry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was on my way to see i f Gloria had</seg><seg type="columnLine">followed my advice, also something else.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One hundred and fifty bucks I won;</seg><seg type="columnLine">with what I had that made three hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred. I got a hundred and fifty for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fracas. Altogether I had lour hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fifty dollars all in greenbacks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">large denomination in my jacket pocket.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And I was going to give Gloria every</seg><seg type="columnLine">cent of it, if she'd take it. so she could</seg><seg type="columnLine">go back to New Jersey and the cows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This sure wasn't no place for a nice girl</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be in, and I'll admit I indulged in</seg><seg type="columnLine">some dreams as I hurried along--about</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time I'd retire from the sea and</seg><seg type="columnLine">maybe gcr into the dairy farming busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness in New Jersey.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I WAS headed for the Striped Cat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but on my way I passed Salana's</seg><seg type="columnLine">gym, and I noticed that they was a light</seg><seg type="columnLine">44</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in one of the small rooms which served</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a kind of office. As I passed the door</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	distinctly heard a voice I knowed was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gloria's. I stopped short and started to</seg><seg type="columnLine">knock on the door, then something made</seg><seg type="columnLine">me steal up close and listen--though I</seg><seg type="columnLine">ain't a eavesdropper by nature. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the voices five people was in the room--</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gloria, Salana, Abe Gold, Joe Crom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">well, and Tony.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't hand us no line, sister," Gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">was saying in his nasty rasping voice.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You said leave it to you.

Well, he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> fell for me right off, naturally, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">got him into the gym here, intending to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay him cold and lock him up till after</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fight.

Another of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same sort stood him on his head in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a corner with a cracked jaw-bone, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost simultaneous Abe Gold barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed me with a pair of brass knuckles,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Tony landed hard 011 my ear.

The battle in question was between Terry McGovern, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">featherweight champion of the world, and Oscar Gardner, a prominent chal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenger for honors in that class.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Gardner was famous for his right-hand punch. He had cut a swath</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the featherweights of the day with it and was regarded as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">runner-up in Terrible Terry's division. Early in the fight he crossed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible right to McGovern's jaw. Down went the champion. In those days,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a man w'as knocked down, his antagonist did not have to go back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his corner of the ring, so Gardner stood over Terry waiting for him to get</seg><seg type="columnLine">up. Terry was numbed and bewildered. Throwing out groping hands he</seg><seg type="columnLine">got hold of Gardner's leg.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  More by instinct than anything else, he began to pull himself to his feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gardner tried to get his legs away, but Terry hung on. The referee, Johnny</seg><seg type="columnLine">White, has been accused of partiality to the champion, just as the referee in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Chicago fight was accused of favoring Tunney with a long count. At any</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate, White did not do very much about making Terrible Terry release Gard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner's legs, and after scrambling around with his opponent, the champion</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventually got to his feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  No official time was taken, but spectators at the ringside have claimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it took McGovern nearly half a minute, even with the assistance of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">antagonist's legs, to get to his feet. However, when he did get up, he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">back strong, and shortly thereafter knocked Gardner cold. The fight caused</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great scandal in fistic circles and is still discussed wherever old-timers get</seg><seg type="columnLine">together.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Baby-Face Terror</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By JACK KOFOED</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Author of "Fitzsimmons, the Wonder Fighter"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A beautiful scrapper to watch--that McLarnin boy!

Baby</seg><seg type="columnLine">Face, as they called the tiny fighter, won</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily. He beat Fidel LaBarba and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jackie Fields and Joey S'angor. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one who had anything on him was</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bud Taylor. But Jimmy grew from</seg><seg type="columnLine">one class into another until he was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">full-fledged lightweight, and was bitten</seg><seg type="columnLine">by a desire to show his wares in New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York.

Glittering Broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way! Jimmy McLarnin was daz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zled and happy when he first set foot</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Gotham-town. He went around to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Forty-ninth Street and Eighth Avenue</seg><seg type="columnLine">to marvel at the size of Madison Square</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garden and blush a little at the signs</seg><seg type="columnLine">advertising the coming fight between Sid</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terris and Jimmy McLarnin. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were men at the box-office already. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was 110 small job to crash New York--</seg><seg type="columnLine">to make people pay out hard-earned</seg><seg type="columnLine">money to see you fight. They said New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York was cold and hard to failures, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">that if you caught its love and admira-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion nothing was too good for you.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well, the first obstacle in the way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaining that success was a young gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man named Terris. He must be re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Jimmy weighed in at the Com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">47</seg><seg type="columnLine">48</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mission's office, he had his first look at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sid Terris. He saw an extraordinarily</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin young man, whose skin was drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly over his cheek-bones and mottled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a hectic flush. His legs and arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked powerful. Sid was a pretty good</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitter, but he had won fame because of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his extraordinary speed of foot. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">called him the East Side Will o' the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wisp, and lightweights had found him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as easy to collar as a mosquito.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy studied his opponent. Terris</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't have much resistance to punish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. You could see that. The thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do with him was to get close, crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, keep belting away. No fancy work.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No dancing around or boxing. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">get in there and hit. If you whaled</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a couple of times he'd go. Not</seg><seg type="columnLine">through lack of gameness, but just be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause Nature hadn't built him to stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">a walloping.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Terris was a New York idol. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">packed 'em in when he fought. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy was making his big-time debut</seg><seg type="columnLine">against this fellow. Knock him out,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and you're made, boy. Fight fans, like</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone else, string with the winners.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Put Sid Terris away and you'll pull</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in at the gate like nobody's busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He's awful fast," said Pop Foster.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Don't let him get away from you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy.

Get</seg><seg type="columnLine">close before you begin shootin'."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Don't worry, Pop," said Baby</seg><seg type="columnLine">Face. "I think I know how to beat this</seg><seg type="columnLine">guy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The hours whirled by. Almost be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore he knew it Jimmy McLarnin sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the glaring white ring, a quizzical</seg><seg type="columnLine">little smile on his lips as he looked across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring at Sid Terris. Well, New York,</seg><seg type="columnLine">here I am! Are you going to like me?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Will you take to the way I belt 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">over? I want you to like me, New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York. It's too bad that you can't get</seg><seg type="columnLine">anywhere without putting somebody</seg><seg type="columnLine">else out of the picture. There's Terris.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A nice, mild boy. If I plaster him</seg><seg type="columnLine">away his money earning days will sim-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">mer out. But that's none of my busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. It's his job to put me away if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he can.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Gee, how the galleries are roaring for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terris. They certainly like him in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">town. What's that Joe Humphries is</seg><seg type="columnLine">saying, . . the representative light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of the Pacific Coast, Jimmy Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larnin." That's the tip to get up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smile and bow. Gosh, that was a nice</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand for a stranger! New Yorkers are</seg><seg type="columnLine">not such cold people, after all. Looks</seg><seg type="columnLine">like they want to give everyone a break.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, out in the center of the ring to</seg><seg type="columnLine">listen to cut-and-dried instructions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Look at Terris. He's pale, but then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they say he is always pale. These East</seg><seg type="columnLine">Side boys never had much sun to color</seg><seg type="columnLine">them up. But you can see his heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">thumping against his ribs. Bang, bang,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bang. He's nervous, all right. Is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">any sign? Lots of great fighters have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been nervous before the gong--Jeffries,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ketchel, rafts of them. That doesn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">mean that they are ready to be pushed</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. Jimmy himself never felt par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticularly fidgety, but everybody is dif-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A pat on the back from Pop, a quick</seg><seg type="columnLine">handclasp. The boys are in their corners</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for the bell. There it is! Out</seg><seg type="columnLine">goes Jimmy McLarnin for his first fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">in New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">TERRIS skipped about on those</seg><seg type="columnLine">springy, long legs of his like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasshopper, prodding with his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand. Gosh, he was fast, wasn't he?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Looked as though he could jump clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">across the ring with one bound. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder they couldn't catch him very</seg><seg type="columnLine">easily. Jim went in with a rush, hooked,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and missed. Sid jabbed him and sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">warily away. The crowd yelled its ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miration. Go ahead and yell. This thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">hasn't even started yet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McLarnin wasn't going to waste his</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy firing at long range. He went in</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat-footed, seeking to get close enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">so the target would be easier to hit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's Terris against the ropes. Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">lashed out with his left again, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Baby-Face Terror</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">49</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">punch was glancing and did no damage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sid was in the middle of the ring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Laughing at him? No. There was all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seriousness of an undertaker in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale, gaunt face of the East Sidcr, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hint of derision in his eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy came closer. Terris, his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand extended, hesitated like a gazelle</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to fly. A feint to the body. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Will o' the Wisp pulled down his guard,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whango!--over went the right with</seg><seg type="columnLine">every ounce of power Jimmy could put</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it. The blow landed squarely on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">jaw. Terris went down as though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been hit by a blackjack. He went</seg><seg type="columnLine">flat on his back, his head cracking</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the floorboards.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy said to himself, "That finishes</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Tougher guys than he would go</seg><seg type="columnLine">out with that wallop. Look at him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eyes shut, gloves open. They could</seg><seg type="columnLine">count a hundred over him and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't move. Well, boy, this is a</seg><seg type="columnLine">pretty nice start for me."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The place was in a bedlam. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">referee counted seriously, as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a chance that Terris would</seg><seg type="columnLine">get up. But the Will o' the Wisp lay</seg><seg type="columnLine">there helpless, done for.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Nine, ten--out!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy McLarnin turned a hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spring in the center of the ring, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed over to where Pop Foster stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a beatific smile on his broad,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grizzled face. Their metropolitan debut</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been a riot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was nothing less than that, really.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Their share for the quick knockout over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terris amounted to $19,645.50, by far</seg><seg type="columnLine">the largest purse the partnership had</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever taken in. But there was even more</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it than that. Jimmy signed for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">four-day appearence at Fox's Academy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Music for $1,500, and was swamped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with offers to appear in half a dozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pop turned down all bids of a fistic</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature, and waited to see what Madison</seg><seg type="columnLine">Square Garden would do next. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the big bet. Jimmy had proved</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself a fighter, a hitter and a drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">card. They would be anxious to put</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight--flcpt.--4</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">him on again, quickly. Sure enough,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rickard called them in. He wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy to fight Phil McGraw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That sounded swell. Phil was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Greek lightweight, a Battling Nelson</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort of punch-absorber, a club fighter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the first order, but neither a fine boxer</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor a great hitter. It looked like a softer</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot to Pop than Sid Terris had been,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but a good box-office attraction at that.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There wasn't even any need of talking</seg><seg type="columnLine">it over with Jimmy, Baby Face was</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly willing to take anyone or</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone, the more the better. Each</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight was another step toward the cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pionship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McGraw was noted for his rugged-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. No lightweight in the game had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown greater ability to absorb a thump-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing without slowing up. He had fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">most of the men in his division, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">none had hurt him. Those who believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that Jimmy's quick victory over Sid</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terris had been something of an acci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent saw in this match a real test of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy's hitting power.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Phil himself was confident that</seg><seg type="columnLine">McLarnin couldn't hurt him. He believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could take anything shot his way and</seg><seg type="columnLine">outrough and outpunch Baby Face. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as these hitters understood that</seg><seg type="columnLine">they couldn't hurt you they lost most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their stuff. The old confidence went.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They drew an excellent crowd to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Madison Square Garden. Jimmy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught on instantly, and McG raw's des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perate 'battles with Stanislaus Loayza</seg><seg type="columnLine">and others had made him a drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">card, too.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a big difference between</seg><seg type="columnLine">McGraw and Sid Terris. The latter</seg><seg type="columnLine">had flashy speed and some boxing</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability, but was entirely lacking in ability</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take a punch. Phil, on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, was not extraordinarily fast, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">could stand up under a walloping until</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cows came home.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was one interesting occurrence</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the bill, though it had no connection</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Jimmy McLarnin. A boy named</seg><seg type="columnLine">A1 Singer made his Garden debut in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening four-rounder, and knocked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">50</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy Gervcl. Within a very short</seg><seg type="columnLine">time Singer was to share with McLarnin</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distinction of being the best draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing card in New York. F'*jn then he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was tremendously popular with the East</seg><seg type="columnLine">Side fans, and a string of victories</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread his popularity throughout the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. Jimmy had never heard of him at</seg><seg type="columnLine">that time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">When the main event started</seg><seg type="columnLine">McGraw rushed at Baby Face. Phil</seg><seg type="columnLine">was wide open for any kind of a punch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but not being a boxer he depended on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ferocity of his attack to make up</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his defensive shortcomings. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">ferocity wasn't enough to bother Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">McLarnin. He was a sharpshooter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this instant was firing at the side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a barn. He just couldn't miss.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JIMMY'S first right-hand drive</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed flush to the button. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">McGraw had not known before what</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was to lie hurt, he knew then. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">bomb exploded inside his head. His feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">were swept out from under him. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been back toward the ropes and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pitched head-first through them onto</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heads of the men in the press seats.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Phil didn't know where he was; didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know anything except that he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled out of the ring and that if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't get back quickly he'd be counted</seg><seg type="columnLine">out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So he scrambled around, reached for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the the bottom strand of the ropes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauled himself up. The referee had</seg><seg type="columnLine">only counted to five, so quick had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">McGraw's actions, but Phil didn't know</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the count was, and couldn't take</seg><seg type="columnLine">any chances. He hitched himself to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet, shook his head, blinked his eyes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">catching sight of Jimmy McLarnin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed at him again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was really too bad to take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money. Baby Face didn't even bother</seg><seg type="columnLine">to feint. He just whipped the right to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jaw again, and down went Phil</seg><seg type="columnLine">McGraw. The latter felt as though he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been hit with a mallet, but he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">his reputation to live up to. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an iron man. Who ever heard of an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">iron man being knocked out in the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">round? Who even heard of him stay-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing on the floor to take advantage of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">count? McGraw scrambled to his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">as quickly as he could, and that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick enough since the referee had only;</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached "two."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This time he had a little more difficulty</seg><seg type="columnLine">in locating McLarnin. His head</seg><seg type="columnLine">was going around like a top. His jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt as though it had swollen into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">balloon. No wonder Sid Terris had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been flattened so quickly. No wonder</seg><seg type="columnLine">this baby had knocked out Kid Kaplan</seg><seg type="columnLine">and all those others. Could he hit?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Whooie! It was nothing short of mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der. Well, let's go. Where is he?</seg><seg type="columnLine">McGraw's bleared eyes focused them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves on the form of Jimmy McLar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nin suddenly looming before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He put his gloves up before his face,</seg><seg type="columnLine">peering over the tops of them. No use</seg><seg type="columnLine">being too reckless when a guy is throw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing dynamite bombs in your face. Let</seg><seg type="columnLine">McLarnin lead. He'd wait a bit.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Then--and McGraw hadn't the</seg><seg type="columnLine">faintest notion of how it happened-- an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other bomb exploded under his chin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He felt the resin scraping under his</seg><seg type="columnLine">elbows. The sound of the explosion</seg><seg type="columnLine">rang in his ears. Phil shook his head,</seg><seg type="columnLine">trying to clear it. His legs felt all right.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was no weakness there yet, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">his dome felt as though it weighed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand pounds. It took all his deter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mination to pyll it up, to lift that huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight upright.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Phil had no idea of what round it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, or how long it would be before</seg><seg type="columnLine">the round ended. He didn't know how</seg><seg type="columnLine">often he had been on the floor, either.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The only thing he was conscious of was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the absolute necessity of getting up</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. He didn't know why he should</seg><seg type="columnLine">get up--but he just had to.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All over the Garden people were yell-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing for the referee to stop it. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was no logic in having a game man</seg><seg type="columnLine">slaughtered when he didn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a chance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy looked at the referee. The lat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter shook his head. He wasn't going</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Baby-Face Terror</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">51</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to stop it yet. McGraw had lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">through terrible punishment before this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stop it now, and his people would yell</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloody murder the rest of their lives.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Let's see what happens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McLarnin walked in, set himself, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot another right-hander to the jaw.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Down, down, down went McCarthy to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bottom of the sea. Only this time</seg><seg type="columnLine">his name was McGraw. Down through</seg><seg type="columnLine">an alley of velvet blackness. Phil</seg><seg type="columnLine">McGraw felt as though he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped off a precipice into a bottom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less abyss. But he wound up with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thump on his hands and knees again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How many times had he been there?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He didn't know. He didn't care, either.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He didn't care about anything. Wearily</seg><seg type="columnLine">he scuffled his way to his feet again as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the referee reached "eight." He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rubber-legged with punishment. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees buckled under him. Just the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of his body on them was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">much to carry. His arms hung by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. His eyes were glazed, unseeing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Another blow might be fatal. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be no resistance to it. The Greek</seg><seg type="columnLine">was utterly relaxed, ready to fall with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out being struck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the referee stepped between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men. There was no doubt in his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">or anyone else's about it now. McGraw</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't last out the round let alone the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight. Why permit it to continue? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the Title!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HAVING knocked out the fleet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">footed Terris and the rugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">McGraw, Jimmy waited for other game,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was presented to him shortly in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">person of the Chilian Indian, Stanislaus</seg><seg type="columnLine">Loayza. Loayza was beetle-browed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tough as shoe-leather. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">tougher than McGraw, for he had twice</seg><seg type="columnLine">beaten the Greek in savage, hair-raising</seg><seg type="columnLine">battles. If any of the lightweights</seg><seg type="columnLine">could stop Jimmy's knockout streak</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">this dark skinned man from South</seg><seg type="columnLine">America should be the man to do it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stanislaus, who had little imagina-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion and no fear of anyone, went at</seg><seg type="columnLine">McLarnin the way a hungry dog would</seg><seg type="columnLine">snap at a bone. He slapped away with</seg><seg type="columnLine">both fists without accomplishing much</seg><seg type="columnLine">for McLarnin had forgotten more about</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxing than the Indian would ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">know,--and then the right hand went</seg><seg type="columnLine">over.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From that moment on it was just too</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad. McLarnin slaughtered Loayza.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He hit him with everything but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">water bucket. He raked him from brow</seg><seg type="columnLine">to belt line with the choicest punches in</seg><seg type="columnLine">his repertoire, and still Loayza came</seg><seg type="columnLine">striding in for more. If you couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">admire his judgment you could applaud</seg><seg type="columnLine">his gameness and ability to stand up un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der the most ferocious punishment. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't go over as easily as Terris and</seg><seg type="columnLine">McGraw. At each savage thump he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook his head, knit his brows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged in for more. As for handing</seg><seg type="columnLine">out any punishment himself--lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't have hit Jimmy with a hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful of buckshot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It wasn't a fight, but a case of ag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gravated assault-and-battery. No one</seg><seg type="columnLine">rightly understood how Stanislaus man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">aged to keep his feet. But constantly</seg><seg type="columnLine">dripping water wears away stones, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pounding of McLarnin's fists had</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same effect on the Indian. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight ended in the fourth round--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">everyone was glad when it did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This third straight sensational victory</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his New York invasion put Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">in an enviable position. He was set now</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a shot at Sammy Mandell, the title-</seg><seg type="columnLine">holder, and when he went into the ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the handsome Sheik of Rock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ford he'd carry a lot of New York</seg><seg type="columnLine">money. The big town was just crazy</seg><seg type="columnLine">about him. He looked like the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightweight to come down the road since</seg><seg type="columnLine">the days of Benny Leonard.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tex Rickard was very keen for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightweight championship bout between</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mandell and McLarnin. That class was</seg><seg type="columnLine">very close to his heart for he had started</seg><seg type="columnLine">52</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his promotional career with Battling</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nelson and Joe Gans in the humid heat</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Goldfieid, Nevada. He wanted an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other lightweight title bout--one that</seg><seg type="columnLine">might equal the success of the battles</seg><seg type="columnLine">staged between Benny Leonard and Lew</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tendler. McLarnin had become star-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tlingly popular in New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It looked like a great financial shot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but old Pop was a little dubious. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew fights and fighters, and he knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as anyone else that Mandell was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a capable, polished ringman--not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leonard, perhaps--but a master just</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same. He wasn't sure that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't be rushing Jimmy too fast by</seg><seg type="columnLine">making the match.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Baby Face himself was the deciding</seg><seg type="columnLine">factor. Pass up this chance to stiffen</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mandell ? I should say not! Sure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll fight him, and beat him, too.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wasn't that what they had come to New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York for? Weren't those victories over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Terris and McGraw and Loayza the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps toward the match? Pop finally</seg><seg type="columnLine">acquiesced, and Jimmy began to train.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The work of getting down to weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more difficult than he had antici-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pated. It was the old story over again.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He was growing, and Nature would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to be placated. That was the worst</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of this racket, the business of mak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing weight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy entered the ring wearing a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">splendent green bathrobe with the fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mous yellow harp embroidered on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. His round, pink face was sober.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was a chance that could not be</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken lightly. You didn't laugh off a</seg><seg type="columnLine">championship. Of course, he wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid. He believed that he could whip</seg><seg type="columnLine">any man of his weight in the world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but--the championship of the world was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at stake!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">A moment later Sammy Mandell</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed through the ropes. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shrouded in a brown bathrobe, and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark, good-looking face was just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">serious as Jimmy's. He realized that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was putting his most prized posses-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sion on the line against the most danger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous contender in the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AS Joe Humphries introduced Can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nonball Martin and Joe Glick,</seg><seg type="columnLine">both local favorites, Pop Foster and Dia</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dollings hovered over their charge like</seg><seg type="columnLine">parents over a new-born child. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd was impatient. They wanted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight to start. Joe's introduction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion brought an enthusiastic cheer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but nothing compared with the whole-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hearted roar of applause that burst forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">when McLarnin rose to take his bow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Irish boy had caught the metro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">politan imagination the first time he</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed his wares in New York. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">subsequent showings had cemented that</seg><seg type="columnLine">affection. Everyone wanted him to win.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Referee Magnolia called the rivals to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of the ring for instructions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were solemn as schoolboys caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a prank that might mean expulsion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy's heart hammered against his</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribs. Let's get going. Action was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">antidote for nervousness. Once he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">throwing leather this crowded sensa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion in his chest would pass. What was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the use of being nervous? It didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">help, and it might make it seem that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was afraid--when he wasn't really;</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the crowd and the importance of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this fight and his own hot desire to win</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the causes of his jumpiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McLarnin looked at Mandell, for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first time, when they faced each other</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the center of the ring. Down inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">of him he was saying, "I'm going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lick you. Within an hour I'll be the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightweight champion of the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lightweight champion of the world!</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'li lick you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They smiled a little diffidently at</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other when Referee Magnolia</seg><seg type="columnLine">slapped their backs and said, "That's all,</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They shuffled to their corners, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood waiting for that last interminable</seg><seg type="columnLine">moment to pass. Irish and Italian.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Good-looking, clean, honest. Two finer</seg><seg type="columnLine">boys never faced each other in any ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The brass voice of the gong called</seg><seg type="columnLine">them into action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy rushed, fists flying. He might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have boxed--and, had he boxed as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Baby-Face Terror</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">53</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">had in earlier bouts, might have equalled</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sammy in cleverness. But blah with</seg><seg type="columnLine">that! He was a fighter--a slugger. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">knock Mandell into the middle of next</seg><seg type="columnLine">week. Championships shouldn't pass</seg><seg type="columnLine">on decisions. The way to win was by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">knockout. Flatten 'em!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Sheik of Rockford wasn't there</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be flattened so early in the fuss. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a flickering beam of light. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed around the ring on his talented</seg><seg type="columnLine">toes, but used more than footwork. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">jab was perfection, straight as a piston</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with the power of his shoulders be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind it. It wasn't a powder puff that</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck Jimmy McLarnin, but a balled</seg><seg type="columnLine">up missile of bone and leather. It stung,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurt, disconcerted Jimmy. He had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">run into anything as bothersome as that</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hand. It was continually in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still, no one as game and confident as</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy McLarnin loses confidence</seg><seg type="columnLine">through being disconcerted. Sure, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be cut up, made to look bad for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">while, but what of that? He had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">utmost faith in his right hand. It had</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked out some great lightweights. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would knock out Sammy Mandell if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed, and McLarnin didn't believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man lived who could keep him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing for fifteen rounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What were a few bruises? Sure, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion found it easy to poke him</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that jab. Why not? He was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in wide open, bothering about noth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing but landing the one big, vital shot.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was all he needed. He'd gamble</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the rest. Sammy wasn't a hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitter, though a punishing one. Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">could afford to gamble on a ten-to-one</seg><seg type="columnLine">basis. He'd trade one right cross for</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten jaibs. It didn't make any difference</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he looked good or bad to the specta-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors at this stage of the game. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">have them cheering for him before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">finish--and what a finish it would be!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MANDELL seemed so darned confi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent, so sure of himself without</seg><seg type="columnLine">being careless. He didn't jab as most</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighters do, flicking the left hand into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the other fellow's face. He put some</seg><seg type="columnLine">steam into it. His shoulders were back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the blows, and Jimmy's head bobbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">back Under them. In the clinches--and</seg><seg type="columnLine">there were many of them in the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">few rounds--Sammy showed his greater</seg><seg type="columnLine">experience by tying Jimmy up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Belfast boy fumed. He wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">so desperately to land. He tried so</seg><seg type="columnLine">hard! As he rushed and swung and</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed, Mandell ripped him with both</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands. At times the champion smiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">'broadly and winked at his manager,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eddie Kane, as though to say, "Imagine</seg><seg type="columnLine">this guy thinkin' he can lick me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This fight, as a matter of simple</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth, must be reported as a picture of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a master working with a pupil. Jimmy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">game and willing as he was, simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't find the target, and his own</seg><seg type="columnLine">pink cheeks felt the continual impact of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his rival's gloves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the fifth, McLarnin's wild swings</seg><seg type="columnLine">occasionally found the mark. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was plenty of steam and danger in</seg><seg type="columnLine">them, but they didn't land often enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">to balance the rain of punches that fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the time the seventh had passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the little Irishman's face was dyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimson. The blood provoked Mandell</seg><seg type="columnLine">to further efforts. Experts had scoffed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at his hitting powers compared with</seg><seg type="columnLine">McLarnin's. He hit away at a faster</seg><seg type="columnLine">pace.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through it all Jimmy came rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, his blue eyes narrowed against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm. He was not discouraged. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture of Sid Terris and Lou Kaplan</seg><seg type="columnLine">and others writhing on the floor, spurred</seg><seg type="columnLine">him on. Terris was faster than Man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dell. Kaplan was tougher. Yet both</seg><seg type="columnLine">had dropped under the McLarnin blows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mandell would, too, sooner or later.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the champion's stabbing jab kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">him off balance. The hooks and</seg><seg type="columnLine">counters and crosses shook him, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">none seemed to hurt him vitally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a certain sameness to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bout, a lack of thrill and drama. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not because either boy slackened his</seg><seg type="columnLine">•efforts for a moment. It was ratheij</seg><seg type="columnLine">54</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">because there was no rise and fall to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flow of action. One round was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">similar to the other. Jimmy rushed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging, and Mandell made him miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hit him in return.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> By the end of the eleventh Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larnin's left eye had closed under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrage of blows. It gave his ibaby face</seg><seg type="columnLine">the appearance of being peculiarly</seg><seg type="columnLine">askew; like that of a Bacchus cherub.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It did more than make him look queer.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Half-blinded, the game little Irishman</seg><seg type="columnLine">was more than ever a wide open target</seg><seg type="columnLine">for his clever rival.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Still, never for a single instant did</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy stop trying. Though the pound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing he had undergone had robbed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the sting of his punch he kept throw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it desperately. He knew as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone that his only chance lay in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">knockout--and the chance had faded</seg><seg type="columnLine">away almost into nothingness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And he kept trying right through to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very last second. When the final</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell sounded it found him lunging in,</seg><seg type="columnLine">feebler physically, but just as ibrave and</seg><seg type="columnLine">determined as ever.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When the bell rang Jimmy's pink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">oheeked face was only a caricature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">its smooth and childish self. The pink</seg><seg type="columnLine">had deepened to a dull red. Over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut eye was a bloated and discolored</seg><seg type="columnLine">lump. His slim waistline wras banded</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the crimson imprint of a thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sand blows the champion had landed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McLarnin walked over and shook</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands with his conqueror. He smiled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with no hint of regret or envy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You fought a great fight, champ,'*</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, gracefully admitting the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cision before it had been announced.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"It just wasn't my night. Some other</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, eh?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thanks," answered Mandell. "You're</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gamest boy I ever saw, Jimmy. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">deserve another chance.

Of course, McLarnin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">barbed by disappointment, but, being a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">confirmed optimist, was certain that his</seg><seg type="columnLine">time would come. This didn't mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would never climb to the title.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bosh! He'd get there. It was just</seg><seg type="columnLine">his misfortune that on this night</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sammy Mandell had been at his superb</seg><seg type="columnLine">best, and that Jimmy McLarnin hadn't.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's all there was to it. If they met</seg><seg type="columnLine">again he felt--in spite of the trounc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing he'd just taken--that he would win,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that the lightweight champion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the world would finish with his nose in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the resin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     CHAPTER VIII</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">     The Blare of Battle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DISCOURAGED, but not disheart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened, at the lacing Mandell had'</seg><seg type="columnLine">given him, Jimmy started again on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">trail that leads to championships.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was again finding more and more</seg><seg type="columnLine">difficulty in making weight.

McLarnin hoped that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">transformation would take some time</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet. He wanted another shot at Man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dell. His Irish optimism flamed high.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nobody was going to hold a perma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nent edge on him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As a starter, he took on Ray Miller.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through the medium of one of the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">left ihooks in the business, Ray had'</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed out of a shoe salesman's job and</seg><seg type="columnLine">became a contender for the lightweight</seg><seg type="columnLine">championship. Smart ring generalship</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hitting ability had made him ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremely popular.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was one of the worst matches Pop</seg><seg type="columnLine">Foster ever made--though it was more</seg><seg type="columnLine">a matter of bad luck than anything else.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy had an old cut over one eye.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller made that a target from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">start and soon ripped it wide open. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood gushed out in a stream. Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hard working seconds could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped that crimson river.

The fans</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen him badly trounced by Man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dell, and now he had Ibeen stopped by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller. Just how far back had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">slipped? Would his nice smile and great</seg><seg type="columnLine">punch disappear from the ring? Most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us doubted that. Baby Face was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">young. He had not suffered sufficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">punishment to batter him down. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garden matched him with Joe Glick so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we might all find out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the ring game suffered its great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est loss.

His body</seg><seg type="columnLine">was sent North and he lay in state in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Madison Square Garden his execu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive genius had created. Jimmy McLarn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in was one of those who mourned. Rick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ard had represented great things to him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rickard had given him his first oppor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunity in New York. And now the cold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent man from the North was gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the scene of his greatest triumphs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was a sharp lesson to the Belfast</seg><seg type="columnLine">boy. He saw how trivial are all things</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the face of death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But even such a happening as Rick-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ard's death could not halt the march of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">business. McLarnin trained hard for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fight with Glick. This represented</seg><seg type="columnLine">the turning point of his career.

Pie was a smart, defensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxer and a fair hitter. He knew his</seg><seg type="columnLine">business, and a good part of that busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness was to see that he wasn't hurt. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">tough fellow to lick, this button-liole</seg><seg type="columnLine">maker from Williamsburg, an exceed-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingly tough one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He started to make it difficult for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy in the very first round. Baby.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Face wanted to end the matter quickly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He threw rights until Glick set him</seg><seg type="columnLine">back on his heels with well-timed jabs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then McLarnin decided that this af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair was not to he ended so quickly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">began whipping his left hook to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mark. Those digs made Joe take to</seg><seg type="columnLine">56</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">cover, but he always came out with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flurry of punches that landed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Student that he was, James McLarnin</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out exactly what Joe Glick had in</seg><seg type="columnLine">those three minutes of fighting. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't enough, he decided to cause him</seg><seg type="columnLine">any trouble. Bingo with the left hook!</seg><seg type="columnLine">That would win this fight for him. He'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hook this baby to death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy did exactly that in the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, and wound it up with a blasting</seg><seg type="columnLine">right-hander at the hell that almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurled the button-hole maker through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ropes. It was exactly that sort of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">story through to the seventh round, Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larnin winning all of them. He not</seg><seg type="columnLine">only outhit Joe but outboxed him as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well. Glick wrapped himself in a beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful defense and was never in real</seg><seg type="columnLine">danger of being knocked out. Oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casionally he would land a rousing left</seg><seg type="columnLine">or right himself, but these spurts were</seg><seg type="columnLine">too rare to give him an advantage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The seventh was a fine slugging bee.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Click's seconds urged him to get out</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fight--to take chances, if need be.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He couldn't wrin by staying in his shell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Get out there and trade with 'im.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Joe had apparently arrived at that</seg><seg type="columnLine">decision himself. He started by pepper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Jimmy's nose with a fast left jab</seg><seg type="columnLine">that brought a spurt of blood. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirred the Irishman's pride and temper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Back he tore in a furious effort to</seg><seg type="columnLine">knock Glick out. He pegged away with</seg><seg type="columnLine">both fists, and the button-hole maker</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood up to him in fine style and fired</seg><seg type="columnLine">back at him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was a rip-snorting fight. Those</seg><seg type="columnLine">who thought that Glick excelled only in</seg><seg type="columnLine">defending himself were surprised to see</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he took what McLarnin sent over,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dealt out punches himself that</seg><seg type="columnLine">weren't labelled creampuffs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The eighth and the ninth were hot,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, though Jimmy increased his advan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tage by dint of continual leading. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">final was the tip-off on the whole fight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They slugged furiously in mid-ring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">neither giving ground until that canto</seg><seg type="columnLine">was nearly over. Then, bit by bit, Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">retreated, fighting bravely, Ibut unable</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to do any execution in the face of Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larnin's tireless attack. Jimmy's arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">moved like pistons. He threw eighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">percent of the blows, and did eighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">percent of the execution.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was absolutely no question as</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the justice of the decision, which went</seg><seg type="columnLine">unanimously to McLarnin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Incidentally it might be mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">that with popular prices prevailing--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">is with a top charge of five dollars for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ring-side seat--the McLarnin-Glick</seg><seg type="columnLine">bout drew $71,158, a record for that</seg><seg type="columnLine">scale. Jimmy, of course, was the mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">net. He always pulled 'em at the box</seg><seg type="columnLine">office, and against a popular metropoli-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tan regular like Glick, was sure fire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Outside of perhaps Jack Dempsey</seg><seg type="columnLine">there wasn't a better liked boy in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring than Jimmy McLarnin. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowds he always drew was proo£</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough of that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There hadn't been any doubt in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">minds of those who saw the bout be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween Jimmy and Joe that Baby Face</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the better man. Still doubt is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">essential in the making of matches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The boys had waged a great fight--one</seg><seg type="columnLine">that was well worth going to see. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances were all in favor of them do-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing exactly that thing again. Besides--</seg><seg type="columnLine">most important of all they had attracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">an enormous gate. So match-maker</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom McArdle proposed staging an en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">core.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was all right with Jimmy. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">readying up for a second shot at Ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller. Another meeting with Glick</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be an excellent warm-up. Sure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would meet the button-hole maker</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Why not? Joe was quite as</seg><seg type="columnLine">willing. I doubt that he really believed</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could whip McLarnin, but he had1</seg><seg type="columnLine">(been very well paid for the last match</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had suffered no particular damage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even if he had lost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They met again in Madison Square</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garden, and again a goodly crowd was</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. Jimmy went in very de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terminedly. He should have knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Glick out the first time they met. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do it now.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Baby-Face Terror</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">57</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MAKING up your mind to do some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing and then doing it are quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">different things. However, Jimmy ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">complished what he set out to do, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he did it in jig-time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first round indicated that their</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle might be a repetition of the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">one. It wasn't anything like it. In</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second McLarnin hit the button-hole</seg><seg type="columnLine">maker with his right hand--hit him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything he had, and exactly on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">proper spot. After that there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing much to do but sweep up Mr.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Glick and carry him thence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That quick and flashing victory</seg><seg type="columnLine">cemented the return bout between Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larnin and Ray Miller in Madison</seg><seg type="columnLine">Square Garden. It intensified interest</seg><seg type="columnLine">in it. New York, having seen both</seg><seg type="columnLine">men in action, could not believe that</seg><seg type="columnLine">their Jimmy could have been the victim</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Miller's left hook, great a weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">as that hook was. Now that he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished off Glick in jig-time, they</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted fo see him try to reverse the</seg><seg type="columnLine">verdict that the Chicagoan held over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The principal drawback was the ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of weight. Jimmy had grown into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a welterweight. There was no doubting</seg><seg type="columnLine">that. He could do nothing but hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself if he tried to make 136 pounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">at two o'clock in the afternoon. Miller,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the other hand, was something less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than a legitimate lightweight. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do 132 pounds very easily, and 136 was</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy for him. So, naturally, Ray's</seg><seg type="columnLine">people fought bitterly about the weight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Despite the fact that Miller had scored</seg><seg type="columnLine">a technical knockout in their first meet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing he didn't want to give away gobs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">poundage. The young man had a high</seg><seg type="columnLine">regard for McLarnin's ability.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Finally they came to an agreement. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was much too profitable a match to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">spoiled by even so important a matter as</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight. Ray realized that the advantage</seg><seg type="columnLine">was with him anyway. Even if he were</seg><seg type="columnLine">beaten he would lose no prestige. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">match was between a lightweight and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">welterweight. Jack Dempsey, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">begun to promote bouts in Chicago, was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">anxious to stage one between Miller and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sammy Mandell with the title of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">136-pound class at stake.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If he could have done so immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">after Ray had stopped McLarnin it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have been a huge money-maker.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That wasn't possible, however, but if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the left hook specialist made a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing this time the possibility of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">profit still existed. So Dempsey went</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Miller and offered him a date with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mandell if he was on his feet at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of his battle with McLarnin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That offer did more than anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">else to spoil what should have been a</seg><seg type="columnLine">really great fight. Ray was not a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cautious fighter under normal condi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions. He had always been willing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">take a chance. Now, however, too much</seg><seg type="columnLine">hinged on his showing to permit him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to take a chance. Had he gone out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought McLarnin, as he did in their</seg><seg type="columnLine">first meeting, it would have been a swell</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle and everyone would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead, he had Dempsey's offer on</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mind. A fight with Mandell for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightweight championship of the world!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He must be on his feet to get it. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">McLarnin clipped him with that right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand it would ruin everything. So the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little Chicago puncher went into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring with the single idea in mind of</seg><seg type="columnLine">playing safe. He wouldn't give Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">a shot at his chin no matter what hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened. He was going to earn that bid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Well, the inevitable happened, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course. Miller played too safe. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't take any sort of a chance. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">kept in his shell from start to finish. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be admitted that Jimmy was none</seg><seg type="columnLine">too hot himself, as the saying is. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a poor night, and combined with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ray's safety first tactics, the most bally-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hooed bout between little men in years</seg><seg type="columnLine">fizzled off into an uninteresting ten</seg><seg type="columnLine">round you-grab-me-and-ril-grab-you af-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The gate was a vast one, and the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turns for both fighters top-notch. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was too bad that their performance was</seg><seg type="columnLine">so disappointing. As ft happened,</seg><seg type="columnLine">58</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Miller didn't get his big chance with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mandell after all, for Dempsey decided</seg><seg type="columnLine">not to go through with the bout. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">Kay had gone in, traded with McLarnin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fought a slashing battle whether he</seg><seg type="columnLine">won or lost, he would have been better</seg><seg type="columnLine">off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmy, however, hadn't lost any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his popularity in New York. Getting</seg><seg type="columnLine">men who had a chance with him was</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite a different matter, or even men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to take a chance with him. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">life of a matchmaker is full of troubles</seg><seg type="columnLine">and problems. This fellow won't fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">that one, or the other chap wants so</seg><seg type="columnLine">much money that there is no sense in</seg><seg type="columnLine">putting him on. It would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">good business for Madison Square</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garden to feature Jimmy McLarnin at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least once a month, but where could you</seg><seg type="columnLine">find enough opponents?

He was a modest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown-eyed, boyish youngster, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned to box and play basketball in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the Henry Street Settlement on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">East Side. He had every apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">requisite to become one of the greatest</seg><seg type="columnLine">lightweights of all time. He boxed bril-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liantly, and was a deadly hitter. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">start of his career he had scored twenty</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight victories, fourteen by knock-</seg><seg type="columnLine">outs, when he was matched with Ace</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hudkins at Coney Island.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He gave Hudkins a fine trouncing</seg><seg type="columnLine">for three rounds, and in the fourth</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped him. But the rugged Nebraska</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wildcat climbed to his feet and knocked</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruby out with a terrific smash to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Goldstein started all over again. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">flattened Pete Petrolle* Sig Keppen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnny Ceccolli and Ray Mitchell, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave Jimmy Goodrich a fine pasting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he met Sid Terris and the drama</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Hudkins was reenacted. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">setbacks apparently ruined Ruby's in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terest. He fought only occasionally,</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed for bouts and ran out on them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Though only twenty-three years old,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it looked as though his ring career was</seg><seg type="columnLine">over. He had saved fifty thousand dol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lars, and had about decided to enter</seg><seg type="columnLine">some business and forget the gloves al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">together wheti he met a girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She was of his own people and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">own neighborhood. It galled her that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruby Goldstein should be called a quit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. She urged him to go back into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">game to make good for her sake, if not</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own, this time. So, at the start of</seg><seg type="columnLine">1929, the mild Mr. Goldstein renewed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his campaign for greatness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In quick succession he stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">Freddy Mueller, Joe Reno, Joey Kauff-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man, Cuddy DeMarco and Billy Drako.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No great fighters among them, true</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough, but they were veterans who</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew how to take care of themselves.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruby looked so good that his partisans</seg><seg type="columnLine">flocked to him once more. He had failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in his two biggest shots, but he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't fail them now. Ruby Gold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stein was a second Benny Leonard, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'd prove it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So a match was made with Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">McLarnin.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Baby-Face Terror</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">59</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The East Side was more than hope-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful. It was willing to bet that its idol</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been made over. A girl had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. No more debacles like those with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hudkins and Terris. Goldstein was</seg><seg type="columnLine">really on the road now. The news-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paper observers and the bettors were</seg><seg type="columnLine">not so optimistic. They were not con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vinced that the intuitive fighting spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Jewel of the Ghetto had lacked in</seg><seg type="columnLine">other encounters could be supplied</seg><seg type="columnLine">overnight in this way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The intimation was not that Goldstein</seg><seg type="columnLine">lacked courage. It wasn't that. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">rather a lack of competitive spirit.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruby could be brave enough, but sim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ply could not whip himself to his high-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est pitch when most was demanded of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Had he possessed that attribute</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might have gone on to a champion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship. For he had every physical asset.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McLarnin, a student of the opposi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion he was called upon to face, did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not believe that Ruby had changed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">believed that the boy would be frozen</seg><seg type="columnLine">with stage fright at the very beginning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the battle. If he succeeded in get-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting by a few rounds he might find a</seg><seg type="columnLine">new esprit. He would become more</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more dangerous with the passing</seg><seg type="columnLine">moments. The thing to do would be to</seg><seg type="columnLine">overwhelm him at the start. Not give</seg><seg type="columnLine">him a chance to get set. Batter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">smash and hack the heart out of him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite the fact that Jimmy was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">3-to-l favorite and was generally</seg><seg type="columnLine">tabbed to win by a knockout, the bout</seg><seg type="columnLine">excited the greatest attention in New</seg><seg type="columnLine">York. The East Side has always stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">staunchly by its own. It stood now by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ruby, hoping against hope. The aver-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age ring fan, who knew that Goldstein</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hit with anyone of his weight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that when two punchers get to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether drama hangs breathless in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">balance. So Madison Square Garden</seg><seg type="columnLine">was packed the night Jimmy McLarnin</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Ruby Goldstein met.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Baby Face came with Pop Foster</seg><seg type="columnLine">and that cagey old second, Doc Bagley.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Jewel of the Ghetto was backed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Abe Attell and Whitey Bimstein, mas-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ters of the corners. Ruby was solemn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost frightened looking. Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">smiled a little. This might very easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the easiest fight of his life--or the</seg><seg type="columnLine">toughest. He couldn't know in advance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he did know that no one who could</seg><seg type="columnLine">punch as Goldstein could should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">rated as a set-up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hadn't this soft-eyed boy put Ace</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hudkins on the floor, and was there a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tougher soul on all the green footstool</seg><seg type="columnLine">than this same Hudkins? Ruby could</seg><seg type="columnLine">blast with either hand, and there was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">guesswork about that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Baby Face looked across at his rival's</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner. Attell and Whitey were laugh-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing and patting Goldstein on the back.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Trying to laugh some confidence into</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. That's what they were doing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before leaving his dressing-room Ruby</seg><seg type="columnLine">had told some of the newspapermen that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would win by a knockout in four or</seg><seg type="columnLine">five rounds.

Jimmy, in a crouch, his lips</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawn back from his white teeth pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tector, waded in grimly. It was ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent that Ruby was nervous. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">jabbed and jumped away before a re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn could be made. McLarnin rushed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging. He missed. Ruby poked with</seg><seg type="columnLine">another jab and sprinted off, high on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the balls of his feet. There was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">power in his jabs. They were merely</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentative pokes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy kept pressing in. Bang!</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's the right. How do you like</seg><seg type="columnLine">that, Mister? Goldstein's down. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Garden is filled with a bedlam of</seg><seg type="columnLine">screams. Goldstein down on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">haunches, dazed and frightened, a look</seg><seg type="columnLine">of appeal in his brown eyes. Why</seg><seg type="columnLine">should you hurt me? . . . Why . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">He's up again, dancing away, poking</seg><seg type="columnLine">frantically with his left in an effort to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep off the merciless Irish boy. Keep</seg><seg type="columnLine">him off? You can't do it. Yes, Gold-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stein is the same fighter he always was.</seg><seg type="columnLine">60</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A champion against the second-raters;</seg><seg type="columnLine">a second-rater against the champions.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why can't he keep his head and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nerves ? He's good enough to box with</seg><seg type="columnLine">anybody, but look at him! All at loose</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends. He can't do anything right. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">knockdown might not mean anything</seg><seg type="columnLine">with some men, but it's the finish with</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. No matter what happens after-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, that first knockdown was the real</seg><seg type="columnLine">finish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Look at McLarnin drive him to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ropes!

Oh . . . oh . . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bell!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a vast sigh of relief from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the galleries, where Goldstein's friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">were packed. He was past the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">round. Maybe in this minute's rest he</seg><seg type="columnLine">would find himself. Maybe he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">get over the palsy that gripped his</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles in this big moment. If he did</seg><seg type="columnLine">he yet might beat McLarnin. His sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">onds are working desperately. They're</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking to him--Abe Attell, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the greatest featherweight cham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pions that ever lived; Whitey, who has</seg><seg type="columnLine">few superiors as a second. They're try-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to inject some of their own spirit</seg><seg type="columnLine">in him. Come on, Ruby. Get your-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self together! Your girl, your friends</seg><seg type="columnLine">--everybody is watching . . . Beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">this guy and you'll be in the million-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dollar class.

Fight!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ruby went out to give the best he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had. He met a tigerish boy, who with</seg><seg type="columnLine">head down and fists flying, drove him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ropes. Nothing Goldstein could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do was enough to keep McLarnin off.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy was certain of himself. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">smell of victory was in his nostrils.

The lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tern-jawed Baltimorean had guarded his</seg><seg type="columnLine">title so carefully, permitting no one a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot at it, that interest in the division</seg><seg type="columnLine">had waned.

One</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Young Jack Thompson, whom Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">McArdle, matchmaker at the Garden,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was anxious to toss in with Jimmy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thompson was a slim brown panther</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a man, a fine boxer and a hard hitter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had knocked out Joe Dundee in two</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounds, and had stopped Harry Kid</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brown, Jack Silver, Red Herring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harry Dudley, Johnny Adams, Russie</seg><seg type="columnLine">LeRoy and others. A sweet fighter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and one who had never shown his wares</seg><seg type="columnLine">in New York.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sometimes it is almost incredible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me how the bookmakers figure the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances of rival fighters. Jimmy Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Larnin is undoubtedly one of the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting men, inch for inch, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">modern game has seen. He can punch</seg><seg type="columnLine">and box, has courage, brains and ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">instinct. In short, he is everything a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good fighter should be.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All that is admitted, but Jack Thomp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son's record showed that he was a star</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his own right. He had beaten many</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">good men. How in the name of com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon sense McLarnin could be quoted</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a four-to-one favorite is almost im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible to understand. No one as good</seg><seg type="columnLine">as Thompson should be on the short</seg><seg type="columnLine">end of four-to-one against any man of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his weight. It isn't in the cards. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">that is exactly how they figured the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown man's chances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This is what happened:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As is usually the case when Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">fights, the Garden was packed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">crowd was crazy about him. It gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thompson a good hand, too, consider-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the tact that he was totally unknown</seg><seg type="columnLine">in those parts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They traded pretty evenly in the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">round. Jack showed himself a good</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxer, a snappy hitter and a smart ring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. He found out very soon that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">best way to counteract Jimmy's terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">blows was to keep crowding so that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't get entirely set.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He won the second round, after tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a few solid belts around the waist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">line, whipping in a fast uppercut that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had plenty of damage in it. McLarnin</seg><seg type="columnLine">landed one right-hander high on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown boy's head--and snap! His hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">went. Jimmy felt the bone break on an</seg><seg type="columnLine">old injury. The pain was numbing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knew that, except for defense, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fist would be useless for the remainder</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fight. Thompson would soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">find out that something was wrong. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">counteract the loss of that weapon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy stepped faster. He won the</seg><seg type="columnLine">third and fourth, carrying the fight to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thompson and lashing away with his</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hook, while making threatening ges-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures with the right. Jack wasn't hurt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He drifted about like a brown shadow</seg><seg type="columnLine">and rolled with the blows that landed--</seg><seg type="columnLine">a boxer who knew what it was all about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then the brown man, sensing what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the matter, went out himself. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore into Jimmy like a tiger. McLar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nin's nose was cut. He swung wildly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the body, and was warned by the ref-</seg><seg type="columnLine">eree. Thompson's seconds urged him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be more careful, but he believed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had a chance to knock out the good-</seg><seg type="columnLine">62</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">looking white boy and put himself in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big money. At the end of the sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enth round he had a distinct edge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll have to step out, Jimmy,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Pop. "You ain't goin* so well.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This Thompson guy has something on</seg><seg type="columnLine">you, up to now.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">bluffed with his right, missing always,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but wreaking execution with his left.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just as the bell sounded for the eighth</seg><seg type="columnLine">and ninth rounds he let fly with the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jured fist, landing on the body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That made the whole fight pretty even</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they waited to go out for the final</seg><seg type="columnLine">round. The winner of those last three</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes of struggle would come pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to earning the decision. Both men</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that, I think. Jimmy did, at any</seg><seg type="columnLine">rate. He was a good judge of pace.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He always knew to a fine point what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was needed of him, and he understood</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as well what he was capable of</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing. He had enough stuff left to carry</seg><seg type="columnLine">things to Young Jack Thompson. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was still strong and able, even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right hand was swollen and painful.</seg><seg type="columnLine">With both fists working, McLarnin was</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain that he would have won easily,</seg><seg type="columnLine">possibly have knocked out this slim pan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ther. But beating a good two-handed</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighter with one hand is a job for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">master. The last round would be hot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the broken digit had to go--well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">let it go. Being beaten by Thompson</seg><seg type="columnLine">at this stage of the proceedings would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be fatal. It would cast a pall over a</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fields-McLaruin battle for the welter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight championship of the world. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be the greatest set-back Jimmy</seg><seg type="columnLine">had ever run into. That last round must</seg><seg type="columnLine">go to him. Nothing else was conceiv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. The bell sent them out.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JIMMY roared and slashed and raved.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He hit with both, hands, the left to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the head and the right to the body. Pain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was nothing. Bursting, straining lungs</seg><seg type="columnLine">were nothing. He kept close to Thomp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son. He never let the brown-skinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">body dance away out of danger. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">hung on like a leech, pounding, pound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thompson, fine fighter that he was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">failed to stem the tide. He couldn't'</seg><seg type="columnLine">get set for his own punches. The play</seg><seg type="columnLine">was taken out of his hands. The rip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping attack of the Irish boy drove him</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a leaf before the gale. Time after</seg><seg type="columnLine">time he stood up to the punches, trying</seg><seg type="columnLine">to break through with his own batteries,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the hammering was too much for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. It would have been too much, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think, for any welterweight in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. McLarnin was fighting mad;</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to throw away his future, if need</seg><seg type="columnLine">be, to win this fight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The last gong sounded in the midst</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a roar from the spectators. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a champion's finish. No one could</seg><seg type="columnLine">dispute it. It was a winner's finish, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was enough to snatch the decision</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of Thompson's waiting hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They clapped each other on the back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and went to their corners to await the</seg><seg type="columnLine">official decision from Joe Humphries.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When Joe had collected the slips from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the judges and referee he walked over</seg><seg type="columnLine">to McLarnin and lifted his soaked glove</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the age-old token of victory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was one of the most popular deci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sions ever given in the Garden. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">idol of the fans had snatched it from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the burning, when it seemed that defeat</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be his portion. It should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been a lesson, too, to those optimists</seg><seg type="columnLine">who bet four-to-one that Thompson</seg><seg type="columnLine">would lose. There is no such thing as</seg><seg type="columnLine">a four-to-one shot when two first-class</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting men face each other in the ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We must leave Jimmy McLarnin at</seg><seg type="columnLine">this stage of his career.

When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally hangs up his gloves for the last</seg><seg type="columnLine">time, he will--with a smile from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fates--have compiled a record worthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of standing with the historic ones of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE END</seg><seg type="columnLine">SOCKER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DOOLEY,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FIGHTING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">GOLFER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  By CHARLES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  FRANCIS COE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">This time, his squared circle was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">golf links, the bright sun his spot-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, and on his ability to sock a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little white ball rested his reputation</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a mauler of men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IT was Artie Coombs's big idea.

Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">too, he really had an inventive turn to</seg><seg type="columnLine">that mind of his which made up good</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff for any one's newspaper.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once let Artie roll into an editor's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">presence with the silk handkerchief</seg><seg type="columnLine">hanging so far out of his breast pocket</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he seemed to be in danger of trip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping over it, his smile working overtime</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his story all neatly typed and held</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his left hand while his right grasped</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of the victim, and something was</seg><seg type="columnLine">going to be printed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then knowing Artie will enable you</seg><seg type="columnLine">to understand coming events.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big idea appeared in the form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a story which had Socker Dooley tak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up the gentle and aristocratic game</seg><seg type="columnLine">of golf.

He won. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">honor was his; dubious, but his.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Guess we're all set to go," he said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Hand me th' whacker, kid!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Little Bobbie Aldrich always did have</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot of sense for a kid, so he drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth the driver and handed the ringster</seg><seg type="columnLine">a ball.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take a little sand out 6f that box,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Socker," he coached; "make a tee, set</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ball on it and take your time. Don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">press and be sure to keep your eye on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ball."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Watch me go, kid. I'm gonna bust</seg><seg type="columnLine">that pill where it's tender!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SOCKER made the tee and stood the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball upon it. Then he took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">driver and assumed his stance. For a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wholly extemporaneous one it wasn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad. True, he took hold of the club</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a bat and glared at the ball with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">venomous purposefulness. The crowd</seg><seg type="columnLine">milled and whispered. That disturbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">Artie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fore!" he called sharply.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How do you make that out!" de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded Socker. "I ain't even had one</seg><seg type="columnLine">swipe at it yet!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Never mind, Socker. I wasn't talk-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to you. Everything is all right; you</seg><seg type="columnLine">just play the game. Lay her right down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the middle, old boy. Nice and firm, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't press."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Once again Socker turned to the busi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness in hand. He waved the club men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acingly, cast his huge arms upward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirled like a dervish and flailed away.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There came a shower of dust and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">muffled report of club against ball.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then a deadly silence.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where is it ?" Socker asked. "I hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">it an awful belt!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But not a man in the crowd could an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">swer. A second before the ball had</seg><seg type="columnLine">Socker Dooley, Fighting Golfer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">67</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">been there, now it was gone. For at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least twenty seconds there was complete</seg><seg type="columnLine">bafflement. Then there came a dull thud</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the ball rolled back onto the tee.</seg><seg type="columnLine">All eyes turned toward the sound. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw Red Mulrain reeling around with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one hand clapped to the top of his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his knees wabbling like the legs of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a country hotel bureau.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Foul! Foul!" the manager mumbled.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Th' thing's a plant." Then, as his</seg><seg type="columnLine">faculties returned somewhat he charged</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Socker, and only a burly sergeant of</seg><seg type="columnLine">police cheated the crowd out of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">real fun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's all right, Red," one of the sports</seg><seg type="columnLine">writers assured him. "It just happened.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I've seen a dozen balls hit that way.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Socker didn't mean it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The official scorer marked down one</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroke for Socker and the job was up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to Jimmie McKone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The trouble with that shot was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you stood too close to the ball after hit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ting it, Socker," grinned Artie. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">man could be a press agent without a</seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of humor. And with all the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ergy Socker had put into that shot, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball now lay some ten feet away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But things quickly adjusted them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves. Jimmie took three swings in</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid succession. Which means that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">first two missed entirely. The third</seg><seg type="columnLine">darted happily off the toe of the club</seg><seg type="columnLine">and was saved from a long flight out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bounds only by the interference of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bench.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every one saw the bench stop the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball. The pellet hit the boards and shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight up into the air. "Pretty lucky,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">grinned a spectator. But, almost as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though the remark had tempted fate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ball dropped again to the bench and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then took a graceful little loop straight</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the bucket of water on the first tec!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Play it out! Play it out!" shrieked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the watchful Artie. "It's a fair hazard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lengthy conference decided that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Artie was right. Jimmie took his driver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mounted the bench and took one lusty</seg><seg type="columnLine">whale at the bucket. The bottom sprung</seg><seg type="columnLine">loose and a stream of dirty water</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">trickled forth, but the ball remained</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">secure.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rather than dwell upon detail we will</seg><seg type="columnLine">quote results. When finally Jimmie was</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear of the bucket and his ball once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more lay in the fair, he had taken eight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">een strokes and been presented with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">summons for destruction of public</seg><seg type="columnLine">property.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But they were off. Down the fair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way beckoned the velvety green where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two must soon pay for their folly</seg><seg type="columnLine">or collect their just reward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dooley away," chanted the scorer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Try an' get me away! After that</seg><seg type="columnLine">guy loses out before he gets started?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, no, Socker. He means you are</seg><seg type="columnLine">farther from the hole than McKone, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">you shoot now," explained Artie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't use that same stick, Socker,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">little Bobbie coached. "Take this mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron and don't try to hit it hard. Just</seg><seg type="columnLine">dribble along to the green. You got it</seg><seg type="columnLine">won now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Socker's idea was for the spectac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ular. With a margin in his favor such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he had, disaster seemed endlessly</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "All I gotta do is win the first hole.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That gives me a sock at this gink's</seg><seg type="columnLine">chatter channel. After that he won't</seg><seg type="columnLine">even see a ball."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can't tell, Socker," warned</seg><seg type="columnLine">Artie. "He looks pretty tough."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yeah. But I'll just miss his chin far</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough to close his eyes. How can he</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit that dodgin' domino with his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut ? I can't with 'em open !"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SOCKER took the iron, waved it</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully and planned his shot. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">heard Bobbie urge that he keep his left</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm straight and keep his head down.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He did both. He swung and the ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">began a flight that would have made</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sarazen green with envy. True and far</seg><seg type="columnLine">it sped. The crowd gasped in amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment at its marvelous soaring. Watched</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathless until it finally landed dead</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of the fairway and leaped grace-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully toward the green.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Oh, now I get the idea better,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">68</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">nodded Socker. "I got th' secret now!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He followed along as the perspiring</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmie took lour more shots to catch</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with him. Socker lay two, Jimmie</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-two. Things looked sweet for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Th' first hole was for a smash on th'</seg><seg type="columnLine">chin, Jimmie," Socker reminded his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rival as they tiearcd the green.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'd rather take it than try to hit that</seg><seg type="columnLine">fool ball any more! 1 told Red he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">carryin' a yegg into church when he gets</seg><seg type="columnLine">me onto this daisy an' dandelion em-</seg><seg type="columnLine">porium!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Sockcr grinned. All confidence now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stepped up to his ball, looked calmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the green and repeated, as he thought,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his last shot. And it looked as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had, for a moment. The ball started</seg><seg type="columnLine">out well, but suddenly seemed attracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">by something off its course. In a wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">but rapid sweep it curved to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After that it curved some more, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then kept on curving in an ever increas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing scope until the ground under its</seg><seg type="columnLine">flight ceased to be the smooth, open fair-</seg><seg type="columnLine">way and altered into stubble, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">"rough" of a menacing nature and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">finally, into wavy, long sward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Socker watched this unexpected de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">velopment in somewhat awed amaze-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Never had he seen such a queer</seg><seg type="columnLine">doings. Ilis mental category had failed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to embrace such a thing as a "slice" and</seg><seg type="columnLine">as for the physics back of it--well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the old gentleman under the</seg><seg type="columnLine">apple tree! The only difference is that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fruit missed Socker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Is there sumthin' up there!" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped. As if trying to determine the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cause of the unfortunate phenomena his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes remained fixed in an effort to trace</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tiling to its source.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good night!" cried Bobbie Aldrich.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"We'll be lucky to find that at all.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That's a terrible place!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He done sumthin' to me ball, that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he done!" Socker suspected any</seg><seg type="columnLine">one at a time like this.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">And to make matters worse an extra</seg><seg type="columnLine">caddie appeared at that moment carry-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a large, square box. Somehow it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was familiar to Socker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lad walked straight up to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">police sergeant and offered the box for</seg><seg type="columnLine">inspection. Then Socker saw what it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was. A set of boxing gloves!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The only way you can pull off this nut</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea is in conformity with the law," the</seg><seg type="columnLine">official announced. "I can see that one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of you swamp rats is due for a sweet</seg><seg type="columnLine">pasting in another hundred yards and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">won't stand for bare knuckles!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They trooped excitedly to the point</seg><seg type="columnLine">where the ball had seemed to land. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">most interested parties arrived first, fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed by about a thousand of the gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lery. A lost ball is ever a source of</seg><seg type="columnLine">worry and dismay, but in this case it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was destined to delay arrival at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green and that crowd was anxious to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the first score paid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have five minutes in which to</seg><seg type="columnLine">find your ball," Jimmie's scorer an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nounced. "If in that time you have not</seg><seg type="columnLine">succeeded you lose the hole. This is</seg><seg type="columnLine">match play."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They hunted feverishly for three of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the precious five. At the end of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">time they were exactly where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">started and Socker was showing con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable concern. Then it was that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Artie's fertile brain began to work. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">sidled about until he secured another</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball which he secreted in the palm of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Four minutes came and went and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloating look upon the face of Red</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mulrain enraged Socker to the point of</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction. Four and a half minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">--then a shout from Artie.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here it is--I have it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Every one rushed toward him and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Socker heaved a sigh of infinite relief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a lie!" shouted the suddenly in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">furiated Red Mulrain. "I been stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">in' on his ball for three minutes!''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ONCE more the police prevented</seg><seg type="columnLine">sudden death. Socker did his best</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get at Red, but to no avail. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he did finally place himself for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next shot he was dismayed to find</seg><seg type="columnLine">Socker Dooley, Fighting Golfer</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">69</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">his ball ground so deep into the clinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass and soggy earth that he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was endless argument, but no</seg><seg type="columnLine">final decision. Any ruling was a pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cedent. Both scorers begged the ques-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. "It all comes down to the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that golf is supposed to be a gentle-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man's game and it's catching some ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rible abuse around here," one of them</seg><seg type="columnLine">declared. "Play the shot as it lies, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you lose the hole you can protest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Socker began whittling away. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">incomprehensibly arduous and unprofit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able. His shoulders were draped with</seg><seg type="columnLine">grass, his mouth was filled with flying</seg><seg type="columnLine">mud and his muffled curses and strokes</seg><seg type="columnLine">plenteous before he found the ball once</seg><seg type="columnLine">more on the fairway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "McKone is away?" said the scorer</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultimately. Socker welcomed the breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing space. "Shoot, McKone. You lie</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty-two--Dooley twenty-six 1"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My gosh! An' they call this gulf a</seg><seg type="columnLine">game!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten minutes later--forty since leav-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the tee, both men got onto the green.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmie lay thirty-nine while the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">that could be counted for Socker was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">snappy forty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jimmie was away. Using the same</seg><seg type="columnLine">swing as he juggled with his driver, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">putted. The ball gyrated across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">green in the general direction of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cup, but so far past it that he still was</seg><seg type="columnLine">away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again he putted. This time the gal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leries held their breath. For better than</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty feet the ball rolled true on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">course to the cup. Then it stopped. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">even so it hung on the very lip of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cup. That left Jimmie a clean forty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">two, for by no conceivable chance could</seg><seg type="columnLine">he miss his next shot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It also meant that Socker had to sink</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fifteen foot putt in one to win; or</seg><seg type="columnLine">two to halve.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Under the dutiful and not inexpert</seg><seg type="columnLine">guidance of Bobbie Aldrich, Socker</seg><seg type="columnLine">planned his shot. Very carefully he</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung. The crowd gasped in astonish-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Straight as a die the ball coursed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">over the green; right up to the cup--</seg><seg type="columnLine">where it collided with Jimmie's with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gentleness of a downy caress, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced off to the left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Jimmie's ball did not glance. No.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It teetered a fraction of a second then</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped neatly into the cup. Jimmie</seg><seg type="columnLine">had won on Socker's shot. J immie was</seg><seg type="columnLine">down in forty-one. With a yell of de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light he motioned the police officer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began swinging his arm by way of tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a hazy moment Socker hesitated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he strode across the green and</seg><seg type="columnLine">held forth his chin while a big glove</seg><seg type="columnLine">was slipped onto Jimmie's mitt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While the crowd held its breath in</seg><seg type="columnLine">expectancy, Jimmie measured his man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Putting every ounce of his experience</seg><seg type="columnLine">and strength into the move, he drove</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right fist against the Dooley jaw.

Then, too, when Flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in one of his frequent moods, Bill</seg><seg type="columnLine">Purdy, remembering his angry wish,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was filled with self-reproach.

The ebony-skinned</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant towered more than six inches</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the man who was recognized as</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion. Burns was no more than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">light-heavy weight, though that pound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age packed on a frame that measured</seg><seg type="columnLine">no more than five feet seven and a half</seg><seg type="columnLine">inches made him look squatty and thick.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In one way, though, Burns was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">freak.

He was not only the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">referee in Australia, but had vitally at</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart the task of seeing that this bout</seg><seg type="columnLine">was really 011 the level. To his knowl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge the men intended doing their best</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he wanted to be in supreme com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand, to act if he saw anything sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">picious.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He called the rivals to the center of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring. Johnson towered high above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white man. He smiled, showing his</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashing gold teeth. It was the smile</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a good-natured boy. Jack had many</seg><seg type="columnLine">faults. He was wild and irresponsible,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but was a friendly fellow who wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">people to like him. Burns, on the other</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, was grim and scornful. He acted</seg><seg type="columnLine">as though Johnson was an inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">loper, a fool who was going to take a</seg><seg type="columnLine">good trouncing for daring to challenge</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The champion was seconded by Keat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, O'Keefe, O'Donnell, Burke and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Russell. Johnson was accompanied by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sam Fitzpatrick, Rudy LTnholz, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Boer lightweight, Bryant, Mullins and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill Lang, an erstwhile Australian op-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ponent. McIntosh announced that if</seg><seg type="columnLine">the police should stop the bout he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">award the decision to the man in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lead at that time. This met with every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">one's approval. Photographs were taken,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the bell rang.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BOTH men were cautious at the start.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They fiddled around, sparring for</seg><seg type="columnLine">an opening. Each had a deep respect</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the other, even if lie hadn't admitted</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, and was not inclined to take chances.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then those.who had bet 2-to-l 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallant Tommy were given a terrific</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shaken, though not vitally hurt.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the psychology of the thing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now all with the black man. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">shown Burns that he could hit. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">Famous Fights I Have Seen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">85</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shown even more clearly that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not afraid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Tom stayed down for a count of</seg><seg type="columnLine">eight. His head was clear and he nodded</seg><seg type="columnLine">reassuringly toward his seconds, but a</seg><seg type="columnLine">knockdown is a knockdown and he de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">termined to take advantage of all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">time possible. ITe sprang suddenly to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his feet and charged at Johnson, swing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jack blocked his lead and countered</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a smashing right that sent Tommy</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggering across the ring. The Cana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dian, though, was tough and game. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulled himself together and came back</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a wildcat, landing a stiff right to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his enemy's jaw and smothering the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">fellow's attempted returns. But John-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son hooked in a powerful left just be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the bell sounded for the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the round, and Burns went back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">his corner with a serious look on his big</seg><seg type="columnLine">face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was every reason for him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be serious. Johnson had shown him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self an excellent boxer and a sharp</seg><seg type="columnLine">hitter. Tom's ears still rang with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rattle of blows on his chin. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't discouraged. He told himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would soon get to Johnson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. The Texas negro would curl up</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he was battered there. Sure, he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">curl. All these fellows did.

He waved his</seg><seg type="columnLine">gloves with a wide smile, and shouted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Come on, Tommy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Burns needed no invitation. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged across the ring and was met</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a left hook that swept his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">out from under him. Down he went,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but leaped up immediately. He tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get into the stomach, but Jack beat</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to it, burying his left fist wrist</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep in the Canadian's body. He fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed up his advantage, landing with</seg><seg type="columnLine">both hands to the face. Tom's left eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to swell and turn an ugly bluish</seg><seg type="columnLine">color.

After</seg><seg type="columnLine">landing a sharp right to the head, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ripped Jack's body with both hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Texan was borne back by the fury</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the assault. For a time he couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">block those fists that rattled off his</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle. The only execution he did was</seg><seg type="columnLine">by landing some frightful blows over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">kidneys when they clinched. These hurt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Tommy was so elated at his success</seg><seg type="columnLine">in taking the fight into the Johnson</seg><seg type="columnLine">camp that he didn't mind them. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was winning. From now on it would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fight. Why, the big stiff might be</seg><seg type="columnLine">as tall as the Woolworth Building. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't matter. He'd get him, anyway.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Jack seemed untroubled when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the next round started. He lashed a</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy right-hander to Tommy's heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Canadian retaliated with an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other. They began making remarks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">each other, bitter, sarcastic things. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneered at color, religion and courage.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They were each intent on getting the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other excited. As they talked they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fought their way in and out of clinches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but did no appreciable damage. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked queer in the clinches, with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant colored man towering so high</seg><seg type="columnLine">above Burns.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To the casual onlooker who might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">just wandered in, without a knowledge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of either man's capabilities, this must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seemed a most uneven battle. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">it wasn't uneven. Freshened by his</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute's rest Burns flared out to pepper</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnson with both fists in the fifth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">win that round with plenty to spare.</seg><seg type="columnLine">86</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JOHNSON, though, was as coolly</seg><seg type="columnLine">confident as ever. He seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">feel that he had the. Canadian at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mercy; that it was in the books for</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to win. Though he didn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">much of a lead up to this point he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">sampled the best punches Tommy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his repertoire and had not been hurt</seg><seg type="columnLine">or bothered by them. So, in the sixth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he took the aggressive himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He went after Burns, and Tommy</seg><seg type="columnLine">hustled himself into a clinch. Holding</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his left Jack burned his right fist</seg><seg type="columnLine">into his opponent's side a dozen times.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those blows hurt. They would drain</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyone's stamina. Burns, realizing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he wasn't strong enough to cope with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnson in the clinches, broke loose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and let go a rapid-fire of blows to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. Johnson laughed at them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That all the harder yon c'n punch,</seg><seg type="columnLine">little man?" he jibed. "Huh, somcbuddy</seg><seg type="columnLine">tole me you was a hitter. Must've been</seg><seg type="columnLine">somebuddy else he meant. Yo' can't hit</seg><seg type="columnLine">a-tall."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With that he bustled Tommy across</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring, driving rights and lefts to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stomach so fast that Burns simply had</seg><seg type="columnLine">to cover up and run. He couldn't get</seg><seg type="columnLine">started against that whirlwind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At that point the champion began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose some of his high confidence. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">wasn't a lack of courage on his part.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had never quit in his life, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not going to quit now. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">realized the tremendous handicap he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">facing. If Johnson merely had size it</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't matter so much. But backing</seg><seg type="columnLine">up his much greater strength was won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful boxing skill and accurate hitting.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The man was a real fighter. It would</seg><seg type="columnLine">be a tough job to beat him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the sixth round had been bad for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burns, the seventh was worse. John-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son had the smell of victory in his nose.</seg><seg type="columnLine">1 fe wanted to win as quickly as possible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The big man didn't box in that sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enth round. He fought. lie pounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tore Tommy with both hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burns kept his head. He was cool, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew exactly what he should do if his</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical limitations permitted. Once,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in the midst of a fierce attack, he sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnson back on his heels with a hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">left hook, but there were lumps under</seg><seg type="columnLine">both eyes now, and he was tiring.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The discolored orbs were targets, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">viting marks for Johnson to shoot at.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He landed repeatedly and talked to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">people at the ringside about how easy</seg><seg type="columnLine">he found it to whip his opponent. Burns</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't lose his head even then. Tie kept</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooting at the shiny black body before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, but Johnson, as though to show</seg><seg type="columnLine">his versatility, switched from the head</seg><seg type="columnLine">and knocked Tommy down with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vicious hook to the ribs. The champion</seg><seg type="columnLine">came up quickly, mad as a dripping</seg><seg type="columnLine">cat, but the knockdown counted against</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He came up for the eighth, eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">puffed and with a drip of blood on his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lips. An intolerable weariness had set-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tled on him. There was no longer any</seg><seg type="columnLine">sting in his punches. Several times,</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost disdainfully, Johnson allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">openings, but Burns couldn't take ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vantage of them. In the meantime the</seg><seg type="columnLine">big stevedore was hacking and lashing</seg><seg type="columnLine">at Tommy's head, adding further to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">damage lie had done. Even Burns must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have known that only a miracle could</seg><seg type="columnLine">save him. It looked as though Johnson</seg><seg type="columnLine">might score a knockout at any moment,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but those who expected it did not count</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Canadian's courage and great</seg><seg type="columnLine">stamina.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Jack taunted Tom writh the ineffec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiveness of his blows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Swing your right, Tommy," he</seg><seg type="columnLine">sneered. "Swing it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You yellow dog!" Burns snarled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing into action. He was burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">with rage. It didn't matter what hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened to him now. There was only one</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing in the world that was worth doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that wotdd bring him joy and con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentment--and that was to bash and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bruise the man opposite. lie couldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">achieve that desire. He found the range</seg><seg type="columnLine">too great.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tenth was slow. Johnson, tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">from his tremendous exertions.

Jack, his body wet</seg><seg type="columnLine">with sweat that made it gleam like pol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ished walnut, used his fists effectively</seg><seg type="columnLine">against Tom's head and body. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">latter fought back gamely. He gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything he had, but seemed singularly</seg><seg type="columnLine">ineffective. He was outclassed. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew it. Johnson was invulnerable. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the round Tom limped back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his distressed seconds, a battered,</seg><seg type="columnLine">weary man on the edge of disastrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">defeat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The twelfth coming up! The twelfth</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming, and again the little Canadian</seg><seg type="columnLine">was subjected to a frightful battering.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His eyes were almost closed. His jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">was swollen to almost twice its normal</seg><seg type="columnLine">size. The fight having been well and</seg><seg type="columnLine">gamely fought so far, now degenerated</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a test between Johnson's hitting</seg><seg type="columnLine">power and Burns' failing stamina.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tommy was dazed. He hardjy knew</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he was, or what he was doing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Only the instinct of a game man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep on his feet kept him moving for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ard, always forward into the swirl of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the merciless Johnson fists. Mercy had</seg><seg type="columnLine">no place in that ring. The champion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship was at stake, and then there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the implacable feud between these two.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burns had lashed him with stinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">words. Why shouldn't he be paid back</seg><seg type="columnLine">with blows?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnson continued to play for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swollen eyes and bleeding mouth with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his accurate blows. He hit and hit and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit at the disfigured face. He put</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything he had into those punches,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Burns refused to go down. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggered about, blind to everything, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavering reed in a gale, but was still</seg><seg type="columnLine">on his feet, enduring the battering when</seg><seg type="columnLine">the harsh-throated bell saved him for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the moment.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That skimpy rest period could do</seg><seg type="columnLine">him no good.

His seconds soaked him with</seg><seg type="columnLine">water and jammed smelling salts under</seg><seg type="columnLine">his nose. Burns shook his head</seg><seg type="columnLine">to clear it a little more. He had just</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough vitality left to get him to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet and out to the center of the ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the fourteenth round.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnson feinted and then let the</seg><seg type="columnLine">right go.

Game</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy staggered. Tom's red and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blinded face was toward his foe, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he could do nothing to protect him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McIntosh might have stopped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight then. Under ordinary circum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stances he would have done so, but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a championship ibout and tradition</seg><seg type="columnLine">demanded that when a champion fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishes, he must finish on his back. TTis</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconds, knowing Tom's courage, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">not throw in the towel. They'd let him</seg><seg type="columnLine">take it because he wanted no interven-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion. So the referee held his hand, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">hoping that Johnson would do the job</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly. It didn't look as though there</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be much difficulty about that.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was a commotion at the ring-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side.

A new</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion had been crowned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THIS was a 'battle that deserved to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be rated among the great ones. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">is true that Johnson outclassed Burns</seg><seg type="columnLine">after the first six rounds; that he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">88</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">so clever and shifty; that Tommy was</seg><seg type="columnLine">seldom able to rcach a vital spot. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was true that Johnson jolted and jarred</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white man continually, that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved himself a greater defensive</seg><seg type="columnLine">boxer, a harder hitter and a better ring</seg><seg type="columnLine">general than the Canadian.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But don't forget that Tommy Burns</seg><seg type="columnLine">faced a handicap of six inches in</seg><seg type="columnLine">heighth and almost twenty pounds in</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight; that seldom in any champion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship affair has there been such a vast</seg><seg type="columnLine">difference in physical prowess. Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">has never been rated as highly as he</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have been because of this dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">astrous bout at Rushcutters Bay. How</seg><seg type="columnLine">many light-heavyweights--and that is</seg><seg type="columnLine">all lie was--could have compiled as fine</seg><seg type="columnLine">a record as he did, and could have gone</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourteen fast rounds with the Jack</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnson of that day?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnson really had everything. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">the veterans concede that he rated with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greatest heavyweights of all time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That Burns fought him as he did, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">indicative that he had some elements of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fistic greatness himself. Looking back</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is incredible that Tom should have</seg><seg type="columnLine">•been rated a favorite, but Johnson's</seg><seg type="columnLine">record, for this reason or that, had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been so impressive up to then.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Burns was born Noah Brusso in Han-</seg><seg type="columnLine">over, Canada. The Dominion to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">North has produced great soldiers--as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Princess Pat and other regiments</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved in the World War--but very</seg><seg type="columnLine">few good heavyweight fighters. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were jack Munroe and Victor McLag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">len and Jack Renault, and others of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stripe and pattern, but they never went</seg><seg type="columnLine">very far with their fists. Burns was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pick of the lot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It may be that he doesn't deserve to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rank with Fitzsimmons, Corbett and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jeffries. He lacked the physical quali-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fications of those champions. But he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was as brave and smart as any one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thorn, a good boxer and a sharp hitter.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tie was rightfully the champion of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">day--in the hiatus between Jeffries and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnson--and there was no reason why</seg><seg type="columnLine">there should have been any question</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">about inscribing his name on the Mul-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">doon trophy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twenty-one years elapsed between</seg><seg type="columnLine">his start and finish as a fighting man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He numbered Jim Flynn, Philadelphia</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack O'Brien, Marvin Hart, Bill Squires</seg><seg type="columnLine">and others among his victims. That he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hit is proven by his record of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty-four knockouts in fifty-seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">fights. They didn't feed him pushovers,</seg><seg type="columnLine">either. ITe had to fight for everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">he got.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Tommy Burns you see around</seg><seg type="columnLine">nowadays--a fat, powerful man--car-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ries no hint of the little fighting fury</seg><seg type="columnLine">of twenty years ago.

At his very best</seg><seg type="columnLine">he never compared with the big, lazy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold-toothed stevedore from Galveston.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Johnson had everything.

Naturally, he became</seg><seg type="columnLine">careless. That was what the Cockney</seg><seg type="columnLine">was waiting for. He landed a right-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hander flush on the chin with everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had. If the man had been ten years</seg><seg type="columnLine">younger Burns would have been</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked out then and there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An indescribable change came over</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tommy. He turned to cold fury.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There was a terrible viciousness about</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. With two minutes of the round</seg><seg type="columnLine">still to go he went to work on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cockney. Pie worked so well that after</seg><seg type="columnLine">a minute the promoter jumped into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring and led the bleeding, stricken En-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glishman back to his corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Will I do?" asked Tommy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do," said the promoter. "Boy,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">you'll be a champion some day."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He really believed it and intended</seg><seg type="columnLine">managing the boy, but becoming en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangled in the details of his skating</seg><seg type="columnLine">rink, passed it up. In later years he</seg><seg type="columnLine">moaned over his lost chance, but that</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't do him any good.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Anyway, Tom's meeting with the big-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot and his fight with the Cockney</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to inspire him. TTe went further</seg><seg type="columnLine">afield and began winning steadily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After a few years he assumed a leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">role among the heavyweights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Conditions among the big fellows</seg><seg type="columnLine">were in a rather chaotic state. Jeffries,</seg><seg type="columnLine">on retiring, presented his crown to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winner of the bout between Marvin TTart</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Jack Root--T Tart, a big, clever Ken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tuckian stopping Root in twelve rounds.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burns beat TTart, who had already out-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed Jack Johnson, and claimed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">championship. He beat Philadelphia</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jack O'Brien and other stars to cement</seg><seg type="columnLine">his claim.</seg><seg type="columnLine">90</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">JOHNSON was coming along, too,,</seg><seg type="columnLine">The huge negro whipped Joe Jean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nette, Sandy Ferguson, Jim Flynn, Bob</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fitzsimmons and others. He went to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Australia and knocked out Peter Felix</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Bill Lang, who had been regarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">as great fellows iby the natives of Pago</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pago, Iiobartstown and Ballard. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipped them more decisively than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burns had done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All this time he continued to hurl</seg><seg type="columnLine">challenges at Tommy, and Tom turned</seg><seg type="columnLine">a deaf ear to them. It wasn't that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sturdy little Canadian feared Jack. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew that Johnson was a better man</seg><seg type="columnLine">than any he had fought, but was quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">confident he could whip him. However,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while he was making money with easier</seg><seg type="columnLine">marks his reluctance drummed up pub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lic interest in a bout that was inevitable.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tommy went off to England. John-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son didn't 'have a dollar, ibut his man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ager, Sam Fitzpatrick, borrowed enough</seg><seg type="columnLine">from friends to take them to London.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still Burns wouldn't listen. He hastened</seg><seg type="columnLine">to France and then to Australia, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he triumphed over the already beaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">Squires and Lang. In the eyes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aussies Tom was a hero and the great-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est fighter in the world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile in England Johnson had</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipped A1 McNamara and Ben</seg><seg type="columnLine">Taylor, but there was little money and</seg><seg type="columnLine">less renown in that. Fitzpatrick inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ested members of the National Sporting</seg><seg type="columnLine">Club in the big fellow and they gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">him the money required to get to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Australia. Assistance was rendered</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Johnson agreed to come back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">London and fight Sam Langford re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gardless of the result of the match with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burns. This promise, incidently, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">never kept.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Johnson and Fitzpatrick ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rived in Sydney they found that Tommy</seg><seg type="columnLine">still had the upper hand. He was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion and the big Galveston black</seg><seg type="columnLine">was only a rather despised challenger.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The newcomer was informed that if he</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted a fight he would have to accept</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom's terms. This wasn't news in any</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">sense of the word. It was expected that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the champion would get the lion's share</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the purse. Champions always did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hugh McIntosh, who promoted bouts</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Rushcutter's Bay Stadium offered</seg><seg type="columnLine">a purse of $35,000. Sounds laughable,</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't it, in these days of high finance?</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it was real money then, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">principals were agreeable. Burns, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, demanded $30,000 for his end,</seg><seg type="columnLine">win, lose or draw. That was drawing</seg><seg type="columnLine">it a bit fine. After paying their debts</seg><seg type="columnLine">and expenses there wouldn't be much</seg><seg type="columnLine">left.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Johnson didn't care. He was so con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fident he could whip the little Canadian</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he would have agreed to an even</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller reward. After all, the immedi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ate results of a championship were</seg><seg type="columnLine">small compared with what came later.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tommy was a psychologist. He be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lieved that Jack suffered under an in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feriority complex. He continually</seg><seg type="columnLine">harped on his ability to whip the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">man. He claimed that Johnson was yel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low and had shown a lack of courage on</seg><seg type="columnLine">more than one occasion. He was so</seg><seg type="columnLine">brash and sure that much of the 2-to-l</seg><seg type="columnLine">odds quoted in Burns' favor was due</seg><seg type="columnLine">to these verbal assaults.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The quiet boy of Port Huron had</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed somewhat. This was natural.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Burns was smart, quick to take advan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tage of an opening. He knew as well</seg><seg type="columnLine">as anyone that Johnson had a world of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability and all the physical advantages.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Those advantages must be minimized</seg><seg type="columnLine">by instilling a doubt in Jack's mind. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">must be bothered. Of course.

In the same ring, ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">actly one year and seven days previously, the Filipino had knocked Singer</seg><seg type="columnLine">cold as a wedge.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The battle was a classic of ring history, sensational from the tap of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening gong until the end of the last round. Fight critics agree that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranks with the best contests in the lightweight division since the historic</seg><seg type="columnLine">battles between Leonard and Tendler a dozen years ago. Singer opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">by knocking the tough Filipino flat in the first round for the first knockdown</seg><seg type="columnLine">recorded in the long career of the brown-skinned lad. Again, in the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, Fernandez hit the canvas. Thereafter, the slugging continued with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out a pause, and at the end Singer, the Bronx Bombardier, held a command-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing lead. At times, it appeared that the Filipino would go down for the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">count, but his extraordinary stamina carried him through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Singer's feat in decisively beating an opponent who had previously hung</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kayo sign on him, is one infrequently chronicled in prize ring annals. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes one back to the classic battles of Stanley Ketchel and Bill Papke.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ketchel was middleweight champion of the world when he was knocked out</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Papke--and then came back a short time later to reverse the situation and</seg><seg type="columnLine">regain the title. Other champions and near-champions have tried the feat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but when a fighter has once hung the kayo sign 011 an opponent, the mental</seg><seg type="columnLine">hazard of entering the ring again with such a conqueror has been almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">insurmountable, and few have shown the ability, courage and determination</seg><seg type="columnLine">to come off victors in a subsequent encounter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Look for the bulVs-eye	on fhe magazines you buy*</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The sterling-silver hall-mark of action-ad venture fictionl</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Fight--Sept.--7</seg><seg type="columnLine">FIGHTERS ALL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">By ARTHUR J.

O'Baldwin did likewise, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the same goes for Joseph Wormald.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McCool, though he had been defeated</seg><seg type="columnLine">by Joe Coburn in sixty-seven rounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">the year Allen arrived, began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">attract notice, despite that defeat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">105</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Jimmy Dunn, a good one, had beaten</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bill Davis in forty-three rounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> McCool took on the tough Mr. Davis</seg><seg type="columnLine">(and made a much ibetter job of whip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ping him than had Dunn. It took Mike</seg><seg type="columnLine">thirty-four rounds and, as bare-knuckle</seg><seg type="columnLine">things went in those glorious beef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brine clays, it was considered a spiffy</seg><seg type="columnLine">jolb.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Allen was trying to get a real line on</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ihis own ability and on Dunn, Davis and</seg><seg type="columnLine">McCool. So he ups and challenges</seg><seg type="columnLine">Davis. William lingered about for</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortv-three rounds. This -brought Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cool, three years later, right up to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">match for the title against Allen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Wormald and O'Baldwin had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">haggling between themselves, and Wor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mald finally ducked back to England.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had the tough ones on this side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the water. There was a lot of present-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day method in Joe's madness. He chal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lenged O'Baldwin, whom he seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fear more than Allen. I suppose he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had real reason to fear. Ned was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">giant, and Mike Donovan, the old mid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dleweight war-horse, once told me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Baldwin was the greatest fighter that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever lived. He laughed when I asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">him if John L. Sullivan couldn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">whipped Ned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There never was a man of O'Bald-</seg><seg type="columnLine">win's speed and power in the ring,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Donovan. "Ned could leap over</seg><seg type="columnLine">an ordinary man's head, and could run</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster backward than the casual man</seg><seg type="columnLine">could run forward. He liked his rum</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and his rum got him in the end," said</seg><seg type="columnLine">Donovan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> O'Baldwin refused to go back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">England to fight after having posted</seg><seg type="columnLine">a $1,000 forfeit and Wormald claimed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the money. This enraged O'Baldwin,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and he challenged Wormald to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">back, which the chump did! Ned</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked him kicking in ten minutes of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting in the first round. You know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in those days, a round didn't end until</seg><seg type="columnLine">one or the other was brought to earth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The police jumped in and Ned got the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money and the glory. This battle took</seg><seg type="columnLine">place near Lynfield, Mass., 1868.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That fight spelled the finish of</seg><seg type="columnLine">O'Baldwin. He never again figured</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the all-important ones. His dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearance from the limelight left it</seg><seg type="columnLine">right up to McCool and Allen to settle</seg><seg type="columnLine">the row about the world's title.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE was a situation almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">identical with that of Sharkey and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Schmeling, except that Max, of course,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was in there the other night fighting as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the European and German champion.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sharkey, like McCool, was glad to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">known as the American title-holder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then came the first real world's</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavyweight championship 'bout.

As Tom had gone into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight claiming the title, Mace assumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was to be the wearer of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crown from that point on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Allen, before the fight, said that Mc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cool's claim couldn't stand up on its</seg><seg type="columnLine">own hind legs, so Mace made the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the situation. The defeat by Mace</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't dampen Allen's ardor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Mace went on to meet Joe Coburn</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the American title. They fought a</seg><seg type="columnLine">draw, and then up foobbed McCool</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, challenging Allen. They met,</seg><seg type="columnLine">this time at Allen's lucky spot, St.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Louis, Mo.

This was in 1873.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Three years later, Allen lost his place</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the sun when Joe Goss loomed up</seg><seg type="columnLine">as an opponent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again Allen was guilty of an illegal</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow.

He</seg><seg type="columnLine">never set eyes on the freckled one until</seg><seg type="columnLine">they came into the ring at New Orleans.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dempsey took one look at the amazing</seg><seg type="columnLine">physical freak before him, the light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight legs and the heavyweight arms</seg><seg type="columnLine">and torso.

What I have to say here ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plies directly to ninety out of every</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred present-day fighters. An old</seg><seg type="columnLine">art of the ring is going a-begging, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighters are paying the penalty. You'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">never catch a fighter of the old school</seg><seg type="columnLine">entering a ring without an expert in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">corner. Today, there isn't one second</seg><seg type="columnLine">in five who knows his business, but the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighters don't seem to know or care.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I've been following the fight game for</seg><seg type="columnLine">forty-five years and I know something</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it. My warning to every fighter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">young or old, is to make sure that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">has a real second to advise him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner. If you're a fighter, don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">put your trust in any hanger-on that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">meet in the gymnasium. Spend the</seg><seg type="columnLine">money and get a recognized expert to</seg><seg type="columnLine">watch you. Then see that he gets the</seg><seg type="columnLine">authority to tell you what to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the heat of battle few boxers are</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to do more than press home their</seg><seg type="columnLine">attack in their own peculiar style and</seg><seg type="columnLine">guard themselves from the attack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their foes. When gloves are dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">back and forth in front of your eyes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it's hard to appraise your opponent skill-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully and detect hidden weaknesses. A</seg><seg type="columnLine">George Dixon or a Young Griffo might,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but such super-boxers are born, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">made. Most men in the ring have to</seg><seg type="columnLine">depend upon the observations of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">handlers in the corner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When you're at the average fight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">listen to the seconds talking to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go on, boy. Step in! You're doing</seg><seg type="columnLine">good''--and more of the same. Fine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sounding, encouraging words.

There's no time to experiment</seg><seg type="columnLine">when a man is in the ring. His handler</seg><seg type="columnLine">must instantly know what to do.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The thorough second makes it a point</seg><seg type="columnLine">to understand his own man.

He is able to judge accu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rately his man's ability to take and give</seg><seg type="columnLine">punishment. He can judge if his man is</seg><seg type="columnLine">in condition for a tough fight, if his</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs will stand up under him if he at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempts much feinting or side-stepping.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He knows if his man can mix up his</seg><seg type="columnLine">punches.

He can watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a round or two and get a pretty</seg><seg type="columnLine">accurate idea of just how the opponent</seg><seg type="columnLine">measures up in all these respects. If his</seg><seg type="columnLine">man is leg weary or arm weary, he can</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell him how to stall and guard himself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It stands to reason that the man with</seg><seg type="columnLine">such a second has a big edge on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">other fellow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In my opinion, the trainer should be</seg><seg type="columnLine">the second, provided he possesses the</seg><seg type="columnLine">required knowledge of ring generalship.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Some trainers of today, although efficient</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it comes to conditioning a fighter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">aren't much use in the spot decisions</seg><seg type="columnLine">which must be made in the corner.

Fights arc lost con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly because the handlers can't stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bleeding from eye gashes. Good</seg><seg type="columnLine">trainers know the proper solutions and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the proper nursing tricks. Inexpert</seg><seg type="columnLine">trainers and inexperienced seconds don't.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many seconds of today don't seem to</seg><seg type="columnLine">care what happens to their men. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">aren't taking the punches and they are</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting paid whether their men win or</seg><seg type="columnLine">lose. Wise-cracks take the place of</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge. The inevitable result is the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruination, in two or three years, of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who lets such second-raters serve</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his corner. I don't care how good a</seg><seg type="columnLine">prospect a fighter is. He can't last un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less his ring advisers are skillful, care-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful men. Many youngsters, punch-drunk</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a few years in the ring, would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the top if they had followed such ad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vice as this article contains.

If</seg><seg type="columnLine">he has handled himself properly, having</seg><seg type="columnLine">let his serious fighting wait until he first</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned how to box and protect him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, he should be in A-l condition when</seg><seg type="columnLine">he retires. There is big money in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">game today, and any clever youngster</seg><seg type="columnLine">with courage and good sense can get</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself a slice of it. But it takes time</seg><seg type="columnLine">and patience -- plus scientific handling</seg><seg type="columnLine">both outside and at the ringside. No</seg><seg type="columnLine">youngster of promise should take</seg><seg type="columnLine">chances on trainers or handlers. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">should deal only with reliable, expe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rienced men. Such men can be found</seg><seg type="columnLine">in every sizeable city, if a young man</seg><seg type="columnLine">will only look for them and not trust</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much to chance acquaintanceships</seg><seg type="columnLine">and chance meetings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fifteen or twenty years ago every</seg><seg type="columnLine">man who stepped in the corner as a sec-</seg><seg type="columnLine">114</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Fight Stories</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ond was an expert trainer.

If the man</seg><seg type="columnLine">won, the second probably got $150.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There weren't so many of us in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">game then, and there wasn't a week that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I myself didn't second four or five</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighters. But what we got we earned for</seg><seg type="columnLine">we knew our business, and the fighters</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew we did.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the first place, most of the men I</seg><seg type="columnLine">seconded were men trained by myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">or by good trainers whom I knew. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighters came to the ring properly con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditioned to do their best for the par-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticular distance they were required to go</seg><seg type="columnLine">--six, eight, ten or fifteen rounds. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the most part they were fighters tough-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened by far more rigorous training</seg><seg type="columnLine">methods than are employed today, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to battle hard for fifteen rounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">and be fresh at the finish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There were no "hot-house" fighters a</seg><seg type="columnLine">generation ago. The men didn't have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the money for expensive camps and im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ported chefs. They trained in cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">barns, and when they wanted a shower,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they stood under a big can in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">holes had been punched while someone</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured in a bucket of cold water from</seg><seg type="columnLine">above. Rigorous treatment, but it made</seg><seg type="columnLine">tough bodies. Men would go fifteen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty and twenty-five rounds and show</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarcely a mark afterwards. Nowadays</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood flows freely in almost every six-</seg><seg type="columnLine">round go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">IGHTERS of that older day, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew how to box. There was little</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wild swinging which marks three-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters of the ring engagements of to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">day. When a man let fly a punch, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">knew where it was going to land. Thus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had good material to work with from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corner. It was wit against wit. craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">against craft on the part of the second.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To them, also, each fight was a personal</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter. Every second tried to outguess</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opposing second, and guided his</seg><seg type="columnLine">man every step of the way. For in-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stance, if an opposing fighter was using</seg><seg type="columnLine">a straight left constantly, the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">was expected to tell his fighter how to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away from it and how to attack in</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn. When I saw an opponent who used</seg><seg type="columnLine">his left hand regularly, I'd advise my</seg><seg type="columnLine">man: "Slip his left and drive your right</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand to the heart." If an opponent was</seg><seg type="columnLine">using a left-hand hook to the body, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">told my man how to move so that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hook would go harmlessly around his</seg><seg type="columnLine">body while he was getting home a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">right-hand blow to the jaw.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The seconds knew the value and mean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing of the counter-punch, which is not</seg><seg type="columnLine">well understood today. The counter is</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a defensive tactic. It's one of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most effective offensive blows the game</seg><seg type="columnLine">knows. You catch your opponent's blow</seg><seg type="columnLine">on your arm--on the inside of his arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">of course--and, before he can recover,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoot your same arm forward for his</seg><seg type="columnLine">unprotected body or jaw. Handled</seg><seg type="columnLine">properly it's a deadly punch.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When Henry Persson, the Swedish</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighter, first came to this country, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">taught him the counter and he became</seg><seg type="columnLine">the greatest counter fighter I have ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. In the semi-final of the Dempsey-</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tunney match at Philadelphia, Persson</seg><seg type="columnLine">knocked out Jack Adams with counter</seg><seg type="columnLine">punches. He beat Johnny Risko with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the counter, and to my mind was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">logical man to have faced Tunney for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the championship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Harry's disqualification in his fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Bud Gorman always has seemed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">me a most unfortunate happening for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ring. It angered Persson because he</seg><seg type="columnLine">always insisted that he had not struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gorman a foul blow, and he never would</seg><seg type="columnLine">train for his few subsequent fights. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">could have licked both McCarthy in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hartford and Jimmy Maloney if he'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">really tried.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The counter punch requires a strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">forearm to take up the shock and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">limber wrist to deliver the snap blow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Many seconds of the present have only</seg><seg type="columnLine">a vague idea how it works and can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">advise their men on its use.

In the excite-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment of the fight, a man can't listen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">two or three voices jabbering in his ear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One is plenty. The second must be cool</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that he can make sure his advice gets</seg><seg type="columnLine">home in the minute of rest between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Tom O'Rourke taught me that lesson.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the manager of George Dixon and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the handler of Tom Sharkey and Joe</seg><seg type="columnLine">Walcott and scores of other great fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers of the past, he proved himself one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the greatest ringside advisers ever</seg><seg type="columnLine">known. He acted as second himself, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he let me help him second Dixon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sharkey, Walcott and others. But Tom</seg><seg type="columnLine">was boss at the ring and his instructions</seg><seg type="columnLine">were plain and blunt:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Jimmy, watch closely for any mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">takes our man or the other fellow may</seg><seg type="columnLine">make.

In the early days of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">training and seconding, I would ask the</seg><seg type="columnLine">manager if I were to advise the tighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the ringside, or if he intended to give</seg><seg type="columnLine">advice. If the manager intended to talk</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his man, I always announced that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not be responsible for the fight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">er's work, although I would give him</seg><seg type="columnLine">what advice I could.

A battle is fought. A great event</seg><seg type="columnLine">happens. A great man is born and dies. That seems to be the end of it. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing is as simple as it seems. In the workshop of human destiny nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">is lost, nothing disappears forever. A generation or two later--or maybe a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of hundred years, or a thousand or so--the same sequence turns up. A similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle is fought. Similar events occur. A great man is born with form and fea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures similar to those of a forerunner; and, more remarkable still, as his career</seg><seg type="columnLine">unrolls, it is seen to resemble detail by detail the life of his predecessor who lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty or a hundred or a thousand years ago.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Historians tell us that our own</seg><seg type="columnLine">George Washington was a dead ringer</seg><seg type="columnLine">for Cincinnatus, the general of old</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rome who lived long before the Chris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tian era. They say that the busts of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Roman and statues of our own first</seg><seg type="columnLine">president are so much alike that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not be told apart if it were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the difference in costume. Cin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cinnatus, like Washington, liberated his</seg><seg type="columnLine">land from a foreign foe. He fought his</seg><seg type="columnLine">battles of Trenton and Yorktown and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Washington, refused to be made</seg><seg type="columnLine">king by a grateful people and returned</seg><seg type="columnLine">to end his life as a country gentleman.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And so it goes in the great world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The little world of the ring, however, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as full of repetitions and coincid-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ences.

Even</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a pair of busted mitts he nearly mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dered big Jim Jeffries, the toughest heavy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of all time. After his second fight</seg><seg type="columnLine">with Ruby Robert, big Jim was the worst-</seg><seg type="columnLine">punished boxer who ever stood in a ring.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His right eye was cut completely around by</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fitz's terrible left, and his left eye was gashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">top and bottom and swollen shut. His nose</seg><seg type="columnLine">was beaten down level, and it took more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">eighty stitches to make even a partial job of</seg><seg type="columnLine">repair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Old Bob's hands gave way in the second</seg><seg type="columnLine">round, but he kept right on hitting with them</seg><seg type="columnLine">anyway. He could feel the bones rattling</seg><seg type="columnLine">around in his fists like ice in a water pitcher,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he kept on jamming in the punches, never-</seg><seg type="columnLine">the less.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the sixth he had big Jeff dazed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">staggering. Fitz often said he felt sure that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if he could have had either hand whole and</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid for thirty seconds at that time, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have emerged champion of the world. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fight. Jeff, the winner, looked as though</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had been run through a sausage machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while there wasn't a mark on Fitz, aside from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his mitts, which were done up in splints.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, take his fight with George Gardiner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was the greatest feat of gameness a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting man ever pulled off. Gardiner was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a big. strong, tough, clever fellow. He could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have licked nine-tenths of the heavyweights</seg><seg type="columnLine">of today. Fitz was about forty-five years</seg><seg type="columnLine">old when he took him on, and his hands were</seg><seg type="columnLine">always like chinaware after his fight with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jeffries. In the very first round he slammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his terrible left for the body and shoved it</seg><seg type="columnLine">into Gardiner's elbow. Pop !* went a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of bones. Still the freckled marvel fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">on, and was making a chopping block of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gardiner when along toward the middle of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fight he thought he had him feinted into</seg><seg type="columnLine">just the proper position for a knockout. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">old right mitt whizzed through the air for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gardiner's jaw. By a frantic wiggle the Bos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ton fighter just managed to pull down his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head enough so that the punch landed on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">top of his dome instead of his chin. Down</seg><seg type="columnLine">went Gardiner just the same. If his concrete</seg><seg type="columnLine">work hadn't been a foot thick and well re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inforced, he would have been out cold. As it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was, he managed to scramble to his feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">before the count of ten, and gradually his</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength came back.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With Fitz, the case was different. That</seg><seg type="columnLine">mighty wallop had busted his one good hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which made it rather awkward for Bob, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be left in the ring with a husky young near-</seg><seg type="columnLine">champion without a solid bone in either mitt.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fitz was nothing if not a man of courage</seg><seg type="columnLine">and resource, however. He didn't tell any-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body how badly his hands were hurt. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the rest of the fight he kept aiming</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific punches at Gardiner, which just barely</seg><seg type="columnLine">missed their mark. George had sampled those</seg><seg type="columnLine">punches, and he had no desire to run into</seg><seg type="columnLine">any more of them. So, by dint of swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">and missing and occasionally poking in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">punch on some soft spot. Fitz carried on to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end of the battle, gaining the referee's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">decision by a piece of bluffing unmatched in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring history.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> So much for Mr. Brainard. Which</seg><seg type="columnLine">brings us back to our beginning, as to</seg><seg type="columnLine">history repeating itself. That was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great battle Fitz fought against George</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gardiner, and a great feat of cunning</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gameness. It wasn't so long ago,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, that something very similar</seg><seg type="columnLine">was pulled and in a championship battle.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The hero of the incident was Bat Bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">talino, and the occasion was his feather-</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight championship contest with An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dre Routis. Early in the battle Bat</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed his left hand, his best mitt, on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Frenchman's head. Which left him</seg><seg type="columnLine">handicapped. He had landed a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of healthy lefts on the Frenchman, how-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, and implanted a mighty respect in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other's brain for that wing. So all</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the rest of the fight he kept on</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging with it just as Fitz had done</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him, taking care to miss by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fractional margin each time. By the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aid of this maneuvre and a lot of healthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">activity with the right, he got away with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the battle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And that is not all. It was necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">to operate to straighten out the bones</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hand, and the wound become in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fected. Bat's hand was a terrible sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Before winning the title, he had signed</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to fight Lew Massey in Philadelphia,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Bat is one of those fighters who</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes it his boast never to break an</seg><seg type="columnLine">engagement. In spite of the terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">condition of his mitt, he went over to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the City of Brotherly Love, where he</seg><seg type="columnLine">put up a hurricane battle against Mas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sey. After the bout, he fainted; and,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when they looked at the condition of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand, they knew why.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chairman of the Pennsylvania</seg><seg type="columnLine">Athletic committee censured the physi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cian who had pronounced Bat fit to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fight. Be that as it may, Bat had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">his fight and won under the same con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ditions and under the same handicap</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hampered Ruby Robert Fitzsim-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mons twenty-five years before, and his-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory had pulled another of its famous</seg><seg type="columnLine">repeats.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Neutral Corner	123</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Bare-Knuckle Days</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AN odd figure in the annals of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ring of the old bare-knuckle days</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Tom Cannon, the "Great Gun of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Windsor," heavyweight champion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">England from 1824 to 1827. Beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">being a first-class man with his fists,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tom had other accomplishments which</seg><seg type="columnLine">lent color to his character.

He was born at</seg><seg type="columnLine">Eton, England, in 1789, and won his</seg><seg type="columnLine">way to the top of the heavyweight heap</seg><seg type="columnLine">in 1824, at which time he was thirty-</seg><seg type="columnLine">five years old, losing it three years later</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the age of thirty-eight.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Like many other champions of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">British prize ring, Cannon worked as a</seg><seg type="columnLine">waterman, or "bargee." In his early</seg><seg type="columnLine">days he rowed a punt on the river</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thames for hire, graduating from this</seg><seg type="columnLine">occupation to the ring.

Only 3 short</seg><seg type="columnLine">months ago he was about as pitiful a specimen of man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hood as ever walked the earth. He "couldn't lift a</seg><seg type="columnLine">feather," and at the end of the day he was almost too</seg><seg type="columnLine">tired to drag himself home. The men in his office used</seg><seg type="columnLine">to laugh at his poor attempts to keep pace with them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But he learned the secret of scientific muscle-building</seg><seg type="columnLine">--of gaining tremendous strength in a hurry--and look</seg><seg type="columnLine">at him now. He's just one of the 100,000 men I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">rebuilt in the last 19 years.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">You Can Be Like Him</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Folks call me the Muscle-Builder.
