O'Conor Sloane, Ph.D.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">But there is more to be said than this. In all the physical</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, nothing is more essential to the life of man than rays.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Without rays the universe would cease to exist for mankind and</seg><seg type="columnLine">all life would vanish. This is a trite assertion, for we all know</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we depend upon the sun for the heat necessary to existence</seg><seg type="columnLine">and for light and that heat and light reach us by rays. Exactly</seg><seg type="columnLine">what rays are is none too certain. They are generally taken</seg><seg type="columnLine">as ether waves. Having given us the heat from the sun so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we can live, rays give us light from the same luminary so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we can see. But they do much more than this, for the light</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays of the sun have much to do with our health and life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Wireless communication is one of the wonders of the age, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">it is carried out by waves of ether comparatively long, con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stituting rays. These waves are so long that they carry neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat nor light, but they are the vehicles or pathway, as it may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">termed, for all sorts of impressed waves and these impressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon them at the sending station, give the sounds we listen to</seg><seg type="columnLine">from our radios, with far too little amazement.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Rays tend to spread over the spherical elements, of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">their point of origin is the center. This spreading weakens their</seg><seg type="columnLine">power .and forms one of the limitations to long-distance radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">work. Long ether waves are very intractable, and are hard to</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflect and refract, if we compare these qualities or factors to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the corresponding ones of light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">As we approach the region of the spectrum, the rays become</seg><seg type="columnLine">shorter and more tractable. They can be reflected and refracted</seg><seg type="columnLine">and give us heat and light. In the ultra-violet region of shorter</seg><seg type="columnLine">waves the actinic effects appear, and these rays are used as</seg><seg type="columnLine">remedial agents. They produce sun-burn. The still shorter X-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays produce another more intense and permanent burn and if</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough exposure is submitted to, they can slowly maim and kill.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They can pass through many substances. Lead is one of the best</seg><seg type="columnLine">shields.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">The Millikan, or cosmic ray, is far more penetrative than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">X-ray, and it is everywhere; several feet thickness of lead is</seg><seg type="columnLine">needed to shield it off. Its waves are very short. And now a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheerful theory has been advanced to the effect that cosmic rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">act to kill us, and that the cosmic rays may operate to shorten</seg><seg type="columnLine">our lives, to eventually prove fatal to every man. This curious</seg><seg type="columnLine">theory would make us immortal or nearly so, if the cosmic rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be cut off.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">It is a strange thought and an interesting one, that, except for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cosmic ray, we might live for years of many generations.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           JjHE subject of rays has been a great attraction for</seg><seg type="columnLine">speculative dreamers, who picture to themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">what rays may eventually be made to do. Rays are</seg><seg type="columnLine">invoked as acting upon distant objects. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">years ago we were told of rays which, directed</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon an automobile, would bring it to rest, inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fering with and nullifying the action of the electric ignition</seg><seg type="columnLine">system. A ray that could do this would have a wonderful effect</seg><seg type="columnLine">in war. An airplane's engine could be stopped and the aviator</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have to concernJjimselt with getting to a landing. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">two fighting planes used the ray on each other, both would go</seg><seg type="columnLine">down and be out of the fighting.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the World War there were two achievements impressive</seg><seg type="columnLine">by their originality and effectiveness. They also hold out a pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sibility of immense development. One was the long range</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Paris" gun, as it is sometimes called. This dropped shells of</seg><seg type="columnLine">about eight inches caliber into the city of Paris, some 75 miles</seg><seg type="columnLine">distant. The shells reached an approximate vacuum as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose, and their ballistic curve on this account must have ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proximated the parabola. The projectiles did comparatively</seg><seg type="columnLine">little harm. The effect was to frighten the enemy. The an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ticipation of the shells exploding in the heart of the city was</seg><seg type="columnLine">appalling. The worst injury to life was when, by an irony of</seg><seg type="columnLine">fate, one of them broke down the roof of a crowded church</seg><seg type="columnLine">and killed a number of non-combatants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suppose a ray could have been developed to interfere with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">infinitesimal action of the firing system of a gun--for every shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">solved a problem in higher mathematics--it would have seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">like a nullification of the greatest efforts of the artillerists. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray might have been produced in a distant airplane. But no</seg><seg type="columnLine">such ray has been discovered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tank is destined to play an increasing part in future wars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is being developed into a moving fortress. If the ray, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">can arrest the motion of a gas engine, were a true story, it could</seg><seg type="columnLine">do much to nullify the use of the tank, for the latter must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobile. Without mobility it is reduced to uselessness or near</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it When the account of the ray we speak of first appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the papers, many believed the stor)', as it was told, to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">effect that automobiles w7ere brought to rest from a distance by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the new emanation. The description read like a romance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The above is merely imaginary, and is written to bring out</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fact that there are undreamed of possibilities of developments</seg><seg type="columnLine">in rays, and that it is not safe to limit these possibilities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">293</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beginning a Thrilling New Serial</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">of Interplanetary Life and Travel	PART I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Edward E.

It was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">task of the chief pilot to hold the screened image of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cross-hairs of the two directors in such position relative</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ever-moving point of light as to hold the mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel precisely upon its course, in spite of the complex</seg><seg type="columnLine">system of forces acting upon it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For almost an hour Breckenridge sat motionless, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes flashing from micrometer screen to signal panel,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his sensitive fingers moving the potentiometers through</seg><seg type="columnLine">minute arcs because of what he saw upon the screen and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in instantaneous response to the flashing, multicolored</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights and tinkling signals of his board. Finally, far from</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth, the moon's attraction and other perturbing forces</seg><seg type="columnLine">comparatively slight, the signals no longer sounded and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the point of light ceased its irregular motion, becoming</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost stationary.

Power is generated by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great waterfalls of Tellus and Venus--water's mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">scarce on Mars, of course, so most of our plants there</seg><seg type="columnLine">use fuel--and is transmitted on light beams by means of</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful fields of force to the receptors, wherever they</seg><seg type="columnLine">may be. The individual transmitting fields and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptors are really simply matched-frequency units, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">matching the electrical characteristics of some particular</seg><seg type="columnLine">and unique beam-'of force. This beam is composed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Roeser's rays, in their energy aspect. It took a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to work out this tight-beam transmission of power,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was fairly simple after they got it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He took out a voluminous notebook, at the sight of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which Nadia smiled.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A computer might forget to dress, but you'd never</seg><seg type="columnLine">catch one without a full magazine pencil and a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">blank paper," he grinned in reply and went on, writing</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he talked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For any given frequency, f, and phase angle, tlieta,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you integrate, between limits zero and pi divided by two,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sine theta d. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hold it--I'm sinking!" Nadia exclaimed. "I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">integrate at all unless it is absolutely necessary. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">long as you stick to general science, I'm right on your</seg><seg type="columnLine">heels, but please lay off of integrations and all that--</seg><seg type="columnLine">most especially stay away from those terrible electrical</seg><seg type="columnLine">integrations. I always did think that they were the</seg><seg type="columnLine">most poisonous kind known. I want only a general idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">--that's all that I can understand, anyway."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, I forgot--guess I was getting in deeper than</seg><seg type="columnLine">is necessary, especially since this whole thing of beaxn</seg><seg type="columnLine">transmission is pretty crude yet and is bound to change</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot before long. There is so much loss that when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">get more than a few hundred million kilometers away</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a power-plant we lose reception entirely. But to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get going again, the receptors receive the beam and from</seg><seg type="columnLine">them the power is sent to the accumulators, where it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">stored. These accumulators are an outgrowth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">storage battery. The theory of the accumulator</seg><seg type="columnLine">is. ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Lay off the theory, please!" the listener interrupted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I understand perfectly without it. Energy is stored in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the accumulators--you put it in and take it out. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">all that is necessary."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"]TD like to give you some of the theory--but, after</seg><seg type="columnLine">-I all, it wouldn't add much to your understanding of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the working of things, and it might mix you up, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of it is pretty deep stuff. Then, too, it would take</seg><seg type="columnLine">a lot of time, and the rest of your friends would squawk</seg><seg type="columnLine">if I kept you here indefinitely. From the accumulators,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, the power is fed to the converters, each of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">is backed by a projector. The converters simply</seg><seg type="columnLine">change the aspect of the rays, from the energy aspect to</seg><seg type="columnLine">302</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the material aspect. As soon as this is done, the highly-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged particles--or whatever they are--thus formed</seg><seg type="columnLine">are repelled by the terrific stationary force maintained</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the projector backing the converter. Each particle</seg><seg type="columnLine">departs with a velocity supposed to be that of light, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the recoil upon the projector drives the vessel, or car,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or whatever it is attached to. Still with me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Struggling a little, but my nose is still above the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface. These particles, being so infinitesimally small</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they cannot even be detected, go right through any</seg><seg type="columnLine">substance without any effect--they are not even harm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ful."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Exactly. Now we are in position to go ahead with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lights, detectors, and so on. The energy aspect of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rays you can best understand as simply a vibration</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the ether--an extremely high frequency one. While</seg><seg type="columnLine">not rigidly scientific, that is close enough for you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">me. Nobody knows what the stuff really is, and it can-</seg><seg type="columnLine">not be explained or demonstrated by any model or con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cept in three-dimensional space. Its physical-mathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matical interpretation, the only way in which it can be</seg><seg type="columnLine">grasped at all, requires sixteen co-ordinates in four di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mensions, and I don't suppose you'd care to go into</seg><seg type="columnLine">that."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pll say I wouldn't!" she exclaimed, feelingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, anyway, by the use of suitable fields of force</seg><seg type="columnLine">it can be used as a carrier wave. Most of this stuff of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fields of force--how to carry the modulation up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down through all the frequency changes necessary--was</seg><seg type="columnLine">figured out by the Martians ages ago. Used as a pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrier wave, with a sender and a receiver at each end, it</seg><seg type="columnLine">isn't so bad--that's why our communicator and radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">systems work as well as they do. They are pretty good,</seg><seg type="columnLine">really, but the ultra-light vision system is something .else</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. Sending the heterodyned wave through steel is</seg><seg type="columnLine">easy, but breaking it up, so as to view an object and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn the impulses, was an awful job and one that isn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">half done yet. We see things, after a fashion and at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a distance of a few kilometers, by sending an almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">parallet wave from a twin-projector to disintegrate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">double back the viewing wave. That's the way the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookout plates and lenses work, all over the ship--from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the master-screens in the control room to the plates of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the staterooms and lifeboats and the viewing-areas of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the promenades. But the whole system is a rotten make-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shift, and ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just a minute!" exclaimed the girl. "I and every-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body else have been thinking that everything is abso-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lutely perfect; and yet every single thing you have</seg><seg type="columnLine">talked about, you have ended up by describing as 'un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known,' 'rudimentary,' 'temporary,' or a 'makeshift.'</seg><seg type="columnLine">You speak as though the entire system were a poor thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">that will have to do until something better has been</seg><seg type="columnLine">found, and that nobody knows anything about anything!</seg><seg type="columnLine">How do you get that way?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "By working with Brandon and Westfall.

"One thing I forgot</seg><seg type="columnLine">to tell you about--the detectors. They're worked on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">same principle as the lights, and are just about as effi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cient.

But times change,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the inefficient must go. She's a good old tub, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">she was built when everybody was afraid of space, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we had to put every safety factor into her that we could</seg><seg type="columnLine">think of. As a result, she is four times as heavy as she</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be, and that takes a lot of extra power. Her</seg><seg type="columnLine">skin is too thick. She has too many batteries of ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumulators, too many lif e-boats, too many bulkheads and</seg><seg type="columnLine">air-breaks, too many and too much of everything. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">is so built that if she should break up out in space, no-</seg><seg type="columnLine">body would die if they lived through the shock--there</seg><seg type="columnLine">are so many bulkheads, air-breaks, and life-boats that no</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter how many pieces she broke up into, the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vivors would find themselves in something able to navi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gate.

So, badly as I hate to see her go there, the old</seg><seg type="columnLine">tub is bound for the junk-yard."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A FEW more flights of stairs brought them to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">upper band of dirigible projectors, which encircled</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hull outside the passengers' quarters, some sixty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">belowT the prow. They were heavy, search-light-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">affairs mounted upon massive universal bearings, free</seg><seg type="columnLine">to turn in any direction, and each having its converter</seg><seg type="columnLine">nestling inside its prodigious field of force. Stevens ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plained that these projectors were used in turning the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vessel and in dodging meteorites when necessary, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">they went on through another almost invisible door into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hall and took an elevator down to the main corridor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, you've seen it, Miss Newton." Stevens said</seg><seg type="columnLine">regretfully, as he led her toward the captain's office.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"The lower half is full of heavy stuff--accumulators,</seg><seg type="columnLine">machinery, driving projectors, and such junk, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the center of gravity is below the center of action of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the driving projectors. That makes stable flight possible.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It's all more or less like what we've just seen, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't suppose you want to miss the dance--anyway, a lot</seg><seg type="columnLine">of people want to dance with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wouldn't you just as soon show me through the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">half as dance?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Rather, lots!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So would I. I can dance any time, and I want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see everything. Let's go!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Down they went, past battery after battery of ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cumulators ; climbing over and around the ever-in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creasing number of huge steel girders and bracers;</seg><seg type="columnLine">through mazes of heavily insulated wiring and conduits;</seg><seg type="columnLine">past mass after mass of automatic machinery which</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stevens explained to his eager listener. They inspected</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the great driving projectors, which, built rigidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">parallel to the axis of the ship and held immovably in</seg><seg type="columnLine">place by enormous trusses of steel, revealed neither to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the eye nor to the ear any sign of the terrific force it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was exerting. Still lower they went, until the girl had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been shown everything, even down to the bottom ultra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights and stern braces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tired?" Stevens asked, as the inspection was com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pleted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not very. It's been quite a climb, but I've had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful time."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So have I," he declared, positively. "I know what</seg><seg type="columnLine">--we'll crawl up into one of these stern lifeboats and</seg><seg type="columnLine">make us a cup of coffee before we clynb back.

Here, although no</seg><seg type="columnLine">emergency had been encountered in all the four years of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vessel's life, they found everything in readiness, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the two soon had prepared and eaten a hearty luncheon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, I can't think of any more excuses for monopo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lizing you, Miss Newton, so I suppose I'll have to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">you back.

"What</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that?" he exclaimed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What was what? I didn't hear anything?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Something screwy somewhere! I felt a vibration,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and anything that'd make this mountain of steel even</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiver must have given us one gosh-awful nudge.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There's another!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl, painfully tense, felt only a barely perceptible</seg><seg type="columnLine">tremor, but the computer, knowing far better than she</seg><seg type="columnLine">the inconceivable strength and mass of that enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">structure of solidly braced hardened steel, sprang into</seg><seg type="columnLine">action. Leaping to the small dirigible look-out plate, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned on the power and swung it upward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"/^REAT suffering snakes!" he ejaculated, then stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">VJ mute, for the plate revealed a terrible sight. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">entire nose of the gigantic craft had been sheared off in</seg><seg type="columnLine">two immense slices as though clipped off by a gigantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword, and even as they stared, fascinated, at the sight,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the severed slices were drifting slowly away. Swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">the view along the plane of cleavage, Stevens made out a</seg><seg type="columnLine">relatively tiny ball of metal, only fifty feet or so in di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ameter, at a distance of perhaps a mile. From this ball</seg><seg type="columnLine">there shot a blinding plane of light, and the Arcturus fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">apart at the midsection, the lower half separating clean</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the upper portion, which held the passengers.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leaving the upper half intact, the attacker began slicing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the lower, driving half into thin, disk-shaped sections.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As that incandescent plane of destruction made its first</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashing cut through the body of the Arcturus, accom-</seg><seg type="columnLine">panied by an additional pyrotechnic display of severed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and short-circuited high-tension leads, Stevens and Nadia</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly found themselves floating weightless in the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the room. Still gripping the controls of the look-out</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate, Stevens caught the white-faced girl with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, drew her down beside him, and held her motionless</seg><seg type="columnLine">while his keen mind flashed over all the possibilities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the situation and planned his course of action.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're apparently slicing us pretty evenly, and by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the looks of things, one cut is coming right about here,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he explained rapidly, as he found a flashlight and drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">his companion through the door and along a narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage. Soon he opened another door and led her</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a tiny compartment so low that they could not stand</seg><seg type="columnLine">upright--a mere cubicle of steel. Carefully closing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, he fingered dials upon each of the walls of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cell, then folded himself up into a comfortable position,</seg><seg type="columnLine">instructed Nadia to do the samer and snapped off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">light.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Please leave it on," the shaken girl asked. "It's so</seg><seg type="columnLine">ghastly!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'd better save it, Nadia," he advised, pressing her</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm reassuringly. "It's the only light we've got, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we may need it worse later on--its life is limited, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Later on?

Of course they may get us, Nadia, but this</seg><seg type="columnLine">little tertiary air-break is a mighty small target for them</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hit. And if they miss us, as I think they will, there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a larger room opening off each wall of this one--at least</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of which will certainly be left intact. From any one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of those rooms we can reach a life-boat. Of course, it's</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little too much to expect that any one of the life-boats</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be left whole, but they're bulkheaded, too, you know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that we can be sure of finding something able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">navigate--providing we can make our get-away.

"In that case,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'd never know what hit us, so it's no good worrying</seg><seg type="columnLine">about it.

Besides, it's getting cold in</seg><seg type="columnLine">here. One or two of the adjoining cells have apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">been ruptured and we're radiating our heat out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">space, so we'll have to get into a life-boat or freeze. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">go pick out the best one. Wonder if I'd better take you</seg><seg type="columnLine">with me, or hide you and come back after you? '</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't worry about that--I'm coming with you,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadia declared, positively.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Just as well, probably," he assSnted. and they set out.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A thorough exploration of all the tight connecting cells</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealed that not a lifeboat within their reach remained</seg><seg type="columnLine">intact, but that habitable and navigable portions of three</seg><seg type="columnLine">such craft were available.

One</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing I can do, though.

The upper half of the vessel was still intact, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower half a jumble of sharply-cut fragments. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">each of the larger pieces a brilliant ray of tangible force</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched outward. Suddenly their receiver sounded be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind them, as the high-powered transmitter in the tele-</seg><seg type="columnLine">graph room tried to notify headquarters of their plight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Areturns attacked and cut up being taken tow. . .</seg><seg type="columnLine">Rapidly as the message wras uttered the transmitter</seg><seg type="columnLine">died with a rattle in the middle of a word, and Nadia</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked at Stevens with foreboding in her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They've got something, that's one thing sure, to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">able to neutralize our communicator beams that way,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he admitted.

Several more lifeboats made the at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tempt, as the courageous officers of the Arcturus, some</seg><seg type="columnLine">of whom had apparently succeeded in eluding the vigil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance of the captors, launched the little shells from vari-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ous ports; but as each boat issued, its power was neutral-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ized and it found itself dragged helplessly along in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">grip of one of those mysterious, brilliant rays of force.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At least one hidden officer must have been watching the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fruitless efforts, for the next lifeboat to issue made 110</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt, either to talk or to flee, but from it there flamed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out into space a concentrated beam of destruction--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrible ray of annihilation, against which no known sub-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stance could endure for a moment; the ray which had</seg><seg type="columnLine">definitely outlawed war. But even that frightful weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">was useless--it spent its force harmlessly upon an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">palable, invisible barrier, a hundred yards from its</seg><seg type="columnLine">source, and the bold lifeboat disappeared in one blinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosion of incandescence as the captor showed its real</seg><seg type="columnLine">power in retaliation. Stevens, jaw hard-set, leaped from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the screen, then brought himself up so quickly that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">skated across the smooth steel floor. Shutting off the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lookout plate, he led the half-fainting girl across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room to a comfortable seat and sat down beside her--</seg><seg type="columnLine">raging, but thoughtful.

"I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoke this wreck," he decided, "while it's still smokable.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Well save the rest of them--I'm afraid it'll be a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">time between smokes. Well, let's confer!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This will have to be a one-sided conference.

Right?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You sound lucid.

Even when Jupiter is in mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">opposition to Mars, it is still some five hundred and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty million kilometers away, so you can form some idea</seg><seg type="columnLine">as to how far it is from our nearest planet now. No, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">we expect to get back under our own power, we've got</seg><seg type="columnLine">to break away pretty quick--these lifeboats have very</seg><seg type="columnLine">little accumulator capacity, and the receptors are useless</seg><seg type="columnLine">above about three hundred million kilometers. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But it'll take us a long time to go that far, won't it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not very.

He then exerted a very small</seg><seg type="columnLine">retarding force, so that their bit would lag behind the</seg><seg type="columnLine">procession, as though it had accidently been separated.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the crew of the captor was alert, and no sooner</seg><seg type="columnLine">did a clear space show itself between them and the mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">thaq. a ray picked them up and herded them back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">place. Stevens then nudged other pieces so that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell out, only to see them also rounded up. Hour after</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour he kept trying--doing nothing sufficiently energetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">to create any suspicion, but attempting everything he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could think of that offered any chance of escape from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clutches of their captors. Immovable at the plate, his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands upon the controls, he performed every insidious</seg><seg type="columnLine">maneuver his agile brain could devise, but he could not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">succeed in separating their vehicle from its fellows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Finally, after a last attempt, which was foiled as easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">as were its predecessors, he shut off his controls and</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned to his companion with a grin.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "I didn't think I could get away with it--they're keen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that gang--but I had to keep at it as long as it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have done us any good."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wouldn't it do us any good now?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Not a bit--we're going so fast that we couldn't stop</seg><seg type="columnLine">--we're out of even radio range of our closest power-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant.

As each bit left its</seg><seg type="columnLine">place another beam leaped out, until it became apparent</seg><seg type="columnLine">that no more were available, and Stevens strapped the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl and himself down before two lookout plates.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now for it, Nadia!" he exclaimed, and simultane-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ously threw on the power of his own projectors and sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">out the radio impulse which closed the relays he had so</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully set. They were thrown against the restraining</seg><seg type="columnLine">straps savagely and held there by an enormous weight</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the gigantic dirigible projectors shot their fragment</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the wreck away from the comparatively slight force</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had been acting upon it, but they braced them-</seg><seg type="columnLine">selves and strained their muscles in order to watch what</seg><seg type="columnLine">was happening. As the relays in the various fragments</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed, the massed power of the accumulators was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">shorted dead across the converters and projectors in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead of being fed into them gradually through the con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trols of the pilot, with a result comparable to that of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">explosion of an ammunition dump. Most of the masses,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose projectors were fed by comparatively few accu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mulator cells, darted away entirely with a stupendous ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">celeration. A few of them, however, received the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">impeded flow of complete batteries. Those projectors</seg><seg type="columnLine">tore loose from even their massive supports and crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">through anything opposing them like a huge, armor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">piercing projectile.

Hurry up--let's do something!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Pipe down, ace! Remember that we don't know any</seg><seg type="columnLine">more about anything around here than a pig does about</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sunday, and conduct yourself accordingly. Take it easy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm surprised at the gravity here. This is certainly Gany-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mede, and it has a diameter of only about fifty seven</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred kilometers. If I remember correctly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Damoiseau estimated its mass at about three one-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundredths that of the Earth, which would make its</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface gravity about one-sixth. However, it is actually</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost a half, as you see by this spring-balance here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Therefore it is quite a little more massive than has</seg><seg type="columnLine">been. . . ."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What of it? Let's go places and do things!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Calm yourself, Ginger, you've got lots of time--</seg><seg type="columnLine">we'll be here for quite a while, I'm afraid. We can't go</seg><seg type="columnLine">out until we analyze the air--we're sure lucky there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">as much as &lt;there is. I'm not exactly the world's fore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most chemist, but fortunately an air-analysis isn't much</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a job with the apparatus we carry."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> While Nadia controlled her impatience as best she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could, Stevens manipulated the bulbs and pipettes of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gas apparatus.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pressure, fifty-two centimeters--more than I dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope for--and analysis all x, I believe. Oxygen concen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tration a little high, but not much."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We won't have to wear the space-suits, then?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not unless I missed something in the analysis. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure corresponds to our own at a height of about</seg><seg type="columnLine">three thousand meters, which we can get used to without</seg><seg type="columnLine">too much trouble. Good thing, too. I brought along all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air I could get hold of, but as I told you back there,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">if we had to depend 011 it altogether, we might be out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck. I'm going to pump some of our air back into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cylinder to equalize our pressure--don't want to waste</seg><seg type="columnLine">any of it until we're sure the outside air suits us with-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out treatment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WHEN the pressure inside had been gradually re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced to that outside and they had become ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">customed to breathing the rarefied medium, Stevens</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened the airlock and the outside doors, and for some</seg><seg type="columnLine">time cautiously sniffed the atmosphere of the satellite.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could detect nothing harmful or unusual in it--it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">apparently the same as earthly air--and he became jubi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All x, Nadia--luck is perched right on our banner.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Freedom, air, water, power, and coal! Now as you</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested, we'll go places and do things!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Suppose it's safe?" Her first eagerness to explore</seg><seg type="columnLine">their surroundings had abated noticeably. "You aren't</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed, are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, and I don't believe that there was a gun of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind aboard the Arcturus. That kind of thing went out</seg><seg type="columnLine">quite a while ago, you know. We'll take a look, anyway</seg><seg type="columnLine">--we've got to find out about that coal before we decide</seg><seg type="columnLine">to settle down here. Remember this half-gravity stuff,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and control your leg-muscles accordingly."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leaping lightly to the ground, they saw that the sev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered section of fifty-inch armor, which was the rim of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their conveyance, almost blocked the entrance to the nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row canyon which they had selected for their retreat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Upon one side that wall of steel actually touched the al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most perpendicular wall or rock; upon the other side there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was left only a narrow passage. They stepped through</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, so that they could see the waterfall and the gorge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stopped silent. The sun, now fairly high, was in</seg><seg type="columnLine">110 sense the familiar orb of day, but was a pale, insipid</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing, only one-fifth the diameter of the sun to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were accustomed, and which could almost be studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the unshielded eye. From their feet a grassy</seg><seg type="columnLine">meadow a few hundred feet wide sloped gently down</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the river, from whose farther bank a precipice sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward for perhaps a thousand feet--merging into</seg><seg type="columnLine">towering hills whose rugged grandeur was reminiscent</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the topography of the moon. At their backs the wall</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the gorge was steep, but not precipitous, and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with shrubs and trees--some of which leaned</seg><seg type="columnLine">out over the little canyon, completely screening it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">among whose branches birds could now and then be seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">flitting about. In that direction no mountains were visi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ble, indicating that upon their side of the river there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">an upland plateau or bench. To their right the river,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gorge, and the strip of meadow extended for a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile or more, then curved away and were lost to sight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">To their left, almost too close for comfort, was the stu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pendous cataract, towering above them to a terror-in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiring height. Nadia studied it with awe, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed to puzzled wonder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What's the matter with it, Steve? It looks like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">picture in slow motion, like the kind they take of your</seg><seg type="columnLine">dives--or am I seeing things?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, it's really slow, compared to what we're used to.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Remember that one-half gravity stuff!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, that's right, but it certainly does look funny. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">gives me the creeps."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'll get used to it pretty quick--just as you'll get</seg><seg type="columnLine">used to all the rest of the things having only half their</seg><seg type="columnLine">310</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly weight and falling only half as fast as they ought</seg><seg type="columnLine">to when you drop them. Well, I don't see anything that</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks dangerous yet--let's go up toward the falls a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">meters and prospect that outcrop."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a few brisk strokes of an improvised shovel he</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleared the outcrop of detritus and broke off several</seg><seg type="columnLine">samples of the black substance, with which they went</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to the "Forlorn Hope."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's real coal," Stevens announced after a series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tests. "I've seen better, but on the other hand, there's</seg><seg type="columnLine">lots worse. It'll make good gas, and a kind of a coke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Not so hot, but it'll do. Now we'd better get organized</seg><seg type="columnLine">old partner, for a long camgaign." .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Go ahead and organize--I'm only the cheap help in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this enterprise."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cheap help!

Here's</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dope--we've got to save our own supplies as much as</seg><seg type="columnLine">possible until we know exactly what we're up against,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and to do that, we've got to live off the country. I'll fake</seg><seg type="columnLine">up something" to knock over some of those birds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">small game, then we can make real bow-strings and</seg><seg type="columnLine">feathered arrows and I'll forge some steel arrowheads</seg><seg type="columnLine">while you're making yourself a real bow. We'd better</seg><seg type="columnLine">make me about a hundred-pound war bow, too. ..."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A hundred!" interrupted Nadia. "That's a lot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">bow, big boy--think you can bend it?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You'd be surprised," he grinned. "I'm not quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Robin Hood--I've been known to miss a finger-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick wand at a hundred paces--but I'm not exactly a</seg><seg type="columnLine">beginner."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Oh, of course--I should have known by your lan-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guage that you're an archer, otherwise you'd never have</seg><seg type="columnLine">used such an old-fashioned word as 'pounds.'

And as soon as I can I'll make us a couple</seg><seg type="columnLine">of suits of fairly heavy steel armor, so that we'H have</seg><seg type="columnLine">real protection if we should need it. You see, we don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">know what we are apt to run up against out here. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that much done, it'll be up to you to provide, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll have to work tooth and nail at the forges. You'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to bring home the bacon, do the cooking and so on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and see what you can find along the line of edible roots,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grains, fruits, and what-not. Sort of reverse the Indian</seg><seg type="columnLine">idea--you be the hunter and I'll keep the home fires</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning. Can do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What it takes to do that, I've got," Nadia assured</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, her eyes sparkling. "Have you your job planned</seg><seg type="columnLine">out as well and as fittingly as you have mine?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And then some. We've got just two methods of</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting away from here--one is to get in touch with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Brandon, so that he'll come after us; the other is to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge our accumulators and try to make it under our</seg><seg type="columnLine">own power. Either course will need power, and lots of</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I never thought of going back in the 'Hope.' Sup-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pose we could?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "About as doubtful as the radio--I think that I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">build a pair of matched-frequency auto-dirigible trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitter and receptor units, such as are necessary for</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-ships fed by stationary power-plants, but after I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">got them built, they'd take us less than half way there.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then we'd have only what power we can carry, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">hate even to think of what probably would happen to us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We'd certainly have to drift for months before we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could get close enough to any of our plants to radio for</seg><seg type="columnLine">help, and we'd be taking awful chances. You see, we'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to take a very peculiar orbit, and if we should miss</seg><seg type="columnLine">connections passing the inner planets, what the sun</seg><seg type="columnLine">would do to us at the closest point and where what's</seg><seg type="columnLine">left of us would go on the back-swing, would be just too</seg><seg type="columnLine">bad! Beides, if we can get hold of the Sirius, they'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">come loaded for bear, and we may be able to do some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing about the rest of the folks out here."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">U/^H!" breathed the girl. "Wouldn't it be wonderful</seg><seg type="columnLine">if we could! I thought, of course, they'd all</seg><seg type="columnLine">be. ..." her voice died away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not necessarily--there's always a chance. That's</seg><seg type="columnLine">why I'm trying the ultra-radio first. However, either</seg><seg type="columnLine">course will take lots of power/ so the first thing I've</seg><seg type="columnLine">got to do is to build a power plant. I'm going to run</seg><seg type="columnLine">a penstock up those falls, and put in a turbine, driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">a high-tension alternator. Then, while I'm trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">build the ultra-radio, I'll be charging our accumulators,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so that no time will be lost in case the radio fails. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">it does fail--and remember I'm not counting on its work-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing--of course I'll tackle the transmission and receptor</seg><seg type="columnLine">units before we start out to drift it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You say it easy, Steve, but how can you build all</seg><seg type="columnLine">those things, with nothing to work with?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's going to be a real job--I'll not try to kid you</seg><seg type="columnLine">into thinking it'll be either easy or quick.

Things could be a lot worse--that's</seg><seg type="columnLine">why I brought along the whole 'Forlorn Hope,' instead</seg><seg type="columnLine">of just the lifeboat. As it is, we've got several thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">tons of spare steel and lots of copper. We've got ordi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary tools and a few light motors, blowers, and such</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuff.

However, it'll be plenty bad.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'll have to start out in a pretty crude fashion, and for</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of the stuff I'll need I'll have to make, not only the</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine that makes the part I want, but also the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">that makes the machine that makes the machine that</seg><seg type="columnLine">makes it--and so on, just how far down the line, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">haven't dared to think."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You must be a regular jack-of-all-trades, to think</seg><seg type="columnLine">you can get away with such a program as that ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am--nothing else but. You see, while most of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">school training was in advanced physics and mathe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">matics, I worked my way through by computing and de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">signing, and I've done a lot of truck-horse labor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">various kinds besides. I can calculate and design al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most anything, and I can make a pretty good stab at</seg><seg type="columnLine">SPACEHOUNDS OF IPC</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">311</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">translating a design into fabricated material. I wouldn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonder if Brandon's ultra-radio would stop me, since</seg><seg type="columnLine">nobody had even started to build one when I saw him</seg><seg type="columnLine">last--but I helped compute it, know the forces involved</seg><seg type="columnLine">as well as he did at that time, and it so happens that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know more about the design of coils and fields of force</seg><seg type="columnLine">than I do about anything else. So I may be able to work</seg><seg type="columnLine">it out eventually. It isn't going to be not knowing how</seg><seg type="columnLine">that will hold me up--it'll be the lack of something that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I can't build."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And that's where you will go back and back and back,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as you said about building the penstock?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Back and back is right, if I can find all the necessary</seg><seg type="columnLine">raw materials--that's what's probably going to put a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot of monkey-wrenches into the machinery." And</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stevens went to work upon a weapon of offense, fash-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ioning a crude, but powerful bow from a strip of spring</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel strung with heavy wire.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "How about arrows? Shall I go see if I can hit a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird with a rock, for feathers, and see if I can find some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing to make arrows out of?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not yet--anyway, I'd bet on the birds! I'm going</seg><seg type="columnLine">to use pieces of this light brace-rod off the accumulator</seg><seg type="columnLine">cells for arrows. They won't fly true, of course, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">with their mass I can give them enough projectile force</seg><seg type="columnLine">to kill any small animal they hit, no matter how they</seg><seg type="columnLine">hit it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After many misses, he finally bagged a small animal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">something like a rabbit and something like a kangaroo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a couple of round-bodied, plump birds, almost as</seg><seg type="columnLine">large as domestic hens.

"I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine that any flesh is really poisonous, and we'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">have to arrive at the ones we like best by a process of</seg><seg type="columnLine">trial and error.

It's twelve hours by my watch</seg><seg type="columnLine">since sunrise this morning, and it's still shining."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As for heat, I've been wondering about that. It must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be due to internal heat, because even though Jupiter may</seg><seg type="columnLine">be warm, or even hot, it certainly isn't radiating much,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since it has a temperature of minus two hundred at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible surface, which, of course, is the top of the atmos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phere. Our heat here is probably caused by radioac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tivity--that's the most modern dope, I believe.

Of</seg><seg type="columnLine">course I'll keep the chronometer going 011 I-P time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since we'll probably need it in working out observations;</seg><seg type="columnLine">but we might as well let our watches run down and work,</seg><seg type="columnLine">eat, and sleep by the sun--not much sense in trying to</seg><seg type="columnLine">keep Tellurian time here, as I see it.

Thus she came to realize the true</seg><seg type="columnLine">magnitude of the task he faced and the real seriousness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Stevens had admitted before the work was started,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had known that he had set himself a gigantic task,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but he had not permitted himself to follow, step by step,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the difficulties that he knew awaited him. Now, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">days stretched into weeks and on into months, he was</seg><seg type="columnLine">forced to take every laborious step, and it was borne in</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon him just how nearly impossible that Herculean</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor was to prove--just how dependent any given</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly activity is upon a vast number of others. Here</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was alone--everything he needed must be manufac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tured by his own hands, from its original sources. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">had known that progress would be slow and he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">prepared for that; but he had not pictured, even to him-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self, half of the maddening setbacks which occurred time</seg><seg type="columnLine">after time because of the crudity of the tools and equip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment he was forced to use. All too often a machine or</seg><seg type="columnLine">part, the product of many hours of grueling labor, would</seg><seg type="columnLine">fail because of the lack of some insignificant thing--some</seg><seg type="columnLine">item so common as to be taken for granted in all terres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trial shops, but impossible of fabrication with the means</seg><seg type="columnLine">312</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at his disposal. At such times he would set his grim jaw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a trifle harder, go back one step farther toward the Stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">Age, and begin all over again--to find the necessary raw</seg><seg type="columnLine">material or a possible substitute, and then to build the ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">paratus and machinery necessary to produce the part he</seg><seg type="columnLine">required. Thus the heart-breaking task progressed, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadia watched her co-laborer become leaner and harder</seg><seg type="columnLine">and more desperate day by day, unable in any way to</seg><seg type="columnLine">lighten his fearful load.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the brief period of rest following a noonday meal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stevens lay prone upon the warm, fragrant grass be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side the "Forlorn Hope," but it was evident to Nadia</seg><seg type="columnLine">that he was not resting. His burned and blistered hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">were locked savagely behind his head, his eyes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed too tightly, and every tense line of his body was</seg><seg type="columnLine">eloquent of a strain even more mental than physical.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She studied him for minutes, her fine eyes clouded, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">sat down beside him and put her hand upon his shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I want to talk to you a minute, Steve," she said</seg><seg type="columnLine">gently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All x, little fellow--but it might be just as well if</seg><seg type="columnLine">you didn't touch me.

But you're fighting too many things at once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and they're killing you. And they're mostly imaginary,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at that.

But what of it?</seg><seg type="columnLine">For the day that it becomes clear that we are to remain</seg><seg type="columnLine">here indefinitely; that day we will marry each other here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">before God.

Flowever, I don't believe it will come to that. After</seg><seg type="columnLine">what you've just said, I sure will lick that job, regardless</seg><seg type="columnLine">of how many different factories it takes to make one</seg><seg type="columnLine">armature--I'll show that mess of scrap-iron what kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">of trees make shingles!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl still in his arms, he rose to his feet and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">leased her slowly, reluctantly, unwilling ever to let her</seg><seg type="columnLine">go. Then he shook himself, as though an overwhelming</seg><seg type="columnLine">burden had been lifted from his shoulders, and laughed</seg><seg type="columnLine">happily.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "See this cigaretfe?" he went on lightly. "The Last</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Mohicans. I'm going to smoke it in honor of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">engagement." He drew the fragrant smoke deep into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs and frowned at her in mock seriousness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "This would be a nice wrorld to live on, of course, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jobs here are too darn steady. It also seems to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhat lacking in modern conveniences, such as steel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mills and machine tools. Then, too, it is just a trifle too</seg><seg type="columnLine">far from the Royal and Ancient for you really to enjoy</seg><seg type="columnLine">living here permanently, and besides, I can't get my</seg><seg type="columnLine">favorite brand of cigarettes around here. Therefore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after due deliberation, I don't believe we'll take the</seg><seg type="columnLine">place--we'll go back to Tellus.

Nadia watched him for a moment, her very</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart in her eyes, then picked up her spanner and went</seg><seg type="columnLine">after more steel, breathing a long and tremulous, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">supremely happy sigh.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER IV</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ganymedean Life</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">SLOW, hard, and disheartening as the work had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been at first, Stevens had never slackened his pace,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and after a time, as his facilities increased, the ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">asperating setbacks decreased in number and severity</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his progress became faster and faster. Large as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Forlorn Hope" was, space was soon at a premium, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">their peculiarly-shaped craft became a veritable fac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tory, housing a variety of machinery and equipment un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known in any single earthly industrial plant. Nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">was ornamental--everything was stripped to its barest</seg><seg type="columnLine">fundamental necessities--but every working part func-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned with a smooth precision to delight the senses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">any good mechanic.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a cavern under the falls was the great turbine, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be full-fed by the crude but tight penstock which clung</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the wall of the gorge, angling up to the brink of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">stupendous cataract. Bedded down upon solid rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a high-tension alternator capable of absorb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the entire output of the mighty turbine. This turbo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alternator was connected to a set of converters from</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the energy would flow along three great copper</seg><seg type="columnLine">cables--the receptors of the lifeboats being altogether</seg><seg type="columnLine">too small to carry the load--to the now completely ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hausted accumulators of the "'Forlorn Hope." All</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-tension apparatus was shielded and grounded, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that no stray impulses could reveal to the possible de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tectors of the Jovians the presence of this foreign power</seg><seg type="columnLine">plant. Housings, frames, spiders, all stationary parts</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rough, crude and massive; but bearings, shafts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">armatures, all moving parts, were of a polished and</seg><seg type="columnLine">finished accuracy and balance that promised months and</seg><seg type="columnLine">years of trouble-free operation. Everything ready for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the test, Stevens took off his frayed and torn leather</seg><seg type="columnLine">coveralls and moccasins and climbed nimbly up the pen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stock. He never walked down. Opening the head-gate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he poised sharply upon its extremity and took off in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a perfect swan-dive ; floating unconcernedly down toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">that boiling maelstrom two hundred feet below. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">struck the water with a sharp, smooth "slup!" and raced</seg><seg type="columnLine">ashore, seizing his suit as he ran toward the turbo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alternator. It was running smoothly, and, knowing that</seg><seg type="columnLine">everything was tight at the receiving end, he lingered</seg><seg type="columnLine">about the power plant until he was assured that nothing</seg><seg type="columnLine">would go wrong and that his home manufactured lubri-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cating oil and grease would keep those massive bearings</seg><seg type="columnLine">cool.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hunger assailed him, and glancing at the sun, he noted</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was well past dinner-time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wow!" he exclaimed aloud. "The boss just loves to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait meals--she'll burn me up for this!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He ran lightly toward "home," eager to tell his sweet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart that the long awaited moment had arrived--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">power was now flowing into their accumulators.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hi, Diana of the silver bowr!" he called. "How come</seg><seg type="columnLine">you no blow the dinner bell? Power's on--come give it</seg><seg type="columnLine">a look!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was no answer to his hail, and Stevens paused</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">in shocked amazement. He knew that never of her own</seg><seg type="columnLine">volition would she be out so late--Nadia was gone! A</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapid tour of inspection quickly confirmed that which</seg><seg type="columnLine">he already knew only too well. Forgotten was his</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunger, forgotten the power plant, forgotten everything</seg><seg type="columnLine">except the fact that his Nadia, the bouyant spirit in</seg><seg type="columnLine">whom centered his Universe, was lost or ... he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not complete the thought, even to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Swiftly he came to a decision and threw off his suit,</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealing the body of a Hercules--a body ready for any</seg><seg type="columnLine">demand he could put upon it. Always in hard training,</seg><seg type="columnLine">months of grinding physical labor and of heavy eating</seg><seg type="columnLine">had built him up to a point at which he would scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">have recognized himself, could he have glanced into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mirror. Mighty but pliable muscles writhed and swelled</seg><seg type="columnLine">under his clear skin as he darted here and there, selecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">equipment for what lay ahead of him. He donned the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavily armored space-suit which they had prepared</seg><seg type="columnLine">months before, while they were still suspicious of pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible attack. It was covered with heavy steel at every</seg><seg type="columnLine">point, and the lenses of the helmet, already of unbreak-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able glass, had been re-enforced with thick steel bars.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Tank and valves supplied air at normal pressure, so that</seg><seg type="columnLine">his powerful body could function at full efficiency, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">handicapped by the lighter atmosphere of Ganymede.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The sleeves terminated in steel-protected rubber wrist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lets which left his hands free, yet sheltered from attack</seg><seg type="columnLine">--wristlets tight enough to maintain the difference in</seg><seg type="columnLine">pressure, yet not tight enough to cut off the circulation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He took up his mighty war-bow and the full quiver of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy arrows--full-feathered and pointed with savagely</seg><seg type="columnLine">barbed, tearing heads of forged steel--and slipped into</seg><seg type="columnLine">their sheaths the long and heavy razor-sharp sword and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the double-edged dirk, which he had made and ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">long since for he knew not what emergency, and whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">bell-shaped hilts of steel further protected his hands and</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrists. Thus equipped, he had approximately his nor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal earthly weight; a fact which would operate to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">advantage, rather than otherwise, in case of passible</seg><seg type="columnLine">combat. With one last look around the "Forlorn Hope,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose every fitting spoke to him of the beloved mistress</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was gone, he filled a container with water and</seg><seg type="columnLine">cooked food and opened the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"TT won't be long now; now it won't be long." Naida</seg><seg type="columnLine">-a- caroled happily, buckling on her pack straps and</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking up bow and arrowrs for her daily hunt. "I never</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought that he could do it, but what it takes to do things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he's got lots of," she continued to improvise the song as</seg><seg type="columnLine">she left the "Hope" with its multitudinous devices whose</seg><seg type="columnLine">very variety was a never-failing delight to her; showing</seg><seg type="columnLine">as it did the sheer ability of the man, whose brain and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands had almost finished a next-to-impossible task.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Through the canyon and up a well-worn trail she</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbed, and soon came out upon the sparsely timbered</seg><seg type="columnLine">bench that wTas her hunting grounds. Upon this day,</seg><seg type="columnLine">however, she was full of happy anticipation and her</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind was everywhere except upon her work. She was</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking of Stevens, of their love, of the power which he</seg><seg type="columnLine">might turn on that very day, and of the possible rescue</seg><seg type="columnLine">for which she had hitherto scarcely dared to hope. Thus</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was that she walked miles beyond her usual limits</seg><seg type="columnLine">without having loosed an arrow, and she was surprised</seg><seg type="columnLine">when she glanced up at the sun to see that half the morn-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing was gone and that she was almost to the foothills,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beyond which rose a towering range of mountains.</seg><seg type="columnLine">314</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Snap out of it, girl!" she reprimanded herself. "Go</seg><seg type="columnLine">on wool-gathering like this and your man will go hungry</seg><seg type="columnLine">--and he'll break you right off at the ankles!" She be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">came again the huntress, and soon saw an animal brows-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing steadily along the base of a hill. It was a six-legged,</seg><seg type="columnLine">deer-like creature, much larger than anything she had as</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet seen. But it was meat and her time was short, there-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore she crept within range and loosed an arrow with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">full power of her hunting bow. Unfamiliar as she was</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the anatomy of the peculiar creature, the arrow did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not kill. The "hexaped," as she instantly named it, sped</seg><seg type="columnLine">away and she leaped after it. She, like her companion,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had developed amazingly in musculature, and few indeed</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the denizens of Ganymede, who could equal her</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed upon that small globe, with its feeble gravitational</seg><seg type="columnLine">force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Up the foothills it darted. Beyond the hills and</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep into a valley between two towering peaks the chase</seg><seg type="columnLine">continued before Nadia's third arrow brought the ani-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal down. Bending over the game, she became con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious of a strange but wonderful sweet perfume and</seg><seg type="columnLine">glanced up, to see something which she certainly had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed when the hexaped had fallen. It was an en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ormous flower, at least a foot in diameter and indescrib-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ably beautiful in its crimson and golden splendor. Al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most level with her head the gorgeous blossom waved</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon its heavy stem; based by a massive cluster of en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ormous, smooth, dark green leaves. Entranced by this</seg><seg type="columnLine">unexpected and marvelous floral display, Nadia breathed</seg><seg type="columnLine">deeply of the inviting fragrance--and collapsed sense-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less upon the ground. Thereupon the weird plant moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">over toward her, and the thick leaves began to enfold her</seg><seg type="columnLine">knees. This carnivorous thing, however, did not like the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy cloth of her suit and turned to the hexaped. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust several of its leaves into the wounds upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">carcass and fed, while two other leaves rasped together,</seg><seg type="columnLine">sending out a piercing call.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In answer to the sound the underbrush crackled, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">through it and upon the scene there crashed a vegetable-</seg><seg type="columnLine">animal nightmare--the parent of the relatively tiny thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose perfume had disabled the girl.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Its huge and gorgeous blossom was supported by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long, flexible, writhing stem, and its base was composed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of many and highly specialized leaves. There were saws</seg><seg type="columnLine">and spears and mighty, but sinuous tendrils; there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">slender shoots which seemed to possess some sense of</seg><seg type="columnLine">perception; there was the massive tractor base composed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of extensible leaves which by their contraction and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pansion propelled the mass along the ground. Parent</seg><seg type="columnLine">and child fell upon the hexaped, and soon bones and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair were all that remained. The slender shoots then</seg><seg type="columnLine">wandered about the unconscious girl in her strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">covering, and as a couple of powerful tendrils coiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">about her and raised her into the air over the monstrous</seg><seg type="columnLine">base of the thing, its rudimentary brain could almost be</seg><seg type="columnLine">perceived working as it sluggishly realized that, now full</seg><seg type="columnLine">fed, it should carry this other victim along, to feed its</seg><seg type="columnLine">other offspring when they should return to its side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BARELY outside the door of the "Forlorn Hope"</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stevens whirled about with a bitter imprecation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He had already lost time needlessly--with a lookout</seg><seg type="columnLine">plate he could cover more ground in ten minutes than he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could cover afoot in a week. He flipped on the power</seg><seg type="columnLine">and shot the violet beam out over the pleateau to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">district where he knew Nadia was wont to hunt. Not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">finding her there, he swung the beam in an ever widen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing circle around that district. Finally he saw a few</seg><seg type="columnLine">freshly broken twigs, and scanned the scene with care.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He soon found the trail of fresh blood which marked</seg><seg type="columnLine">the path of the flight of the hexaped, and with the pecu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">liar maneuverability of the device he was using, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">not long until he was studying the scene where the en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">counter had taken place. He gasped when he saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bones and perceived three of Nadia's arrows, but soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw that the skeleton was not human and was reassured.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Casting about in every direction, he found Nadia's bow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saw a peculiar, freshly trampled path leading from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kill, past the bow, down the valley. He could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">understand the spoor, but it was easily followed, and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot the beam along it at headlong speed until he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">up with the monstrous creature that was making it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">until he saw what burden that organism was carrying.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He leaped to the controls of the lifeboat, then dropped</seg><seg type="columnLine">his hand. While the stream of power now flowing was</seg><seg type="columnLine">ample to operate the lookout plates, yet it would be many</seg><seg type="columnLine">hours before the accumulator cells would be in condition</seg><seg type="columnLine">to drive the craft even that short distance.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It'll take over an hour to get there--here's hoping</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I	can check in all x," he muttered savagely, as he took</seg><seg type="columnLine">careful note of the location and direction of the crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture's trail and set off at a fast jog-trot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The carnivorous flower's first warning that all was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">well was received when Stevens' steel-shod feet landed</seg><seg type="columnLine">squarely upon its base and one sweeping cut of his sword</seg><seg type="columnLine">loppd off the malignant blossom and severed the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendrils that still held the unconscious Nadia. With a</seg><seg type="columnLine">quick heave of his shoulder, he-'tossed her lightly back-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward into the smooth-beaten track the creature had made</seg><seg type="columnLine">and tried to leap away--but the instant he had consumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in rescuing the girl had been enough for the thing to</seg><seg type="columnLine">seize him, and he found himself battling for his very</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. No soft-leaved infant this, but a full-grown</seg><seg type="columnLine">monster, well equipped with mighty weapons of offense</seg><seg type="columnLine">and defense. Well it was for the struggling man that</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was encased in armor steel as those saw-edged, hard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">spiked leaves drove against him with crushing force;</seg><seg type="columnLine">well it was for him that he had his own independent air</seg><seg type="columnLine">supply, so that that deadly perfume eddied ineffective</seg><seg type="columnLine">about his helmeted head! Hard and fiercely driven as</seg><seg type="columnLine">those terrible thorns were, they could do no more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent his heavy armor. His powerful left arm, driving</seg><seg type="columnLine">the double-razor-edged dirk in short, resistless arcs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">managed to keep the snaky tendrils from coiling about</seg><seg type="columnLine">his right arm, which was wielding the heavy, trenchant</seg><seg type="columnLine">sword. Every time that mighty blade descended it</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleaved its length through snapping spikes and impo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tently grinding leaves; but more than once a flairling ten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dril coiled about his neck armor and held his helmet im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">movable as though in a vise, while those frightful, grind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ingsaws sought to rip their way through the glass to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">living creature inside the peculiar metal housing. Dirk</seg><seg type="columnLine">and saber and magnificent physique finally triumphed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it was not until each leaf was literally severed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">every other leaf that the outlandish organism gave up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ghost.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NADIA had been tossed out into pure air, beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the zone of the stupefying perfume, and she re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered her senses in time to see the finish of the bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle. Stevens, assured that his foe was hors du combat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned toward the spot where he had thrown Nadia's</seg><seg type="columnLine">SPACEHOUNDS OF IPG</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">315</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">body. He saw that she was unharmed, and sprang</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward her in relief. He was surprised beyond mea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sure, however, to see her run away at a pace he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not hope to equal, encumbered as he was; motioning</seg><seg type="columnLine">frantically at him the while to keep away from her. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stopped, astounded, and started to unscrew his helmet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whereupon she dashed back toward him, signaling him</seg><seg type="columnLine">emphatically to leave his armor exactly as it was. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">stood still and stared at her, an exasperated question</seg><seg type="columnLine">large upon his face, until she made clear to him that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was to follow her at a safe distance, then she set off at</seg><seg type="columnLine">a rapid walk. She led him back to where the hexaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">had fallen, where she retrieved her bow and arrows;</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, keeping a sharp lookout upon all sides, she went</seg><seg type="columnLine">on to a small stream of water. She made the dumb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">founded man go out into the middle of the creek and</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie down and roll over in the water, approaching him</seg><seg type="columnLine">sniffing cautiously between immersions. She made him</seg><seg type="columnLine">continue the bathing until she could detect not even the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightest trace of the sweet, but noxious fragrance of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiarly terrible form of Ganymedean life. Only then</seg><seg type="columnLine">did she allow him to remove his helmet, so that she</seg><seg type="columnLine">could give him the greeting for which they both had</seg><seg type="columnLine">longed and tell him what it was all about.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "So that's it, ace!" he exclaimed, still holding her</seg><seg type="columnLine">tightly in his iron embrace. "Great balls of fire! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought maybe you were still a little cuckoo. Anaesthetic</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfume, huh ? Hot stuff, I'd say--no wonder you bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">---I would, too. It's lucky for us I was air-tight--we'd</seg><seg type="columnLine">both be fee . .</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Stop it!" she interrupted him sharply. "Forget it--</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't ever even think of it!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All x, ace. It's out like the well known light. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">to do? It's getting darker than a hat, and we're a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">way from home. Don't know whether I could find my</seg><seg type="columnLine">way back in the dark or not; and just between you and</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, I'm not particularly keen on night travel in these</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts after what's just happened. Are you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Anything else but," she assured him, fervently.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'd lots rather stay hungry until tomorrow."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No need of that--I've brought along enough supper</seg><seg type="columnLine">for both of us. I'm hungry as a wolf, too, now that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have time to think of it. We'll eat and den up some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where--or climb a tree. Those wampuses probably can't</seg><seg type="columnLine">climb trees!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There's a nice little cave back there about a hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred meters. We'll pretend it's the Ritz," and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon had a merry fire blazing in front of the retreat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There they ate of the provisions Stevens had brought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, while the man rolled up boulders before the nar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">row entrance of the cave, Nadia gathered leaves and</seg><seg type="columnLine">made a soft bed upon its warm, dry floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Good night, lover," and the girl, untroubled and se-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cure now that Stevens was at her side, was almost in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stantly asleep; but the man was not sleepy. He thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the power plant, even now sending its terrific stream</seg><seg type="columnLine">of energy into his accumulators. He thought of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ultra-radio--where could he get all the materials needed ?</seg><seg type="columnLine">He thought of his friends, wondering whether or not</seg><seg type="columnLine">they would receive his message. He thought of Breck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enridge and the other human beings who had been aboard</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Arcturus, wondering poignantly as to their fate. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought of Newton and of his own people, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">certainly given them up for dead long since.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But above all he thought of the beautiful, steel-true</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion lying there asleep at his mailed feet, and he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gazed down at her, his heart in his eyes. The firelight</seg><seg type="columnLine">shone through the chinks between the boulders, casting</seg><seg type="columnLine">a flickering ruddy light throughout the little cavern.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadia lay there her head pillowed upon one strong,</seg><seg type="columnLine">brown little hand. Her lips were red and sweetly curved,</seg><seg type="columnLine">her cheek was smooth and firm as so much brown vel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vet. She was literally aglow with sheer beauty and</seg><seg type="columnLine">with perfect health; and the man reflected, as he studied</seg><seg type="columnLine">her hungrily, that this wild life certainly had agreed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with her--she was becoming more surpassingly beau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiful with every passing day.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You little trump--you wonderful, lovely, square lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle brick!" he breathed silently, and bent over to touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">her cheek lightly with his lips. Slight as the caress was,</seg><seg type="columnLine">it disturbed her, and even in her sleep her subconscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind sent out an exploring hand, to touch her Steve and</seg><seg type="columnLine">thus be reassured. He pressed her hand and she settled</seg><seg type="columnLine">back comfortably, with a long, deep breath; and he</seg><seg type="columnLine">stretched his iron-clad length beside her and closed his</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes, firmly resolved not to waste a minute of this won-</seg><seg type="columnLine">derful night in sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When he opened them an instant later, it was broad</seg><seg type="columnLine">daylight, the boulders had been rolled away, the fra-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grance of roasting meat permeated the atmosphere, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nadia was making a deafening clamor, beating his</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel breastplate lustily with the flat of his huge saber.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Daylight in the swamp, you sleeper!" she exclaimed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Roll out or roll up! Come and get it, before I throw</seg><seg type="columnLine">it away!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must have been kind of tired," he said sheepishly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he saw that she had shot a bird and had cooked</seg><seg type="columnLine">breakfast for them both while he had been buried in</seg><seg type="columnLine">oblivion.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Peculiar, too, isn't it?" Nadia asked, pointedly. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">only did about ten days' work yesterday in ten minutes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging this frightful snickersnee of yours. Why, you</seg><seg type="columnLine">played with it as though it were a knitting-needle, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I wanted to wake you up with it, I could hardly lift</seg><seg type="columnLine">it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thought you didn't want that subject even men-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioned ?" he tried to steer the talk away from his prowess</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the broadsword.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That was yesterday," airily. "Besides, I don't mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">talking about you--it's thinking about us being . . . you</seg><seg type="columnLine">know . . that I can't stand."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All x, ace. I get you--right. Let's eat."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">BREAKFAST over, they started down the valley,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stevens carrying his helmet under his arm. Hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">had they started however, than Nadia's keen eyes saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">a movement through the trees, and she stopped and</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed. Stevens looked once, then hand in hand they</seg><seg type="columnLine">dashed back to their cave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll pile up some of the boulders and you lie low,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he instructed her as he screwed on his helmet. She</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapped open his face-plate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But what about you? Aren't you coming in, too?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she demanded.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Can't--they'd surround us and starve us out. I'm</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe in this armor--thank Heaven we made it as solid as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we did--and I'll fight 'em in the open. I'll show 'em</seg><seg type="columnLine">what the bear did to the buckwheat!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right, I guess, but I wish I had my armor, too,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">she mourned as he snapped shut his plate and walled her</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the cave with the same great rocks he had used</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night before. Then, Nadia safe from attack, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">316</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">drew his quiver of war-arrows into position over his</seg><seg type="columnLine">shoulder, placed one at the ready 'on his bow-string</seg><seg type="columnLine">and turned to face the horde of things rushing up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">valley toward him. Wild animals he had supposed them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but as he stood firm and raised his weapon shrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">whistles sounded in the throng, and he gasped as he re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">alized that those frightful creatures must be intelligent</seg><seg type="columnLine">beings, for not only did they signal to each other, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he saw that they wrere armed with bows and arrows,</seg><seg type="columnLine">spears, and slings!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Six-limbed creatures they were, of a purplish-red</seg><seg type="columnLine">color, with huge, tricornigerous heads and with staring,</seg><seg type="columnLine">green, phosphorescent eyes. Two of the six limbs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">always legs, two always arms; the intermediate two,</seg><seg type="columnLine">due to a mid-section jointing of the six-foot-long, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most cylindrical body, could be used at will as either</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs or arms. Now, out of range, as they supposed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they halted and gathered about one who was apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">their leader; some standing erect and waving four</seg><seg type="columnLine">hands while shaking their horns savagely in Stevens'</seg><seg type="columnLine">direction, others trotting around 011 four legs, busily</seg><seg type="columnLine">gathering stones of suitable size for their vicious slings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Too far away to use their own weapons and facing</seg><seg type="columnLine">only one small four-limbed creature, they considered</seg><seg type="columnLine">their game already in the bag, but they had no compre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hension of earthly muscles, nor any understanding of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power and range of a hundred-pound bow driving a</seg><seg type="columnLine">steel-headed war arrow. Thus, while they were arguing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stevens took the offensive, and a cruelly barbed steel</seg><seg type="columnLine">war-head tore completely through the body of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">leader and mortally wounded the creature next beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">him. Though surprised, they were, not to be frightened</seg><seg type="columnLine">off, but with wild, shrill screams rushed to the attack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stevens had no ammunition to waste, and every time</seg><seg type="columnLine">that mighty bow twanged a yard-long arrow transfixed</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least one of the red horde--and a body through which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had torn one of those ghastly, hand-forged arnyw-heads</seg><seg type="columnLine">was of very little use thereafter. Accurately-sped ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows splintered harmlessly against the re-enforced win-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dows of his helmet and against the steel guards pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tecting his hands. He was almost deafened by the din</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the stone missiles of the slingers rebounded from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">reverberating shell of steel, but he fired carefully, stead-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ily, and powerfully until his last arrow had been loosed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, the wicked dirk in his left hand and the long and</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy saber weaving a circular path of brilliance in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun, he stepped forward a couple of paces to meet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attackers. For a few moments nothing could stand be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore that fiercely driven blade--severed heads, limbs,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fragments of torsos literally filled the air, but sheer</seg><seg type="columnLine">weight of numbers bore him down. As he fell, he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the whte shaft of one of Nadia's hunting-arrowrs flash</seg><seg type="columnLine">past his helmet and bury itself to the nock in the body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the horde above him. Nadia knew that her ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rows could not harm her lover, and through a chink be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween two boulders she was shooting into the thickest of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mob speeding her light arrows with the full power</seg><seg type="columnLine">of her bow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Though down, the savages soon discovered that Stev-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ens was not out. In such close quarters he could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">use his sword, but the fourteen-inch blade of the dirk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">needle-pointed as it was and with two razor-sharp, ser-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rated cutting edges, was itself no mean weapon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">time after time he drove it deep, taking life at every</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrust. Four more red monsters threw themselves upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prostrate man, but not sufficiently versed in armor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">to seek out its joints, their fierce short spear thrusts did</seg><seg type="columnLine">no damage. Presently four more corpses lay still and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stevens, with his, to them incredible, earthly strength,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was once more upon his feet in spite of their utmost ef-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forts to pinion his mighty limbs, and was again swinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">his devastating weapon. Half their force lying upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">field, wiped out by a small, but invincible and apparently</seg><seg type="columnLine">invulnerable being, the remainder broke and ran, pur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sued by Stevens to the point where the red monsters had</seg><seg type="columnLine">first halted. He recovered his arrows and returned to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cave, opening his face-plate as he came.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All x, sweetheart?" he asked, rolling away the boul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ders. "Didn't get anything through to you, did they?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, they didn't even realize that I was taking part</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the battle, I guess. Did they hurt you while they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had you down? I was scared to death for a minute."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, the old armor held. One of them must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">gnawed on my ankle some, between the greave and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heel-plate, but he couldn't quite get through. 'Sa darn</seg><seg type="columnLine">small opening there, too--must have bent my foot 'way</seg><seg type="columnLine">around to get in at all. Have to tighten that joint up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little, I guess. . I'll bet I've got a black spot and blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">spot there the size of my hand--maybe it's only the size</seg><seg type="columnLine">of yours, though."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You won't die of that, probably.

They'll be back, and next time they won't be</seg><seg type="columnLine">so easy to take."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All x, then--hold me, Steve, I can't stand the sight</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that--let alone wade through it. I'm going to faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">or something, sure."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As you were!" he snapped. "You aren't going to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass out now that it's all over! It's a pretty ghastly</seg><seg type="columnLine">mess, I know, but shut your eyes and Til carry you out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sight."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aren't we out of sight of that place yet?" she de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded after a time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have been for quite a while," he confessed, "but</seg><seg type="columnLine">you're sitting pretty, aren't you? And you aren't very</seg><seg type="columnLine">heavy--not here on Ganymede, anyway!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"T31TT me down!" she commanded. "After that crack</seg><seg type="columnLine">A [ won't play with you any more at all--I'll pick up</seg><seg type="columnLine">my marbles and go home!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He released her and they hurried back toward their</seg><seg type="columnLine">waterfall, keeping wary eyes sharp-set for danger in any</seg><seg type="columnLine">form, animal or vegetable. On the way back across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foothills Stevens shot another hexaped, and upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">plateau above the river Nadia bagged several birds and</seg><seg type="columnLine">small animals, but it was not until they were actually in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own little canyon that their rapid pace slackened</seg><seg type="columnLine">and their vigilance relaxed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "After this, ace, we hunt together and we go back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearing armor while we're hunting.

There are lots</seg><seg type="columnLine">of heavy metals in Jupiter somewhere, but we probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't find them.

It was hardly known until after they</seg><seg type="columnLine">built those thousand-foot reflectors on the Moon, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the seeing is always perfect, but it has been studied a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lot since then.

And speaking of vacuum . . . whoopee! We</seg><seg type="columnLine">don't need mercury any more than a goldfish needs a gas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mask. When we get Mr. Tube done, we'll take him out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into space, leaving his mouth open, and very shortly</seg><seg type="columnLine">he'll be as empty as a flapper's skull.

Where is this</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cantrell's Comet?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't know, exactly--there's one rub. Another is</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I haven't even started the transmitter and receptor</seg><seg type="columnLine">units. But we've got some field-generators here on board</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I can use, so it won't be so bad. And our comet is</seg><seg type="columnLine">in this part of the solar system somewhere fairly close.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Wish we had an Ephemeris, a couple of I-P solar charts,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and a real telescope."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You can't do much without an Ephemeris, I should</seg><seg type="columnLine">think. It's a good thing you kept the chronometers go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. You know the I-P time, day, and dates, anyway."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'll have to do without some things, that's all," and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the man stared absently at the steel wall. "I remember</seg><seg type="columnLine">something about its orbit, since it is one thing that all</seg><seg type="columnLine">I-P vessels have to steer clear of. Think I can figure it</seg><seg type="columnLine">dose enough so that we'll be able to find it in our little</seg><seg type="columnLine">telescope, or even on our plate, since we'll be out of this</seg><seg type="columnLine">atmosphere. And it might not be a bad idea for us to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get away, anyway. I'm afraid of those folks on that</seg><seg type="columnLine">space-ship, whoever they were, and they must live</seg><seg type="columnLine">around here somewhere. Cantrell's Comet swings about</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifty million kilometers outside Jupiter's orbit at aphelion</seg><seg type="columnLine">--close enough for us to reach, and yet probably too far</seg><seg type="columnLine">for them to find us easily. By the time we get back</seg><seg type="columnLine">here, they probably will have quit looking for us, if</seg><seg type="columnLine">they look at all. Then too, I expect these savages to fol-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low us up. What say, little ace--do we try it or do wre</seg><seg type="columnLine">stay here?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You know best, Steve. As I said before, I'm with</seg><seg type="columnLine">you from now on, in whatever you think best to do. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that you think it best to go out there. Therefore,</seg><seg type="columnLine">so do I."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," he said, finally, "I'd better get busy, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">--there's a lot to do before we can start. The radio</seg><seg type="columnLine">doesn't come next, after all--the transmitter and re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptor units come ahead of it. They won't mean wasted</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor, in any event, since we'll have to have them in case</seg><seg type="columnLine">the radio fails. You'd better lay in a lot of supplies while</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm working on that stuff, but don't go out of sight, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">yell like fury if you see anything. We'd both better</seg><seg type="columnLine">wear full armor every time- we go out-of-doors--unless</seg><seg type="columnLine">I'm all out of control we aren't done with those savages</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet. Even though they may be afraid of the demons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the falls, I think they'll have at least one more try at us."</seg><seg type="columnLine">While Nadia brought in meat and vegetables and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stored them awray, Stevens attacked the problem of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structing the pair of tight-beam, auto-dirigible trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mitter and receptor units which would connect his great</seg><seg type="columnLine">turbo-alternator to the accumulators of their craft,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wherever it might be in space. From the force-field</seg><seg type="columnLine">generators of the "Forlorn Hope" he selected the two</seg><seg type="columnLine">most suitable for his purpose, tuned them to the exact</seg><seg type="columnLine">frequency he required, and around them built a complex</seg><seg type="columnLine">system of condensers and coils.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Day after day passed. Their larder was full, the re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceptor wras finished, and the beam transmitter was almost</seg><seg type="columnLine">ready to attach to the turbo-alternator before the calm</seg><seg type="columnLine">was broken.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Steve!" Nadia shrieked. Glancing idly into the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">municator plate, she had been perfunctorily surveying</seg><seg type="columnLine">the .surrounding territory. "They're coming! Thousands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them! They're all over the bench up there, and just</seg><seg type="columnLine">simply pouring down the hills and up the valley!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Wish they'd waited a few hours longer--we'd have</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">been gone. However, we're just about ready for them,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he commented grimly, as he stared over her shoulder into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the communicator plate. "We'll make a lot of those In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dians wish that they had stayed at home with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">papooses."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Have you got all those rays and things fixed up?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not as many as I'd like to have.

Of course I could have</seg><seg type="columnLine">found out from Brandon, but never paid any attention to</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. I've got some nice ultra-violet, though, and a short-</seg><seg type="columnLine">wave oscillatory that'll cook an elephant to a cinder in</seg><seg type="columnLine">about eight seconds.

Glad we had time to cover our open sides, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">looks as though that meteorite armor we put over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectors may be mighty useful, too."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> On and on the savages came, massed in formations</seg><seg type="columnLine">showing some signs of rude discipline. This time there</seg><seg type="columnLine">was neither shrieking nor yelling; the weird creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">advanced silently and methodically. Here and there were</seg><seg type="columnLine">massed groups of hundreds, dragging behind them en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gfiies which Stevens studied with interest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">"Hm ... m ... m. Catapults," he mused. "You</seg><seg type="columnLine">were right, girl of my dreams--armor and bows and</seg><seg type="columnLine">arrows wouldn't help us much right now.

With those things they can cave in our side-armor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and might even dent our roof. When one of those pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectiles hits, we want to know where it ain't, that's all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stevens cast off the heavily-insulated plug connecting</seg><seg type="columnLine">the power plant leads to his now almost fully charged</seg><seg type="columnLine">accumulators, strapped himself and Nadia into place at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the controls, and waited, staring into the plate. Catapult</seg><seg type="columnLine">after catapult was dragged to the lip of the little canyon,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until six of them bore upon the target. The huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">stranded springs of hair, fiber, and sinew were wound</seg><seg type="columnLine">up to the limit, and enormous masses of rock were</seg><seg type="columnLine">toilsomely rolled upon the platforms. Each "gunner"</seg><seg type="columnLine">seized his trip, and as the leader shrieked his signal the</seg><seg type="columnLine">six ponderous masses of metalliferous rock "heaved into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air as one. But they did not strike their objective,</seg><seg type="columnLine">for as the signal was given, Stevens shot power into his</seg><seg type="columnLine">projectors. The "Forlorn Hope" leaped out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">canyon and high into the air over the open meadow,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just as the six great projectiles crashed into the ground</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon the spot which, an instant before, she had occupied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">RUDIMENTARY discipline forgotten, the horde</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed down into the canyon and the valley, in full</seg><seg type="columnLine">clamor of their barbaric urgings. Horns and arms tossed</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiercely, savage noises rent the air, and arrows splintered</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmlessly upon steel plate as the mystified and mad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dened warriors upon the plain below gave vent to their</seg><seg type="columnLine">outraged feelings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look, Nadia! A whole gang of them are smelling</seg><seg type="columnLine">around that power plug.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">chief, who had been inspecting the power-plant, walked</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the triplex lead and joined his followers at its</seg><seg type="columnLine">terminus. Pointing with his horns, he jabbered orders,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and three red monsters, one at each cable, bent to lift the</seg><seg type="columnLine">SPACEHOUNDS OF IPC</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">319</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">plug, while the leader himself thrust an arm into each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the three contact holes. There was a flash of sear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing flame and the reeking smoke of burning flesh--those</seg><seg type="columnLine">three arms had taken the terrific no-load voltage of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">three-phase converter system, and the full power of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">alternator had been shorted directly to ground through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the comparatively small resistance of his body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stevens had poised the "Forlorn Hope" edgewise in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mid-air, so that the gleaming, heavily armored parabolic</seg><seg type="columnLine">reflectors of his projectors, mounted upon the leading</seg><seg type="columnLine">edge of the fortress, covered the scene below. As the</seg><seg type="columnLine">charred corpse of the savage chieftain dropped to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, it seemed to the six-limbed creatures that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">demons of the falls had indeed been annoyed beyond en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">durance by their intrusion; for, as if in response to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flash of fire from the power plug, that structure so</seg><seg type="columnLine">peculiarly and so stolidly hanging in the air came plung-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down toward them.

I remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber the great bronze cup, with its bare little cells, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming pool of rose-light at its heart. To him who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">my father the great green gates of the black tower</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened, and a strange bright world of green and polished</seg><seg type="columnLine">black lay without. Often we ventured into it, he and I,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived in its marvels for many days. Together we would</seg><seg type="columnLine">lie in the lush grass below the black cliffs, the oily green</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea rolling afar off beneath the green sun, heavy fragrant</seg><seg type="columnLine">blooms drooping over us, and watched the colors play</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the shafts of white and royal purple that jutted</seg><seg type="columnLine">up from the pitted red clay. And he would tell me the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lore of the race--tales tens of centuries old, written in</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer old script on crumbling scrolls or handed down by</seg><seg type="columnLine">word of mouth, tales of the First Planet. And I would</seg><seg type="columnLine">laugh, wisely, for even a child might know them as</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreams, untrue. And I was a child.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the Book of Quetzal they were, the scroll which is</seg><seg type="columnLine">all wre know of that first planet from which we came.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It tells of an empire of many isles, whose power was</seg><seg type="columnLine">all over the world--red race, and black, and swarthy</seg><seg type="columnLine">white, even the tall fair warriors of Thule and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crafty Yellow Ones beyond the Second Sea. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair, wonderful world, low sunk in the azure sea, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plumed summit of snowy Quetza towering above</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thula of the many gates. There were trees, and blos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">soms of untold hue, and in the air flitted little silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms of fragile color, powdered with gem dust, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">other larger beings, like them but softly plumed, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">music among the treetops. And there came one,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Emperor of Atlantis and Priest of the Thunderer, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">took to himself the name of fiery Quetza--Ouetzalcoatl,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prince of the Plumed One. He claimed brotherhood</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the spirits of the mountain, and from the radiant</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal of the upper crags he drew the secret of the light-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nings, and toyed with it for the conquest of the world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There came war with the rebel tributaries, and in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">vision, as he lay stricken on the floor of the council</seg><seg type="columnLine">chamber, the Thunderer came to him, and He of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Seas, who is our guardian, and spoke. Then he saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that his race must perish for the evil that lay in it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he rose and called down the lightnings of Zeus (Jupiter)</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon Thula. But Poseidon (Neptune) intervened, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men of Atlantis came to the Second Planet. A fairy</seg><seg type="columnLine">tale, a net of dreams, I thought, but now--I know not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> More he told me, that I believed, of the outer world</seg><seg type="columnLine">where we lay. Far off, beyond the ever rolling sea,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lay Quetza, no longer smoke-plumed as of old, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thula the ancient, now city of the Overlords, and be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond, the Southern Land of floating rock and flaming</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains. Other land there was none, save this where</seg><seg type="columnLine">we lay, walled by the desert of black toward the sun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise, and toward the sunset by low, crannied mountains</seg><seg type="columnLine">that dropped slow to the sea beyond. Between lay a</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide basin, filled with rank swampage and haunted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearful monsters of the dead past, their day long gone,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lingering through chance. Some day, he said, he would</seg><seg type="columnLine">show me these.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He spoke of the Overlords, men of wealth and power</seg><seg type="columnLine">who drove the people of Atlantis from the upper world</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and lived, deathless, dreaming of the Universe. He told</seg><seg type="columnLine">of yet another Quetzalcoatl, hereditary Prince of Quetza,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who led the striving races into the inner world, built the</seg><seg type="columnLine">towers that brought air to the great caverns, raised</seg><seg type="columnLine">Yzdral and Luda and Kor from the level plain, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">light that grain might grow. And he hinted of that un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen, dreaded Underworld, mile on mile beneath, long</seg><seg type="columnLine">since sealed off by those who had found it, and been</seg><seg type="columnLine">afraid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I remember that day when the hard black rock sped</seg><seg type="columnLine">past beneath, until a new world stretched on and on,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising from lush dark green to the rolling violet of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">far horizon. Below, the matted swamp, a green-scummed</seg><seg type="columnLine">lake and sluggish river festering in its midst. Beyond,</seg><seg type="columnLine">swelling green uplands, great open groves of fragrant,</seg><seg type="columnLine">steepled trees, brought from the First Planet by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Overlords, and other trees, massive and spreading, with</seg><seg type="columnLine">lobed leaves and little, hard fruits in tiny scaled cups.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And farther still the weathered rock of the mountains.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A voice rang up and up, a thrilling, spiraling music of</seg><seg type="columnLine">heaven. Father showed me a little russet creature, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird with speckled, swelling throat, that sang and sang</seg><seg type="columnLine">until our ears failed us, and yet sang on, higher than</seg><seg type="columnLine">man might hear--a being of the First Planet. Too, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the loathsome things of the swamps--huge hulks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">swinging flesh, with long thin necks and tails, little flat</seg><seg type="columnLine">heads, and stupid staring eyes--that bleated and bellowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in fear and floundered helpless in the mire as our little</seg><seg type="columnLine">aero swooped low.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thula, I did not see, then. "My son," he said to me</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly. "'When that day comes when I am gone, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">you are Keeper in my stead, take this gem to Thula,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there beyond the seas, and judge by what you see. It is</seg><seg type="columnLine">my legacy to you, and it is your duty to me and to your</seg><seg type="columnLine">grandsire to obey. Once--but enough!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THEN Luda was blasted, and the grey clouds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">death swirled about Yzdral the Beautiful. Beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trident of Poseidon he stood, my father, and led</seg><seg type="columnLine">that hymn of the first planet which men sing over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead in battle. A frightened child, muffled in a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">suit and crystal head-piece, I fled to the surface, bearing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gem which my father gave me in that last long mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment before the gates were opened to the milling mob.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For days I wandered, over the endless sea of rolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">green, until a dot of white lay on the horizon, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Quetzal rose from the waters beneath my tiny aero.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through the quiet streets, between stately rows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">marble palaces, I strode unafraid, bearing my blood-red</seg><seg type="columnLine">gem to him of the snowy beard, w7ho was ruler here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and Prince of Quetza. He took it from my outstretched</seg><seg type="columnLine">palm, and gazed long at it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Once was he, too, one of us," he said slowly. "He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was of the men of ancient Hellas, slaves of Atlantis,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who rose against their masters and brought beauty to</seg><seg type="columnLine">this planet at long last. Do ye think so harshly of us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cleon, the cruel Overlords, who drove a decaying people</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the caverns where they might perish, or else rise to</seg><seg type="columnLine">new beauty and new life? He hated us, I think, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">when he went he swore that when this gem should re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn, we might judge by the bearer if the people of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantis were not equals of Hellene slaves. He must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been your father's father, Cleon, for with him went</seg><seg type="columnLine">a child of your age. What is your thought, Cleon?</seg><seg type="columnLine">You have seen the beauty of this Upper World. Shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities mar it?

It was short and quick, like a sob. "I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought--otherwise. The Underworld has struck, at</seg><seg type="columnLine">last! Tell me of it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I told him of the pit that had struck up through</seg><seg type="columnLine">Luda, of the tempests that sucked the air from our great</seg><seg type="columnLine">caverns, and of the grey death-spores that rose from</seg><seg type="columnLine">below, blotting out the life of our world so hideously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He listened, a memory of fear in his face, until I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">done.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cleon of Yzdral," he said finally, "we will avenge</seg><seg type="columnLine">Atlantis.

For twenty years after my coming to maturity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we strove to perfect ourselves and our weapons to such</seg><seg type="columnLine">an extent that we might hope for success against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Things, at which musty, long-forgotten records hinted.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We had the ray that carves rock, long a tool of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">people, and the blue barrage of the Overlords, but no</seg><seg type="columnLine">more. Vainly had I sought the ancient records for</seg><seg type="columnLine">mention of that lightning of Zeus that was the weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the First Planet, but all had been burned by that</seg><seg type="columnLine">zealot who had brought about the change. And so our</seg><seg type="columnLine">plans were made.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a small cavern, just above the portal into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Underworld, we had carved our first fortress and city,</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside the great fault that ran up five hundred miles to</seg><seg type="columnLine">our desolate inner world. The portal we would also</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortify, and then carve a second fortress, somewhere in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rocky wastes of the mountains that girdled the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Underworld. Should the first city fall, the open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the surface would be automatically sealed, giving</seg><seg type="columnLine">respite to the remaining people of Thula.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I can never forget my first sight of the Underworld.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Down the great chasm of the fault floated aero after</seg><seg type="columnLine">aero, bearing the fifty thousand of our army to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">squat black city that was rising from the cavern floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">About it ran a thin red ribbon of orichalcum, ready to</seg><seg type="columnLine">set up a barrage of flaming energy that no normal force</seg><seg type="columnLine">could pass. Far beyond, flanking the huge arch of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening, were long low fortresses, while three great</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheets of flickering blue sealed the opening itself. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low, the fault dropped into urafathomed blackness, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheer rocks slowly narrowing. It closed at both ends of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cavern, at one of them the triple barrier.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The barrage dropped, and I sped through, between</seg><seg type="columnLine">the looming walls of the forts, into a winding, vaulted</seg><seg type="columnLine">passage that dropped slowly for perhaps a mile until it</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened, high in the face of the cliff, on a wilderness of</seg><seg type="columnLine">tumbled black rock, harsh and ragged as if splintered by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">a sudden blow. Far to the left, through the clustered</seg><seg type="columnLine">crags, a pale white sea lapped soundlessly. Above,</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous grey clouds hung low, concealing the roof of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the huge cavern, which, from the curvature of the wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">must lie not far above, perhaps a mile at the most. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">the right, the fault opened again, this time widening as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it sank into the bowels of the planet, and extending out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sight along the sheer end wall of the cavern.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Not until all was in readiness did we venture beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountains. Then, leading a fleet of a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">aeros, I set out over the troubled waste, following the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chart of those who had been here many years before.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then the mass of black crags was past, and we sped low</seg><seg type="columnLine">over a twisted jungle of horrible vegetation--smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentacular trees rising from steaming pools of creeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow scum, slimy limbs twisting with sentient life,</seg><seg type="columnLine">livid moulds of fungi making great dripping sores in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth, leathery trunks--a living, hellish morass!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Huge orchid-like blooms of rotten purple and festering,</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry crimson clung to the trunks and branches, stirring</seg><seg type="columnLine">hungrily as fetid, putrid odors floated up from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamp. Here and there in the sluggish waters a glist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening formless thing would disturb the slowly stirring</seg><seg type="columnLine">yellow scum. Now and again a tentacular limb would</seg><seg type="columnLine">writhe down into the slime and return, dripping with</seg><seg type="columnLine">filth, its cup-shaped end of smoky orange slowly suck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in an agonizedly twitching form. Once we saw a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge pale grub, larger than a man, blindly groping in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tangle of snaky roots, its naked body horribly alive</seg><seg type="columnLine">with fungus. It was revolting, disgusting, and we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">glad to skirt the steep black shore, hanging low, searching</seg><seg type="columnLine">for the natural amphitheater that lay somewhere beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">this living morass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At last it lay beneath us, a narrow, rising defile open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing into a broad, low-walled oval. Here would be our</seg><seg type="columnLine">second walled city-fortress, where we would lie in</seg><seg type="columnLine">wait, while our ships searched for the unknown Things</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrliose city, whatever it be, lay somewhere beyond in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart of the swamp. We had come prepared to build,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and soon the rock-dust was being blown aside by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cutting blasts, as a strong squat city took form on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">level plain--low enough to afford a poor target for mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siles, massive-walled, roofed with the unbroken rock</seg><seg type="columnLine">from which it was carved, with the great aero-pit in its</seg><seg type="columnLine">center and tier after tier of rooms spreading out over</seg><seg type="columnLine">an area nearly equal to that of one of our great ventila-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tors. About it, and across the neck of the defile ran the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin ribbons of orichalcum that gave rise to our blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">barrage. All this for defense. We must learn more of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Things that we must combat, before we could choose</seg><seg type="columnLine">our weapons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">FOR months we had lost contact wTith the first city,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and now at last I led half our number homeward for</seg><seg type="columnLine">reinforcements. Low through the steaming mists, skirt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the shore for safety, we sped toward the triply</seg><seg type="columnLine">barred portal leading to our great stronghold. Soon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaping corridor opened before us, and we shot up its</seg><seg type="columnLine">tortuous length, bringing up short before the opening</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the cavern, shocked, startled, wondering. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">triple barrage was gone!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reckless of all save the fate of our comrades, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtled through the great arch into the cave. Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">hope had been, lay despair. Fused into a waxen grey</seg><seg type="columnLine">slag, billowing on the cavern floor, were the remains of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our city, the fortress held by four-fifths of our little</seg><seg type="columnLine">324</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">army. Gone were men, aeros, supplies, everything,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruelly annihilated while their leader was not with them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">was supervising the work that a man in ranks might</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seen to, gratifying his curiosity as to the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">world beyond the barrage! Only the fused waste re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mained, melted by some weapon far more awful than</seg><seg type="columnLine">anything of ours. It meant the end for the people of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thula, as for them of Yzdral and Luda!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we put about to leave, a single small aero, capable</seg><seg type="columnLine">of carrying twenty men, dropped from the gloom of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chasm above, a lone survivor of what had occurred.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We dropped to the cave floor and advanced to meet the</seg><seg type="columnLine">single figure that came to meet us. He gave the salute,</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm raised, palm forward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir," he reported, "I wras a messenger from Thula,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing a request for news of your progress. As I</seg><seg type="columnLine">came into the cavern, I saw at once that the barrages</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the portal and about the city were gone. Flooding</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the city were thousands of great spheres of light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bursting into cascades of flame that made the hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">basalt flow like water, fusing the great fortress into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">smoking chaos that suddenly began to turn white with</seg><seg type="columnLine">frost! Then the spheres disappeared, suddenly, into</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin air, and the cavern was empty! There was a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">storm, and then, after a long time, you came. And,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sir, I--I suppose you do not believe me, but there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">nothing there, nothing but the spheres of flame. I swear</seg><seg type="columnLine">it! I arfl telling the truth, or else--I must be mad."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I believe you. You have seen nothing of this Under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">world. You will be more credulous when you have.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You are not mad, do not fear that. Why, the explana-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion is simple, very simple, and what you have seen wrill</seg><seg type="columnLine">aid us greatly! The enemy, whatever they are, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">camouflaged to match the black rock. No wonder you</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not see them! What is really serious is the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we are cut off from the upper world, isolated to</seg><seg type="columnLine">win or. lose as we stand, alone! We must return at</seg><seg type="columnLine">once, and prepare for sudden attack. Come, follow</seg><seg type="columnLine">us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Apparently the Things did not know of our presence</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the oval valley, for during the next two months we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were not molested. As a further precaution against</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise, the mile of plain between the barrage and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">fortress was riddled with fine jets which would spray</seg><seg type="columnLine">forth a quickly drying white enamel, effectively show-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up anything on it. Later, while I was gone, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">extended beyond the barrage, to give ample warning of</seg><seg type="columnLine">approach. Little good it could do us, but that we did</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know then, and when we did it was too late.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then, one day, tired of waiting so fruitlessly, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">manned a small aero with twenty of my youngest men</seg><seg type="columnLine">and set out on a scouting cruise. With me, in the little</seg><seg type="columnLine">control room in the bow of the ship, was the same youth</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had witnessed the destruction of the first fortress;</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was named Hektor (Hector of Troy) after the</seg><seg type="columnLine">custom of the Overlords, a name of ancient Hellas. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed carefree, and scornful of an enemy that must re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sort to disguise, and babbled light-heartedly of a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">poem which he would some day write, an epic of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">conquest of the Underworld. There was a girl, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">older than he, back in Thula, who would welcome him, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hero, and be less haughty before the returned warrior.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He sang the old songs of the First Planet, epics always,</seg><seg type="columnLine">of that first Prince of Quetzal, who bore learning into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the western lands under the plumed manner of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world-serpent, Quetza, whose mouth was the mountain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">above Thula, of the old sea-rovers whence our race</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprang, rousing ballads of war and victory and reward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Poor lad, how could he guess that he would never again</seg><seg type="columnLine">see Thula, never even be able to die? I was twice his</seg><seg type="columnLine">age, already grey. Why could I not have gone, rather</seg><seg type="columnLine">than he? I think that to me life among the Singing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ones would not be cruel, but for him, with hopes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">memories fresh in his mind, I am sure that that part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him that is yet of Man yearns for the old life. But it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not willed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now, miles away over the steaming swamps, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">land was rising slightly, giving birth to a new form of</seg><seg type="columnLine">life. The grey and slimy yellow of the jungle gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">place to a riotous chaos of raw color--bruised purples,</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry crimsons, wan whites, smoky oranges, pale blues.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There lay an enormous tangled forest of gigantic fungi,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bulbous and distorted, that stretched as far as the eye</seg><seg type="columnLine">could scan into the lowering grey mists. There were</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge bulbs on thick stems, and slender twisting spires,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and thick, squat slabs--a livid nightmare forest. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">above it billowed vast dark clouds that tossed uneasily</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the fitful air currents that swept in from the swamp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">land, the grey death-dust that had slain Yzdral. Here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">somewhere in this wilderness of raw, rotting color, must</seg><seg type="columnLine">be the city, the stronghold of the Things we sought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even as we looked out over the twisted sea of vegetation,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the luminous mists swept aside for an instant, and there</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the limit of sight lay a blot of color more vivid even</seg><seg type="columnLine">than the fungi, a blaze of crimson, that vanished again</seg><seg type="columnLine">as the clouds swooped in around us. At a word from</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, we drifted slowly over the wilderness of fungus</seg><seg type="columnLine">growths toward that half-seen vision, moving slowly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">carefully to avoid surprise, for in that instant we might</seg><seg type="columnLine">well have been seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hektor was watching the twisted forest drift past be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath us, trying to count the myriad forms and colors,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps even classifying them mentally. Suddenly he</seg><seg type="columnLine">pointed ahead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Look, Sir! Below there--that cloud. It must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">from a very different sort of fungus, for it is black, so</seg><seg type="columnLine">very black that it is hard to see. All these other spore-</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds are grey, like the death-dust. Might we hover</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a moment, Sir, so that I can look for the fungus?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Certainly. It is a very interesting thing to find here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">is it not? Give the order to drop, and hover over it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was, myself, interested, for the cloud was extremely</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer-looking. It was, as Hektor had said, practically</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible, seen only in silhouette against the vivid colors</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the fungus below it. It was moving slowly, as if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being sucked up into a sort of spherical ball, mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with a queer viscidity that I had never seen in vapor</seg><seg type="columnLine">before. It was apparently very dense, hanging even</seg><seg type="columnLine">lower than the luminous ceiling of clouds and the masses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of grey spores, just above the tops of the fungi.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">NOW we were hanging motionless, barely five hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred feet above it, and I could see plainly that it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was condensing into a smooth, perfect sphere that seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be revolving slowly. Yes, it was spinning more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">more rapidly with every second, and shrinking simul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taneously into a globe less than half the size of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">original sphere. I could feel a tenseness in the air, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">breathlessness that plucked at the mind and stretched it</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the breaking point. Hektor looked drawn and pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside me, his eyes filled with something that I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not state in words, but which I could feel in me, too,</seg><seg type="columnLine">CLEON OF YZDRAL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">325</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">tearing at my mentality. Then the tension burst, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">black sphere leapt in an instant to twice its original size,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then collapsed again like a pricked bladder into a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">black globe from whose hidden heart burned a rosy</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiance, spreading, swelling into a great mottled orb</seg><seg type="columnLine">of opalescent flame, that spun dazzlingly before us as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the tension grew again to unbearable magnitude. Be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">side me, Hektor gave a strangled, agonized groan, ris-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing suddenly to a high-pitched chatter of terror.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Zeus! The flame! Poseidon save me! Why do</seg><seg type="columnLine">you stand there, you fool? Zeus damn you, can't you</seg><seg type="columnLine">see? It is the flame--the Thing!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Madly he hurled me aside and jerked at the controls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like a talcon unhooded, we sprang into the air, fled</seg><seg type="columnLine">blindly. What could he mean? Was he mad, fasci-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nated by the shining globe of light? Or could it be--</seg><seg type="columnLine">could that cloud of black vapor be the Thing we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeking to destroy? The reply came soon. From the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whirling ball of light a light darted jet on jet of rose-</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame, beautiful but awful, blinding us! On the instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">came a blaze of awful heat., then we were falling head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">long through empty air, gasping in the unnatural at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mosphere, the half destroyed control room still about</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, while ship, crew, everything else fell in a searing rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">of molten matter! Huge twisted forms rushed up at</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, there was a pulpy rending, a shattering of crystal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and black silence!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I came to myself to find the remains of the control</seg><seg type="columnLine">room buried in a disgusting mass of fungoid refuse,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we had brought with us in our crashing descent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This it was that broke our fall and saved us from later</seg><seg type="columnLine">destruction by the black mist-creature, for when we</seg><seg type="columnLine">struggled out of our crystal prison, shaken and filthy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but otherwise quite safe, we found the fused remains of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the aero fairly bristling with frost crystals. The air</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the wreck was deathly cold, and the fungi nearest</seg><seg type="columnLine">the burned area were shriveling under the unaccustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">temperature. Above, from the lowering clouds, wras</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropping a fine grey snow, such as is but rarely found</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the upper world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hektor, rather sheepish since his display of unguarded</seg><seg type="columnLine">terror, spoke timidly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sir, what makes this? We saw that Thing melt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">aero. We felt the awful heat. And now it is so cold--</seg><seg type="columnLine">frost forms on the wreckage. I--I cannot understand</seg><seg type="columnLine">how it can be, yet it is just as I saw it before, at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city." He shuddered at the memory of that scene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am beginning to understand much of the nature of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this Thing, Hektor," I replied. "Perhaps if we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach the fortress again, I can devise a weapon or a bet-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter defense. It hurls energy, pure energy drawn from</seg><seg type="columnLine">itself, into whatever it attacks, causing it to disrupt and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fuse under the strain and sudden release of heat. Then,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when it is all over, it sucks back the energy out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">molten mass, its" own energy and the energy of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing it destroyed, leaving it absolutely heatless. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think, Hektor, that were that fused metal not too aw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fully cold to touch, even the smallest bit would tax our</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength to lift. Its particles are packed very closely,</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer than in anything natural that we may find. Does</seg><seg type="columnLine">not that mass of metal seem small, to have been an aero,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and does it not seem unnaturally smooth and dense?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Were we to remain here, it would expand almost visibly</seg><seg type="columnLine">as heat came into it from the air and gave its particles</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy of motion, kinetic energy. But it is too cold</seg><seg type="columnLine">to remain here, and the convection currents will bring</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">on a storm such as you saw in the cavern of the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, a storm the like of which these jungles have never</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen. Have you any idea as to where the fortress</seg><seg type="columnLine">lies?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "None, Sir. The compass was in the other part of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the control cabin."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then we must search as best we can for the edge</seg><seg type="columnLine">of this forest, where we can see the mountains. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be the swamp to cross, though, unless they search</seg><seg type="columnLine">for us with an aero. Come, we are doing no good here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the Thing may return."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For days on end we struggled through that putrid</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangle that was the ages-old floor of the fungus forest,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while overhead the pale clouds were tossed and torn by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great winds that raged through the thin air, limited</seg><seg type="columnLine">only by that thinness, while great fungi toppled and fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">about us with a horrid liquid crushing of massive fleshy</seg><seg type="columnLine">growths, adding to the deep mat of decayed matter that</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered the ground. Rivers of cold air followed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">contour of the fungus jungle, blighting the huge bul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bous things as they flowed through the hollows. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the storm was brief in duration, the half-buried mass</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking up heat very quickly from the rotting mould,</seg><seg type="columnLine">though not as fast as the fortress, with its far greater sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face. Then, at last, after many days of blind stumbling</seg><seg type="columnLine">through that nightmare wilderness, suffering from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">thin air until our burning lungs adapted themselves to</seg><seg type="columnLine">their task, the fungi grew smaller, thinned, and vanished</seg><seg type="columnLine">entirely, leaving us on the edge of a great smooth cup of</seg><seg type="columnLine">glassy, black basalt that sloped steeply down for nearly</seg><seg type="columnLine">half a mile, and curved out in a mighty oval bowl five</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles across.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In it lay the Crimson City of the vapor creatures.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Built entirely of crimson marble, with an underlying</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinge of deep scarlet, it lay like a blazing coal in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">heart of the black bowl. Its architecture was very evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently patterned after the fungi that swarmed about it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Squat, bulging shapes massed about huge towering</seg><seg type="columnLine">shafts--spherical dome on slender column, spiraling</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame-tongue, thick-stemmed hooded parasol--all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">myriad shapes of the fungi, adapted to suit habitation</seg><seg type="columnLine">and carved entirely from the crimson marble. At the</seg><seg type="columnLine">edges, the buildings were low and sprawling, and as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center was reached, they rose into a thrusting twisted</seg><seg type="columnLine">maze of crimson forms, shooting up in a nightmare</seg><seg type="columnLine">wilderness in perfect monochrome mimicry of the mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">strous jungle behind us, clustering about some central</seg><seg type="columnLine">horror that was hidden from us. And everywhere be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the smooth red walls flowed dense black shapes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of mist, drifting slowly and flowing in viscid haste from</seg><seg type="columnLine">opening to black opening that flecked the crimson shafts.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Above the silence, from somewhere in the city's heart,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose a fine thin keening, at the very peak of the ability to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear, as of a taut wire whining in the gale. It was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">tense, unpleasant sound that made me shudder involun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tarily, sending little icy chills up and down my spine, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw Hektor grit his teeth suddenly and fiercely at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound. Yet there was damnable fascination in it, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the city with its tangled inferno of crimson stone, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we stood gazing at it, regardless of the danger of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE suspected nothing, until the reflection of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city in the polished rock at our feet suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">vanished, and a darting arm of black vapor rose to</seg><seg type="columnLine">blot out the crimson vision, then dropped about us. At</seg><seg type="columnLine">326</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">once we knew that these invisible things were not of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordinary vapor, for through such we might have</seg><seg type="columnLine">ploughed with ease to the shelter of the fungi. This</seg><seg type="columnLine">black stuff was as dense as it looked, and denser by</seg><seg type="columnLine">far, for we battered at its closing wall as at rock. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">it had not the feeling of rock, to the touch, for there was</seg><seg type="columnLine">a yielding to it, almost as of flesh, and a subtle energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">that made me tingle from head to foot. Strange stuff</seg><seg type="columnLine">indeed, a definite physical barrier, yet for all its firm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness a vapor, whose outer edges were tossed by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">winds that still stirred. Frankly, it was beyond all my</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding of the properties of matter. Certain it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was that such a property must needs be governed by con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scious control, like a flexing of our own muscles, yet it</seg><seg type="columnLine">should have been utterly impossible in a vapor. My</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind refused to grasp its actuality.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the vapor swirled above and beneath us, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">solid ground dropped out from under our feet. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a moment's sickening drop into emptiness, then a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long smooth glide, constantly accelerating, and a series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">complex motions that we were unable to interpret. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing gave us a clue, trapped as we were in the heart of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vapor thing. The piercing wail from the crimson</seg><seg type="columnLine">city swelled into nerve-shattering shrillness, rising slight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly in pitch as we sped faster, then seemed to loose its di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection and pureness of pitch, telling us that we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">now in the city itself, speeding between those echoing</seg><seg type="columnLine">crimson walls.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now the thing thickened beneath our feet, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were shoved up and out, through a widening gap,</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the light, out on the top of the great cloud of vapor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">encircled to the waist with its binding coils. We were</seg><seg type="columnLine">driving straight into that tumbled labyrinth of crimson</seg><seg type="columnLine">fantasy that was the heart of the city. Through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisting corridors, pouring from narrow slot-like open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, converging on our creature and j billing themselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">to it, came hoards of the vapor things, great and small,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisp and cloud, merging in one great body, one enormous</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thing, carrying us Zeus knew whither, for some great,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unknown purpose that required its presence as an inte-</seg><seg type="columnLine">grated entity, a race of one Thing, yet of numberless</seg><seg type="columnLine">parts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The distorted crimson walls clustered closer, denser,</seg><seg type="columnLine">merging into a great oval central mass of rose-pink, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow black slit high in its side. And we were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted high on a column of black mist, racing at breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking speed straight for that single visible opening, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">hurtling through and down into the light again, the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mist sweeping after us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were in a mighty bowl of purest white, blending</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a rose-flush at the towering edges. Up from its very</seg><seg type="columnLine">center stabbed a flickering shaft of vivid blue light, and -</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it shrieked the wailing, shattering at our ears in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cessantly, filling all the great bowl with its horrid din.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A misty arm shot forth from the body of cloud that bore</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, and caressed a squat black block, set with little red</seg><seg type="columnLine">cups, that lay beside the gaping pit from which the shaft</seg><seg type="columnLine">sprung. The shriek rose to a crescendo and vanished, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the folds of my clothing I felt a crystal lens shatter to</seg><seg type="columnLine">bits. And then we were set down beside the low black</seg><seg type="columnLine">railing that barred us from the blue shaft, while all about,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bathing the snowy walls of the cup with their inky flood,</seg><seg type="columnLine">were the mist folk, circling us completely, barring all</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape save the pit. As in answer to my thought, an arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">of vapor shot forth from the edge of the black mass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrenched the slender pack from Hektor's back, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">flicked it into the shaft of blue light. It vanished into</seg><seg type="columnLine">a golden haze, that became merely a local deepening of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue, then diffused and disappeared. There' was no</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape there!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> What followed I have never precisely understood---</seg><seg type="columnLine">how the vapor creatures were able physically to suck in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">formation--thoughts--from our brains. But the fact</seg><seg type="columnLine">remains. Out of that murky cloud, visible only by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead black contrast of its boundaries, sprang two thin</seg><seg type="columnLine">coils of mist that settled rigidly over our heads, capping</seg><seg type="columnLine">them with clinging black fog, closing about our brains.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They had not the cold, damp feeling of fog, or of most</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the ordinary vapors, but almost a bodily warmth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">filled with pure energy. I felt as never before the alive-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness of these folk of black mist.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Through the snug contact of the caps, I could feel a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rhythmic unease flowing through all that great mass,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stirring it in slow uncertain waves that gained strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">and purpose as time passed, felt w^hat I could not see.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then came the voice of the creatures, how produced I</seg><seg type="columnLine">know not, but a true voice of communication and ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pression entirely apart from the unity of thought con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tact that was in their strange mingling. It was a low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep-throated crooning, floating up as at a great distance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with something of a forlorn wail in its fathomless depth.</seg><seg type="columnLine">At first, like busy insects in the gardens of Thula it</seg><seg type="columnLine">came, tentative and dreamy, then with the purpose and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unison of the swarming hive, swelling in volume and</seg><seg type="columnLine">meaning far beyond all human powers of comparison,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifting in long surging billows of sound that lulled like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the listless swell of the sea in calm. We were comfort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">able, drowsy, wrapped snugly in the warm blankets of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mist, soothed by the rolling drone of music that</seg><seg type="columnLine">flooded about us, lulling and lulling. Sleep was good,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after all the labor of the past, and I felt my senses numb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing slowly, deadening, my will slipping lazily into slum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ber. But somewhere, as a bright clear flame in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreaming sea of blackness, conscious awareness burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my brain. Even as my muscles sagged in unconscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness, it blazed bright, almost as a second external self.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And in it, or with it, I felt the cunning draining of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, the sapping of my knowledge, sucked out into</seg><seg type="columnLine">that great body of black life, every fact, every thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nervous impression of my life flowing eagerly into</seg><seg type="columnLine">that relentless maw. And I knew that the hidden fort-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ress was doomed!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I do not know how long I lay senseless, part of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Things. I came again to life in a small unbroken sphere</seg><seg type="columnLine">of crimson rock, ventilated, lighted I know not how.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In my brain lingered the mocking echo of the crooning</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mist people, and with it an emptiness, a lightness,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a feeling of expansion, and I remembered the sucking of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vampire Things. I must still have been of them, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">part, for as I gazed bewildered about me, a portion of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wall receded and disappeared, showing a vaulted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">well-lit passage without. Weakly I crawled through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow opening, and started slowly down the corridor</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the faint gleam of day at its end. Smooth and</seg><seg type="columnLine">oval it ran, straight to a great railed balcony jutting out</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the city. Rooms there must have been, cells like</seg><seg type="columnLine">mine, but as mine their doors were invisible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">LEANING wearily against the broad rail was a fa-</seg><seg type="columnLine">miliar figure--Hektor. Younger than I, his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">probably less strained by the drawing forth of its</seg><seg type="columnLine">smaller store, he had recovered sooner. With a word he</seg><seg type="columnLine">CLEON OF YZDRAL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">327</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">greeted me, then turned to gaze again out over the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tangled chaos of spires and rounded roof-tops that</seg><seg type="columnLine">marked the upper levels of the city. The screaming of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue shaft had begun again, dinning in our ears</seg><seg type="columnLine">from somewhere beyond our own building, while oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">casionally a muffled booming rose from the narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorges of the streets, where vocally conversing vapor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures drifted to and fro. For a long time Hektor</seg><seg type="columnLine">was silent, then, without turning, he spoke.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cleon--Sir--you have seen more of this world than</seg><seg type="columnLine">I, understand better its laws and possibilities. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought often, before, of the life that is in us, of what</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms it might assume, but never did I imagine this.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This--these things are alien to me, impossible. How can</seg><seg type="columnLine">life be like this? Where is its analogy in our outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">world? Oh, Cleon, I am afraid--of what, I cannot</seg><seg type="columnLine">tell, but deathly afraid! When I felt them draining me</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my thoughts, there in the arena, I was afraid that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">would never regain them, never awake, to this universe</seg><seg type="columnLine">at least. I have a queer feeling, here in the back of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain, that we are dim to them, unreal, fearful menaces,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps. I think that they are keyed higher than we--</seg><seg type="columnLine">that their droning is communication by touch rather than</seg><seg type="columnLine">b.y sound, that that cursed w^ailing is but a gentle murmur</seg><seg type="columnLine">to them, even below the range of hearing, except when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it rises beyond our own. Perhaps they are not entirely</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we see them, vapor creatures, but truly firm and solid</seg><seg type="columnLine">in some other plane. And yet--their life must be</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange, conflicting, for they are aware of our world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their buildings are of it. I--it is beyond me. There is</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth in what I say, I feel it, somehow, and yet--there</seg><seg type="columnLine">are lies, cunning lies to trap us! It--my mind--tells</seg><seg type="columnLine">me so."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I replied:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It may well be as you say, Hektor, I do not know.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But to me there is nothing impossible or without analogy</seg><seg type="columnLine">in them. To me, Hektor, they are much as we.</seg><seg type="columnLine">They are vapor, true, and an unnatural vapor, but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">think they belong to this world more than to any other.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Fundamentally there is the same backing of natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">laws, though the application may be different. How do</seg><seg type="columnLine">we establish contact with our world, and apply our</seg><seg type="columnLine">science? Do we not draw energy from our own bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">to battle against man and nature? Do we not use pure</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy, change it from form to form--matter, light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">heat, work--put it into the planet from which we draw</seg><seg type="columnLine">it again in food and power, to replenish and augment</seg><seg type="columnLine">our store? We are not very efficient in our processes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so we die, but these creatures need no bypaths and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridges in their cycle of energy. You saw that quality</seg><seg type="columnLine">in their destruction of the aero--how they changed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy of their bodies into the flame that fused the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal instantly, then drew it back, and more with it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to keep life in themselves. Where, fundamentally, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">the difference?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And then, their curious oneness, their seeming ability</seg><seg type="columnLine">to act individually or as one unified entity, never quite</seg><seg type="columnLine">one or the other, but always bound together by some tie</seg><seg type="columnLine">â¢which we do not understand. Are we not the same?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Think of us men, each working for self and for race</seg><seg type="columnLine">alike, living, thinking, acting alone or all too often in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mobs, welded together by a single cause, a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought, into unified action. Have you never seen a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great mob, flowing like a mighty wave of humanity, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lentlessly to their single purpose, its single purpose,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking and acting as one being ? I have seen men flow</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">thus, as a mighty flooding wave in liquid--or in vapor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Is there so great a difference?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Even their existence in vapor I can understand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dimly; can find analogy in ourselves. To me, solid life</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be harder to understand than yielding, plastic</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapor. You have never seen truly solid life, Hektor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">nor has any man. What of our own bodies, the bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the other beasts of our outer world? Are they not</seg><seg type="columnLine">built up of myriad tiny cells, tiny unit lives, liquid lives?</seg><seg type="columnLine">We are liquid, Hektor, made firm and purposeful by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unity of life. These creatures about us are vapor, as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are liquid, and their unity must be greater than ours,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as must be their power, their controlling mental strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">that makes them what they are.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, Hektor, there is not such a great gap between</seg><seg type="columnLine">us and them. Everywhere that life is found, there are</seg><seg type="columnLine">its basic factors, the fundamentals that identify it--con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">trolled transformation of energy, the ability of conscious</seg><seg type="columnLine">unification, and motion to a purpose. All things, all</seg><seg type="columnLine">evolution from lower form, all progress of great races</seg><seg type="columnLine">hinge on these. Perhaps all hinge upon the first, though</seg><seg type="columnLine">my mind asks for more than that alone. Many say that</seg><seg type="columnLine">life is but an automatic behavior resulting from natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">laws, blind and helplessly mechanical. Do not these laws</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nature outline a Purpose toward which all life</seg><seg type="columnLine">moves? Many say that evolution follows accidental</seg><seg type="columnLine">paths toward degeneration or monstrosity, but was there</seg><seg type="columnLine">not a purpose in that motion from a simple to a complex</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence, futile though the result may be? Many, very</seg><seg type="columnLine">many, say, that because of Man's machines and his</seg><seg type="columnLine">science he shall sink back into oblivion, die the death of</seg><seg type="columnLine">a race. But do not his machines make more efficient his</seg><seg type="columnLine">control of energy, enlarge his store limitlessly, enable</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to mould the universe into a likeness of the Purpose</seg><seg type="columnLine">that includes all things? There are differences, Hektor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">differences that make many men deny life for what it is.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We are not as an amoeba, nor as a sea-worm, nor a</seg><seg type="columnLine">flower. These vapor folk are not as we. But, to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind, the difference is a simple one. All things differ</seg><seg type="columnLine">in life. We are more alive, far more alive than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bacillus or the worm. And these vapor creatures are</seg><seg type="columnLine">more alive than we. Any race, any entity that is able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">fulfill the three bases of life, is able to control the energy</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the world about him, and unify, and move steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the Purpose that lies behind everything, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">who can do these more intelligently, more efficiently</seg><seg type="columnLine">than we, must be more alive than we!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Zeus, Poseidon, Bel*--whatever you may call Him</seg><seg type="columnLine">who has formed the Purpose and written the Equation</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Space and Time, has made sure that so long as life</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall be, so shall progress exist. We are part of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Equation, governing it and governed by it, our path pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">destined yet flexible to our every will. Some day, per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">haps after eternity, beyond infinity, a race will grasp that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Purpose in its entirety, see the great Equation in its full.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man will not, but Man will have shortened the road by</seg><seg type="columnLine">many an endless age. Near the top, the way grows</seg><seg type="columnLine">rougher, steeper, and race after race must live and pour</seg><seg type="columnLine">its life into another race, and pass away, not dead, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">absorbed into living. When two paths conflict, one</seg><seg type="columnLine">must give way, as we are giving way to these Things,</seg><seg type="columnLine">these vapor creatures. There must be conflict, for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ever, but we must know it for what it is, an attempt to</seg><seg type="columnLine">put away inefficiency and disunion, by whatever sordid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*A Babylonian deity, god of the earth.

Men will fight men, until Man</seg><seg type="columnLine">must fight another race and rise on its ashes. But in</seg><seg type="columnLine">fighting, men may defeat that ultimate, hidden urge, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a degree die, sink beneath their peak for long ages,</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps forever, while a lesser race takes their place and</seg><seg type="columnLine">climbs unaided to new heights that might have been theirs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But this is dreaming--preaching! I cannot explain</seg><seg type="columnLine">what I feel, cannot feel all that is there. In a way, it is</seg><seg type="columnLine">written on Space and Time; in a way, it is for Man to</seg><seg type="columnLine">write it. These Things are higher than we, but we must</seg><seg type="columnLine">strive against them, and if we win we shall rise higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">than they in ages to come!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A little I see, O Cleon,:" said Hektor, "but much is</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouded, unclear. You are older than I, though my</seg><seg type="columnLine">years are no longer my age, and your vision may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">broader. The Equation I can almost grasp--its pres-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence and nature, but not its meaning. And yet--ah, well,</seg><seg type="columnLine">come! I know the way to the streets. We are free in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this city, but unable to leave it. -Let us try to under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stand more of this queer race, and how it may be de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feated. Come."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Hektor said, the city was open to us. Mentally we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were en rapport with the things, and doors were not</seg><seg type="columnLine">barred to us. We found little that we could compre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hend. Life was not as we knew it, understood it. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">red buildings were there, riddled with curious cells and</seg><seg type="columnLine">corridors, but we could not tell their significance in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapor world, whether home, or shelter, or--what. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapor things ignored us, flowed silently around us in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ugly torrents, as if we were rocks in the path. One bit</seg><seg type="columnLine">of machinery we found, one tangible thing that could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">studied and understood in part--the pit in the arena,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we named the Pit of Blue Sound.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out of that great railed pit vomited a mighty beam</seg><seg type="columnLine">of sound, waves of enormous frequency that battered at</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter and tore it into its component atoms. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white arena, the thin air above it was ripped asunder,</seg><seg type="columnLine">energized until it gave off the blue light of the beam.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Beside the pit lay the only mechanical device that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">found in all the Crimson City--a plate of crystal vi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">brated by electrical energy, as we have done in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratories of Thula, setting up a wave of sound in it-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self destructive to life, and far beyond the range of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">senses. By interference, the two waves merged into</seg><seg type="columnLine">one, heterodyned as some would say, giving a lower note,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the high thin wail of the blue shaft. This we discovered</seg><seg type="columnLine">by experiment and by reasoning, but the source of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Blue Sound, somewhere far below' the city, we could not</seg><seg type="columnLine">imagine. Physical phenomenon, production of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapor-things of something higher still than they--I</seg><seg type="columnLine">shall never know which. We of Thula know only its</seg><seg type="columnLine">nature, its resulting phenomena, and no more. Hektor--</seg><seg type="columnLine">but Hektor cannot tell. Perhaps, as we thought by reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">of its location, it was the deity of the things, or else</seg><seg type="columnLine">their place of execution, if such could exist in such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">race, but all was mere conjecture. And yet I think it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not entirely of these, but still more, even as the sap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phire wonder of the Singing Ones. But I must go on.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">HEKTOR, of late, often explored without me, delv-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing down in the dark corridors beneath the city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then, one day, he returned pale and strangely silent,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  *The Quetzal was a bird, considered a deity or symbol of a deity by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Aztecs and Mayas. It is the national emblem of Guatemala, as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagle is of the United States, or the lion of England.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">with fear and guilt in his suddenly aged eyes. He re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fused to go out again, seemed to shun the open, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">he might see and be seen by the vapor people. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">would not speak to me of what he had seen, but once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as he muttered in his infrequent, uneasy sleep, I caught</seg><seg type="columnLine">a few disjointed words that made me wonder and fear</seg><seg type="columnLine">likewise. He mouthed the words hoarsly, and whispered</seg><seg type="columnLine">cunningly to himself, his open eyes fixed on emptiness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The glory--the glory--ah, the white glory of light! I</seg><seg type="columnLine">have seen it--seen it!--They do not know! They will</seg><seg type="columnLine">not know, not for many days!--Hard. Hard, but brit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tle ! Oh yes, very brittle--But they do not know! They</seg><seg type="columnLine">must not! They will kill us! We must escape!--But</seg><seg type="columnLine">we cannot, not from them.--Oh, I was mad, mad to fear,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to strike, but I did not know, I thought it was as they</seg><seg type="columnLine">are, soft and yielding, not brittle!--The glory! Ah,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zeus, I am afraid, afraid!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> *He had found something wonderful, apparently, some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">where in the bowels of the city, something beautiful but</seg><seg type="columnLine">fearful, and in mad terror had struck blindly, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed it. It was something of awful importance,</seg><seg type="columnLine">something whose destruction meant our death as soon as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it should be discovered--a god, perhaps, or something</seg><seg type="columnLine">akin. And I was afraid, with Hektor, and waited for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">day when they must discover his deed, and sweep in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thick cloud of fury toward us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It came, a day of double horror to me. Again we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">borne to the arena, again the white walls flowed black</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapor, again close-fitting caps of mist enclosed our</seg><seg type="columnLine">throbbing brains. But this time thoughts came to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pictures, and I understood that for all this time these</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures of mist had been resting, feeding, storing up</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy for the great final destruction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I saw the narrow defile through the black cliffs, clouds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of inky vapor billowing against the barrier of blue. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw the spheres of flame form, saw the barrier flicker</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fade, and the towers of safety fuse and flow. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the army of the Things had poured out over the plain,</seg><seg type="columnLine">circling the single frail wall of blue fire, trying it, seek-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing out its weakest spot with devilish cunning. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not fear it, for energy is but food to their kind, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">food in sudden excess is unsafe. The fort lay silent be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind its girdle of white, against which the black flow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the hordes showed clearly. And now, hovering above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blasted rock of the defile, I saw an aero, one of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">old aeros of Yzdral! The upper world had come to our</seg><seg type="columnLine">rescue!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a single instant my heart leaped wildly with joy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then sank in disgust and" hate. For they of the aero</seg><seg type="columnLine">were cowards, craven! Some new, powerful weapon</seg><seg type="columnLine">they must have, else they had not come in so small an</seg><seg type="columnLine">aero. It lay in their power to save us, save their own</seg><seg type="columnLine">kin, men of their race, from the awful death of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapor things! And they slunk in safety beyond the rim</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the plain, fearing to risk their precious lives for</seg><seg type="columnLine">others, afraid to trust in the judgment of those men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wisdom who had armed and sent them forth to conquer!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cowards all, unfit to bear the banner of Poseidon! *.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> My mind turned in aversion, turned to the fortress,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where a great sphere of opalescence was forming, send-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing forth little streamers of rose flame that melted into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blue barrier, and beat it down in a torrent of ming-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling, fusing fire. Over the helpless city poured the hosts</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Things, fusing it to a smoking mass of slag, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">sucking forth its energy until it glistened white with</seg><seg type="columnLine">frost. And now, with savage gladness in my heart, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">CLEON OF YZDRAL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">329</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the craven aero flee in sudden terror out across the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamp, the black mists swirling after!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of a sudden the picture was blotted out, and angrily</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mist folk tore at my mind. Into my brain flashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the truth,. In victory they had sought that which Hektor</seg><seg type="columnLine">had destroyed, had found it dead and shattered, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to avenge! On the instant I was jerked high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hektor beside me. Before me the mist bulked high,</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to spin and thicken in the form of a great sphere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt the tearing at our senses, the plucking at our</seg><seg type="columnLine">brains, the tensing of the vibrant atmosphere, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ball of flame burst forth in our very faces, not</seg><seg type="columnLine">opalescent as before, but angry red, shot with little dazzl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing corruscations of electric blue. Nearly within the</seg><seg type="columnLine">reach of my arm it hung, towering above us, a living</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball of glorious flame, yet heatless, and pulsing with con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">suming hate and evil. From it leapt tiny ribbons of</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame, narrow blue tentacles that streamed past me to</seg><seg type="columnLine">where Hektor hung whimpering, and plucked him from</seg><seg type="columnLine">his place. As he was hurled past me into the heart of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sphere, I could see his body alive with leaping, crack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling blue fire, bathing him and sinking into him. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was gone, and the great sphere burst into blinding</seg><seg type="columnLine">white light, as the angry drone of the vapor things rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to a frenzied crescendo. And then he was spewed forth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strangely rigid, into my grasp, as a man dead, yet filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with the hellish life of the Things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sphere was forming again, swiftly, the little blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">streamers leaping from its whirling surface, then darting</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward me. But even as they swept over me, the vibrant</seg><seg type="columnLine">energy of them thrilling and surging in me, there came a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushing roar of mighty winds, and I was hurled high</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the great bowl by the force of the tempest and</seg><seg type="columnLine">borne along on the wings of the wind, Hektor clutched</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my arms, the sphere of flame gone forever. For an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant I saw, advancing swiftly through the broken for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">est of fungi, a great wall of pale white water, dimly</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous, bearing down with awful speed upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Crimson City! The sea had broken through the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tains ! Then I was hurtling above the lashing jungle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about me torn wrisps of scudding black showing dim</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the riddled clouds, borne by the terrible fury of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the winds. My breath was sucked from my striving</seg><seg type="columnLine">lungs by the tempest, and all the world dissolved in</seg><seg type="columnLine">flame-shot blackness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I woke in a welter of whipping waters, borne like a</seg><seg type="columnLine">bit of drift from crest to trough, Hektor still lying rigid</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my locked grip. A black hulk was silhouetted against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the clouds, then rushed down upon us--one of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">living trees of the swamp. Vainly my weakened hands</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrabbled at the leathery smoothness of the huge trunk,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then, as it seemed about to plunge over me and beat me</seg><seg type="columnLine">down into the pale water, my clawing fingers sank into</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the many great sores eaten by fungi into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">otherwise unbroken trunk, sank deep and clung desper-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ately. Slowly I began to raise Hektor, to lay his stiff</seg><seg type="columnLine">body across the broad trunk of the tree and follow him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to safety. And after an age it was done, and I sank</seg><seg type="columnLine">again into sleep.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The waters were still when I awoke, rising and fall-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in long uneasy swells. Hektor lay beside me, motion-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less, his body set as in death, yet I could see the faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulse of veins in his temple and hear the slow hiss of</seg><seg type="columnLine">breath through clenched teeth. About us the milky sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">ran endlessly away beneath the scudding clouds. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">black crags were lost in distance, now, and beneath these</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled waters lay the drowned jungles of that un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known land beyond the Crimson City, The great tree on</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we lay, too, was different from those that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had seen before. The slatey trunk and leathery skin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like bark were the same, but its tentacles were slenderer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">more ribbon-like, and fitted with meshed clusters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">filaments, like little nets, about the edge of the crimson</seg><seg type="columnLine">sucking-cups. This tree must have fed in water that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was flowing, bearing food into the net that it set. Its</seg><seg type="columnLine">roots bore this out. They were stouter and less flexible</seg><seg type="columnLine">than those of the swamp trees. Somewhere, then, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamp must have an outlet, but where ? Were we being</seg><seg type="columnLine">borne into the chasm of this buried world?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For untold time we drifted, and it seemed to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">troubled mind that the current had a definite set, that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were being carried to a certain death. And through all</seg><seg type="columnLine">those fear-filled hours Hektor lay stiff and motionless</seg><seg type="columnLine">beside me. Then, far before us appeared a low-slung</seg><seg type="columnLine">mass, speeding in our direction, against the current!</seg><seg type="columnLine">With every hour of pressing time it drew nearer, and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could see a great monster's head rising from a dully</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming body, with flailing limbs on either side--a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dragon of the sea! But even as I drew my sword, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw a second figure standing where the neck of the mon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ster joined its half-submerged body--a human figure,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clad in glittering metal scales, with golden hair stream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing free beneath a winged helm, and I knew him for</seg><seg type="columnLine">what he was--a man of Thule!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CENTURIES ago, in the days of the First Planet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thule and Atlantis shared the world, island At-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lantis and Thule' of the many gates--a mountain land,</seg><seg type="columnLine">writh myriad narrow arms of the sea breaking the pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cipitous coastline. From an ancient root, older than</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man, comes the words that name them--Thula, city of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the many portals; Thule, land of the many fjords. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a northern land, where the sun often hung low above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the grey sea for long week after week, and mountains</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ice swept down the sea lanes from the pole--a hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">land and the land of a hard race. For the men of Thule</seg><seg type="columnLine">were savage, warriors all, and in their dragon ships,</seg><seg type="columnLine">patterned after beasts of legend that no man now remem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bers, they swept the seas to the southward, bringing</seg><seg type="columnLine">death and destruction with them. Upon Atlantis they</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell, but the cunning of that race that had conquered Mu</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the emerald isles and the barren uplands of the Yellow</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ones was too great for their valor, and they fell before</seg><seg type="columnLine">us. But the fathers of Atlantis were born old, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">their wisdom they forgave the bold men of the north</seg><seg type="columnLine">and made them allies. We gave them of our culture,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as they could understand, and from the squalid</seg><seg type="columnLine">savages rose a race of god-men--giants all, with flowing</seg><seg type="columnLine">hair and beard of spun gold, and eyes keen and blue</seg><seg type="columnLine">as good steel. When Thula came to the Second Planet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">many were with us, and when the Overlords drove forth</seg><seg type="columnLine">the degenerate people, the men of Thule went also, of</seg><seg type="columnLine">their own will and purpose--no man knew whither, save</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps that Quetzal who led the way.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The dragon ship rushed down upon us, and with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">straining of oars hung still, like a falcon poised. Strong</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms dragged us over the low gunwales, great hands,</seg><seg type="columnLine">warriors' hands, gave me food and drink, and strove to</seg><seg type="columnLine">force it upon Hektor, but in vain. And as wre sped</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the cresting sea, he who was their leader, Thor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vald Nilsson told me the history of the men of Thule,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after they left the upper world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">330</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had gone with Quetzalcoatl and his followers</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the caverns where the race settled, but unlike them</seg><seg type="columnLine">went onward and downward, to a narrow land beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the white sea of the Underworld--a fertile land, lit by an</seg><seg type="columnLine">everflowing river of molten rock, where real trees grew,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and flowers, with beasts that their fathers had fought</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the north of Thule in days long gone. And here they</seg><seg type="columnLine">lived and launched their dragon ships in the strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">white sea that lapped upon their bouldered beaches.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In a single great fjord the pale-lit waters ran past</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls of rock that barred their pleasant land from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird world of the Things. Long since they had found</seg><seg type="columnLine">this unnatural land, and the black Things, and with them</seg><seg type="columnLine">another race, of which he spoke but' vaguely, the Singing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ones. They avoided these shores, but when the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">rushed down upon the Underworld, they were drawn</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the mad maelstrom and spewed out upon the silent</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters that hid the swamps and the Crimson City.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have seen such as he, before, O man of Yzdral,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">he said, "and some the Singing Ones have made whole</seg><seg type="columnLine">again, but sometimes even they have failed. I think it</seg><seg type="columnLine">will be wise to seek them, for if it be as ye have said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">that this man has unveiled the secret of the Black Ones,</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as remain will seek ye out for vengeance, and with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Singing Ones we will be safe. There is danger of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the chasm, with this flood pouring through the gate, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">we of Thule have never yet feared danger, nor ever will,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it comes to me that ye are not one to flinch."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And now we put about and ran with the current, save</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster, for a long time, how long I cannot say, for our</seg><seg type="columnLine">chronoscopes were gone and there was no night here.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even as Thorvald, I took my turn at the oars, strength-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ening my sickened muscles, or engaged in sword-play on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the short forward deck, with the shouts of the rowers</seg><seg type="columnLine">in my ears above the hiss of the waves and the oars. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">always Hektor lay as dead, breathing slowly, his pulse a</seg><seg type="columnLine">mere flicker, yet needless of food or drink, so great was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the energy that the sphere of the Things had poured into</seg><seg type="columnLine">him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To north and south the mountains had appeared,</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing in from the low horizon in a great funnel into</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the rushing waters poured. Now we had no need</seg><seg type="columnLine">of oars, for the leaping waves bore us on with awful</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed, the wind whipping our beards and hair and scream-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in our ears. The oarsmen were resting, building</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength for their final great struggle with the sea. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">the walls of black were narrowing faster, drawing to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether to form a great river of wanly flaming water,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose shores rose steep to the drooping clouds. At first</seg><seg type="columnLine">miles in width, the rushing torrent swept down into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow channel bitten deep in the rock, barely a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet across, in which the white waves leaped and boiled</seg><seg type="columnLine">as in a cauldron, dashing high against the smooth-cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls. Still no man took to the oars, except to save us</seg><seg type="columnLine">from crashing into the walls, but as time passed I</seg><seg type="columnLine">sensed a tensing, an awaiting for some last struggle for</seg><seg type="columnLine">life or death. Above the howl of the wind in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">gorge, and the lashing roar of angry water, rose a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">sound, a drumming thunder, far distant and muffled by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the echoing cliffs. And now Thorvald rose from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">seat, where he had been idly gaming with dice, left hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">against right, and strode to the guiding oar. As silently</seg><seg type="columnLine">each man took his seat, and rubbed into his palms the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rosin that assured his grip on the oars. The great oars</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose, and swung forward, lying against the hull, ready</seg><seg type="columnLine">to plunge and strike. At a sign from Thorvald I drag-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ged Hektor to a spot just under the sweeping dragon's *</seg><seg type="columnLine">neck, and lashed him there with leather thongs, then</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined the chieftain at the steering oar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The drumming rose louder now, drowning out all else</seg><seg type="columnLine">in its thunderous roar. Thorvald raised to his lips the</seg><seg type="columnLine">great brazen horn of chieftainship, and gazed down</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mist-filled gorge, waiting. And now, through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">luminous spray, I saw that two mighty peaks jutted out</seg><seg type="columnLine">from either wall, between them a boat's length of space</seg><seg type="columnLine">through which the raging waters surged and battled,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising high, then leaping out, out and down into nothing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness. Through the curtain of water, the twin crags</seg><seg type="columnLine">loomed bare and smooth from the torrent's edge, the left</seg><seg type="columnLine">jet black, the right--it seemed--a flaming gold. Then</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great horn blared forth its message, the oars struck</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep, and for an instant we hung checked in our mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">course, held by the straining oars, then swept on with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the flood. Again and again they plunged, each mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">blow bringing us up as against a yielding wall, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">time hurtling on as before. And now we thrust with all</seg><seg type="columnLine">our weight at the great helm, driving it slowly against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the leaping stream. Now with each giant beat of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oars, I could see the rushing wall to the right creep</seg><seg type="columnLine">closer and ever closer. The oars beat faster now, in</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect rhythm, and the struggling helm battered fiercely</seg><seg type="columnLine">at our strength. Now I could hear above the tumult of</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters a chant of human voices, raised in a song of</seg><seg type="columnLine">battle, and I joined my voice to theirs in the stirring</seg><seg type="columnLine">anthem of Yzdral.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before us the bounding waves climbed up and up, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred feet or more above our heads, battering at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crevice that overhung the great abyss. Great waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">broke over us, not salt, but sickly sweet and filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">a fungoid savor, beating at us in great masses of leap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing white fire that swooped down from the tossing</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds. And still the oars struck firm and sure, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the helm crept slowly to the right. Fiery darts of pain</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot through my straining muscles, and I saw Thor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vald's teeth gripped in his lower lip, blood streaming into</seg><seg type="columnLine">his matted beard. And now the cauldron fell away be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath, and the dragon ship hung high above the abyss</seg><seg type="columnLine">into which the waters thundered, down and out and</seg><seg type="columnLine">down again into the endless depths where pale-lit mists</seg><seg type="columnLine">swirled slowly with dreamy lethargy. For an instant</seg><seg type="columnLine">we poised there, an eternal instant of reminiscence and</seg><seg type="columnLine">despair in which all the forgotten faces of childhood</seg><seg type="columnLine">spun before me in a slow, dead whirl. Then like a gyr-</seg><seg type="columnLine">falcon we swooped through empty air, down and down</seg><seg type="columnLine">into sudden silence, the howling waters but a lost mur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mur in the distance, lulling, lulling our tired muscles into</seg><seg type="columnLine">sleep. No longer did we plunge madly through the blaz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing waves, but rocked in a gentle swell, a soft blue light</seg><seg type="columnLine">seeping through the perfumed air about us--surely the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Paradise of death. Thorvald beside me, I drifted off</seg><seg type="columnLine">into velvet darkness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I WOKE to the gentle grip of Thorvald's hand. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">oarsmen were gone, and he stood silhouetted against</seg><seg type="columnLine">a soft blue luminescence that played in little dancing</seg><seg type="columnLine">wavelets from the ceiling of the great cave in which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we floated. Now I realized the truth of what had hap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pened. The mountain on the right was hollow, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the very center of the narrow gap, through which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters leaped, opened the arched gateway into which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  *The old vikings of Scandinavia called their warships dragons. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">often had a dragon's head on the bow.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CLEON OF YZDRAL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">331</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">we had passed with that final thrust of oars, down into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the calm, slowly eddying lagoon beneath the mountain.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ordinarily, when the river merely drained the stagnant</seg><seg type="columnLine">swamp, it must be difficult enough to enter, but now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a sea pouring through that cranny between the</seg><seg type="columnLine">peaks, it was by little short of superhuman skill and</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength that these men of Thule had won us through.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We lay beside a smooth black pier, jutting from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wall of the cave. The cave itself was low-roofed and</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad, stretching out into the blue haze on either side.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here a great niche had been cut into the wall, fronted</seg><seg type="columnLine">with pillars that glowed with little inlaid twinings of soft</seg><seg type="columnLine">gold. From it opened many corridors, running off into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mountain, and a broad stair, rising into the peak</seg><seg type="columnLine">above us. It was lit by the blue light, and rose easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">in lazy spirals through the black rock of the peak. All</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the walls ran the delicate golden inlay, much like</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fretting of the ventilators of our upper world, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">more gentle and beautiful, patterned after the twining</seg><seg type="columnLine">vines and tendrils of some unknown vegetation. Up</seg><seg type="columnLine">this we strode, bearing Hektor between us, Thorvald</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemingly familiar with the way. Glancing down at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">steps, I could see that they were worn, and the edges</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded by much use during long ages. What people</seg><seg type="columnLine">had carved this stronghold in the heart of the mountain?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Who were the Singing Ones?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The peak was conical, and as we rose the stair drew</seg><seg type="columnLine">near the outer wall and the roar of the fall sounded far</seg><seg type="columnLine">below. At last came a landing and a niche in the wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little alcove from which we might see the river far</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath us. Up from the leaping flood rose the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">cliff, sloping inward in mirror image of that which</seg><seg type="columnLine">loomed opposite. And above and about us, rising in ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">raced levels, clung the Golden City of the Singing Ones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In level after level of blunt-topped golden towers the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city rose above us, circling the cone of the peak. Smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the crag the outer wall would rise, to a series of</seg><seg type="columnLine">little steps, in reality broad terraces, dwarfed by dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance, then up again in a slender golden block to a blunt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">terraced summit. Balconied windows opened from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">smooth, golden wall, looking out over the river and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">abyss into which it plunged, feathering into luminous</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist that drifted up through the thin air to the low-hang-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing clouds that clung about the summit of the peak. On</seg><seg type="columnLine">the terraces, and in the broad ways between the ranks</seg><seg type="columnLine">of buildings grew trees and flowers, climbing in per-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fumed profusion over the golden fretting of the inner</seg><seg type="columnLine">walls. And like a halo over the city clung the blue light,</seg><seg type="columnLine">illuminating everything with its soft azure. What man-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ner of men could these Singing Ones be, to raise such</seg><seg type="columnLine">a city on the crag, and make trees and flowers bloom in</seg><seg type="columnLine">this unhealthy Underworld?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now, as we climbed higher, I heard a music flooding</seg><seg type="columnLine">from above, a music as of organ notes, deep and brood-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing, spangled with merry piping and silvery tinkling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">little bells. Then the stair turned suddenly and stopped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I followed Thorvald out upon a high dais of gold,</seg><seg type="columnLine">bearing Hektor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before me, the golden amphitheater was filled with</seg><seg type="columnLine">light, light such as I had never seen. It lay on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">border line between light and mist, both and yet neither.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was of a rose-hue, a faintly flushed pink, with little</seg><seg type="columnLine">veinings of scintillant silver. In a great motionless flood</seg><seg type="columnLine">it lay in the bowl of the amphitheater, pulsing dreamily.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Through it ran tiny filaments of clotted coral flame,</seg><seg type="columnLine">glittering mischievously through the soft glow, darting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">and twisting through the surge of rose-light. The glow</seg><seg type="columnLine">of it lit up all the golden temple with rosy glory, brighter</seg><seg type="columnLine">and softer than the green light of the upper world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">For an instant I thought of the snowy bowl of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vapor things, but this was different. Here was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">clinging, creeping vapor, dank, black fog, that clogged</seg><seg type="columnLine">the senses with loathing and bound the muscles with in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visible resistance. This light was free, clean, beautiful,</seg><seg type="columnLine">vibrant with pure life, whetting the senses and cleansing</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mind of the ugly darknesses that lurk in its hidden</seg><seg type="columnLine">corners. And now, as the deep organ note throbbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind me, and the bowl of light rippled in thrilling</seg><seg type="columnLine">answer, trilling piping and little elfish bugle notes, fairy</seg><seg type="columnLine">fiddling and little silvery carillon, I knew that the Sing-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing Ones lay before me, and I thought of the words of</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to whom I had gone, a child, for vengeance upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the black Things of the Underworld.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Cleon, if your judgment falters in the future which</seg><seg type="columnLine">must come, heed my advice. Place your trust in that</seg><seg type="columnLine">which you see as wholly beautiful."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And in the Singing Ones I found beauty, though I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to hate and fear all creatures of the mist by reason</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Black Things. In these there was a purity, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">clean virulent airiness that reassured me, though of</seg><seg type="columnLine">necessity they must be fundamentally of the stuff of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the mist folk, living, moving as they, perhaps sprung</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the same hidden root. I stepped to the brink of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the dais, and laid Hektor in the glowing flood of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">that lapped at its brink. Slowly he sank into the rosy</seg><seg type="columnLine">depths where the little threads of silver were clustering</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a scintillant net that dropped softly about him, hiding</seg><seg type="columnLine">him from my sight. Thorvald's hand was on my arm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">his voice in my ear, and in obedience I also let myself</seg><seg type="columnLine">drop into the pool of light and drift down through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silent depths. Weariness and the fatigue of strained</seg><seg type="columnLine">muscles faded away, leaving peace and dreamy languor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I was purged of the horror I had seen and felt, made</seg><seg type="columnLine">new and clean by the fingers of light that were gently</seg><seg type="columnLine">wafted through my brain. And with Thorvald at my</seg><seg type="columnLine">side, I drifted dreamily to where the little filaments</seg><seg type="columnLine">of coral flame were grouping, dancing, beckoning</seg><seg type="columnLine">eagerly. They surged up about me, folded over my</seg><seg type="columnLine">head in a living net of flame, and through my body ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">a leaping fire of vibrant energy, renovating me, charging</seg><seg type="columnLine">me with life and joy and health, such as I had not felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">for many years. Here was the alliance that made gods</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the warriors of Thule!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Out on the golden dais we were laid, Thorvald and I,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while from the bowl of light came a sad murmur of</seg><seg type="columnLine">ethereal music, regretful, apologetic. Up from the pool</seg><seg type="columnLine">swam the globe of silver threadings, up to our very feet.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It opened, like a great bud unfolding, and there as in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">cradle nestled Hektor, sleeping. He stirred, and woke,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but in his eyes was not that which I sought. Conscious-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ness wras his, now, and the will to live, but not in our</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrorld. He moved and saw and felt in some higher</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane, in the plane of the Black Things.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Thorvald spoke. "Do not despair, O Cleon. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">far gone. I feared it would be thus--I have seen men so</seg><seg type="columnLine">before, after the flame-kiss of the Black Ones. He lives,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we, but in their world. There is yet a hope, Cleon.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I have seen it--once--applied only in direst extreme. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">it should succeed, he would be ever such asÂ» you see him</seg><seg type="columnLine">now, but of these Singing Ones, and free of the Black</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ones forever. I think--they will try it. They are very</seg><seg type="columnLine">kind. And you must give of your strength willingly,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">332</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hektor rose to his feet, stalked past us as in a dream.</seg><seg type="columnLine">After him poured the flood of rose light, enveloping us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">carrying us up with it. I saw now the source of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">organ notes, those to which the Singing Ones responded.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like a mighty sapphire, faceted and jeweled, yet of yield-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing blue glory, midway between light and flame, it floated</seg><seg type="columnLine">--father, ruler, god of these Singing Ones. About it</seg><seg type="columnLine">clustered the rose light, baring us in its midst, forming</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great halo about the blue jewel of flame. I touched it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">felt it full of a warmth and a great life, with infinite</seg><seg type="columnLine">understanding, and into my mind came the thought of</seg><seg type="columnLine">that which Hektor had destroyed in the Crimson City--</seg><seg type="columnLine">perhaps its counterpart in the life of the black Vapor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Creatures, and I had more of sympathy for that race</seg><seg type="columnLine">which had lost its god.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far below, on the dais, Hektor stood like a statue of</seg><seg type="columnLine">marble, face upturned to the light. Now from the sap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phire globe burst a fountain of silver flame, falling in</seg><seg type="columnLine">mist about him, then thickening to a rain of flashing silver</seg><seg type="columnLine">that flooded over him from head to foot. And there came</seg><seg type="columnLine">a yearning in me, a longing to unite my strength and</seg><seg type="columnLine">life with the life of the Singing Ones, pouring them out</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the silver flame that meant life and safety to him be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low. Thicker and thicker poured the rain of silver,</seg><seg type="columnLine">cascading over him in great waves and sinking into him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he began to rise from the golden floor, and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">silver flood ceased as he drew near, and I saw in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">dreaming eyes the presence of the Singing Ones. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rose mist he swept from the temple, and I stood with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thorvald above the empty bowl, watching the life ebb</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the golden hall. Then all were gone, and we went</seg><seg type="columnLine">wearily down the corridor to the hall where the oarsmen</seg><seg type="columnLine">waited.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING the days that followed, there was little to</seg><seg type="columnLine">do but roam the golden city or gaze over the side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mountain at the flood that still roared beneath.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thorvald said that a deep, narrow channel had been cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">through the mountains and out into the sea, how we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could not imagine, and that through it the water of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea was pouring into the swamp and then into the abyss.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But the sea was large, and the channel narrow, and it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be long before the men of Thule might venture</seg><seg type="columnLine">homeward once more. There were many in that golden</seg><seg type="columnLine">city, like Hektor, living as men, yet part of that people</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rose light that were the Singing Ones. Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the streets and garden they wandered, a great peace and</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge in their quiet eyes, and I could not but envy</seg><seg type="columnLine">them at times.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I could not but wonder at these folk of light. Here,</seg><seg type="columnLine">even more than in the mist creatures, were my three</seg><seg type="columnLine">criteria of perfection in life satisfied. In the mist crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures, the transformation of energy was efficient far be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond all our hopes and dreams, but there was always</seg><seg type="columnLine">something artificial about it, something of unnatural</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain, while here the light had gathered, the silver rain</seg><seg type="columnLine">had descended all with perfect spontaneity that was be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">yond my ability to comprehend, smooth and effortless as</seg><seg type="columnLine">*--light. In the black mist there was unity beyond all</seg><seg type="columnLine">leagues of Man, but the limits of the individual were</seg><seg type="columnLine">still evident. One could see the difference at once.</seg><seg type="columnLine">In the Crimson City, the black mist flowed about in isola-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ted gouts of vapor, unified only in time of great stress.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Here, the golden walls and paving glowed through a</seg><seg type="columnLine">veiling haze of rose and silver, everywhere from lowest</seg><seg type="columnLine">to highest level, and ever continuous, one with all its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">parts, yet a people rather than a single creature. Lastly,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Purpose of the Things, whatever it might be, was</seg><seg type="columnLine">at odds with all the world except itself, alien to the races</seg><seg type="columnLine">that shared the Universe with it. But these people of</seg><seg type="columnLine">light were in perfect harmony with the chord that under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lies Nature, the basic chord of beauty and symmetry,</seg><seg type="columnLine">great or tiny, majestic or ethereal, that vibrates in</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmony with the fundamentals of Space and Time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Sometimes, I felt that they were not merely a single</seg><seg type="columnLine">race, but that in them all the other races met in com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mon sympathy and understanding, as one race, perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">--as Life itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And I thought of the varied races that I knew--of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man, and of the creatures of the outer world that I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seen, birds, and insects, and brilliant fishes, of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">flesh-hulks of the marshes that my father had shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me, of the horridly living jungle in the Underworld,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and last, of these two topmost races--the Vapor Crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tures and the Singing Ones. Where did all these fit into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Purpose that day by day . Man is dragging from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">secrets of the Universe? How did they fit into the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lying unity that must ultimately envelop all things, when</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man shall have the mind to comprehend it? I felt that</seg><seg type="columnLine">these Singing Ones were closer to it now than we. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not strive with machines and delicate experiments</seg><seg type="columnLine">to catalogue the Universe, to name and classify all that</seg><seg type="columnLine">came within their experience, for that is the way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Man. Slowly, painstakingly we climbed the steep path,</seg><seg type="columnLine">step by faltering step, slipping and stumbling, halting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to impress every pebble and grain of sand, every grass-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blade along the wTay in our memory, that when the sum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mit is at last reached, Man may stand and look back into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the memory of his race, and see all the infinite mosaic of</seg><seg type="columnLine">law and chance that is the Pattern of the Universe, uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fied before him. So Man moves to his ultimate height,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and so no other race moves while Man lives.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But these folk of light, and they of the black vapor,</seg><seg type="columnLine">had no machines that Man could name so, no massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">tomes of data such as Man could understand. Their ways</seg><seg type="columnLine">were different, from ours and from each other, as are</seg><seg type="columnLine">all ways, in my belief. Both, it seemed, absorbed the Uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">verse into themselves, but not in the same way. For</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Black Things sucked out the life of what they met,</seg><seg type="columnLine">destroyed it utterly and horribly, while the Singing Ones</seg><seg type="columnLine">gave life where it was needed, out of themselves, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">profited and progressed by it, how I cannot tell, except</seg><seg type="columnLine">that their way was the way of beauty. I am old, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the old comes something of insight and philosophizing,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but I am a man, and Man's way must needs be mine--</seg><seg type="columnLine">the painful, halting climb that knows few leaps of all-</seg><seg type="columnLine">enveloping insight. I cannot be otherwise, though with</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hektor--I cannot tell.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For long, while the torrent waned beneath the crag</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Golden City, I had been awaiting the vengeance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Black Ones. Come it must, and I felt that this</seg><seg type="columnLine">would mark a crisis in their cause, for all their race must</seg><seg type="columnLine">needs be flung into the battle. Strange, how a little</seg><seg type="columnLine">thing can break the sway of a mighty race, as once tiny</seg><seg type="columnLine">hairy mammals, new evolved and untried by time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">found welcome food in the buried eggs of those great</seg><seg type="columnLine">reptiles that once ruled the planet, and brought that giant</seg><seg type="columnLine">race crashing to the ground in defeat. Hektor was such,</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had feared the coming of the Things, yet when that</seg><seg type="columnLine">ominous cloud of black billowed sluggishly down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">narrow gorge, I was strangely calm and unconcerned.</seg><seg type="columnLine">CLEON OF YZDRAL</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">333</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I felt then that they could not win, that it was written</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the equation of their life.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the topmost turret of the golden city we</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched, Thorvald and I, the oarsmen crowding around</seg><seg type="columnLine">us with flashing eyes to see the battle. Far below,</seg><seg type="columnLine">lining the terraces in silent expectation, were those who,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like Hektor, had come under the silver rain. Above us,</seg><seg type="columnLine">all about us, enveloping all the city in a glorious haze</seg><seg type="columnLine">of rose light, the Singing Ones floated, their voice a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrilling clamor of bugles presaging victory. And up</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the heart of the city, blending with their bugling,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose the organ-sorig of the sapphire globe, triumphant</seg><seg type="columnLine">and exultant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the Black Ones had encircled the crag with their</seg><seg type="columnLine">dense, black clouds, and were rising toward the city.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And below, at the lowest ramparts, the halo of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">spread and thickened, its rose-flush deepening with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">little darting tongues of thrilling flame. In the uneasy</seg><seg type="columnLine">ranks of black the spheres of opalescence were forming,</seg><seg type="columnLine">small, then swelling into sudden fiery brilliance, huger by</seg><seg type="columnLine">far than what I had ever seen. They were spinning now,</seg><seg type="columnLine">faster and ever faster, the wind whining furiously from</seg><seg type="columnLine">their contact. And still the rose deepened, and I could</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the flickering web of silver that laced its heart.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Now the spheres were still, tensing for the attack.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Even beneath the protecting halo of light we felt the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strain, tugging at Space itself, gaining strength from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">deformation of the Universe to loose its fusing thunder-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bolts of flame. As before, it mounted until the mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed drawn to breaking. And then the tension snap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped, and from .the myriad opal spheres leapt the tongues-</seg><seg type="columnLine">of searing flame, hurtling straight at the guardian halo,</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashing against that wall of soft rose light--and van-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ishing! Faster, thicker they came, with a sort of frantic</seg><seg type="columnLine">fury! Now the black mist was gone entirely, drawn into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the opal spheres, and the place below had become a</seg><seg type="columnLine">maelstrom of battling flame! Leaping, meshing, twin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in a tangled maze of fire, the fury of the spheres bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tered at'the city, faster, ever faster and more furiously,</seg><seg type="columnLine">until the eye could not follow their dancing in the sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">of flame! Yet the barrier halo of light still clung un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">harmed about the city, drinking in the mad fire that ham-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mered in mighty bolts and streamers at its surface, dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solving them utterly, with no sign of stress or battle</seg><seg type="columnLine">save the slow deepening of the rose as the flames poured</seg><seg type="columnLine">into it. I cannot say how long the fray went on. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose had swelled to a burning scarlet, shot with great</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulsing arteries of silver, when high above us throbbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the organ note of the sapphire globe, imperative, com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manding. And in reply, the rose mist whispered, low</seg><seg type="columnLine">and sweet and far off, laughing and triumphant, with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">little tingling trill running through the soft soughing.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The globe burned with a dazzling blue, now, and from it</seg><seg type="columnLine">cascaded the torrents of silver light, flooding down over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sea of fire beneath! And where it struck the spheres,</seg><seg type="columnLine">they dissolved, and were gone in a thin green mist that</seg><seg type="columnLine">drifted slowly out over the gorge and they were swal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lowed up by the leaping spray. The Black Ones were</seg><seg type="columnLine">forever dead!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THERE is little more to tell of the Singing Ones.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Once more, just before our oars bore us again up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the shallow stream, now free of the pouring waters of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pale sea, we bathed in the rose light, which was</seg><seg type="columnLine">filling us with the fiery energy that had come from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Black Ones. Slowly up the stream we went, and over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the still flooded swamps where drowned and rotting</seg><seg type="columnLine">tree-things were rising from the settling water, to a deep</seg><seg type="columnLine">inlet that ran far into the mountains and a great cavern</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaped through to the pale sea. Over the level cavern</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor we bore the dragon ship, pushed on rollers by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">oarsmen, and down the sloping, wave-worn bed of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sea to the restless waters. Skirting the rocky shore, we</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed the channel that had been burned into the black</seg><seg type="columnLine">rock beneath the shattered crystal valve under Luda,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the luminous white water still lipping into its smooth</seg><seg type="columnLine">groove. Then we struck straight out into the pale sea</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose lowering roof came slowly down as though to</seg><seg type="columnLine">crush us, until we rowed blindly through the clinging</seg><seg type="columnLine">mists that blanketed the waters with weird fire. Now</seg><seg type="columnLine">and again some monster of long-gone time broke the sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">face, throwing up a luminous spray toward the flasHng</seg><seg type="columnLine">clouds. By what reckoning, what instinct, we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">guided I cannot tell, but after many weary hours the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocky walls of the cavern closed in 011 either hand to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">high-walled narrow fjord running back mile on mile into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the heart of the cliff, then opening into the vaulted</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern of the men of Thule.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About the shores of a quiet lagoon clustered the low,</seg><seg type="columnLine">thatched homes of stone where lived the race of Thor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vald. Before each hall, drawn high on the pebbled</seg><seg type="columnLine">beach, lay a dragon ship, marked with the shield of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">clan which dwelt in the granite hall beyond. Up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cluster of houses ran waving upland meadows of</seg><seg type="columnLine">wheat and rye, while green forests showed beyond.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gnarled and leafy, they ran up the flanks of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">fi re-mountain which gave light to this new Thule, its</seg><seg type="columnLine">time-worn precipices aflame with a white-hot river</seg><seg type="columnLine">of molten rock, flowing in great cascades to finally pour</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the bowels of the planet through a great oval pit</seg><seg type="columnLine">above the little city. Here among the kinsmen of Thor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vald, in his high-raftered hall of granite, I lived and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunted with them the strange beasts of the land beyond</seg><seg type="columnLine">the fiery mountain, beasts such as the old books tell of,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountains of flesh with long, recurving tusks and great</seg><seg type="columnLine">flailing trunks, smaller beasts with horns upon their</seg><seg type="columnLine">snouts, and little red eyes, great dun cats with sword-</seg><seg type="columnLine">like teeth--things that had been in Thule in the days of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the First Planet, when men first fought there.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But at last I grew weary, and longed to see again the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lands of the surface, Yzdral, and Kor, and Thula. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thorvald for guide, and ten brawny men of Thule to</seg><seg type="columnLine">aid us, we went up and through shadowy caverns of</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystal where no life was save ourselves. More than a</seg><seg type="columnLine">year we climbed, fed by the stores hid long ago by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">forefathers' race, food preserved in the cunning way of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thule. The way was steep and smooth, smoothed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the hand of Man in ages past, and here and there stone</seg><seg type="columnLine">bridges spanned a chasm, or bronze ladders scaled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">vertical precipice of a mighty fault, or strong gates</seg><seg type="columnLine">barred the way. I recognized here the hand of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prince of Quetzal who reared the inner cities for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">banished people of Atlantis and gave aid to them of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Thule, who were his friends.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And then the inner caverns!

The roGket</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a satellite of the huge, revolving world around</seg><seg type="columnLine">which it held to its orbit. In the year 1958, Professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Jameson had sought a plan whereby he might preserve</seg><seg type="columnLine">his body indefinitely after his death. He had worked</seg><seg type="columnLine">long and hard upon the subject.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Since the time of the Pharaohs, the human race had</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked for a means by which the dead might be preserved</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the ravages of time. Great had been the art of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Egyptians in the embalming of their deceased, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">practice which was later lost to humanity of the ensuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">mechanical age, never to be rediscovered. But even</seg><seg type="columnLine">the embalming of the Egyptians, so Professor Jameson</seg><seg type="columnLine">had argued, would be futile in the face of millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">years, the dissolution of the corpses being just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">eventual as immediate cremation following death.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor had looked for a means by which the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body could be preserved perfectly forever.

Just as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">long as he sought an earthly means of preservation, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">was doomed to disappointment.

It was clear to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor that he could never accomplish his purpose if</seg><seg type="columnLine">he were to employ one system of atomic structure, such</seg><seg type="columnLine">as embalming fluid or other concoction, to preserve an-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other system of atomic structure, such as the human</seg><seg type="columnLine">body, when all atomic structure is subject to universal</seg><seg type="columnLine">change, no matter how slow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had then soliloquized upon the possibility of pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">serving the human body in its state of death until the end</seg><seg type="columnLine">of all earthly time--to that day when the earth would re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">turn to the sun from which it had sprung. Quite sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly one day he had conceived the answer to the puz-</seg><seg type="columnLine">zling problem which obsessed his mind, leaving him awed</seg><seg type="columnLine">with its wild, uncanny potentialities.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He would have his body shot into space enclosed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket to become a satellite of the earth as long as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth continued to exist. He reasoned logically. Any</seg><seg type="columnLine">material substance, whether of organic or inorganic</seg><seg type="columnLine">origin, cast into the depths of space would exist indefi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nitely. He had visualized his dead body enclosed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket flying off into the illimitable maw of space. He</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">334</seg><seg type="columnLine">335</seg><seg type="columnLine">336</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">would remain in perfect preservation, while on earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions of generations of mankind would live and die,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their bodies to molder into the dust of the forgotten</seg><seg type="columnLine">past. He would exist in this unchanged manner until</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">                                                                    svxtv,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">fade out forever in the chill, thin atmosphere of a dy-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing world.

What a magnificent idea!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   At first he had been assailed with doubts. Suppose his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">funeral rocket landed upon another planet or, drawn by</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the pull of the great sun, were thrown into the flaming</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">folds of the incandescent sphere? The rocket might con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tinue on out of the solar system, plunging through the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">endless seas of space for millions of years, to finally</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">enter the solar system of some far off star, as meteors</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">often enter ours. Suppose his rocket crashed upon a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">planet, or the star itself, or became a captive satellite</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of some celestial body?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It had been at this juncture that the idea of his rocket</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">becoming the satellite of the earth had presented it-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">self, and he had immediately incorporated it into his</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">scheme. The professor had figured out the amount of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">radium necessary to carry the rocket far enough away</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from the earth so that it would not turn around and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">crash, and still be not so far away but what the earth's</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">gravitational attraction would keep it from leaving the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vicinity of the earth and the solar system. Like the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">moon, it would forever revolve around the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   He had chosen an orbit sixty-five thousand miles from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the earth for his rocket to follow. The only fears he had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">entertained concerned the huge meteors which careened</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">through space at tremendous rates of speed. He had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">overcome this obstacle, however, and had eliminated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the possibilities of a collision with these stellar jugger-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nauts. In the rocket were installed radium repulsion</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rays which swerved all approaching meteors from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">path of the rocket as they entered the vicinity of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">space wanderer.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The aged professor had prepared for every con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tingency, and had set down to rest from his labors, rev-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">elling in the stupendous, unparalleled results he would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">obtain. Never would his body undergo decay; never</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would his bones bleach to return to the dust of the earth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">from which all men originally came and to which they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">must return.

The Zoromes, several hun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dred thousand years before, had reached a stage in</seg><seg type="columnLine">science, where they searched for immortality and eternal</seg><seg type="columnLine">relief from bodily ills and various deficiencies of flesh and</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood anatomy. They had sought freedom from death,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and had found it, but at the same time they had destroyed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the propensities for birth. For several hundred thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">years there had been no births and few deaths in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">history of the Zoromes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This strange race of people had built these mechanical</seg><seg type="columnLine">bodies, and by operation upon one another had removed</seg><seg type="columnLine">their brains to the metal heads from which they directed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the functions and movements of their inorganic anato-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mies. There had been no deaths due to worn out bodies.</seg><seg type="columnLine">When one part of the mechanical men wore out, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">replaced by a new part, and so the Zoromes continued</seg><seg type="columnLine">living their immortal lives which saw few casualties.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was true that, since the innovation of the machines,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there had been a few accidents which had seen the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">struction of the metal heads with their brains. These</seg><seg type="columnLine">were irreparable. Such cases had been few, however,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the population of Zor had decreased but little. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine men of Zor had no use for atmosphere, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had it not been for the terrible coldness of space, could</seg><seg type="columnLine">have just as well existed in the ether void as upon some</seg><seg type="columnLine">planet. Their metal bodies, especially their metal encased</seg><seg type="columnLine">brains, required a certain amount of heat even though</seg><seg type="columnLine">they were able to exist comfortably in temperatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">which would instantly have frozen to death a flesh-and-</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood creature.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The most popular pastime among the machine men of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zor was the exploration of the Universe.

At the base of the strange craft there pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jected a lever, while in one side was a door which appar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ently opened outward.

The machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">men, expecting to see at least several, perhaps many,</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange creature moving about within the cylinder, stared</seg><seg type="columnLine">aghast at the sight they beheld. There was but one crea-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ture, and he was lying perfectly still, either in a state</seg><seg type="columnLine">of suspended animation or else of death. He was about</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice the height of the mechanical men of Zor.

The machine man released</seg><seg type="columnLine">these, and with the help of his comrade removed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of the creature from the cosmic coffin in which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had found it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is dead!" pronounced one of the machine men</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a careful examination of the corpse.

He was sick. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-	doctors had not expected him to live; they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">frankly told him so--but he had cared little in view of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the long, happy years stretched out behind him. Perhaps</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was not to die yet. He wondered how long he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">slept. How strange he felt--as if he had no body.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why couldn't he open his eyes? He tried very hard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A mist swam before him. His eyes had been open all</seg><seg type="columnLine">the time but he had not seen before. That was queer, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">ruminated. All was silent about his bedside. Had all the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doctors and nurses left him to sleep--or to die?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Devil take that mist which swam before him, obscur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing everything in line of vision. He would call his</seg><seg type="columnLine">nephew. Vainly he attempted to shout the word "Doug-</seg><seg type="columnLine">las," but to no avail. Where was his mouth? It seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">as if he had none. Was it all delirium? The strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">silence--perhaps he had lost his sense of hearing along</seg><seg type="columnLine">with his ability to speak--and he could see nothing dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinctly. The mist had transferred itself into a confused</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumble of indistinct objects, some of which moved about</seg><seg type="columnLine">before him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He was now conscious of some impulse in his mind</seg><seg type="columnLine">which kept questioning him as to how he felt. He was</seg><seg type="columnLine">conscious of other strange ideas which seemed to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">impressed upon his brain, but this one thought concern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing his indisposition clamored insistently over the lesser</seg><seg type="columnLine">ideas. It seemed just as if someone was addressing him,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and impulsively he attempted to utter a sound and tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">them how queer he felt. It seemed as if speech had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken from him. He could not talk, no matter how hard</seg><seg type="columnLine">he tried. It was no use. Strange to say, however, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulse within his mind appeared to be satisfied with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the effort, and now put another question to him. Where</seg><seg type="columnLine">was he from? What a strange question when he was at</seg><seg type="columnLine">home. He told them as much. Had he always lived</seg><seg type="columnLine">there? Why, of course.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The aged professor was now becoming more astute</seg><seg type="columnLine">to his conditions. At first it was only a mild, passive</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderment at his helplessness and the strange thoughts</seg><seg type="columnLine">which raced through his mind Now he attempted to</seg><seg type="columnLine">arouse himself from the lethargy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Quite suddenly his sight cleared, and what a surprise!</seg><seg type="columnLine">He could see all the way around him without moving</seg><seg type="columnLine">his head! And he could look at the ceiling of his room!</seg><seg type="columnLine">His room? Was it his room! No--it couldn't be.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Where was he ? What were those queer machines before</seg><seg type="columnLine">him? They moved on four legs. Six tentacles curled</seg><seg type="columnLine">outward from their cubical bodies. One of the machines</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">stood close before him. A tentacle shot out from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">object and rubbed his head. How strange it felt upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">his brow. Instinctively he obeyed the impulse to shove</seg><seg type="columnLine">the contraption of metal from him with his hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His arms did not rise, instead six tentacles projected</seg><seg type="columnLine">upward to force back the machine. Professor Jameson</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasped mentally in surprise as he gazed at the result of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his urge to push the strange, unearthly looking machine-</seg><seg type="columnLine">caricature from him. With trepidation he looked down at</seg><seg type="columnLine">his own body to see where the tentacles had come from,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his surprise turned to sheer fright and amazement.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His body was like the moving machine which stood be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore him! Where was he? What had ever happened to</seg><seg type="columnLine">him so suddenly? Only a few moments ago he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">in his bed with the doctors and his nephew bending over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him, expecting him to die. The last words he had re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">membered hearing was the cryptic announcement of one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the doctors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "He is going now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But he hadn't died after all, apparently. A horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought suddenly struck him! Was this the life after</seg><seg type="columnLine">death ? Or was it an illusion of the mind ? He became</seg><seg type="columnLine">aware that the machine in front of him was attempting</seg><seg type="columnLine">to communicate something to him. How could it, thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">the professor, when he had no mouth. The machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">walked nearer on its four legs. Was it alive ? Its desire</seg><seg type="columnLine">to communicate an idea to him became more insistent.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The suggestion of the machine's question was in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">mind. Telepathy, thought he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The creature was asking him about the place whence</seg><seg type="columnLine">he had come. He didn't know; his mind was in such a</seg><seg type="columnLine">turmoil of thoughts and conflicting ideas. He allowed</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself to be led to a window where the machine with</seg><seg type="columnLine">waving tentacle pointed towards an object outside. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a queer sensation to be walking on the four metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">legs. He looked from the window and saw that which</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused him to nearly drop over, so astounded was he.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor found himself gazing from the bound-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less depths of space across the cosmic void to where a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge planet lay quiet. Now he was sure it was an illusion</seg><seg type="columnLine">which made his mind and sight behave so queerly. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was troubled by a strange dream. Carefully he examined</seg><seg type="columnLine">the topography of the gigantic globe which rested off in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distance. At the same time he could see back of him</seg><seg type="columnLine">the concourse of mechanical creatures crowding up be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind him and was aware of a telepathic conversation</seg><seg type="columnLine">which wras being carried on behind him--or before him.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Which was it? Eyes extended all the way around his</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, while there existed no difference on any of the four</seg><seg type="columnLine">sides of his cubed body. His mechanical legs were</seg><seg type="columnLine">capable of moving in any of four given directions with</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfect ease, he discovered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The planet was not the earth--of that he was sure.</seg><seg type="columnLine">None of the familiar continents lay before his eyes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And then he saw the great red ball of the dying sun.</seg><seg type="columnLine">That was not the sun of his earth. It had been a great</seg><seg type="columnLine">deal more brilliant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Did you come from that planet?" came the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">impulse from the mechanism by his side.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No," he returned.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He then allowed the machine men--for he assumed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were machine men--and reasoned that some-</seg><seg type="columnLine">how or other they had by some marvelous transformation</seg><seg type="columnLine">made him over just as they were, to lead him through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the craft of which he now took notice for the first time.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was an interplanetary flyer, or space ship, he believed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">340</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 25X-987 now took him to the compartment where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">had removed him from the strange container they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">found wandering in the vicinity of the nearby world.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There they showed him the long cylinder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My rocket satellite!" exclaimed Professor Jameson</seg><seg type="columnLine">to himself, though in reality every one of the machine</seg><seg type="columnLine">men received his thoughts plainly.

Already he knew that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">geographical conditions of the various continents were</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed. He had seen as much from the space ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A short time later the earth was reached. The space</seg><seg type="columnLine">travelers from Zor, as well as Professor Jameson,</seg><seg type="columnLine">emerged from the cosmic flyer to walk upon the surface</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the planet. The earth had ceased rotating, leaving one-</seg><seg type="columnLine">half its surface turned always toward the sun. This side</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the earth was heated to a considerable degree, while</seg><seg type="columnLine">its antipodes, turned always away from the solar lumi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nary, was a cold, frigid, desolate waste. The space</seg><seg type="columnLine">travelers from Zor did not dare to advance very far into</seg><seg type="columnLine">either hemisphere, but landed on the narrow, thousand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mile strip of territory separating the earth's frozen half</seg><seg type="columnLine">from its sun-baked antipodes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Professor Jameson emerged from the space ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">with 25X-987, he stared in awe at the great transforma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion four hundred thousand centuries had wrought.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The earth's surface, its sky and the sun were all so</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed and unearthly appearing. Off to.the east the</seg><seg type="columnLine">blood red ball of the slowly cooling sun rested upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">horizon, lighting up the eternal day. The earth's rota-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion had ceased entirely, and it hung motionless in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sky as it revolved around its solar parent, its orbit</seg><seg type="columnLine">slowly but surely cutting in towards the great body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sun. The two inner planets, Mercury and Venus,</seg><seg type="columnLine">wrere now very close to the blood red orb whose scintil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lating, dazzling brilliance had been lost in its cooling</seg><seg type="columnLine">process. Soon, the two nearer planets would succumb to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great pull of the solar luminary and return to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">flaming folds, from which they had been hurled out as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gaseous bodies in the dim, age-old past, when their ca-</seg><seg type="columnLine">reers had just begun.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The atmosphere was nearly gone, so rarefied had it</seg><seg type="columnLine">become, and through it Professor Jameson could view</seg><seg type="columnLine">with amazing clarity without discomfort to his eyes the</seg><seg type="columnLine">bloated body of the dying sun. It appeared many times</seg><seg type="columnLine">the size he had seen it at the time of his death on ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">count of its relative nearness. The earth had advanced</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great deal closer to the great star around which it</seg><seg type="columnLine">swung.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sky towards the west was pitch black except for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the irridescent twinkle of the fiery stars which studded</seg><seg type="columnLine">that section of the heavens. As he watched, a faint</seg><seg type="columnLine">glow suffused the western sky, gradually growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">brighter, until, like a great gem inlaid in the velvety</seg><seg type="columnLine">blackness, the full moon majestically lifted itself above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the horizon, casting its pale, ethereal radiance upon the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dying world beneath. It was increased to many times</seg><seg type="columnLine">the size Professor Jameson had ever seen it during his</seg><seg type="columnLine">natural lifetime. The earth's greater attraction was</seg><seg type="columnLine">drawing upon the moon just as the sun was pulling the</seg><seg type="columnLine">earth ever nearer itself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This cheerless landscape confronting the professor</seg><seg type="columnLine">represented the state of existence to which the earth had</seg><seg type="columnLine">come. It was a magnificent spread of loneliness which</seg><seg type="columnLine">bore no witness to the fact that it had seen the teeming</seg><seg type="columnLine">of life in better ages long ago. The weird, yet beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">scene, spread in a melancholy panorama before his eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">drove his thoughts into gloomy abstraction with its dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mal, depressing influence. Its funereal, oppressive as-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect smote him suddenly with the chill of a terrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">loneliness.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> 25X-987 aroused Professor Jameson from his lethar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gic reverie. "Let us walk around and see what we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">find. I can understand how you feel in regard to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">past. It is quite a shock--but it must happen to all</seg><seg type="columnLine">worlds sooner or later--even to Zor. When that time</seg><seg type="columnLine">comes, the Zoromes will find a new planet on which to</seg><seg type="columnLine">live. If you travel with us, you will become accustomed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the sight of seeing dead, lifeless worlds as well as</seg><seg type="columnLine">new and beautiful ones pulsating with life and energy.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Of course, this world being your own. holds a peculiar</seg><seg type="columnLine">sentimental value to you, but it is really one planet</seg><seg type="columnLine">among billions."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Professor Jameson was silent.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I wonder whether or not there are any ruins to be</seg><seg type="columnLine">found?" queried 2SX-987.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I don't believe so," replied the professor.

In the space</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, they moved around the earth to the other side, still</seg><seg type="columnLine">keeping to the belt of shadowland which completely en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">circled the globe like some gigantic ring. Where they</seg><seg type="columnLine">now landed arose a series of cones with hollow peaks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Volcanoes!" exclaimed the professor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Extinct ones," added the machine ;tnan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Leaving the space ship, the fifty or more machine men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">including Professor Jameson, were soon exploring the</seg><seg type="columnLine">curiously shaped peaks.

Through</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Stygian gloom he fell in what seemed to be an end-</seg><seg type="columnLine">less drop. He finally crashed upon something hard.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The thin crust of the volcano's mouth had broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">through, precipitating him into the deep, hollow in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">terior.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It must have been a long ways to fall--or so it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed. Why was he not knocked senseless or killed?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then he felt himself over carefully with three tentacles.</seg><seg type="columnLine">His metal legs were four broken, twisted masses of</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal, while the lower half of his cubic body was jammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">out of shape and split. He could not move, and half of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his six tentacles were paralyzed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> How would he ever get out of there? he wondered.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The machine men of Zor might never find him. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">would happen to him, then? He would remain in this</seg><seg type="columnLine">deathless, monotonous state forever in the black hole of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the volcano's interior unable to move. What a horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">thought! He could not starve to death; eating was un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">known among the Zoromes, the machines requiring no</seg><seg type="columnLine">food. He could not even commit suicide. The only</seg><seg type="columnLine">way for him to die would be to smash the strong metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, and in his present immovable condition, this was</seg><seg type="columnLine">impossible.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It suddenly occurred to him to radiate thoughts for</seg><seg type="columnLine">help. Would the Zoromes receive his messages? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">wondered how far the telepathic messages would carry.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He concentrated the powers of his mind upon the call</seg><seg type="columnLine">for help, and repeatedly stated his position and plight.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He then left his mind clear to receive the thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">answers of the Zoromes. He received none. Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">he tried. Still he received no welcoming answer. Pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fessor Jameson became dejected.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was hopeless. The telepathic messages had not</seg><seg type="columnLine">reached the machine men of Zor. They were too far</seg><seg type="columnLine">away, just as one person may be out of earshot of</seg><seg type="columnLine">another's voice. He was doomed to a terrible fate of</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence! It were better that his rocket had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">been found. He wished that the Zoromes had de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed him instead of bringing him back to life--back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to this!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His thoughts were suddenly broken in upon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We're coming!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't give up hope!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> If the professor's machine body had been equipped</seg><seg type="columnLine">with a heart, jt would have sung for joy at these wel-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come thought impressions. A short time later there ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared in the ragged break of the volcano's mouth,</seg><seg type="columnLine">where he had fallen through, the metal head of one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the machine men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We shall have you out of there soon," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The professor never knew how they managed it, for</seg><seg type="columnLine">he lost consciousness under some strange ray of light</seg><seg type="columnLine">they projected down upon him in his prison. When he</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to consciousness once more, it was to find himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">inside the space ship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If you had fallen and smashed your head, it would</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been all over with you," were the first thought im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pulses which greeted him. "As it is, however, we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">fix you up first rate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why didn't you answer the first time I called to</seg><seg type="columnLine">you?" asked the professor. ''Didn't you hear me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We heard you, and we answered, but you didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">hear us. You see, your brain is different than ours, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">though you can send thought waves as far as we can</seg><seg type="columnLine">you cannot receive them from such a great distance."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I'm wrecked," said the professor, gazing at his</seg><seg type="columnLine">twisted limbs, paralyzed tentacles and jammed body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We shall repair you," came the reply. "It is your</seg><seg type="columnLine">good fortune that your head was not crushed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you going to do with me?" queried the</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor. "Will you remove my brains to another</seg><seg type="columnLine">machine ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No, that isn't necessary. We shall merely remove</seg><seg type="columnLine">3'our head and place it upon another machine body."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Zoromes immediately set to work upon the task,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and soon had Professor Jameson's metal head removed</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the machine which he had wrecked in his fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">down the crater. All during the painless operation, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">professor kept up a series of thought exchanges in con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">versation with the Zoromes, and it seemed but a short</seg><seg type="columnLine">time before his head surmounted a new machine and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was ready for further exploration. In the course of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his operation, the space ship had been moved to a new</seg><seg type="columnLine">position, and now as they emerged 25X-987 kept com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pany with Professor Jameson.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must keep an eye on you," he said. "You will be</seg><seg type="columnLine">getting into more trouble before you get accustomed to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metal bodies."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But Professor Jameson was doing a great deal of</seg><seg type="columnLine">thinking. Doubtlessly, these strange machine men who</seg><seg type="columnLine">had picked up his rocket in the depths of space and</seg><seg type="columnLine">had brought him back to life, were expecting him to</seg><seg type="columnLine">travel with them and become adopted into the ranks of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Zoromes. Did he want to go with them? He</seg><seg type="columnLine">couldn't decide. Pie had forgotten that the machine men</seg><seg type="columnLine">could read his innermost thoughts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You wish to remain here alone upon the earth?" asked</seg><seg type="columnLine">25X-987. "It is your privilege if you really want it so."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I don't know," replied Professor Jameson truthfully.</seg><seg type="columnLine">He gazed at the dust around his feet. It had probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">been the composition of men, and had changed from</seg><seg type="columnLine">time to time into various other atomic structures of other</seg><seg type="columnLine">queer forms of life which had succeeded mankind. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the lav/ of the atom which never died. And now he</seg><seg type="columnLine">had within his power perpetual existence. He could be</seg><seg type="columnLine">immortal if he wished! It would be an immortality of</seg><seg type="columnLine">never-ending adventures in the vast, endless Universe</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the galaxy of stars and planets.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A great loneliness seized him. Would he be happy</seg><seg type="columnLine">among these machine men of another far-off world--</seg><seg type="columnLine">among the Zoromes? They were kindly and solicitous</seg><seg type="columnLine">of his welfare. What better fate could he expect? Still,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a longing for his own kind arose in him--the call of hu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manity. It was irresistible. What could he do? Was</seg><seg type="columnLine">it not in vain? Humanity had long since disappeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the earth--millions of years ago. He wondered</seg><seg type="columnLine">what lay beyond the pales of death--real death, where</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body decomposed and wasted away to return to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dust of the earth and assume new atomic structures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He had begun to wonder whether or not he had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">dead all these forty millions of years--suppose he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE JAMESON SATELLITE</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">343</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">been merely in a state of suspended animation. He had</seg><seg type="columnLine">remembered a scientist of his day, who had claimed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the body does not die at the point of official death. Ac-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cording to the claims of this man, the cells of the body</seg><seg type="columnLine">did not die at the moment at which respiration, heart</seg><seg type="columnLine">beats and blood circulation ceased, but existed in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">semblance of life for several days afterward, especially</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cells of the bones, which died last of all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Perhaps when he had been sent out into space in his</seg><seg type="columnLine">rocket right after his death, the action of the cosmic</seg><seg type="columnLine">void was to halt this slow death of the cells in his body,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hold him in suspended animation during the ensuing</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions of years. Suppose he should really die--de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroying his own brain? What lay beyond real death?</seg><seg type="columnLine">Would it be a better plane of existence than the Zo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">romes could offer him? Would he rediscover humanity,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or had they long since arisen to higher planes of exist-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ence or reincarnations ? Did time exist beyond the</seg><seg type="columnLine">mysterious portals of death? If not, then it was possible</seg><seg type="columnLine">for him to join the souls of the human race. Had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">really been dead all this time ? If so, he knew what to ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pect in case he really destroyed his own brain. Oblivion!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again the intense feeling of loneliness surged over</seg><seg type="columnLine">him and held him within its melancholy grasp. Des-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perately, he decided to find the nearest cliff and jump</seg><seg type="columnLine">from it--head first! Humanity called; no man lived to</seg><seg type="columnLine">companion him. His four metal limbs carried him</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly to the summit of a nearby precipice. Why not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">gamble on the hereafter? 25X-987, understanding his</seg><seg type="columnLine">trend of thought, did not attempt to restrain him. In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stead, the machine man of Zor waited patiently.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As Professor Jameson stood there meditating upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the jump which would hurl him into a new plane of</seg><seg type="columnLine">existence--or into oblivion, the thought transference of</seg><seg type="columnLine">2SX-987 reached him. It was laden with the wisdom</seg><seg type="columnLine">born of many planets and thousands of centuries' ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">perience.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why jump?" asked the machine man. "The dying</seg><seg type="columnLine">world holds your imagination within a morbid clutch.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It is all a matter of mental condition.

I did notice something else, however, which</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> caused me to utter an involuntary exclamation of sur-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> prise. The walls of the pit beneath us were of gleaming,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> silvery looking metal, and winding up around them was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a railed metal stairway. On this stairway there was a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> movement--a constant flow of shiny metal globes rolling</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> upward.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Rapidly shifting the focus for a nearer view I looked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> for the top of the metal wall. I found it in a moment, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the powerful glasses brought every detail so close that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> it seemed as if I could almost reach out and touch</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the gleaming railing of the spiral stairway. Never, so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> long as I live, will I forget the strange, almost unbe-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> lievable sight that greeted my eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Standing along the railing near the end of the stairway,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> were four grotesque creatures, somewhat man-like in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> form. Their bodies were glistening metal globes, like</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> osage oranges, from which, in lieu of arms and legs,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> there projected four tentacles, apparently constructed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> of many little globes strung together like beads. Perched</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> on similar but shorter tentacles above the body spheres</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> were smaller globes, evidently the heads of the creatures.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They had enormous goggling eyes, literally like head-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> lights, both in shape, and from the fact that they cast</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> their own rays before them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The first three of these strange beings carried long</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> pipes slightly curved at the upper ends. The lower ends</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> were attached to flexible tubes greatly resembling con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> duit, which trailed down the stairway. The fourth held</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> a straight cylinder about three inches in diameter and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> four feet in length.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The first three individuals were exceedingly busy. In</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> fact they seemed to be the sole structural workers on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the stupendous metal shaft that was swiftly rising from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the bowels of the earth. The metal globes which were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> rolling up the stairway were of three sizes, and appeared</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> to be living creatures, for when they reached the ends</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> / of their respective lines, all sprouted the queer tentacle-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> like arms and legs of the four larger creatures, and pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> jected globular heads from their round interiors. Then</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> those of the largest size sprang up, one by one, to the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> top of the unfinished wall, where they retracted their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> heads and limbs and rolled closely together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> AS soon as each new globe was in position, the fore-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> most of the three large workers cemented it in place</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> with a stream of gleaming liquid resembling quicksilver,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> that poured from the tube he carried, and filled in the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> interstices until a glistening, pebble-grained wall resulted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The rolling globes of the middle size leaped from the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> end of their line to make the stairway in the same man-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ner, cemented in place by the second tube-bearer, while</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> those of the smallest size formed the railing and its sup-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> porting bars, and were fused into place by the third large</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> worker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was dumbfounded. The idea of a race of metal beings</seg><seg type="columnLine">building a structure with their own bodies, cheerfully</seg><seg type="columnLine">and willingly, was almost unthinkable for me. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">something quite beyond my point of view. But then, a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coral polyp's viewpoint as it fuses its body in with mil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">lions of others to form an atoll of a reef is also iar</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the understanding of individualistic men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Haven't seen a banshee, have you, chief ?" asked Pat.</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had noticed my startled expression.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take a look for yourself," I responded. "I want to</seg><seg type="columnLine">know if you can see what I see."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Focusing his own binoculars he looked, then exclaimed:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Holy smokes!

It's the Little People, sure as my name's</seg><seg type="columnLine">Pat Higgins!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was looking at the fourth of the larger individuals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the one that carried the tube, wondering what his func-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion was. Suddenly, as if attracted by the intensity of my</seg><seg type="columnLine">gaze, he flashed his great goggle eyes upward. For an</seg><seg type="columnLine">instant he gazed at the electroplane. Then he pointed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his cylinder upward, and there was a crash of broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">glass as a projectile struck the floor window.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we were without weapons, I shouted an order to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Reeves:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Ascend! Full speed!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Sure, that one must have been a guard," said Pat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shutting off his clicking cameras. "Wonder what that</seg><seg type="columnLine">was he fired at us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The floor lurched as our craft shot swiftly upward.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Something rolled against my foot. It was a shiny metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe about two inches in diameter--evidently the mis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sile which had been fired from the cylinder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Here it is, Pat," I said, and picked it up.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But scarcely had I done so, when it shot out segmented,</seg><seg type="columnLine">tentacle-like arms and legs, and a head that was a tiny,</seg><seg type="columnLine">goggle-eyed miniature of the creature which had fired it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">One of the metal tentacles whipped down on the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of my hand with a stinging blow, so startling me that I</seg><seg type="columnLine">dropped the thing. It instantly scurried for the broken</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor window, but Pat with a "No you don't!" scooped</seg><seg type="columnLine">it up in his empty binocular case and fastened down the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lid.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "My grandfather once caught a fairy," said Pat, "and</seg><seg type="columnLine">devil a bit of good luck did he have after that. It brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">him to an early grave in his ninety-seventh year."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We emerged into the light of day, and Pat shut off</seg><seg type="columnLine">his lights.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Back to Leon," I ordered, and Reeves started</seg><seg type="columnLine">the three propellers roaring as he pointed the nose of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">craft up over the crater rim.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For our powerful electroplane, capable of a speed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">five hundred miles an hour, the sixty-mile trip back to</seg><seg type="columnLine">Leon would only have been a matter of a few minutes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But we were not destined to complete it, for scarcely had</seg><seg type="columnLine">we passed over the ruins of Viejo, a little more than half</seg><seg type="columnLine">the distance, ere Pat, who had been looking backward</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward Coseguina, called my attention to the fact that</seg><seg type="columnLine">an immense metal globe had shot up out of the crater and</seg><seg type="columnLine">was following us through the air at a pace so much</seg><seg type="columnLine">swifter than our own that we seemed, by comparison, to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be standing still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I focused my glasses on the big globe as it hurtled</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly toward us. It was about a hundred and fifty feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in diameter, and constructed of the same gleaming metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">that we had noted in the shaft. A minute, and it loomed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense and menacing, almost upon us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE METAL MONSTER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">347</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Drop," I ordered Reeves.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He shut off the forward propellers, set the wings at</seg><seg type="columnLine">perpendicular, and reversed the helicopters. We dropped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">just in time, the immense globe hurtling over us with</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrific speed. Its momentum must have carried it at</seg><seg type="columnLine">least five miles ahead of us before it could turn to come</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. In the meantime, we had descended to within a</seg><seg type="columnLine">thousand feet of the earth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hover," I shouted to Reeves, but scarcely had he</seg><seg type="columnLine">checked our downward progress, less than five hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet from the ground, when the globe returned, plunging</seg><seg type="columnLine">straight at us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reeves managed to swerve slightly to one side before</seg><seg type="columnLine">it struck, but our left wing was torn off, and we spun</seg><seg type="columnLine">crazily beneath the supporting helicopters.

The floor was covered</seg><seg type="columnLine">to depth of more than a foot with fluffy volcanic ash,</seg><seg type="columnLine">making the going difficult.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently my outstretched hands encountered a wall,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and I followed this to a doorway. Stumbling through, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered a large room that was in semi-darkness. I felt</seg><seg type="columnLine">a hand on my arm. Then Pat whispered :</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "They're after us! Hear 'em clanking around in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">next room?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Where's Reeves?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't know. Must have found a place to hide."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We came to another doorway. The door was half</seg><seg type="columnLine">ajar, and,we squeezed through. We found ourselves in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a small clothes closet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I peered through the interstice between door and</seg><seg type="columnLine">frame. The dust was settling rapidly, and the room into</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we had crashed was partly visible through the first</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway we had entered. A number of metal creatures</seg><seg type="columnLine">like those we had seen in the shaft were swarming over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the wreck. Their globular bodies gleamed in the sunlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">which filtered through the dust into the hole we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">smashed in the roof* And hanging down through that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">hole was a thick metal cable or tentacle composed of</seg><seg type="columnLine">globular segments which tapered slightly toward the tip.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The creatures investigating the . wreck of the electro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plane were about four feet in height--the same stature as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the structural workers we had observed in the shaft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Suddenly I heard the voice of Reeves:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let go of me, damn you!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a cloud of swirling dust he was dragged by two of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the creatures, each of which had hold of an arm, out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the sunlight. His head and clothing were thickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">covered with volcanic ash. Evidently he had missed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway, had dug in, and had just been discovered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twisting, kicking and cursing, he was dragged up</seg><seg type="columnLine">toward the huge tentacle. It whipped around his waist,</seg><seg type="columnLine">then jerked him aloft, out of our sight. In a moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">it dropped once more. With remarkable agility, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal beings swarmed up. Then it was withdrawn,</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was a clank like that of huge metal door being</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed, and the roof creaked as if a great weight had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been lifted from it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"They've gone," said Pat, "and they've got Reeves!"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Poor devil! And we couldn't do a thing! Come on."</seg><seg type="columnLine">I led the way to the room into which the ship had</seg><seg type="columnLine">crashed. Quickly mounting to its top, I climbed up on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the unbroken helicopter blade and leaped to the roof.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The huge metal sphere had disappeared.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pat came up beside me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It's a long walk to Leon," he said, "and my wrist</seg><seg type="columnLine">radiophone is smashed. How's yours?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I tested it. It was tuned for just such an emergency,</seg><seg type="columnLine">with that of my secretary, Miss Davis, who was back in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Hotel Soledade at Leon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It worked.

Right away."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I broke the connection, then turned to Pat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Think we can save any of those pictures?" I asked.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Why not, chief ? The fuselage wasn't wrecked. I'll</seg><seg type="columnLine">go down and get them."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The helicopter taxi arrived just as Pat came up with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cameras.

We passed</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to a couple of liveried attendants, who led the way</seg><seg type="columnLine">to our suite.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Miss Davis arose from her typewriter desk, concern</seg><seg type="columnLine">in her eyes, as we entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Was anyone injured? Why, where's Mr. Reeves?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">He's not-"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not dead, so far as we know," I replied.

Then I'll look up</seg><seg type="columnLine">President Monteiro."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The face of my chief presently appeared in the radio-</seg><seg type="columnLine">visiphone disc.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"Stuart!" he exclaimed.

"He is in Parlor L."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went into the next room, where Pat was busy de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veloping his films. He had taken his small metal cap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tive from his binocular case and confined it in a stout</seg><seg type="columnLine">bird cage with a small padlock on the door. It was lean-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing against the bars, watching him with its round, head-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light eyes, as I entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get your stuff in shape so you can leave it, Pat,'" I</seg><seg type="columnLine">said. "We're going to call on President Monteiro in</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten minutes, and take the prisoner with us."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Ten minutes later I knocked on the door of President</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monteiro's suite. Pat stood behind me with his caged</seg><seg type="columnLine">prisoner. We were ushered in by an attendant. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">president, a small dark man with a carefully trimmed</seg><seg type="columnLine">iron gray beard, was seated behind a large mahogany</seg><seg type="columnLine">table. Beside him, with her hand on his shoulder, stood</seg><seg type="columnLine">a slender, brown-eyed girl, apparently about twenty years</seg><seg type="columnLine">of age. I recognized her instantly from the photographs</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had seen of her, as Dolores Monteiro, daughter of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">president, and the most famous beauty in the two Amer-</seg><seg type="columnLine">icas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The president greeted me cordially. I introduced my</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistant, and he presented us to his daughter. An at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tendant placed chairs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Selecting a long, thin cigar from a humidor, and push-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing it toward me with a gesture of invitation, the presi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dent said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And now, Senor Stuart, what is this important mes-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sage you have for me?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Briefly I told him of our strange experience--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">astounding sights we had witnessed, and our narrow</seg><seg type="columnLine">escape. He smoked with countenance unruffled until the</seg><seg type="columnLine">end. Then he said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Understand me, senor, I am not doubting your word.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But a story so strange as yours needs substantiation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">You will not mind if I--ah--investigate further?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That is precisely what I hope you will do," I re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied.

The little</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature inside it focused its huge headlight eyes in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiringly 011 each of us in turn, as if wondering what to</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect next.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Looks like a man-made automaton," commented the</seg><seg type="columnLine">president.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "True," I replied, "yet it, and its larger fellows which</seg><seg type="columnLine">we encountered, acted as if endowed with intelligence."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You think these creatures will be--hostile?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Judging by their past actions, yes."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Hum. We'll try them a little further."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pressed a button on the table. A buzzer sounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the next room and a uniformed aide came in.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Dispatch three combat ships, fully armed and manned,</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the crater Coseguina at once," he ordered. "Tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">them to be on the lookout for flying globes and strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal beings, but to make no hostile move unless at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked. Have one descend as far as possible into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">crater while the other two stand by to guard it. If at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacked, they are to defend themselves to the best of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">ability. And let me hear their reports."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The aide bowed and withdrew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Perhaps you would like to see some photographs," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "With pleasure," replied the president.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll make some quick prints and bring them trp,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Pat, rising. "Shall I leave the prisoner here?"</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Yes, leave him," said Monteiro. "I want to examine</seg><seg type="columnLine">him further."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Pat went out and closed the door. The president poked</seg><seg type="columnLine">an inquiring finger through the bars at the little creature</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the cage, then withdrew it hastily with an exclama-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion of surprise as it struck at the encroaching digit with</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of its tentacle arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Per Dioshe exclaimed. "This one, at least, is</seg><seg type="columnLine">hostile.

A huge tentacle whipped into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">room. Clinging to it were four of the globular metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures. One picked up the cage, a second seized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">girl, and the other two pounced upon me, gripping my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms with their powerful tentacles.

To all</seg><seg type="columnLine">appearances the floor, walls and ceiling were con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">structed of seamless brown metal, without windows or</seg><seg type="columnLine">doors. Even the source of the light was invisible. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to radiate from the six metal surfaces that sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rounded me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">On the floor lay the girl, a look of terror in her eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Bending over, I lifted her to a sitting posture. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor lurched suddenly, and I sprawled beside her. Re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">covering my balance, I asked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you hurt, senorita?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">"No, seiior, but I am very frightened. Where are we?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "If Pm not mistaken," I replied, "we're riding in one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the swift flying globes of the metal people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In a few minutes there was a second lurch, followed by</seg><seg type="columnLine">a sudden jolt that threw us both flat. Then a door opened</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the apparently solid wall, and four of the metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures came in. Helping us to our feet, they hustled</seg><seg type="columnLine">us out upon a platform constructed from brown metal.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It was part of an extensive system of docks, along which</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundreds of the globes rested. Countless others were ar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">riving and leaving, from and for all points of the com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pass. Far above these flying globes I could see, through</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dim haze, a great self-luminous dome--the ceiling of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this tremendous underground world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But most amazing of all was the immense city of</seg><seg type="columnLine">gleaming white metal which surrounded the docks--a city</seg><seg type="columnLine">of glistening towers, walls and battlements, all metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But conductors led us to a queer brown-metal vehicle</seg><seg type="columnLine">--flat, with a hand-rail traversing the center longitudinal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly. In lieu of wheels, it traveled on four spheres, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">supported it on idling bearings. There were no seats.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Our captors, after bundling us aboard, indicated that we</seg><seg type="columnLine">must stand, gripping the rail in the center.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The vehicle started smoothly, accelerating with great</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidity. I was unable to see any controls, and none of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our captors seemed to be driving or steering it. Emerging</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the dock, we rolled out on a broad, smooth street,</seg><seg type="columnLine">paved with brown metal. Many vehicles like that we oc-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cupied wrere traversing this street, some of them at ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rific rates of speed. Some had passengers, some carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">materials of various kinds, and some were empty.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Moving in and out among the vehicles, and often</seg><seg type="columnLine">traveling at even greater speeds, were thousands of sil-</seg><seg type="columnLine">very metal globes of divers sizes. I noticed some of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them no larger than buckshot, while others were easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">ten feet in diameter. I saw them, from time to time,</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop at the entrances of buildings, put forth arms, legs</seg><seg type="columnLine">and heads, and enter. Others, coming out of the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings, retracted their limbs and heads and rolled swiftly</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. I judged them to be factories, and afterward con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">firmed this belief.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We passed a building under construction, and I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it was being put together in the same manner as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal shaft I had seen rising in Coseguina--the bodies</seg><seg type="columnLine">of thousands of these strange creatures being utilized as</seg><seg type="columnLine">building material.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently we drew up before a metal wall about fifty</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet in height. Two massive gates, which had previously</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared as part of the wall itself, swung back, reveal-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing a winding metal roadway which led to an immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">building that stood in the center of the most unusual</seg><seg type="columnLine">garden I have ever seen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Instead of grass, flowers, shrubs and trees, it was filled</seg><seg type="columnLine">with mosses, moulds, fungae, lichens and other thallo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phytic growths. Short velvety gray moss carpeted the</seg><seg type="columnLine">lawn. There were clumps of huge mushrooms and</seg><seg type="columnLine">morels, of many shapes, sizes and colors. But the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">striking of all wTere the varieties of gigantic slime moulds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leocarpus fragilis with its gleaming golden spore</seg><seg type="columnLine">cases shaped like elongated eggs, a mycetozoan on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">borderland between the animal and vegetable kingdoms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">grew to a height of ten feet. Globe-shaped physariums</seg><seg type="columnLine">attained a diameter of three to four feet. And the dusky</seg><seg type="columnLine">plumes of the stemonitis, massed in large clumps, waved</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty feet above our heads. Not so pleasing to look</seg><seg type="columnLine">upon were the slimy, gelatinous plasmodia of the various</seg><seg type="columnLine">species, flowing sluggishly about in the areas to which</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had been confined, questing the food which they</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have in order to produce the beautiful plumes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">globes, baskets and ovoid spore cases of mature ones.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were all creatures of the darkness--conceived</seg><seg type="columnLine">and developed without sunlight--unable even to exist</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the direct rays of the lord of the solar system, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">multiplying and growing prodigiously, here in this weird,</seg><seg type="columnLine">pale light of the nether world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We came to a stop before what looked like the un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">broken wall of the building, but here again a previously</seg><seg type="columnLine">invisible door opened, revealing a circular doorway about</seg><seg type="columnLine">fifteen feet in diameter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Here we left our strange vehicle, and walked between</seg><seg type="columnLine">our guards along a narrow corridor until we came to a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great central foyer which evidently reached to the top</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the building. Looking up, I could see galleries encir-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cling it at each level, clear to the top. On the floor of</seg><seg type="columnLine">this room near its center was a ring of black discs, each</seg><seg type="columnLine">about ten feet in diameter, encircled by a narrow rail-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. Our captors led us out on one of these and directed</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to grip the railing, whereupon it shot up into the air</seg><seg type="columnLine">with considerable speed, then slanted over toward one</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the higher balconies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Peering over the railing, I saw that we were being</seg><seg type="columnLine">lifted by a gigantic segmented tentacle emerging from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor where the disc had been. After we had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">deposited on the balcony the disc swiftly returned to its</seg><seg type="columnLine">original position.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">MANY round doors opened on the balcony, and we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were conducted through one of these along a cor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ridor to a second, much larger doorway, on each side of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which stood two guards carrying metal tubes. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">paid no attention to us as we were ushered into a mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nificently furnished room which contrasted oddly with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the plain brown metal corridors and foyer. The foyer</seg><seg type="columnLine">was thickly and richly carpeted, the walls were decorated</seg><seg type="columnLine">with murals near the bottom and bas reliefs above, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ceiling was of luminous yellow metal, which shed</seg><seg type="columnLine">a soft, amber light over the whole scene.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At the far end of the room a figure reclined beneath</seg><seg type="columnLine">a green and gold canopy, upon a luxuriously cushioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">dais raised about three feet above the level of the floor.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As we drew near the throne, the figure sat up. I gazed</seg><seg type="columnLine">aghast at the thing that confronted us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">350</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> At first I thought it a living human skeleton, but as</seg><seg type="columnLine">we drew closer, I saw that its flesh and skin were trans-</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent, its bones and teeth translucent, and its viscera</seg><seg type="columnLine">and nervous system opaque. Its immense head, fully</seg><seg type="columnLine">twice as large in proportion to its size as that of any</seg><seg type="columnLine">earthly man, was encircled by a jewel-encrusted gold</seg><seg type="columnLine">band, which supported an immense emerald at the cen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter of the forehead. It wore no clothing, but its waist</seg><seg type="columnLine">was encircled by a belt of golden links from which a</seg><seg type="columnLine">dagger with a jeweled hilt, and several other instruments</seg><seg type="columnLine">or weapons, I knew not which, depended. Its feet were</seg><seg type="columnLine">enclosed in pointed golden slippers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The horrible creature arose as our conductors brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">us to a halt, and stepped forward to examine us.

Wherever it touched me, it left</seg><seg type="columnLine">prints of slime very much like those left by a garden</seg><seg type="columnLine">slug. Its fingers felt cold and clammy.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Having completed its examination of me, the thing</seg><seg type="columnLine">returned to its dais and reclined.

Then they</seg><seg type="columnLine">led me down another corridor, and through a circular</seg><seg type="columnLine">door into a large room in which more than a hundred</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snals were working, some seated at tables, others stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing before high benches on which were flasks, tubes,</seg><seg type="columnLine">retorts, immense magnifying glasses, and much other</seg><seg type="columnLine">paraphernalia I did not recognize.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was conducted to a square, glassed-in room in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">center of this vast laboratory, where a Snal with a head</seg><seg type="columnLine">even larger than that of Zet, sat at a metal table.

I was sur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">prised that this slimy, gelatinous individual would allow</seg><seg type="columnLine">me in his presence without the Teks to guard me, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned the reason when, under his steady gaze, I tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to shift to a more comfortable position. I was as firmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">attached to the metal chair, which was in turn attached</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor, as if I had been bound with steel bands. Yet</seg><seg type="columnLine">the invisible force that held me did not manifest itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">except when I tried to shift my position on the chair.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Snal stood up, squinting at me through his huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">lens. Through his transparent body and his translucent</seg><seg type="columnLine">ribs, I could see his heart beating, his lungs inflating and</seg><seg type="columnLine">deflating, and his stomach expanding and contracting as</seg><seg type="columnLine">it disposed of his last meal. It was evident from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">demeanor that he thought me an exceedingly queer look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing creature. The feeling was mutual.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have been sent to me for examination, Walter</seg><seg type="columnLine">Stuart," he said, finally.

You are to be tested mentally."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He pushed a shiny metal sphere on the table before</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.

"You have the vision.</seg><seg type="columnLine">It may be that we can use you. Step into this scene."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, as I gazed into that metal globe, I felt my-</seg><seg type="columnLine">self drawn into it--felt that it had enlarged until it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">as high as the sky.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was moving--walking on a metal stairway. Globes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were rolling up beside me, becoming Teks, springing up</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the top of a wall. In my hands--not hands, tentacles</seg><seg type="columnLine">--I held a bent tube from which gleaming liquid metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">poured forth each time I pressed a small button on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">side.

Meanwhile, I glanced over</seg><seg type="columnLine">the rim of the wall. It was level with the crater rim of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Coseguina. And between me and that rim, thousands of</seg><seg type="columnLine">other workers like myself were building a metal city on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sloping sides of the crater. Their animated build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing material was coming up the shaft in a steady stream,</seg><seg type="columnLine">rolling up a spiral ramp that had been constructed at one</seg><seg type="columnLine">side. On the crater rim, a great metal dome was rising</seg><seg type="columnLine">--swiftly closing inward and upward toward the center</seg><seg type="columnLine">with amazing rapidity--shutting out the daylight from</seg><seg type="columnLine">above.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Reflecting the sunlight from their shimmering sides,</seg><seg type="columnLine">a dozen huge, flying globes slowly circled overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The vision suddenly faded.

"Now let me see</seg><seg type="columnLine">if you can control."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From beneath the table he produced two electrodes 011</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">insulated wires.

A voice came from somewhere beside me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">yet I saw no one.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I rolled from my position, and down the side of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pyramid of globes. When I was half way down, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">voice said: "Stop."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I halted, clinging to the slanting surface by some mag-</seg><seg type="columnLine">netic force which I was able to control.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Let go."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I shut off the force, and rolled to the floor,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Walk."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thrust out leg and arm tentacles, put forth my metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">head with its great goggling eyes, and scrambled to my</seg><seg type="columnLine">feet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Back to your place."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly retracting head and limbs, I rolled back</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the top of the pyramid and lay still.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The vision faded.

I was a</seg><seg type="columnLine">goggle-eyed Tek, seated high in the air in a metal room</seg><seg type="columnLine">situated in a great dome which covered the crater Cose-</seg><seg type="columnLine">guina. The work of building had been completed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">incredible swiftness. I was surrounded by metal, yet I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had \he, power of looking through it at any point by</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashing a special ray from between my eyes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A FLEET of twelve battleships was approaching from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the south. They flew the flag of Nicaragua. An-</seg><seg type="columnLine">other fleet of seven, flying the flag of Honduras, ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">proached from the north, across the Gulf of Fonseca.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The two fleets deployed, and formed a semicircle, front-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the isthmus on which the volcano was situated. From</seg><seg type="columnLine">the land side an immense army approached behind a long</seg><seg type="columnLine">line of great, rumbling tanks. And two fleets of mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">aerial battleships closed in above, attended by several</seg><seg type="columnLine">hundred relatively small but exceedingly swift helicopter</seg><seg type="columnLine">electroplanes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">352</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly, as if every gun in the attacking force were</seg><seg type="columnLine">under single control, a terrific bombardment began. Shells</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the battleships and artillery rained on that metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome. Immense bombs were dropped by the aerial bat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tleships and electroplanes. Projectiles of smaller caliber,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from seventy-fives down to thirty-forties, rattled against</seg><seg type="columnLine">that great hemisphere of gleaming metal. But not one</seg><seg type="columnLine">shell or proj ectile so much as dented it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This bombardment lasted for perhaps five minutes</seg><seg type="columnLine">without interruption, and without any visible effect on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great dome. Then, suddenly, a thousand doors that</seg><seg type="columnLine">had hitherto appeared to be a part of the solid metal,</seg><seg type="columnLine">opened. From each door emerged a flying globe. Like</seg><seg type="columnLine">a swarm of angry bees defending a hive, they hurtled at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the attackers. Bullets rattled and shells burst against</seg><seg type="columnLine">them without effect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two globes descended on a Nicaraguan battleship,</seg><seg type="columnLine">one above the fore deck, the other near the stern. Long</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal tentacles slithered down, gripping the front and</seg><seg type="columnLine">rear turrets. And down these tentacles swarmed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Teks. They plunged into the turrets--down the ladders.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Each Tek, as it emerged, dragged a human prisoner. One</seg><seg type="columnLine">by one these prisoners were passed up into the globes.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Teks followed. The tentacles were drawn up.

Other globes seized the aerial</seg><seg type="columnLine">battleships with their powerful tentacles, boarded them,</seg><seg type="columnLine">took off the men, and left them to drift unguided, or to</seg><seg type="columnLine">crash. One by one the electroplanes were caught and</seg><seg type="columnLine">denuded of men. The army attempted to retreat, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">this was quickly prevented by a row of globes which</seg><seg type="columnLine">formed on the ground, stretching across the peninsula.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Teks swarmed everywhere. Men were pulled out</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tanks--dragged away from the field pieces, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">caught as they attempted to flee or hide.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> All the battleships were circling erratically. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">were several collisions. One- ship went down, rammed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by another. Aerial battleships and electroplanes were</seg><seg type="columnLine">continually crashing to the ground or falling into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Gulf and the ocean. Huge tanks, driverless, climbed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the peak as far as the edge of the dome, stood up, grind-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at the shimmering metal, and fell over backward,</seg><seg type="columnLine">their motors roaring, to tumble down the steep slope</seg><seg type="columnLine">they had climbed, and smash to masses of twisted wreck-</seg><seg type="columnLine">age at the bottom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In less than thirty minutes after the bombardment</seg><seg type="columnLine">began, the last globe returned to the dome.

Once more I was back in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory with Hax. His colorless, glass-like</seg><seg type="columnLine">eyes leered at me through the huge lens.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You see," he said, "how hopeless it is for mankind</seg><seg type="columnLine">to resist us. We are invincible."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have but defeated the forces of two small na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tions," I replied.

Her scientists will find a way to defeat you."</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Her scientists are weak-minded children, compared to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the most ignorant Snals," he said, contemptuously. "They</seg><seg type="columnLine">are creatures of a lower order, fit only for slaves. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">you will go now to begin your slavery with the rest.''</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Two Teks suddenly appeared behind me. Seizing my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms, they lifted me from the chair and hurried me</seg><seg type="columnLine">away. As I left the laboratory the mocking laughter of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Hax followed me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The Teks took me out of the building the way I</seg><seg type="columnLine">had come. One of the queer, rolling vehicles was wait-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing. My hands were forced down on the central rail,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which glowed as if with some radioactive force. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">stuck there, and try as I could, I was unable to remove</seg><seg type="columnLine">them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We passed through the gates in the wall, and threaded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the city streets to a great, large structure near the cocks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A number of other similar vehicles with glowing hand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rails were waiting around the building. And th:n sands</seg><seg type="columnLine">of prisoners, disembarking from arriving globes, were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being herded into this building by the Teks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Others were being driven out of another entrance I</seg><seg type="columnLine">noticed that some were forced to grasp the shin:::? hand</seg><seg type="columnLine">rails, while others were bound, hand and foot, w:Â± wire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stacked on the vehicles like cord wood. At hr;: I</seg><seg type="columnLine">saw only soldiers, sailors and airmen, wearing the uni-</seg><seg type="columnLine">forms of Nicaragua and Honduras. But the ;s</seg><seg type="columnLine">presently began to disgorge loads of civilian;---men.</seg><seg type="columnLine">women and children, whites, mestizos, Indian; ani - ti-</seg><seg type="columnLine">roes, evidently taken in raids on the nearby territory.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The vehicles, loaded with their human freight and</seg><seg type="columnLine">each presided over by a Tek, began to form in a !:&gt;ng</seg><seg type="columnLine">line. When a train of about six hundred had been i onrsed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">we left. All traffic had evidently been stopped to let</seg><seg type="columnLine">us through, for although I could see many vehides on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other streets those through which our leader piloted</seg><seg type="columnLine">us were deserted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The vehicle in which I was riding was a half mile or</seg><seg type="columnLine">so behind the one which led the procession. Aixnt half</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the vehicles were loaded with the bound prisoners and</seg><seg type="columnLine">half with those held by the luminous hand rails. A load</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the poor bound wretches was just ahead of me. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">could hear their piteous moans. Their wrists and ankles</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so tightly bound with wire that they were cut and</seg><seg type="columnLine">bleeding. And those at the bottom of the tilt were</seg><seg type="columnLine">crushed by the weight of the ones above them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our train soon passed through the city, ani out upon</seg><seg type="columnLine">a great metal causeway that stretched above a weird and</seg><seg type="columnLine">unusual landscape of grotesque thallophytlc growths.</seg><seg type="columnLine">These were in orderly array, and tended by busy Teks.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Among the cultivated plants I saw a number of varieties</seg><seg type="columnLine">of gigantic slime moulds. They were cultivated in pits</seg><seg type="columnLine">about twelve feet in diameter, set in rows with metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">runways between them. Some of the pits contained</seg><seg type="columnLine">great masses of naked, polynuclear protoplasm--the plas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">modia which would later develop into adult slime moulds.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we passed along through these fields I noticed that,</seg><seg type="columnLine">from time to time, one of the cars containing the bound</seg><seg type="columnLine">human beings was shunted off the causeway and along</seg><seg type="columnLine">one of the tracks which ran between the plasmodium</seg><seg type="columnLine">pits. Watching one of these as w7e sped past, I saw</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Tek lift a bound human being and hurl his helpless</seg><seg type="columnLine">victim into one of the pits. At the next pit he stopped</seg><seg type="columnLine">and repeated the process. The grim prophecy of Hax</seg><seg type="columnLine">was already coming to pass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The men who were fastened on the vehicle on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I rode numbered about twenty. There were five naval</seg><seg type="columnLine">officers, five seamen, eight Indians and two Negroes. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE METAL MONSTER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">353</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">man just ahead of me wore the uniform of a lieutenant.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What did they do to you in the round building, Senor</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lieutenant ?" I asked him in Spanish.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We were given a test to see if we could control those</seg><seg type="columnLine">metal creatures, senor," he replied. "Those who could</seg><seg type="columnLine">not pass the test--many of them women and children--</seg><seg type="columnLine">were bound with wire. It is horrible. What are they</seg><seg type="columnLine">doing with them?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I told him. He ground his teeth and cursed luridly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently he asked:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And what will they do with the rest of us?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "As long as we can serve," I replied, "we'll probably</seg><seg type="columnLine">be slaves. After that, food for the plasmodia."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Of the six hundred vehicles that left the city, about</seg><seg type="columnLine">three hundred drew up before a great, dome-like build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing.

The Tek who presided over our</seg><seg type="columnLine">vehicle shut off the current in the rail, releasing our hands.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then we were herded into the building with the others--</seg><seg type="columnLine">whites, mestizos, Indians and Negroes, men and women,</seg><seg type="columnLine">mixed indiscriminately.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The first room in which we found ourselves was an</seg><seg type="columnLine">immense lobby which encircled the building. This room</seg><seg type="columnLine">proved to be the living and sleeping quarters of the Snal</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers, whose places we human slaves were to take.</seg><seg type="columnLine">While one-half of the workers labored in the inner rooms,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other half slept and took recreation in this apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment. Their bunks were metal cylinders about three feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">in diameter and seven feet long, stacked three rows high</seg><seg type="columnLine">along the outer wall. They contained no padding or cov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers, and were as private as gold-fish bowls. The tired</seg><seg type="columnLine">workers, without bothering to disrobe, crawled into them</seg><seg type="columnLine">and stretched out on the cold metal when ordered to do</seg><seg type="columnLine">so by their overseers. They crawled out again to re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceive their meagre rations and to resume w?ork when</seg><seg type="columnLine">their sleep period had elapsed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The overseers wore round, pointed helmets and com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plete . suits of scale-armor made from a dull-surfaced,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dark brown metal. Their weapons were paralyzing ray</seg><seg type="columnLine">tubes, like that which Zet had used on me, and queer,</seg><seg type="columnLine">double-edge weapons, the blades of which looked like two</seg><seg type="columnLine">meat-axes welded together, back to back, with handles</seg><seg type="columnLine">about eighteen inches in length hooked at the end to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hang from their belts; they carried slender metal rods</seg><seg type="columnLine">about eight feet in length, the pointed ends of which con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tinually glowed at a red heat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">WE were forced to disrobe and don the coarse</seg><seg type="columnLine">aprons. In each apron were two pockets, one of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which contained a glass flask and the other a shallow</seg><seg type="columnLine">bowl. As fast as we donned our slave raiment, we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">driven in single file past a counter, where we were issued</seg><seg type="columnLine">water in our flasks and a thick, jet black porridge, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I afterward learned was made from the spores of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">species of slime mould, in our bowls. It had a rank,</seg><seg type="columnLine">musty flavor, and I could not stomach it at first, but as it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was the only food given us, we had to eat it or starve.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Most of us eventually got so we could consume the</seg><seg type="columnLine">portions served us, although I doubt if anyone really</seg><seg type="columnLine">learned to like the stuff.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After we had been given our garments and rations,</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were herded into the immense central control room.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The floor of this room rose in circular concentric ter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">races conforming to the contour of the domed roof</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">above, and ending in a small round platform occupied</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by the chief overseer, who could thus look down 011</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the entire workroom.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Set against the faces of the terraces were curved tables.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Twenty workers w'ere seated at each table, gazing into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their control globes and gripping their electrodes. Each</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">table was presided over by an armed and armored over-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">seer, who gazed into a large globe mounted on a tripod,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in which he could watch the collective activities of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Teks controlled by his workers. A worker, caught</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shirking or making an error, was punished by a searing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">touch from the red-hot point of the overseer's long rod.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I was assigned to a seat between two Snal workers,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and noticed that this arrangement was maintained with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the other slaves--first a Snal, then a human slave.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The young lieutenant who had ridden on the same</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vehicle with me was seated just beyond the Snal at my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">right.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  At a sharp command from the; overseer, I grasped my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">controls and gazed into my globe. I instantly found</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">myself a Tek, operating a gigantic mechanical shovel</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">1 that was scooping up what looked like white sand from</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the floor and walls of a huge pit and dropping it into</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">vehicles writh globe-wheels and hopper-shaped bodies.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">These vehicles, each operated by one Tek, moved past in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a steady stream as fast as I filled them with the white</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sand. One immense shovelful sufficed to fill each vehicle.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Other Teks labored nearby with similar mechanical</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shovels. The vehicles, I noticed, were all moving toward</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a great structure some distance away, from which col-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">umns of smoke or vapor were rising, and from which,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at times, lurid flashes of light gave a blood-orange tint</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the surrounding landscape and to the vapors that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">floated beneath the great vault, high overhead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  It dawned on me that this white sand must be a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">metallic ore--a salt of some metal--and that the building</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to which it was being taken was a smelter or refinery.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   As I sat there working, it seemed that I developed the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">faculty of being two places at once--thinking two sets of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">thoughts at the same time. Objectively, I sat and worked</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in the control room. Subjectively, I operated the me-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chanical shovel. It was like playing a piano and singing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the same time--or perhaps more like singing an air</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and playing a violin obbligato. Doing two things at once,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">one objectively, the other subjectively, yet conscious of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">doing both.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The Snals had permitted me to retain my wrist</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">chronometer, though my radiophone was taken from me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">They had learned its use when Art Reeves had sacrificed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">his life to warn me--all to no avail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The chronometer showed that our day was divided</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">into two periods of about ten hours each--a work period</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and a rest period. The work period lasted for ten solid</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hours without intermission, nor were we permitted to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">take our hands from the electrodes even for an instant</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">during that period. When the work period was finished,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the second shift of workers was ready to take our places.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">We were then issued wTater and black porridge, and per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mitted to roam about in our living quarters for about an</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hour. At the end of the hour, however, we were per-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">emptorily ordered into our sleeping cylinders for eight</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hours. We were then ordered out, fed and watered, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at the end of another hour, marched into the control</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">room to relieve the shift that had been working while we</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">slept and rested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   The division in which I worked, labored unremittingly</seg><seg type="columnLine">354</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">at digging and loading a seemingly endless desert of</seg><seg type="columnLine">white ore. I learned from workers in other divisions that</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of them were engaged in smelting the ore, some in</seg><seg type="columnLine">building metal cities and warehouses, others in building</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying globes, and still others in transporting materials</seg><seg type="columnLine">and prisoners through the streets of the subterranean</seg><seg type="columnLine">cities and along the metal causeways that connected them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With the aid of my chronometer I kept careful track</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the outer world time.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Within two weeks after my arrival, every worker</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snal in the building had been replaced by a human slave.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The only Snals remaining were the armed and armored</seg><seg type="columnLine">overseers.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I often thought of Dolores Monteiro as I had last seen</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, shuddering before Zet, the slimy emperor of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">nether world, and wondered what had become of her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">She was a lovely creature, and unspoiled, despite the</seg><seg type="columnLine">adulation she had always received.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Although certainly not human, Zet greatly resembled</seg><seg type="columnLine">a human being in form.

Withdrawing it deliberately, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">shut off the paralyzing ray, permitting the body to slump</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the floor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This exhibition of cruelty so filled me with rage and</seg><seg type="columnLine">revulsion that I was tempted to hurl my globe at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snal's head, and follow the throw with an attack. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">the thought of Dolores deterred me. She would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting for me--expecting me to meet and help her.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another slave was thrust into the lieutenant's place,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his body was carried out by two Teks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Take heed, slaves, from the death of your fellow,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said the overseer, "and rebel not against authority lest</seg><seg type="columnLine">you share his fate."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolores met me at the beginning of the rest period,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we went together for our food and water, then sat</seg><seg type="columnLine">down on the stone floor to eat.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Before we had finished eating, a number of Teks came</seg><seg type="columnLine">in, bearing the sections of a huge metal screen, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE METAL MONSTER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">355</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">they welded smoothly together and set up in the middle</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the floor. Several Snals came a short time thereafter,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and connected it with a complicated-appearing machine,</seg><seg type="columnLine">while the slaves flocked curiously around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When their work was finished, a life size image ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared on the screen. It was Zet, ruler of the nether</seg><seg type="columnLine">world, his emerald diadem sparkling above his slimy</seg><seg type="columnLine">features.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He began to speak and every voice was hushed. To</seg><seg type="columnLine">me, he seemed to be speaking English. Dolores told me</seg><seg type="columnLine">afterward that she thought he was speaking Spanish.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And a Misskito Indian I later interrogated was positive</seg><seg type="columnLine">the great "Glass Face" had spoken his native dialect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zet told us that the screen had been installed for our</seg><seg type="columnLine">entertainment and information, and that, through it.</seg><seg type="columnLine">he would keep us constantly posted on the progress of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his conquest of the world. We would thus be made to</seg><seg type="columnLine">realize, he said, how hopeless it would be for us to rebel</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the fate which nature had intended for us--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of serving the Snals, who were as superior to us as we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were to the beasts we had domesticated. He ended by</seg><seg type="columnLine">promising that those of us who served faithfully and</seg><seg type="columnLine">well would be rewarded later, when his empire was es-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tablished, by easier work and positions of power among</seg><seg type="columnLine">our fellows.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Zet's image faded from the screen. It was followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">by that of another Snal--a short, stocky individual,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whose ornaments were richly powdered with jewels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I am the Voice," he said. " I speak for Zet, Lord</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Inner and Outer Worlds. Behold the progress of</seg><seg type="columnLine">his conquests."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE image faded and a large map of the Americas</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared on the screen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The portions marked in green are under the domin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ion of Zet," said the Voice. "He moves slowly but</seg><seg type="columnLine">surely, taking what he wants when he wants it."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> From the northern border of Mexico, through Central</seg><seg type="columnLine">America, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela., the map</seg><seg type="columnLine">was shaded green! And all this in thirty days!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The map faded, and in its place we were shown mov-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing pictures in full color. Managua, rebuilt capital of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Nicaragua, was shown first In the heart of the city</seg><seg type="columnLine">rose an immense metal dome--shiny and incongruous,</seg><seg type="columnLine">like some false growth appearing on the fair body of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the earth. We were shown a glimpse of an inner room</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the great dome. President Monteiro and his staff</seg><seg type="columnLine">were here, guarded by Teks and bullied by an armored</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snal who seemed to be Zet's vice-regent of the nation.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There were other, flatter domes near the outskirts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">city. Beneath these, beds of slime mould had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">planted. They were being tended by human slaves, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">fed both with the bodies of men and domestic animals.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Just outside this ring was another, in which were taller</seg><seg type="columnLine">domes like the one we were in--control buildings in</seg><seg type="columnLine">which human slaves toiled with their minds, that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Teks might work the will of their Snal masters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We saw flashes of other capitals, each with its great</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining dome centrally located, and its encircling rings</seg><seg type="columnLine">of metal-covered slime mould beds and control buildings.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Bogota, Caracas, Quito, Mexico City, San Jose, San</seg><seg type="columnLine">Salvador and the rest, all were under the yoke of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conquerors.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Teks rolled about the streets--swarmed everywhere,</seg><seg type="columnLine">searching out human victims to be dragged before the</seg><seg type="columnLine">conquering Snals, who remained in their huge metal</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">buildings or in the flying globes. Tiny Teks no larger</seg><seg type="columnLine">than pin heads spied on the people unseen. Conspirators</seg><seg type="columnLine">against the tyranny were thus quickly detected, captured</seg><seg type="columnLine">and fed to the plasmodia.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were shown the northern battle front, where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">United States had stretched a huge army from gulf to</seg><seg type="columnLine">ocean to protect its territory. It was not a battle, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">a farce, in which the Teks were sent out at will of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">controlling Snals, to drag men from the trenches, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tanks, or the decks and cabins of aircraft, and whirl</seg><seg type="columnLine">them away in the flying globes, against which the most</seg><seg type="columnLine">powerful weapons of the world were powerless. New</seg><seg type="columnLine">weapons were being tried--oxy-acetylene flame-throw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ers--that would cut through steel plates as if they had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been paper--bombs, loaded both with nitric and sul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phuric acids, in the hope that these might prevail against</seg><seg type="columnLine">the obstinate metal. But they had no more effect on it</seg><seg type="columnLine">than water has on glass.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Some of these things we saw. Some were told to us</seg><seg type="columnLine">by the Voice. But I do not think there was a man or</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman in the building who was not convinced of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">truth of all of them, and the utter hopelessness of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">situation. Man's knell of doom had sounded. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">place in the sun was being slowly but surely wrested</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him by these slimy intelligences of the nether</seg><seg type="columnLine">world.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The South American republics had also extended a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great defensive line across their continent. But it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">even less of an obstruction to the conquerors than that</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the United States.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After each work and sleep period, Dolores and I met</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the same spot. We would eat our block porridge to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, then go and stand in front of the screen to learn</seg><seg type="columnLine">the latest news of the earth's conquest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In another thirty days the southern half of the United</seg><seg type="columnLine">States and more than half of South America were under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the sway of the Snals. The opposing armies had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">completely routed, and most of their field equipment de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">stroyed. Our screen was tuned in with exploring globes</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying over the areas as yet unconquered. And they</seg><seg type="columnLine">showed people fleeing northward in every means of con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">veyance at their disposal. Canada swarmed with refu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gees. Air- and water-liners loaded to capacity were</seg><seg type="columnLine">leaving for Europe, Africa and Asia. And the advance</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the metal menace continued steadily, relentlessly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolores came to mean much to me--more than the</seg><seg type="columnLine">whole world. I had never told her, had not more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">touched her hand. But she could do more with her eyes</seg><seg type="columnLine">than can most girls with arms and lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was because of the hopelessness of our situation</seg><seg type="columnLine">that I did not speak to her of love or marriage. I sus-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pected, however, that she knew of my love, and dared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to hope that she returned it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I always looked forward to my meetings with her as</seg><seg type="columnLine">the only bright spots in this career of mental drudgery.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Like those of the other slaves, my brain was being</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned into a machine to work the will of the Snals.</seg><seg type="columnLine">And it might have become as dulled and listless as did</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others had it not been for her bright companionship.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> During those first two months the Snal overseers</seg><seg type="columnLine">began to select women from among the slaves to share</seg><seg type="columnLine">their quarters with them. Each overseer had a private</seg><seg type="columnLine">apartment, jutting out from the outer wall of the build-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing at its base. These apartments were set at intervals,</seg><seg type="columnLine">clear around the building, and where their round doors</seg><seg type="columnLine">were placed, no sleeping cylinders were piled. Some</seg><seg type="columnLine">356</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">went fearfully, under the threat of the red hot torture</seg><seg type="columnLine">rods. But many preferred to die in agony,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A number of overseers had asked for Dolores--my</seg><seg type="columnLine">own, a tall fellow named Lak, among them. But the</seg><seg type="columnLine">head overseer had his orders. She was to be saved for</seg><seg type="columnLine">Zet until such time as the ruler should send for her,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unless- Every overseer knew that she had been com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">manded to keep this secret from the other slaves--that</seg><seg type="columnLine">if she disobeyed, death would be the penalty. And each</seg><seg type="columnLine">overseer combined in his person, the powers of judge,</seg><seg type="columnLine">jury and executioner.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Many times I noticed Lak watching us furtively when</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were together. Once 1 turned, and saw him stand-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing close behind us as we watched the news screen. But</seg><seg type="columnLine">even then, I did not guess his purpose.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was, when I had computed that about two months</seg><seg type="columnLine">of earth time had passed, that I eagerly sought our</seg><seg type="columnLine">rendezvous after a work period, but Dolores was not</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. I waited more than ten minutes, but she did not</seg><seg type="columnLine">put in an appearance. Then I noticed a Misskito In-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dian, seated nearby licking his porridge--smudged</seg><seg type="columnLine">fingers and eyeing me significantly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You look for white senorita?" he asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes. Have you seen her?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In there," was the laconic answer. He pointed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">his porridge-smeared thumb to the door of Lak's apart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VII</seg><seg type="columnLine">The Subterranean Jungle</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I LOOKED cautiously about me. None of the Snals</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed to be watching my movements. Endeavor-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to appear unconcerned, I walked slowly toward</seg><seg type="columnLine">the door of Lak's apartment. It took less than a minute</seg><seg type="columnLine">to reach the edge of the pile of sleeping cylinders. Again</seg><seg type="columnLine">I glanced slowly around. So far as I could see, neither</seg><seg type="columnLine">Snal nor slave was paying any attention to my move-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dodging into the passageway between the piles of cyl-</seg><seg type="columnLine">inders, I tiptoed to the door. It was closed, but gave</seg><seg type="columnLine">when I tried the fastening. I opened it cautiously for</seg><seg type="columnLine">a little way. Lak was standing with his back to me,</seg><seg type="columnLine">holding Dolores by her shoulders. Neither could see</seg><seg type="columnLine">me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Entering soundlessly, I closed the door.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Lak was saying:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You have earned death, slave-girl, but I can save</seg><seg type="columnLine">you. Only I heard you tell the secret of Zet to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">slave-man. You must make your choice now--your life</seg><seg type="columnLine">or the love of Lak."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I had heard more than enough. With a single bound,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I stood beside them. Seizing the armored shoulder of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Snal, I spun him half around.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> His burning rod stood in a rack, but his chopper and</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralyzing ray cylinder still hung from his belt. With</seg><seg type="columnLine">a grunt of surprise and anger, he grabbed for the lat-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter. But his visor was up and I swung for his face.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The result was astounding--and sickening. My arm</seg><seg type="columnLine">was buried, half way up to my elbow in his great round</seg><seg type="columnLine">head. My fist had crashed through his nose and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">frontal bones of his face, clear into his, huge, mushy</seg><seg type="columnLine">brain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">With a feeling of intense disgust, I withdrew my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm, and the metal-clad body clanked to the floor. As</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">best I could, I cleaned the slime from my arm with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">coverlet dragged from Lak's luxurious sleeping cylinder.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolores, who had bravely faced her persecutor to</seg><seg type="columnLine">the end, now collapsed, with her face in her hands, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">began weeping softly. I was about to try to comfort</seg><seg type="columnLine">her, when I noticed something sputtering on the floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">at her feet. Puzzled, I bent forward to investigate.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A great tear trickled down between her fingers--fell</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the metal floor. And where it struck, the sputtering</seg><seg type="columnLine">commenced anew, while beneath it a patch of white</seg><seg type="columnLine">crystals was forming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The floor, unlike that of the main building, was made</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the white metal that had defied shells, solid shot, oxy-</seg><seg type="columnLine">acetylene flames and two of the strongest acids known</seg><seg type="columnLine">to man, yet here it was, changing to a white powder be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">neath a woman's tears. After each tear drop fell the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sputtering soon ceased. But the white spots spread</seg><seg type="columnLine">with amazing rapidity. Presently, several of them ran</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, then collapsed, revealing the wild thallophytic</seg><seg type="columnLine">growths of subterranean jungle about ten feet below</seg><seg type="columnLine">the floor. The hole widened rapidly, the metal flaking</seg><seg type="columnLine">away in white crystals. It undermined the body of Lak,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it fell into the undergrowth while Dolores and I</seg><seg type="columnLine">looked on amazed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A way out!" I exclaimed. "Come on!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After dropping Lak's burning rod, I swung down on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the edge of the still-widening orifice, and let go, alight-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing in the muck among the soft growths, with scarcely</seg><seg type="columnLine">a perceptible jar.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolores bravely followed, and I caught her in my</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I stripped off the overseer's belt, which contained his</seg><seg type="columnLine">paralyzing ray cylinder and chopper. When I had it</seg><seg type="columnLine">strapped around my waist, I caught up the burning rod,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we hurried away through the grotesque fungoid</seg><seg type="columnLine">growths.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few steps took us out from beneath the building,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which stood on metal stilts set into the soggy soil. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">we emerged under the luminous dome of this strange</seg><seg type="columnLine">underground world, the light grew much stronger and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the vegetation taller.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Soon we were hurrying through a forest of thick</seg><seg type="columnLine">slimy trunks, some of them eight to ten feet in diame-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ter at the base and fifty to sixty feet in height--the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stems of colossal mushrooms. Often we found our way</seg><seg type="columnLine">blocked by these immense fungoids which had crashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground, and for the remains of which, lichens and</seg><seg type="columnLine">slime moulds of many varieties contended. Giant mosses</seg><seg type="columnLine">of endless shapes and hues formed most of the under-</seg><seg type="columnLine">growth, and algae dominated the thousands of stagnant</seg><seg type="columnLine">pools. From time to time the immense, umbrella-shaped</seg><seg type="columnLine">caps overhead opened their gills to discharge millions of</seg><seg type="columnLine">spores that glittered in the queer phosphorescent light</seg><seg type="columnLine">as they swirled downward to settle over the weird land-</seg><seg type="columnLine">scape.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The animal, as well as the vegetable kingdom, was re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">presented in variety and profusion. The lower orders</seg><seg type="columnLine">dominated in size as well as in numbers. Fat, gray</seg><seg type="columnLine">slugs, three feet and more in length, fed on the juices of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the various plants about us. Snails of infinite variety</seg><seg type="columnLine">and immense size left their slimy trails everywhere.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I recognized glass snails, amber snails, agate snails, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">most striking of all, great ramshorn snails as tall as</seg><seg type="columnLine">camels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">Insect monstrosities buzzed busily about, or scamp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ered over the moss. An immense thousand-legged worm,</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE METAL MONSTER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">357</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">fully twenty feet in length, startled us as it crossed our</seg><seg type="columnLine">path. A huge green beetle as large as a Shetland pony</seg><seg type="columnLine">charged us with its huge four-foot mandibles distended,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but backed up and hastily scampered away at a touch</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my searing rod. A mosquito, as large as a crane,</seg><seg type="columnLine">buzzed about us for some time, until I killed it with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">lucky thrust through the head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The air was heavy with the musty odors of the fun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">goid growths, the sickening charnel scent of the slimy</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures that lived in their moist depths, and the reek</seg><seg type="columnLine">of decaying organic matter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Stumbling, slipping, sliding, sometimes sinking knee-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deep in clinging muck or splashing through water above</seg><seg type="columnLine">our waists, we pressed onward, our sole desire being</seg><seg type="columnLine">to put as much distance as possible between ourselves</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the slave quarters.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As we hurried along I pondered much on the miracle</seg><seg type="columnLine">that had wrought our deliverance from the apartment of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Lak. What could there be, I wondered, in this woman's</seg><seg type="columnLine">tears, that had destroyed a metal which had defied pro-</seg><seg type="columnLine">jectiles, explosives, heat, and powerful acids? In this</seg><seg type="columnLine">solution of this mystery lay the key to the door of</seg><seg type="columnLine">knowledge which, if once opened, would deliver the</seg><seg type="columnLine">world from bondage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> And why, I wondered further, had this mircale not</seg><seg type="columnLine">been wrought before? Surely many of the captured</seg><seg type="columnLine">woman and children had dropped tears in the metal</seg><seg type="columnLine">globes, on the metal vehicles in which they had been</seg><seg type="columnLine">hauled, and on the tentacle-like arms of their captors.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then I recalled that the room in the globe that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">brought me in, a prisoner, was of brown metal, as were</seg><seg type="columnLine">the bodies of the vehicles in which we had been carried,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and the highways over which we had traveled. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">arms of the Teks, although of white metal, were of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">duller cast than the globes and heads, as were the tables,</seg><seg type="columnLine">globes and electrodes in the control room. The floor</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the building, except in the private apartments of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">overseers which jutted out over the jungle, were of</seg><seg type="columnLine">stone.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> But all this did not explain the enigma.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After five hours of wearisome travel, we were glad to</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop and sit down on the moss for a breathing spell. I</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a drink of water from my flask. It was nearly half</seg><seg type="columnLine">full. I shuddered at the thought of having to drink the</seg><seg type="columnLine">foul, stagnant water we had encountered. Dolores also</seg><seg type="columnLine">drank some water and replaced her flask in her apron</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fm hungry," she announced. "Do you suppose any</seg><seg type="columnLine">of these plants are edible?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No doubt," I replied, "and it's equally probable that</seg><seg type="columnLine">some of them are so poisonous that a mouthful or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">would prove fatal. The question is, which are poisonous</seg><seg type="columnLine">and which are edible. We have no way of knowing."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then what are we to do?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We may run across some of the varieties of slime</seg><seg type="columnLine">moulds that the Snals cultivate for food," I replied.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Their spores are good to eat. And in the palace gardens</seg><seg type="columnLine">I saw some gigantic morels. I think we would be safe in</seg><seg type="columnLine">using these for food if we could find any. In the outer</seg><seg type="columnLine">world the morel is the one mushroom form that is never</seg><seg type="columnLine">poisonous."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "In that case," she said, "let us look for morels."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Rested by our brief pause, we resumed our journey.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently the character of the vegetation changed as.</seg><seg type="columnLine">we came out of the marshy country to higher and drier</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground. The moss was replaced by short, white snake</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">grass. And huge, jointed reeds began to take the place</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the tall mushrooms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We had not gone far when we came to a group of</seg><seg type="columnLine">large mounds uniformly about fifty feet in diameter and</seg><seg type="columnLine">twenty feet high.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fm going up and have a look around," said Dolores,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and suited her action to her words by scampering up</seg><seg type="columnLine">the side of the mound. She had not taken more than</seg><seg type="columnLine">five steps when one foot broke through into a compart-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment underneath. She withdrew it with a scream of</seg><seg type="columnLine">pain, and came running toward me, her knee bleeding.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then a white thing about eighteen inches in height,</seg><seg type="columnLine">popped out after her and pursued her on six rapidly</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving legs. Behind it came another and another, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I recognized them for what they were--giant termite as</seg><seg type="columnLine">large as pet bulldogs and ten times as dangerous.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I ran toward her, my burning rod ready for action,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but before I reached her a veritable army of the formi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dable creatures came rushing toward us from around</seg><seg type="columnLine">both sides of the mound, their great hooked mandibles</seg><seg type="columnLine">snapping menacingly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No use to argue with those things," I shouted. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">wouldn't have a Chinaman's chance. Can you run?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "And how!" she replied, passing me like a bullet.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I was not slow to follow, but I soon saw that we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">being outstripped by the swift, six-legged creatures De-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hind us, and that it would only be a matter of a few mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ments before we would be pulled down and torn to</seg><seg type="columnLine">pieces.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Climb something," I cried. "It will be our only</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance to hold them off."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolores leaped for the nearest jointed stalk, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrambled up, I at her heels, just as the foremost term-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ites came snapping up behind us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I thrust the point of my burning rod into the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">mouth of the leader, and sent it tumbling back on those</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind it. Then an astounding thing happened. There</seg><seg type="columnLine">was a roar overhead as if a dozen helicopter blades had</seg><seg type="columnLine">suddenly gone into action, and the stalk to which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were clinging left the ground with amazing rapidity.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I glanced upward and saw the reason. Instead of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">scaly plant stalk, we were clinging to the slender, seg-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mented body of an immense insect! And already we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were so high above the ground that to let go would mean</seg><seg type="columnLine">certain death!</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">CHAPTER VIII</seg><seg type="columnLine">Monsters of the Nether World</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">THE huge insect to which we were clinging flew</seg><seg type="columnLine">off with incredible speed. Its immense wings,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which when quiescent I had taken for the spatu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">late leaves of a strange subterranean plant, whirred so</seg><seg type="columnLine">rapidly that they were invisible. The creature itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">greatly resembled a titanic dragon fly, with its massive</seg><seg type="columnLine">head, great bulging eyes, and long, relatively slender</seg><seg type="columnLine">body. It flew at an elevation of about a thousand feet,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and watching the ground, I calculated that it was carry-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing us at a speed of over a hundred miles an hour.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Clinging to the rim of the huge segment with one</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, and gripping the round body with both legs, I</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the rapidly changing landscape beneath us.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Presently, all signs of vegetation ceased, and we were</seg><seg type="columnLine">flying over a barren, gleaming white area of dunes and</seg><seg type="columnLine">hollows.</seg><seg type="columnLine">358</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  On the next segment in front, Dolores was clinging</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tightly with hands and arms, and I noticed that she,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">too, was anxiously watching the landscape below. I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shouted to her, but she could not hear me because of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">whirring of the huge wings. And I could not creep</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">nearer to her without danger of losing my grip on our</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">living aircraft and pitching to sudden death below.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  So occupied was I in watching the landscape beneath</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that I did not notice the immense black thing, flashing</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">downward at us from above, until it struck. Huge teeth</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sunk into the thorax of the giant dragon fly, just back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the head. Its wings quivered, then hung limply. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">..was a swift, clean kill. We were borne swiftly aloft</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in a steep spiral and I had an opportunity to observe</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the thing that was carrying us. It was an immense,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">black-skinned hairless bat. The body of the insect</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">trailed almost vertically, making it much more diffi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cult to hang on than when it had been flying hori-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">zontally. It appeared that the giant bat had not even</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">noticed us, taking us for part of its victim's body.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  As we spiraled higher and higher, the light grew</seg><seg type="columnLine">stronger above us, while the outlines of the ground be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">low became more and more blurred and indistinct.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Up and up we went through the drifting, diaphanous</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mists until we were just under the luminous dome of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">this weird nether world, fully five miles above the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ground. My eyes were dazzled by the brightness of the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rugged, luminous, and probably radioactive stone that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">formed the vault.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The bat hovered for a moment beneath a huge jagged</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">opening in the dome. As it did so I saw that there were</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a number of similar openings nearby. Then it flew</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">upward and to one side, alighting in a self-illuminated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cave about a hundred feet square.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  I wondered why the monster had not devoured its</seg><seg type="columnLine">victim on the wing as outer world bats habitually do, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">I realized the reason when two of its offspring, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">had been hanging upside down from a ledge at the back</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the cave, fluttered to the floor and rushed toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">parent, screeching and flapping excitedly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The adult bat laid the insect on the floor with us</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">still clinging to it, then turned and dived back through</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the opening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Judging by the size of the parent, the two youngsters</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">that were rushing toward us were about a quarter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">grown. But this did not prevent them from being ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ceedingly formidable antagonists, for each stood more</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">than ten feet in height, and was armed with long sharp</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">teeth as well as wicked looking claws on wing joints and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">hind feet. Dolores and I both sprang to our feet and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">backed away as they pounced on the insect and began</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">feeding voraciously, as if each feared that it would get</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">less than the other would.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  My first impulse was to look for some way of escape</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">while the two immense youngsters were occupied with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">their feast. Bidding Dolores secrete herself behind one</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">of the boulders that cluttered the floor, I made a care-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ful search, circling behind the young bats and return-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing in front of them. They watched me with their black,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">beady eyes, but evidently did not think me quite as</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tempting a morsel as the insect.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Having assured myself that there was no way out of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the cave except that by which we had come, I returned</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the boulder with the beady eyes of the bats still fol-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">lowing me as they finished the remains of the ill-fated</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">dragon fly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Our situation appeared utterly hopeless. There we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were, five miles above the surface of the nether world,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and we knew not how many uncounted miles below the</seg><seg type="columnLine">surface of the earth, imprisoned with two hungry beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">larger and more formidable than the greatest of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outer world carnivora. Moreover, we might expect at</seg><seg type="columnLine">any moment, the arrival of one or both of the parents--</seg><seg type="columnLine">creatures four times as large as the ones we now faced.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There seemed little question but that the young bats</seg><seg type="columnLine">would attack us, and that was quickly resolved, for as</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as they had finished their feast and licked their</seg><seg type="columnLine">chops for a moment, they came hopping and flapping to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With Lak's paralyzing ray cylinder in my left hand,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his burning rod in my right, I leaped up on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">boulder, behind which Dolores crouched.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As soon as they were within striking distance, both</seg><seg type="columnLine">of them reached out to seize me, whereupon I held the</seg><seg type="columnLine">one 011 my left with the paralyzing ray and lunged at</seg><seg type="columnLine">the other with the burning rod. I struck for the eye,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but the beast dodged and the point seared itself into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hunched shoulder, instead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a siren-like shriek of rage and pain the burned</seg><seg type="columnLine">creature jerked back out of reach of the point, toppled</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the edge of the entrance for a moment, and then</seg><seg type="columnLine">fell, squawking and fluttering, down the steep shaft.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As it had not learned to fly, it was undoubtedly dashed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to pieces on the ground five miles below. At any rate,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I did not see it again.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The other young bat, held by the powerful paralyzing</seg><seg type="columnLine">ray, stood helplessly while I plunged the point of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning rod into its heart. Then, as I withdrew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rod and shut off the ray, a shudder ran through its frame</seg><seg type="columnLine">and it toppled over on its back, dead.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">ALTHOUGH we had vanquished our immediate ene-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mies, we were a long way from being out of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">predicament.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolores came out from behind the boulder, and to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether we examined the fallen monster.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently she said:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Tell me the truth, Wallace. Is there no way out?</seg><seg type="columnLine">No hope of escape?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'm afraid not," I replied.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then we are to die here together. It doesn't matter</seg><seg type="columnLine">how. We'll be slain by the mother bat when she returns,</seg><seg type="columnLine">or perhaps by her mate. Even if you conquer both</seg><seg type="columnLine">monsters with the weapons of Lak, we're trapped here</seg><seg type="columnLine">to die of hunger and thirst. In one case it will be a</seg><seg type="columnLine">matter of a few hours, the other a few days. Am I</seg><seg type="columnLine">not right?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It looks that way," I replied, kicking absently at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tip of one of the webbed wings, my head turned away to</seg><seg type="columnLine">hide my feelings.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wallace! Look at me!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I turned, and she came up very close, her glorious face</seg><seg type="columnLine">upturned to mine.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Wallace, isn't there something you would like to say</seg><seg type="columnLine">to me before we--are taken by death?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was that in her eyes which sent the hot blood</seg><seg type="columnLine">coursing through my veins, and made me forget the peril</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which we stood. The burning rod clattered to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor of the cave as I crushed her to me--claimed her</seg><seg type="columnLine">sweet lips.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "But, Wallace. You have said nothing," she panted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I can't make you pretty speeches," I replied, "nor can</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE METAL MONSTER</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">359</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">I croon sweet love songs. But I love you, Dolores. You</seg><seg type="columnLine">know that now."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I have known it all along," she confessed, "but I</seg><seg type="columnLine">wanted to hear you say it. Dios, how I love you, my</seg><seg type="columnLine">big American! And we are to die so soon."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Her arms went around my neck--clung there, and she</seg><seg type="columnLine">buried her face in my shoulder, weeping softly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Desperately I looked about me. There must be a way</seg><seg type="columnLine">out. I must think. I must plan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Suddenly an idea came to me.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Don't cry, dear," I said. "I think I've hit on a plan."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What is it?" she asked eagerly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "There is enough material in the webbed wing of that</seg><seg type="columnLine">young bat to make a parachute that will carry us both</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the ground," I said, "and I'm going to try to make</seg><seg type="columnLine">one."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I'll help you," she replied. "Let's work fast. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">mother bat may come back at any moment."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Using Lak's keen, two-edged chopper, I quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">severed the immense wings from the body. In the</seg><seg type="columnLine">webs there was material enough for our purpose, and to</seg><seg type="columnLine">spare. I cut a number of long strips to serve as rope,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and with these, Dolores stitched the larger pieces to-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gether, punching the holes with the tip of the burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">rod.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> When I had exhausted the supply of web which we</seg><seg type="columnLine">could spare for this purpose, I skinned the immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">carcass, and cut the hide into strips two inches in</seg><seg type="columnLine">width. I fastened the ends of these around the edge of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the parachute, while Dolores finished her job of fasten-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the larger pieces together.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This work completed I drew all of our guy straps</seg><seg type="columnLine">together, and tied them to a ring-strap, cut trebly wide</seg><seg type="columnLine">that it might stand the extra strain. To this I added</seg><seg type="columnLine">a strong loop on each side, forming a swing seat for each</seg><seg type="columnLine">of us, and we stepped back to view the result of our</seg><seg type="columnLine">labor.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It appeared exceeding crude and awkward, but it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be strong enough.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Are you ready to make the jump?" I asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I slipped the loop of her swing strap around her, cau-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tioning her to hold on with both hands.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We'll drag the whole thing clear up to the edge," I</seg><seg type="columnLine">said, "then jump out away from the ledge as far as pos-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sible. Otherwise the 'chute may catch on the edge and</seg><seg type="columnLine">swing us back against the face of the rock."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Luck had favored us thus far by the prolonged ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sence of the mother bat, and I wondered, as I arranged</seg><seg type="columnLine">the folds of the 'chute on the rim of the abyss, if it</seg><seg type="columnLine">would fail us now.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For a moment I strained Dolores to me in a farewell</seg><seg type="columnLine">kiss. Then I caught up the burning rod, and with a:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"one, two, three!" we leaped.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For several seconds we hurtled downward at a breath-</seg><seg type="columnLine">taking speed. The walls of the shaft vanished, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were shooting down through the mists of the nether</seg><seg type="columnLine">world sky, our speed unslackened. "It hasn't opened,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">I thought. "We're doomed." But even as this thought</seg><seg type="columnLine">came to me, the guy straps suddenly tightened with a</seg><seg type="columnLine">jerk. One of them snapped and fell down, trailing its</seg><seg type="columnLine">wet inner surface over my shoulder. Our speed slack-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ened. A few seconds more, and we were gliding smooth-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ly downward. The immense web that had been designed</seg><seg type="columnLine">to support the huge body of the bat in flight easily</seg><seg type="columnLine">sustained us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">A CRY of exultation came to my lips, but it quickly</seg><seg type="columnLine">changed to an exclamation of horror as I sud-</seg><seg type="columnLine">denly saw, flapping toward us, the immense black bulk</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the mother bat. She was carrying a huge beetle in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her mouth, but dropped it as she came closer and</seg><seg type="columnLine">scented the hide of her dead offspring. With a horrible</seg><seg type="columnLine">shriek, more powerful and ear-splitting than the sound</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a steam siren, she dived straight at us, her immense</seg><seg type="columnLine">maw gaping, her lips drawn back in a hideous snarl that</seg><seg type="columnLine">revealed her big, ugly teeth.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I whipped the paralyzing ray cylinder from my belt,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and gripped both it and the strap at my left with my left</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand, while I couched the burning rod beneath my right</seg><seg type="columnLine">arm. I had my misgivings as to whether or not the rays</seg><seg type="columnLine">would have any effect on so huge a bulk, but it was our</seg><seg type="columnLine">only hope.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> To my surprise and relief, it worked. The giant bat,</seg><seg type="columnLine">unable to move her wings, turned over and began hurt-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ling groundward in a nose dive. But she had not fallen</seg><seg type="columnLine">far before the rays ceased to affect her, whereupon she</seg><seg type="columnLine">righted herself and came back at us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Again I turned the rays on her and again she</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged downward, only to right herself and come back</seg><seg type="columnLine">as fiercely as ever. She repeated the process persis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tently, and to my horror I noticed that she was able to</seg><seg type="columnLine">get a little closer each time. The battery was growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">weaker.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Presently she came so close that I thrust the burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">rod into her mouth. With a snarl, she clamped her huge</seg><seg type="columnLine">teeth down on it, snapping the metal shaft as if it had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been matchwood. She opened her mouth once more and</seg><seg type="columnLine">shook her head, attempting to dislodge the searing point,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it had already passed her throat, and was burning</seg><seg type="columnLine">its way down into her vitals.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> With a horrid, gurgling scream, she went into her last</seg><seg type="columnLine">nose dive, falling like a plummet. I saw her strike the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground several seconds later, but we were drifting in an</seg><seg type="columnLine">air current that had, in the meantime, carried us some</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance to one side. I noticed for the first time that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we were above a huge expanse of glistening, barren</seg><seg type="columnLine">white dunes. A short time thereafter we alighted, sink-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to our ankles in a substance which I readily recog-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nized--the white crystals which my Tek had been load-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing these many days, to be hauled to the smelter. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the material from which the Snals manufactured their</seg><seg type="columnLine">miraculously hard metal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Disentangling ourselves from our straps, we set out</seg><seg type="columnLine">over the rolling dunes. As all directions were alike to</seg><seg type="columnLine">us, we set our faces toward what looked like a rugged</seg><seg type="columnLine">mountain range, some of the jagged peaks of which</seg><seg type="columnLine">pierced the clouds. Our water supply had dwindled to</seg><seg type="columnLine">a swallow apiece. And we were ravenously hungry.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For hour after hour, we plunged onward, through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">weird light of the changeless day. We stopped once,</seg><seg type="columnLine">exhausted, and slept for twelve hours by my chrono-</seg><seg type="columnLine">meter. Upon awakening, we drained our water flasks,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pressed forward once more. But so great was the</seg><seg type="columnLine">distance of these mountains, which at first had only</seg><seg type="columnLine">seemed a few miles away, that they appeared to recede</seg><seg type="columnLine">as we advanced toward them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another four hours of walking, however, made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outlines of the mountains bulk much nearer. And where</seg><seg type="columnLine">there are mountains, there are usually springs or</seg><seg type="columnLine">streams. After a brief rest, we set forth once more.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But it was not long before Dolores staggered and fell.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I tried to pick her up, and fell beside her. My strength</seg><seg type="columnLine">360</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">was fast waning. I tried to murmur a few words of en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">couragement to her, but my lips were dry--my tongue</seg><seg type="columnLine">so swollen that they sounded like the muttering of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">drunken man. It did not matter, however, as she had</seg><seg type="columnLine">swooned away.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After a brief breathing spell, I arose, and taking</seg><seg type="columnLine">Dolores in my arms, proceeded, carefully conserving</seg><seg type="columnLine">my strength and pausing at short intervals to rest.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We were less than a mile from the nearest mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">when Dolores regained consciousness. She immediately</seg><seg type="columnLine">insisted that I set her on her feet.

The clanking sound was</seg><seg type="columnLine">caused by the long, segmented cable it had dropped.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Down this cable swarmed a score of Teks.

"Into the water."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> We turned and ran, splashing through the heavy</seg><seg type="columnLine">brine. A few steps, and it reached our waists. The Teks</seg><seg type="columnLine">splashed in after us. The circle was closing in at both</seg><seg type="columnLine">ends.

Above the spot the water</seg><seg type="columnLine">effervesced like champagne.

"Come on."</seg><seg type="columnLine">She came up beside me, but scarcely had she done so</seg><seg type="columnLine">ere the cable swiftly wrapped around both of us, jerking</seg><seg type="columnLine">us up through the round door.

The</seg><seg type="columnLine">rays which emanated from it must have been effective</seg><seg type="columnLine">only for a short distance, for, though they made the</seg><seg type="columnLine">globe appear transparent, everything beyond it looked</seg><seg type="columnLine">perfectly natural. Looking downward through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">floor, I saw that we were above a jungle of primordial</seg><seg type="columnLine">growths. I was gazing at the queer plants and beasts</seg><seg type="columnLine">beneath us, when Dolores suddenly cried:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "A globe pursues us! We are discovered!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Slow up and let it come close to us," I said.

The other globe shot swiftly up behind</seg><seg type="columnLine">us.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I lurched over to the door and grasped the rail beside</seg><seg type="columnLine">it, holding the flask poised in my other hand.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All right," I shouted.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door swung open. The other globe was now less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than fifty feet from us. I hurled the flask and had the</seg><seg type="columnLine">satisfaction of seeing it break against the pursuing globe,</seg><seg type="columnLine">scattering its contents over the gleaming surface.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The door clanged shut, but I continued to watch the</seg><seg type="columnLine">pursuing globe by means of my penetrating head light.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A sputtering white patch instantly appeared where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">brine had struck. Soon this was replaced by a gaping</seg><seg type="columnLine">hole with rapidly widening white edges, from which</seg><seg type="columnLine">fluffy crystals were flaking.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolores accelerated our speed and shot upward. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">other globe attempted to follow, but it was rapidly losing</seg><seg type="columnLine">power. Soon more than half of its surface had disap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared, exposing its mechanism and inner room, swarm-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing with Teks. Another moment, and it hurtled ground-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, burying itself in the soft muck of the swamp.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DOLORES straightened our course once more</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ahead of us lay the metal city to which we had</seg><seg type="columnLine">first been brought--the capital of the nether world. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">about five miles to our right was a great cone of lava</seg><seg type="columnLine">nearly two miles high. Above this cone was the gleam-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing mouth of a metal shaft which thousands of globes</seg><seg type="columnLine">were constantly entering and leaving.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Steer for the shaft," I said. "Perhaps we can bluff</seg><seg type="columnLine">our way through to the outer world. They can't tell</seg><seg type="columnLine">who is in this globe, can they ?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not unless they use the penetrating rays," she re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">plied, "and they can only do that at close range. I don't</seg><seg type="columnLine">think we can make our way through. However, Zet will</seg><seg type="columnLine">expect us to try, and will be prepared."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Then we'll try another way," I said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A moment later wre plunged into the shaft--shot</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly upward. The speed of the globe was terrific.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had no means of computing it. And because of this,</seg><seg type="columnLine">I had no idea how many miles of shaft we had traversed</seg><seg type="columnLine">when we suddenly shot up beneath the huge metal dome</seg><seg type="columnLine">that covered Coseguina.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Dolores brought the globe almost to a stop--hover-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing uncertainly.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now where?" she asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I recalled my two visions of this dome--the first when</seg><seg type="columnLine">it w^as in the process of building--the second after it</seg><seg type="columnLine">was completed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Not the ports," I said. "They'll surely catch us</seg><seg type="columnLine">there. Fly close to the wall."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> She instantly brought the globe to within ten feet of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the arching wall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Open the door."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the door flew open I hurled my flask of salt water</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the wall. The flask shattered, spreading the brine</seg><seg type="columnLine">over an area about ten feet in diameter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another globe, apparently noting our strange actions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">shot upward toward us to investigate. Dolores saw it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">closed the door, and flew away, circling the huge dome.</seg><seg type="columnLine">A second globe rose to cut us off. Then a third and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fourth. Dolores managed, somehow, to dodge all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">them. Soon the dome swarmed with flying globes, all of</seg><seg type="columnLine">which looked alike. We were darting in and out among</seg><seg type="columnLine">the others, and I doubt wrhether more than one or two</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their pilots had any idea which globe we were in.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Several globes collided, bouncing apart like billiard balls,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but undented and apparently unharmed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Twice we flew past the rapidly widening hole in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dome where I had hurled the salt water, but each time</seg><seg type="columnLine">it was too small for us to squeeze through. Then we</seg><seg type="columnLine">were herded away from it by the other globes for several</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes. By dint of much skillful manipulation on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">part of Dolores, we managed to get back to it. This time</seg><seg type="columnLine">there was room to spare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "At last!" I cried, as we shot out into the sunlight</seg><seg type="columnLine">which we had not seen for more than two months.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Beautiful, isn't it?" said Dolores. "Now where shall</seg><seg type="columnLine">we go?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Get some altitude," I replied. "Then we'll look</seg><seg type="columnLine">around. We must find a place to hide, first of all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Far out on the Pacific, I saw a rain storm coming.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Quick !" I said. "Into that storm!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A long trail of globes was after us, and more were</seg><seg type="columnLine">continually emerging from the dome like a cloud of</seg><seg type="columnLine">angry wasps. We plunged toward the storm. In less</seg><seg type="columnLine">than two minutes we were in it. At least a thousand</seg><seg type="columnLine">globes were on our trail by that time, but once we got</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the thick clouds, they could not see us, nor we them.</seg><seg type="columnLine">We veered off sharply to the right, traveling at tremen-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dous speed.

She pressed the lever that opened the</seg><seg type="columnLine">door, and I leaned out gripping the hand rail. Then the</seg><seg type="columnLine">submarine just beneath us began to rise. Presently its</seg><seg type="columnLine">tower emerged from the water. Then up came its tur-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rets, rails and deck. A hatch swung open, and two</seg><seg type="columnLine">men came out. One wore the uniform of a U. S. na-</seg><seg type="columnLine">val officer. The other was in civilian clothes. To my</seg><seg type="columnLine">surprise I recognized my former assistant, Pat Hig-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gins.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Pat!"

The effervescing</seg><seg type="columnLine">is caused by the escaping hydrogen displaced by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sodium as it unites with the water to form sodium</seg><seg type="columnLine">hydroxide. It is plain that but very small quantities of</seg><seg type="columnLine">of chlorine are necessary for the conversion of large</seg><seg type="columnLine">areas of metal.

Earth and Hell--the top deck</seg><seg type="columnLine">was Heaven, where everyone possessed all that he could</seg><seg type="columnLine">desire, the middle deck, earth, where the employees of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Airships Company and the lower class passengers had</seg><seg type="columnLine">quarters; and the interior, hell, where the slaves labored</seg><seg type="columnLine">like black and grimy demons.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ship followed fast in the track of the departing</seg><seg type="columnLine">sun but not even in the thousands of years that had</seg><seg type="columnLine">passed since man first learned to fly had airships reached</seg><seg type="columnLine">a speed sufficient to equal that of dawn or sunset. So in</seg><seg type="columnLine">an hour or two darkness overtook the ship. Brilliant</seg><seg type="columnLine">lights were switched on and the gaiety on the upper</seg><seg type="columnLine">deck continued unabated.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> An hour or two after dark the lights were suddenly</seg><seg type="columnLine">extinguished and at the same time the speed of the ship</seg><seg type="columnLine">was greatly increased. A murmur of surprise and</seg><seg type="columnLine">consternation swept through the passengers. What</seg><seg type="columnLine">could be the cause of such unusual procedure? Soon</seg><seg type="columnLine">the word was passed around that a suspicious-looking</seg><seg type="columnLine">ship, which refused to answer any radio signals, had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been sighted by the lookout. The radio operators had</seg><seg type="columnLine">immediately attempted to send word to the patrolling</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruisers of the Airships Company, but the strange craft</seg><seg type="columnLine">had set up a field of artificially produced electrical waves</seg><seg type="columnLine">that prevented any intelligible messages from either being</seg><seg type="columnLine">sent or coming through. The passengers were advised</seg><seg type="columnLine">to go below to their cabins and the Myrmidons were</seg><seg type="columnLine">ordered to their combat posts.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The strange ship, at first barely visible in the light of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">rising moon, approached rapidly. There was the report</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a gun from its forward deck and a phosphorous shell</seg><seg type="columnLine">burst across the bows of the liner. This was the inter-</seg><seg type="columnLine">national signal to heave to. The liner answered by a</seg><seg type="columnLine">broadside of all its available guns. Several of the shells</seg><seg type="columnLine">were seen to burst on the strange craft, which could now</seg><seg type="columnLine">be made out as a swift cruiser.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It soon became clear in the struggle that followed that</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cruiser was to have much the best of it. It moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">almost two feet to the liner's one. It maneuvered more</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly and easily, and most important of all, it was</seg><seg type="columnLine">evidently commanded by an expert in aerial warfare.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The liner dropped, rose, circled and dipped--all to no</seg><seg type="columnLine">avail. The cruiser quickly obtained a commanding po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sition above it, and swooped low over it, raking its decks</seg><seg type="columnLine">with gunfire. It was evident that they disdained to drop</seg><seg type="columnLine">bombs.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few of the passengers on the upper deck had ne-</seg><seg type="columnLine">glected to obey the advice to seek the safety of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cabins and now stood watching the conflict from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">partial shelter of companion way entrances and cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAID OF THE MERCURY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">367</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">doors. One of these was a young man dressed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">white robe with a purple border, which proclaimed him</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be of the highest rank. He had taken no part in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dancing and flirting which had occupied most of the pas-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sengers. At the time the lights were extinguished he had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been dictating to an enormous slave amenuensis. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">soon as he heard the explanation for putting the ship in</seg><seg type="columnLine">preparedness for battle, he had taken shelter in a cabin</seg><seg type="columnLine">doorway and remained an interested but imperturbable</seg><seg type="columnLine">spectator. Occasionally he made some observation on</seg><seg type="columnLine">the trend of events, seeming to speak rather to himself</seg><seg type="columnLine">than to the slave. Now, as it became apparent that the</seg><seg type="columnLine">keel guns of the cruiser were making it impossible for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the defenders to remain at their guns, he muttered to</seg><seg type="columnLine">himself, "The captain is a fool. If he keeps this up he</seg><seg type="columnLine">will soon have no men left at all. His only chance is to</seg><seg type="columnLine">order his men into shelter in hopes that the pirates will</seg><seg type="columnLine">be foolish enough to board."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Seeing the captain in the shelter of a hatch some dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tance away, he coolly walked across the deck, disregard-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the fact that he was exposed to a very dangerous fire,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and communicated this observation to him. The captain</seg><seg type="columnLine">received his advice with great respect and acted on it</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once. The Myrmidons were ordered to leave the guns</seg><seg type="columnLine">and conceal themselves as best they might about the deck.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The sudden cessation of fire evidently puzzled the</seg><seg type="columnLine">attacking ship. It circled low over the liner in an attempt</seg><seg type="columnLine">to find the cause for the sudden abandonment of the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fense, and, apparently satisfied that the defenders were</seg><seg type="columnLine">practically routed, it finally came alongside and began to</seg><seg type="columnLine">land a boarding party. The young man, who, by the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacit assent of the captain, seemed to have taken com-</seg><seg type="columnLine">mand of the defense of the liner, coolly waited until a</seg><seg type="columnLine">fair half of the boarding party had reached the deck and</seg><seg type="columnLine">then ordered the vertical propellers reversed, which</seg><seg type="columnLine">course violently wrenched the two ships apart, dropping</seg><seg type="columnLine">the liner a thousand feet or more. This course was</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleverly calculated to maroon the attackers so that they</seg><seg type="columnLine">might be overwhelmed before assistance could reach them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">-	But the attackers showed their mettle. Instead of</seg><seg type="columnLine">waiting to be rushed by the Myrmidons, who were now</seg><seg type="columnLine">coming out of their hiding places, the others took the</seg><seg type="columnLine">initiative. Lead by a fair-haired, blue-eyed, young man</seg><seg type="columnLine">they rushed forward to the attack. Armed with the long</seg><seg type="columnLine">slightly curved swords, suitable for either cutting or</seg><seg type="columnLine">thrusiirx. which the experience of thousands of years</seg><seg type="columnLine">had shown to be man's most formidable weapon for</seg><seg type="columnLine">hand-to-hand fighting, they surged forward in a shouting,</seg><seg type="columnLine">whoop:cheering mass. The impetuosity of their</seg><seg type="columnLine">charge swept all before it for a time. The Myrmidons</seg><seg type="columnLine">were caught separated in small groups and were cut</seg><seg type="columnLine">separate';--. The sword play of the leader of the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">vaders was a fearful and beautiful thing to see. Dressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the she rt belted tunic which is the uniform of all atmen,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and which admirably set off his perfection of bodily</seg><seg type="columnLine">strength, he moved among the defenders like a raging</seg><seg type="columnLine">god. Broad shouldered, deep chested, slender of waist</seg><seg type="columnLine">and hips, muscular of arm and leg, quick and graceful</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a leaping panther, his blade was repeatedly dyed with</seg><seg type="columnLine">the blood of the defenders. Using edge and point with</seg><seg type="columnLine">equal skill, he alternately beat down the guard of some</seg><seg type="columnLine">stalwart Myrmidon by brute force and then, pausing</seg><seg type="columnLine">only long enough to wrench his blade free, he would use</seg><seg type="columnLine">superior skill and speed to thrust the point deep into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">body of another. His blue eyes flashed with cold fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">and his lips were slightly curved in a mocking smile.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> That he was not unknown to the defenders was shown</seg><seg type="columnLine">by an observation the leader of the defense made to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">captain.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It is Prince James and his 'revolutionaries/" he</seg><seg type="columnLine">calmly remarked. "I thought as much after I saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">skill with which the cruiser was handled. By Midas, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">is a noble fighting man!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Another passenger also was watching the leader of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the invaders. She was a tall slender girl; who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">sheltered deep in the entrance of a cabin door. Evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently of the highest rank, she was accompanied by two</seg><seg type="columnLine">or three slave girls who incessantly begged her to take</seg><seg type="columnLine">refuge in the depths of the ship. She refused.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I must see this," she said. "It is James and the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cruiser is the Mercury, I am sure. Is he not handsome,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Esmeralda? And he plays his part like a true man.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Had he but written me what he intended, I would have</seg><seg type="columnLine">come to his side, though he had been pronounced traitor</seg><seg type="columnLine">and pirate by all the nations on earth!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Meanwhile the fight had commenced to go against the</seg><seg type="columnLine">young atman and his followers. The leader of the de-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fense had coolly allowed several groups of the defenders</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be routed in order to give him time to organize the</seg><seg type="columnLine">rest. Now this had been done and two cohorts were at-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tacking the invaders directly from the front, while sharp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">shooters and rapid-fire gunners poured in a destructive</seg><seg type="columnLine">hail of shot from the flanks.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The leader of the defenders, himself apparently un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">armed and taking no personal part in the struggle,</seg><seg type="columnLine">watched the consummation of his wise plans with con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">siderable pleasure. The invaders seemed to be on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">verge of being wiped out. But he had counted without</seg><seg type="columnLine">the interference from the cruiser. This ship now re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">entered the battle. It took up a position directly above</seg><seg type="columnLine">the liner and sprayed its decks with its keel rapid-fire</seg><seg type="columnLine">guns. The gunners on the lower ship were unable to</seg><seg type="columnLine">damage the cruiser from the bottom, as it was here that</seg><seg type="columnLine">its protective armor was thickest, and were soon forced</seg><seg type="columnLine">to desert their posts. The captain dropped, dipped,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and whirled his ship as rapidly as possible, in a mad</seg><seg type="columnLine">attempt to dislodge the cruiser from its commanding po-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sition, but in vain. The cruiser could maneuver much</seg><seg type="columnLine">more easily and it stuck to its position like a mongoose</seg><seg type="columnLine">to the neck of a cobra.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The defenders went down like grain before the reaper.</seg><seg type="columnLine">The passenger, who had assumed command, saw the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hopelessness of the situation and himself ran up the</seg><seg type="columnLine">white flag to the masthead and ordered the few remain-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing defenders to throw down their arms.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The young atman of the invaders took command of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ship and slowly dropped it to the ground. A few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes later the cruiser landed beside it. The field</seg><seg type="columnLine">where they landed was part of a boundless plain in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">middle west. Like almost all of the country, since men</seg><seg type="columnLine">had learned to make their food in factories, it was ab-</seg><seg type="columnLine">solutely void of all human occupation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The lights were switched on. The crew of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Mercury (which name could now be made out on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hull of the cruiser) methodically searched the liner, re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">moving whatever they wanted in the way of food, am-</seg><seg type="columnLine">munition, clothes or other stores. On deck the atman</seg><seg type="columnLine">who had now been joined by a short thickset man,</seg><seg type="columnLine">dressed in the uniform of a chief gunner, who was evi-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dently his second in command, ordered the passengers</seg><seg type="columnLine">and crew of the Light of the Western Skies lined up</seg><seg type="columnLine">for inspection.</seg><seg type="columnLine">368</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As he walked slowly down the line, he saw the leader</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the defenders and stopped with a cry of surprise.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well," he said in a cold voice, "this is a piece of</seg><seg type="columnLine">luck. Lothaire, Prince of the Second Cycle, Vice-Pon-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiff of the Plutocracy. Who would have suspected that</seg><seg type="columnLine">you would fall into my hands? We have a few scores</seg><seg type="columnLine">to settle, Prince. Do you remember when you led the</seg><seg type="columnLine">armies of the Plutocracy against my estates in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">South? My father and sister were killed in the sack of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the 'Town of the Oaks' and it was you who commanded</seg><seg type="columnLine">the troops. I am very glad to see you again, Prince."</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then turning to his second in command he continued,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"Say you not so, Aurelius? You were present at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">sack of the 'Town of the Oaks/"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Aye, Prince," was the reply. "He is the ablest devil</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the council of Midas, or in the whole administration</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Plutocracy."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The person, addressed as Lothaire, replied calmly and</seg><seg type="columnLine">haughtily. "What I did then I did as the servant of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Plutocracy and I am not ashamed of it. You brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">your fate upon yourself. You might have stood high</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the councils of the Plutocracy. None had a better</seg><seg type="columnLine">chance. You had youth, ability, great wealth, and a</seg><seg type="columnLine">great name. But you preferred to espouse the cause of</seg><seg type="columnLine">'the people' as you call it, and see what it has bought</seg><seg type="columnLine">you"--the speaker gestured toward a placard that was</seg><seg type="columnLine">fastened to an adjacent wind-screen--"there is a price</seg><seg type="columnLine">on your head. That poster offers a reward for your</seg><seg type="columnLine">capture. The Grand Council of the Plutocracy has for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">feited your estates. The name of James Lancaster,</seg><seg type="columnLine">Prince of the Second Cycle, is now coupled -with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">terms traitor and pirate. Even at the present moment</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ships of the Plutocracy are probably closing in on</seg><seg type="columnLine">you to mete out the fate you deserve."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Prince James flushed violently, and started with rage,</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the word traitor, but he controlled himself, scorning</seg><seg type="columnLine">to strike a prisoner, and said with a slight smile, "Thanks</seg><seg type="columnLine">for reminding me of that fact, Prince." Then to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">second in command, "Aurelius, send out ten scouts in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the gliders. Let them cover every direction and report</seg><seg type="columnLine">the approach of any ship." Turning back to the prisoner,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he continued, "You shall answer for your words as</seg><seg type="columnLine">well as your deeds, Lothaire. It ill becomes you, who</seg><seg type="columnLine">are known as the most coldly cruel general of the Pluto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracy, to cast epithets at others. You know that you</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been tried and condemned by the Black Groups.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What if I turned you over to them for execution? But</seg><seg type="columnLine">more of this later."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Continuing his inspection of the prisoners, he came</seg><seg type="columnLine">to where stood the girl who had spoken of him to her</seg><seg type="columnLine">maid. On seeing her, his face lit up with pleasure and</seg><seg type="columnLine">he rushed forward saying. "Avice, you in America!</seg><seg type="columnLine">Why didn't you answer my letters ? I thought you must</seg><seg type="columnLine">have thrown me over as most of my friends did when</seg><seg type="columnLine">I espoused the cause of the people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then as the girl did not move, he said anxiously.</seg><seg type="columnLine">"You haven't, have you?"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You wrote, James?" the girl asked. "I never re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ceived your letters. They must have been intercepted by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the secret agents of the Plutocracy. I know that I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been watched. I thought that you had deserted me. And</seg><seg type="columnLine">so I came to America to see. But, James, you need never</seg><seg type="columnLine">be afraid of being thrown over by me. It was I who in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">duced your father to suggest our engagement. I have</seg><seg type="columnLine">loved you since we used to play together as little children</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the Villa Cumberland."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Thank God," he said and caught her in his arms as</seg><seg type="columnLine">though he would never let her go.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Prince Lothaire watched this scene with the keenest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">r</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">interest, and, as it attracted the attention of the guards</seg><seg type="columnLine">from him, he moved to take advantage of it. The one-</seg><seg type="columnLine">man gliders that James had ordered sent out were now</seg><seg type="columnLine">poised on the deck of the liner ready to take off. Lothaire</seg><seg type="columnLine">took a step or two forward and clapped one of the men,</seg><seg type="columnLine">who was just about to take off in a glider, on the shoul-</seg><seg type="columnLine">der in a friendly way, saying, "Hello, Anderson."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The man, thinking he was mistaken for another,</seg><seg type="columnLine">turned unguardedly. Lothaire seized a dagger from his</seg><seg type="columnLine">belt, and with the smooth speed of a striking snake,</seg><seg type="columnLine">plunged it up to the hilt into the man's body. Then, be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">fore the already lifeless body could fall, he had moved</seg><seg type="columnLine">behind the man and on to the glider. Starting the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">but'efficient motor, with which it was equipped, he slip-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ped over the side of the liner and plunged toward the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground to gather speed quickly. He straightened out so</seg><seg type="columnLine">close to the ground as to brush the grass, then keeping</seg><seg type="columnLine">the liner between himself and the guns of the cruiser,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was off like an arrow.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The consummate coolness and cunning of his escape</seg><seg type="columnLine">left his captors so astounded that no effective action was</seg><seg type="columnLine">taken until too late. A few hasty and ill-directed shots</seg><seg type="columnLine">were fired and the other gliders left in quick pursuit, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">the darkness of the night and the almost absolute silence</seg><seg type="columnLine">with which the glider moved prevented any real hope</seg><seg type="columnLine">of success.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> James was plainly worried by this successful escape of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the prisoner. He turned to his second in command:</seg><seg type="columnLine">"How soon can we leave, Aurelius? Lothaire will have</seg><seg type="columnLine">the cruisers of the Plutocracy about our ears in an hour</seg><seg type="columnLine">at the latest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It will take at least half an hour to transfer the</seg><seg type="columnLine">stores we need, Prince. "Then, too, one of their shells has</seg><seg type="columnLine">damaged the port horizontal propeller and that will</seg><seg type="columnLine">cut down our speed considerably."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "It was certainly an unfortunate escape," said James,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"for we are sure to have to encounter Lothaire again</seg><seg type="columnLine">later. But"--here he smiled at A vice--"no day on which</seg><seg type="columnLine">I find you again could be anything but supremely happy,</seg><seg type="columnLine">no matter what else occurred."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The girl smiled happily. "Tell me about yourself,</seg><seg type="columnLine">James," she said. "It is two years since I saw you,</seg><seg type="columnLine">you know, and then I had no idea that you were to be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come a famous revolutionary. You were interested in</seg><seg type="columnLine">sports and aviation then, instead of political affairs.</seg><seg type="columnLine">What caused this change? Was it your father? I</seg><seg type="columnLine">remember he wrote several books dealing with the in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">justice of slavery and the rights of the people."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Yes, it was my father," he said. "You see, he didn't</seg><seg type="columnLine">stop at writing. He made speeches and had them broad-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cast to the four corners of the world. The Plutocracy</seg><seg type="columnLine">didn't like his books, but, he was an independent prince</seg><seg type="columnLine">so they let him alone, but when he began to have his</seg><seg type="columnLine">speeches broadcast to the slaves and people, they sent</seg><seg type="columnLine">to arrest him. As an independent prince, he refused to</seg><seg type="columnLine">be arrested. Then they sent an army and surrounded</seg><seg type="columnLine">him in the 'Town of the Oaks.' I was on a hunting trip</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the west and didn't hear about it until after it was too</seg><seg type="columnLine">late. Aurelius was there and he tells me they put up a</seg><seg type="columnLine">gallant defense. Except for Lothaire's skill and cun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ning, they would have escaped. Dad, who had never</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a sword in his hand before in his life, died in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">breach in the town wall. When it became evident that</seg><seg type="columnLine">THE RAID OF THE MERCURY</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">369</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">the town was to be sacked, Mary, my sister, took poison.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Aurelius was wounded and left for dead. He was saved</seg><seg type="columnLine">by some former slaves that father had freed. They tried</seg><seg type="columnLine">to get me, too, when I came back from my hunting trip,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but some member of the Black Groups warned me and</seg><seg type="columnLine">I got away on the yacht. It was then I swore vengeance</seg><seg type="columnLine">on the Plutocracy and Lothaire. I turned the yacht</seg><seg type="columnLine">into a cruiser, manned it with the slaves Dad had freed</seg><seg type="columnLine">and who remained faithful, and preyed on the commerce</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the Plutocracy ever since. I do not intend to rest</seg><seg type="columnLine">until father's ideas are carried out; the slaves are freed,</seg><seg type="columnLine">and there is justice in the courts for all.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "As soon as I decided on this course I realized that my</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">â¢position was very different from the one I held, when</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">we were engaged, so I wrote you, asking if you pre-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ferred to break off the engagement or live the life of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">a pirate's wife. When I did not hear from you, I was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">very much afraid that I would have to go on alone."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "I would be with you anywhere, James," she said.</seg><seg type="columnLine">''But with the combined power of our principalities we</seg><seg type="columnLine">should be able to gain your point, even against the Pluto-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cracy. Since my father's death, I am Princess of</seg><seg type="columnLine">Orleans, Duchess of the Cumberlands, and Countess of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the Delta. Together, we control almost a fifth of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">country."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  James shook his head.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  "Some of my estates are far separated you know," he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">said. "And though I believe the artisans and people gen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">erally would support me if they dared, I do not think</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they will have the courage to do so. The Kingdom of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the South, which was our main support, has been badly</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ravaged. It is more likely that you will only lose your</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">estates in addition. Still, I feel sure we will win finally.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The Black Groups have given me some aid already, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">they will continue to co-operate with us. I do not ap-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">prove of their policy af assassination; still I have had</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to admit that it is the only thing that has held the Pluto-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cracy in check at all."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  Here Aurelius reported the transfer of stores com-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">plete. James ordered the slaves on the liner turned loose</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and allowed some of them, who had had experience</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">either as soldiers or machinery workers, to join his crew.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The passengers and the Myrmidons were left unmolest-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ed. The invaders withdrew to the Mercury, accom-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">panied by the Princess Avice and two of her slaves. It</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was s: :-n found that they had taken their departure none</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">too soon, for the scouts sent out in the gliders came back</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">at top speed and reported a fleet of large ships approach-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ing from the east and north. James went to the control</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">cabin and laid a course almost due south along the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ancient river valley of the Mississippi. He ordered full</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">speed for both vertical and horizontal propellers. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Mercury was a wonderfully swift yacht, built for speed,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">but w::h the damage to the propeller, he doubted if he</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">could distance the ships behind him. He knew that they</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would be spread out fan-wise with delicate listening</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">apparatus tuned to discover the sound of his motors, so</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he hoped to outwit them by rising, which would lessen</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the distance that his motors could be heard, since sound</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">is carried by air waves, and in the rarefied air of great</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">heights audibility is much decreased.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">  The vertical propellers, hidden deep within their air</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">shafts, which were so arranged as to force out a dense</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">column of air from the bottom of the ship, thus helping</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">it to rise in somewhat the same manner that a squid pro-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">pels itself through the water, hummed with a steadily</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">rising note as they gained speed. The Mercury rose</seg><seg type="columnLine">swiftly and soon all hands were ordered below decks to</seg><seg type="columnLine">protect them from the cold and rarefied air of the great</seg><seg type="columnLine">height. In the control cabin of polished ebony and ma-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hogany, James and Avice sat on a bench waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">anxiously for a report from the master electrician. His</seg><seg type="columnLine">report will determine whether or not the fleet had picked</seg><seg type="columnLine">up their trail.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you remember where our estates adjoin in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Cumberland Mountains?' asked James.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Of course," answered Avice. "I got many a lecture</seg><seg type="columnLine">from my governess for sneaking off from the Villa Cum-</seg><seg type="columnLine">berland to play with you."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, that is where we are going," said James. "We</seg><seg type="columnLine">have a secret stronghold near there. We should reach it</seg><seg type="columnLine">in a few hours."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Aurelius entered.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "The master electrician reports that a large fleet is un-</seg><seg type="columnLine">doubtedly following us and gaining on us fast," he said.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Drop the ship within five hundred feet of the earth</seg><seg type="columnLine">at once," ordered James. "Our plan has failed. We</seg><seg type="columnLine">must depend on speed now and the propellers can't get</seg><seg type="columnLine">a good grip on the air at this altitude."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> After the ship had reached the thicker air of the lower</seg><seg type="columnLine">altitudes, the pursuing fleet gained much more slowly.</seg><seg type="columnLine">But they still gained, and the number of pursuers</seg><seg type="columnLine">steadily increased as ships, signaled in advance, joined</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pursuit. By keeping up a strong and continuous field</seg><seg type="columnLine">of static the electrician on the Mercury interfered with</seg><seg type="columnLine">these signals as much as possible and prevented any in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">telligible messages from being sent to ships in the di-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rection in which the Mercury was moving. In that way</seg><seg type="columnLine">the ships were not headed off, but new ones steadily</seg><seg type="columnLine">joined the pursuers from flank and rear.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The chase lasted for some hours. The pursuers were</seg><seg type="columnLine">much closer and the dawn was lightening the sky in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">East. James had gradually turned east of south and was</seg><seg type="columnLine">now over the western foothill of the southern Appala-</seg><seg type="columnLine">chians. In order to lose no time in vertical movements,</seg><seg type="columnLine">he was following the carefully engineered track of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">Org Line. This wonderful invention, embodying a</seg><seg type="columnLine">series of electro-magnets arranged in a half circle so</seg><seg type="columnLine">that a paramagnetic body would be held at the center and</seg><seg type="columnLine">(by being equally attracted from below and both sides)</seg><seg type="columnLine">would be supported in the air a few feet from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">ground, appearing to stay there by magic, now carried</seg><seg type="columnLine">the freight traffic of the country at great speeds. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">electric circuits were so arranged that certain magnets</seg><seg type="columnLine">in front of any car traveling on the line pulled it for-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ward, and then, when it passed, the pole was automati-</seg><seg type="columnLine">cally changed and it was repelled. In this way cargoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">of great bulk were speedily transferred in metal cars,</seg><seg type="columnLine">without any crew or pilot.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As the sky slowly grew brighter, it became possible to</seg><seg type="columnLine">make out the pursuing fleet. It seemed to be composed</seg><seg type="columnLine">of large ships. To James' experienced eye they appeared</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be battle-cruisers. A shell that burst some distance</seg><seg type="columnLine">away made him aware that they also could be seen by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the pursuers. A large mountain loomed ahead into</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the Org Line bored in a tunnel. The situation was</seg><seg type="columnLine">desperate, for the delay necessary to rise over the moun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tain would be fatal. The crew were aware of their pre-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dicament and either stood around the windshields, watch-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the pursuing fleet with hopless hate in their eyes, or</seg><seg type="columnLine">busied themselves in preparing the guns of the cruiser</seg><seg type="columnLine">for a last desperate battle. Most of them would be</seg><seg type="columnLine">370</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">AMAZING STORIES</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">treated as runaway slaves if they were captured and they</seg><seg type="columnLine">preferred to die at their posts. Aurelius, brave and</seg><seg type="columnLine">stanch of heart as his peerless Roman namesake, fin-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gered his long heavy sword and suggested that since they</seg><seg type="columnLine">must fight, they should turn back and board the flagship</seg><seg type="columnLine">in which he did not doubt Lothaire to be, saying that he</seg><seg type="columnLine">could die happy if he first saw his blade bury itself</seg><seg type="columnLine">in Lothaire's body. Avice de Loyola, brave as any of</seg><seg type="columnLine">her illustrious ancesters, who had been noted for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">courage for hundreds of years, stood quietly--very pale</seg><seg type="columnLine">but composed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Since we must die, my prince," she said, "let us show</seg><seg type="columnLine">them that we know how to die bravely. I am glad that</seg><seg type="columnLine">we are together."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> James looked at her in desperation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "No!" he said. "It shall not be. You are too young</seg><seg type="columnLine">and beautiful to die. There must be some way out. If</seg><seg type="columnLine">only that mountain were not there. If we lose time to</seg><seg type="columnLine">rise over it they will get us with a shell; but if we</seg><seg type="columnLine">had a little start, we might be able to escape, for their</seg><seg type="columnLine">cursed listening devices will not work among the echoes</seg><seg type="columnLine">and air currents of these hills."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Then he saw the gaping mouth of the Org Tunnel and</seg><seg type="columnLine">a desperate plan flashed into his mind.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "All is not lost," he announced coolly. "There is still</seg><seg type="columnLine">one chance; a desperate one, but still, a chance."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> He stepped to the open bridge and took the controls.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Straight toward the mouth of the tunnel he headed. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel was terribly small for his plan. Should they strike</seg><seg type="columnLine">an Org Car coming in the other direction, at the speed at</seg><seg type="columnLine">which they were moving they would be reduced to dust,</seg><seg type="columnLine">but it seemed their only alternative. Another danger was</seg><seg type="columnLine">that of being forced against the roof or wall of the tun-</seg><seg type="columnLine">nel. As the darkness closed over them, he heard Avice</seg><seg type="columnLine">gasp. Aurelius' ruddy face turned almost white, but</seg><seg type="columnLine">he stood quietly with a grim smile on his face. This was</seg><seg type="columnLine">the kind of thing he admired, and for which he followed</seg><seg type="columnLine">his young leader with boundless devotion. Courage and</seg><seg type="columnLine">audacity, where could there be a better leader ?</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The tunnel was fifteen miles long but it hardly seemed</seg><seg type="columnLine">that they were in it a minute. To James it was just a</seg><seg type="columnLine">long stretch of smooth walls illuminated by the search-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light and blurred by the speed with which he passed.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Then they shot out into the open air again and just as</seg><seg type="columnLine">they rose from the Org Line, a cigar shaped car, al-</seg><seg type="columnLine">most as large as the cruiser, suddenly loomed out of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">dim morning light ahead and shot past below with the</seg><seg type="columnLine">speed of thought. James raised his hand to his forehead</seg><seg type="columnLine">and found it damp with perspiration at the narrowness</seg><seg type="columnLine">of their escape. If they had met the Org Car in the</seg><seg type="columnLine">tunnel, they would never have known what struck them.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> James steered the ship down a sheltering valley at</seg><seg type="columnLine">right angles to their former course. Then he changed</seg><seg type="columnLine">the course several times dropping deep into mountain</seg><seg type="columnLine">valleys and hurtling through passes at top speed. When,</seg><seg type="columnLine">after a half hour of this, the master electrician reported</seg><seg type="columnLine">no sound of the pursuing fleet, he knew that they were</seg><seg type="columnLine">safe. He headed straight for their stronghold. A few</seg><seg type="columnLine">minutes later he brought the ship low over the rushing</seg><seg type="columnLine">waters of a swift mountain stream. After following its</seg><seg type="columnLine">course for a short distance, the dark entrance of a mighty</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern showed to their left. By skillful maneuvering</seg><seg type="columnLine">he brought the Mercury to rest in this natural hangar,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">completely concealed from the keen eyes of the hundreds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of aerial scouts that he knew would soon be on the look-</seg><seg type="columnLine">out for them. Under the eye of the searchlight, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cavern disclosed itself as containing galleries and pas^</seg><seg type="columnLine">sages that might conceal an army. A small body of his</seg><seg type="columnLine">men that had been left behind, either to guard the strong-</seg><seg type="columnLine">hold or because they were unfit for the strenuous work</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the expedition, rushed forward to unload the ship and</seg><seg type="columnLine">congratulate them on the successful outcome of their ex-</seg><seg type="columnLine">pedition. When it was learned that James had brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">back his future wrife, and that she was Avice, who was</seg><seg type="columnLine">noted for her generosity, kindliness and wealth, an im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">promptu celebration was staged.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> A few hours later they were married. The impressive'</seg><seg type="columnLine">and dignified ceremony was performed before a natural</seg><seg type="columnLine">altar in the rock. The scene was lit by the ruddy glare</seg><seg type="columnLine">of a great fire. James stood tall and proud and very</seg><seg type="columnLine">happy, with his officers and friends grouped behind him.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Avice, with hair as black as night, and skin of the tint</seg><seg type="columnLine">of pale ivory, stood at his side with her maids behind her.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Her gorgeous robes and jewels (taken from the small</seg><seg type="columnLine">amount of baggage she had had time to bring with her)</seg><seg type="columnLine">made her look, even more than ever, the beautiful woman</seg><seg type="columnLine">and great princess that she was. The gossamer fabrics,</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the fashion of the day, only partially concealed the</seg><seg type="columnLine">beautifully rounded perfection of her form. The fire-</seg><seg type="columnLine">light glinted from her hair, illuminated the soft and</seg><seg type="columnLine">warm flesh of her throat and shoulders, and sparkled in</seg><seg type="columnLine">her eyes in a way that put to shame her splendid jewels.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The ceremony was performed by Aurelius, who had</seg><seg type="columnLine">been made a tribune by Prince Edward, James' father.</seg><seg type="columnLine">As the concluding words were said, Avice and James</seg><seg type="columnLine">blended their lips in one long kiss, a thousand swords</seg><seg type="columnLine">flashed from their scabbards and a mighty shout rent</seg><seg type="columnLine">the air. "Long life and happiness to our* King and</seg><seg type="columnLine">Queen, Success to our cause!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">*	* *</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">1 RETURNED to full consciousness very slowly. It</seg><seg type="columnLine">was with a start that I realized that the sun was</seg><seg type="columnLine">shining on the stained glass windows in the west of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the room and that it must be late afternoon. I must have</seg><seg type="columnLine">been in some kind of trance, looking into the crystal</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball, for hours. I turned my attention to the crystal</seg><seg type="columnLine">again. It was as clear and limpid as a mountain stream.</seg><seg type="columnLine">No vestige of the wild scenes that I had gazed at within</seg><seg type="columnLine">its depths remained. Nor did the most prolonged scru-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tiny restore them. The ball remained mockingly clear.</seg><seg type="columnLine">I rose from the beautifully carved chair with my feet</seg><seg type="columnLine">sinking into the soft carpet and looked around for the</seg><seg type="columnLine">old magician. There was no one in the room save myself.</seg><seg type="columnLine">Still partially dazed, I walked from the room and out</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the street. As I passed out it seemed to me that</seg><seg type="columnLine">I heard someone laughing softly to himself.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> I went to my rooms and turned what little skill I had</seg><seg type="columnLine">into writing the story of what I had seen in the crystal</seg><seg type="columnLine">ball.

It may be merely the wild dreams of a man under</seg><seg type="columnLine">the influence of whatever drug the old magician used in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the charcoal brazier.

He now acted in an unusual manner</seg><seg type="columnLine">for janitors, for he carefully placed these treasures in</seg><seg type="columnLine">a larger stamped envelope which he carried in an inside</seg><seg type="columnLine">pocket of his vest. Leaving the office door open, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">quickly walked down the hall and taking the envelope</seg><seg type="columnLine">'he had just filled, deposited it in the mail-chute.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> The next morning this letter found its way to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">desk of a free-lance writer for a popular scientific</seg><seg type="columnLine">monthly.

He was known at the office</seg><seg type="columnLine">as "Mr. Hawk," and the magazine closed its eyes to his</seg><seg type="columnLine">news-gathering methods, because his stuff was popular</seg><seg type="columnLine">and helped put the publication over with half a million</seg><seg type="columnLine">copies per month. An odd type of person, with a neu-</seg><seg type="columnLine">rotic taste for the quasi-scientific. He had studied just</seg><seg type="columnLine">enough science to kill his morals and religion.

Scoefield threaded his way through the group</seg><seg type="columnLine">of passengers on the platform and got into the waiting</seg><seg type="columnLine">buggy of Lem Thompson. Lem was an old-time</seg><seg type="columnLine">farmer, rich in land, but stringent for ready money. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">leased one of his hilltops to the Astronomical Club and</seg><seg type="columnLine">depended upon them for a considerable part of his in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">come.

As he strode</seg><seg type="columnLine">up the path to the Shack, he was conscious of a chill in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the night air, denoting that the short summer was draw-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to its close. His ear, always in tune to the sounds</seg><seg type="columnLine">of nature, caught an odd droning sound coming up from</seg><seg type="columnLine">the valley.

As he entered, a roaring fire, the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cheery circle of old friends, and the aroma of roast pork</seg><seg type="columnLine">with New England baked beans, greeted him.

After cleaning and adjusting his</seg><seg type="columnLine">glasses, he began:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "You gentlemen know that in the exclusive story of</seg><seg type="columnLine">our exploration to the Moon, which Fred sold to the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Associated Press, there were mentioned 603 geological</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimens, besides those basalt disks, which we brought</seg><seg type="columnLine">back. I saw fit to give the Smithsonian Institute 492</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimens, which I identified and labeled during our fall</seg><seg type="columnLine">back to earth; presumably the remainder not mentioned</seg><seg type="columnLine">were either duplicates or worthless; at any rate, no</seg><seg type="columnLine">questions were asked about them, and as far as I know,</seg><seg type="columnLine">the public thinks they have the entire collection."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "For my part, after risking life and limb, I felt en-</seg><seg type="columnLine">titled to retain such material as I have here until this</seg><seg type="columnLine">club could examine and study it at leisure. In fact, this</seg><seg type="columnLine">shack is the only place in the world where I can do any</seg><seg type="columnLine">uninterrupted work. I expect to remain here for another</seg><seg type="columnLine">month at least.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now then, bring the lamps closer, and pass around</seg><seg type="columnLine">these minerals from hand to hand. The science of fossils</seg><seg type="columnLine">is, as you know% called 'palaeontology.' It is a very</seg><seg type="columnLine">broad subject, with new discoveries constantly extend-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing the field. It has now several distinct divisions,</seg><seg type="columnLine">among which may be mentioned 'palaeobotany,' concern-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing itself with the ancient forms of vegetable life. As</seg><seg type="columnLine">an example, please examine these fern fronds; beautiful</seg><seg type="columnLine">specimens, and dating from the Moon's carboniferous</seg><seg type="columnLine">period; probably millions of years before corresponding</seg><seg type="columnLine">terrestrial conditions. They are identical with clado-</seg><seg type="columnLine">phlebis denticiilata, found in English inferior oolite;</seg><seg type="columnLine">adding as if does, another of the now overwhelming</seg><seg type="columnLine">proofs of the universality of the evolutionary processes.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "On the other hand, I have here samples of red shale,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which may be only ten thousand years old, or dating</seg><seg type="columnLine">from the last great cataclysm, which rendered the Moon</seg><seg type="columnLine">uninhabitable for flora or fauna, as we understand it.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "We have striking evidence that in the Moon's death</seg><seg type="columnLine">agony, a series of frightful earthquakes occurred, open-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing up gigantic fissures in the surface into which the once</seg><seg type="columnLine">abundant seas disappeared. In these cosmic disturb-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ances, whole verdant areas must have been suddenly in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">undated, followed by violent sand storms, and then by</seg><seg type="columnLine">burning sun-heat. In this way, these red shale fossils</seg><seg type="columnLine">have been formed. They are a very prolific source of</seg><seg type="columnLine">information.

If someone will get me a chisel, I would like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">split down this block first."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">DURING the interval of getting tools, heads were</seg><seg type="columnLine">bent together, specimens were passed around, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">everybody talked at once.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Fred, come help me hold this piece on edge, while I</seg><seg type="columnLine">try to split through this dark vein." A light blow, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">the stone crumbled under hand, it was so soft and</seg><seg type="columnLine">porous. They all leaned forward to see the contents.</seg><seg type="columnLine">There it was; a spray of leaves on a twig, just as fresh</seg><seg type="columnLine">and green as if plucked yesterday, and partly hidden be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tween the leaves, a brown, egg-shaped object, ridged</seg><seg type="columnLine">and mottled. Holding up the strange thing, Mueller</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked, "What is it?" "Pass it over here," answered</seg><seg type="columnLine">Skidmore, who was a natural history fan.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Gentlemen:" he said "this is a fossil chrysalis of a</seg><seg type="columnLine">huge cutter fly, with probably a wing span of fourteen</seg><seg type="columnLine">or sixteen inches. Very rare and very interesting, in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">deed."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What makes you think it is a fossil ?" spoke up Scoe-</seg><seg type="columnLine">field. "It may be living!"</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Well, that is easy to try," said Mueller. "Someone</seg><seg type="columnLine">bring me a bowl of warm water." The thing was thrust</seg><seg type="columnLine">into the water and all eyes were focused. The seconds</seg><seg type="columnLine">lengthened into minutes. "Give it time to warm up,"</seg><seg type="columnLine">said Mueller; but hardly had he uttered these words,</seg><seg type="columnLine">when the thing began to squirm and jump like a Mexican</seg><seg type="columnLine">jumping bean. The astonishment of the men can be im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">agined. Everybody talked at once, and Skidmore now</seg><seg type="columnLine">took the stage. "Tell me, Doctor, how do you account</seg><seg type="columnLine">for such a miraculous preservation, after these thou-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sands of years?" he questioned. "I cannot account for</seg><seg type="columnLine">it. It is simply one of those strange freaks of nature</seg><seg type="columnLine">which the scientist encounters occasionally, to baffle and</seg><seg type="columnLine">upset our fine theories and speculations. All that could</seg><seg type="columnLine">be said is that a rare combination of insulation, together</seg><seg type="columnLine">with oxygen-bearing ores, sealed and kept vitalized the</seg><seg type="columnLine">twig and chrysalis."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Do you suppose the chrysalis will hatch?" everyone</seg><seg type="columnLine">asked.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why not?" he answered. "And if it does, it will re-</seg><seg type="columnLine">present the Moon's last living creature. We will put</seg><seg type="columnLine">it in a little wire cage under the laboratory skylight, and</seg><seg type="columnLine">let the heat of the sun do the rest."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> This fossil proved to be the "piece de resistance" of</seg><seg type="columnLine">the evening; the remainder held but casual interest for</seg><seg type="columnLine">the men. In a very short time the discussion became</seg><seg type="columnLine">general, and when the chrysalis had been properly dis-</seg><seg type="columnLine">posed of, it ceased to be a subject of speculation. The</seg><seg type="columnLine">night was particularly fine; several of the men wanted</seg><seg type="columnLine">to search for a new comet, recently reported from the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Harvard Observatory, so it was well after two o'clock</seg><seg type="columnLine">before all lights were out, and the symphony of crickets</seg><seg type="columnLine">in the high brush around the shack, was augmented by</seg><seg type="columnLine">the breathing of a dozen men.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> About ten o'clock next morning, Skidmore entered the</seg><seg type="columnLine">laboratory to get his graflex camera. He had left it 011</seg><seg type="columnLine">the big work table under the skylight, near the little im-</seg><seg type="columnLine">provised cage. Glancing toward it, he was surprised to</seg><seg type="columnLine">see the netting neatly slit open, the chrysalis gone, and in</seg><seg type="columnLine">its place, a short note scrawled in lead pencil, on the mar-</seg><seg type="columnLine">gin of a scrap of daily newspaper! He picked it up and</seg><seg type="columnLine">read the following:</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">    "Gentlemen: I regret to deprive you of your little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> treasure, but I also possess scientific curiosity, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> have no qualms, since this is undoubtedly the right-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> ful property of the Smithsonian Institute."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Skidmore rushed back into the living room where the</seg><seg type="columnLine">men were tumbling out of their bunks, or getting dressed</seg><seg type="columnLine">for breakfast.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> They were electrified by the news, and rushed in a</seg><seg type="columnLine">body into the laboratory to look at the empty cage.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Why the devil didn't he take some of our money and</seg><seg type="columnLine">let the chrysalis alone?" blurted out Mueller, who now</seg><seg type="columnLine">appeared in very baggy pajamas.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Now don't get your Dutch up, Doc," retorted Ken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthy; "let us sit down to breakfast, and calmly</seg><seg type="columnLine">analyze this theft."</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "That's right, Professor, you are somewhat of an</seg><seg type="columnLine">amateur detective, if all the reports from Chicago are</seg><seg type="columnLine">true," added Scoefield.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In truth, the noted astronomer was an insatiable con-</seg><seg type="columnLine">sumer of detective stories and criminology interested him</seg><seg type="columnLine">as a divergent line of thought.

Appetites were keen, and once again, the big</seg><seg type="columnLine">table resounded to a noisy meal.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "Mr. Skidmore, please give me that note; I'd like to</seg><seg type="columnLine">glance at it for a moment," requested Professor Ken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthy, after the breakfast was well under way. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">scrutinized it carefully, and then turning to the men, said,</seg><seg type="columnLine">"I feel certain that the mere writing of this note will</seg><seg type="columnLine">prove the thief's undoing.

I don't think the daily papers are a serious</seg><seg type="columnLine">consideration, although there are eight or ten Sunday</seg><seg type="columnLine">papers which usually run one or more popular science</seg><seg type="columnLine">articles in their magazine sections. These inaccurate and</seg><seg type="columnLine">grossly exaggerated space fillers are nearly always</seg><seg type="columnLine">signed, and seldom deal with entomology.

As it lacked but a few minutes of noon, Thomp-</seg><seg type="columnLine">son carefully laid aside his fork, when he saw Ken-</seg><seg type="columnLine">worthy, and coming out of the barn he invited him into</seg><seg type="columnLine">the spring house to have a glass of buttermilk.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> As they chatted, the Professor related the facts of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">strange disappearance of the chrysalis, and made in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">quiry about the length and outlet of the road. It ap-</seg><seg type="columnLine">peared that the road ran by a devious route deep into the</seg><seg type="columnLine">hill country for about 12 miles, and then cut across a</seg><seg type="columnLine">concrete state highway leading directly south to Rutland.</seg><seg type="columnLine">This was an important clue, and would have to be run</seg><seg type="columnLine">out while the tracks of the thief were still fresh.

Fortunately, he picked a taxi driver</seg><seg type="columnLine">who entered into the spirit of the chase, for he was lit-</seg><seg type="columnLine">erally raced from publisher to publisher. His fame,</seg><seg type="columnLine">which both bored and embarrassed him, proved the open</seg><seg type="columnLine">sesame to the editorial rooms. He was surprised at the</seg><seg type="columnLine">wide circle of acquaintances these editors had. They</seg><seg type="columnLine">really seemed to know everybody who typed a line in</seg><seg type="columnLine">the metropolis. He was swamped with names, but kind</seg><seg type="columnLine">assistance narrowed down the list to a possible dozen.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> There was nothing else to do but call on these men in-</seg><seg type="columnLine">dividually. Then the wild goose chase began. It was</seg><seg type="columnLine">most discouraging; several of the writers were out of</seg><seg type="columnLine">town, other were out digging up copy, or had dinner</seg><seg type="columnLine">engagements. The afternoon appeared to be wasted,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since only four men had been actually interviewed.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Hot and exhausted, Fred returned to his office to</seg><seg type="columnLine">change his wilted collar and freshen up a bit before go-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ing to the Engineers' Club for dinner. He would rest an</seg><seg type="columnLine">hour or so and pursue the trail again in the evening.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It was after 5 :30 when he walked into his office. He</seg><seg type="columnLine">was not surprised to see the door ajar, for he knew the</seg><seg type="columnLine">cleaners would be at work at this time, but it was quite a</seg><seg type="columnLine">shock to see a man on his knees rummaging through the</seg><seg type="columnLine">waste baskets, letter by letter.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> "What are you doing here?" he demanded.

Anything to save his job. He hesitated for a mo-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ment, and then, reaching in his pocket, he produced a</seg><seg type="columnLine">large stamped and addressed envelope, which, with trem-</seg><seg type="columnLine">bling hand, he handed to Scoefield. Without another</seg><seg type="columnLine">word, he stooped and gathered the loose letters into a</seg><seg type="columnLine">burlap bag; then taking up his dust-pan and brush, he</seg><seg type="columnLine">trudged out of the office and down the hall.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Fred studied the address.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">           Michael J.

The readers</seg><seg type="columnLine">of Amazing Stories have had a</seg><seg type="columnLine">number of stories about ants presented to</seg><seg type="columnLine">them in our pages. Some of these stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">must have appeared rather remarkable or</seg><seg type="columnLine">even extravagant, as predicating such</seg><seg type="columnLine">power and intelligence for these little be-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ings. In this book there is no science fic-</seg><seg type="columnLine">tion, but scientific truth, a detailed account</seg><seg type="columnLine">of the insect whom the author terms</seg><seg type="columnLine">"astonishing." It makes the ant appear</seg><seg type="columnLine">more wonderful than it has been depicted</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our pages. A clue to the work may be</seg><seg type="columnLine">obtained from the titles from a few of the</seg><seg type="columnLine">chapters, such as "Seeing Antland," "Ant</seg><seg type="columnLine">Weddings," "Ant Housekeeping," "The</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ant Underworld," "Mushroom Growing</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ants," and we even have a chapter on the</seg><seg type="columnLine">Termites, whose popular name is White</seg><seg type="columnLine">Ants.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> It can well be seen that twenty chapters</seg><seg type="columnLine">such as these will cover an immense amount</seg><seg type="columnLine">of ground. The most wonderful stories</seg><seg type="columnLine">are told about these insects, whose ways</seg><seg type="columnLine">seem almost human. ^ Interesting as the</seg><seg type="columnLine">subject is to the distinguished authoress,</seg><seg type="columnLine">she says there is something sad about it,</seg><seg type="columnLine">since the Department of Agriculture in</seg><seg type="columnLine">Washington announces that ants destroy</seg><seg type="columnLine">millions and millions of dollars worth of</seg><seg type="columnLine">property in the United States alone, to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">(Mostly Scientific Fiction)</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg><seg type="columnLine">say nothing of the combined losses.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> In the tropics, ants are still worse than</seg><seg type="columnLine">in our country. One curious thing told</seg><seg type="columnLine">us is that there are some 1500 kinds of</seg><seg type="columnLine">termites (white ants).</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> Despite the fact that the book seems</seg><seg type="columnLine">to be written for children, we can hardly</seg><seg type="columnLine">say too much in its favor for perusal by</seg><seg type="columnLine">grown people. It has between two and</seg><seg type="columnLine">three hundred pages of most interesting</seg><seg type="columnLine">text and in the neighborhood of forty very</seg><seg type="columnLine">wonderful illustrations by Henry C.

They will reduce the wood of a piece</seg><seg type="columnLine">of furniture to dust without disturbing the</seg><seg type="columnLine">outside, so that a chair, intact to all appear-</seg><seg type="columnLine">ance, will crumble if one sits upon it.

This was an interesting</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and exciting story, but it seemed to me he over-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">stepped the boundaries of present-day fact a little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">too far* without giving any adequate reason. The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">greatest error was in his method of utilizing the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">orbital velocity of the earth to get to the moon.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Granting the premise that it would be possible</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to release the ship from the earth's gravitation, it</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">would be possible to use the orbital velocity of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the earth to get to the moon, but not in the way</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">he suggested.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   It is a well recognized law in physics that</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when a body is moving in a curved path there</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">must be a cetripedal force operating inward along</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the radius of the curvature equal to and opposed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">to the centrifugal force.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Thus, the analogy, which was given of the boy</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">towed on skates, was false in some details, for</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when the boy made the U turn, the ice would</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">supply the force necessary to turn him, computed</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">by the above statement. If this force were not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">present, he could not turn, as is easily shown</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">when you run on ice without skates and try to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turn. The same difficulty was encountered in</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">early aviation attempts before the scheme of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">banking on turns was discovered. The rudder</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">turned the nose of the ship, but the ship con-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tinued going in its original direction. That is,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the orientation of the ship with reference to its</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">line of velocity was changed, but the line of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">velocity was not.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Velocity is a vector quantity, expressing direc-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tion as well as magnitude. Momentum is mea-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> sured by the product of the mass and velocity,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> m x v. The statement that the momentum was</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> practically the same after they had made their</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> U turn is, then, false, for the velocity was in a</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> different direction. The force necessary to change</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the direction of the velocity would be extremely</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> large at any reasonable radius of curvature, for at</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the velocity of 67,600 m.p.h. or 99,100 ft./sec.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the quantity m v would be tremendous. This</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> force was in no way accounted for in the story,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> but it seemed taken for granted that once the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> nose of the ship was pointed in a given direction,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> the velocity would automatically change. This</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> is a little too much to pass without explanation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Another minor point was left out which, how-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ever, would have little effect on this story. From</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the point where the earth's gravitational force</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">was cut off it is not stated whether this also cut</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">off the gravitational pull of the sun. If it did,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the earth would not then be traveling with the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">ship, but the ship would leave at a tangent to</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the earth's orbit. It is this fact that might be</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">used in a flight to the moon, for in a short time</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the tangent would intersect the orbit of the moon,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">and thus a flight might be accomplished without</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the impossible bending back and change of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">velocity direction.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   Another inconsistency was the difficulty ex-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">perienced in driving the drill with a hammer on</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the moon. True, the hammer would have less</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">weight on the moon, but the most important factor</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">in using a hammer is not its weight, but its mo-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">mentum at the instant of* impact, and momen-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tum in mass, which is unaffected by gravitation.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The effectiveness of the hammer would be little</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">impaired, for the force of gravity is an inconsider-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">able feature, as is shown by the fact that it is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">easy to drive a nail into a vertical wall where the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">force of gravity is no assistance whatever,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"></seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">   I like the stories and illustrations as a whole,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> although the illustrations are often inaccurate.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> For example, the cover on the February number</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> shows the entire heads of the adventurers with</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> their sleekly combed hair, while the story dis-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> tinctly says that before putting on the space suit</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine"> they donned a "union suit made of wool.

First,</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the stories. They are all very good, with, of</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">course, the exception of one or two. I think the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">worst I have read is "The Act of Retipuj." The</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">best I ever read is "Skylark Three." The latter</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">story was marvelous, and although I am only</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">aged twelve, I appreciate it fully. My favorite</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">authors are Dr. Smith, Dr. Breuer, Taylor Han-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">sen, Jack Williamson, Harl Vincent, Captain</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">Meek, and Charles Cloukey. The artists and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">drawings--of all your artists, Wesso is su-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">preme. His drawings are so accurate and life-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">like, that it is hard to believe that they are not</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">photographs. Morey and Paul are his greatest</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">rivals. He has nothing to fear from the others.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The discussions are very interesting. The theory</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">propounded by P. G. Miller, that Neptune is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">an invader from space, is very ingenious, and</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">should be given serious consideration. The Edi-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">torials are always very instructive and well</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">written. I especially liked the one in the Sep-</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">tember, 1930, issue, about the atom and the stars.</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">The paper is all right, but there is one thing I</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">do not like about Amazing Stories, and that is</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">the way its covers are bound. They fall off</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">very easily, and one does not like to disfigure</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">such splendid drawings as you have on the</seg></ab><ab><seg type="columnLine">covers by pasting them on again.
