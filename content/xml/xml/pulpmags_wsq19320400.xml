            <seg type="columnLine">but since he was a stranger to me I surmised he was my</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">but the girl, no doubt, was his excuse for the delay. Not</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> There came a blinding flash; the room seemed filled with</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">its orbit, perhaps with the full power of his repeller</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">rays, perhaps with a blast of his tubes, more likely with</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">trajectory, and had been too dilatory to broadcast a warn-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">ing. But even that would not have mattered had Hasken</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Yet in the last analysis it all came back to some defects</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the wiring. The installation as well as the spares</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">must have been of bad quality. The warning lamps had</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">merely flickered instead of filling the room with virulent</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">red, and to top it all off the power wires to the rays had</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> As I say my mind grasped all this in a fraction of time</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">rate, a movement additional to its forward progress. The</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">obvious deduction was that the shell and the interior of</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the polyhedron were built separately, and that the inner</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was kept steady by some sort of gyroscopic arrangement,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">while the outer portion while spinning contrived somehow</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to create a vacuum in the air about it. This would at one</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">and the same time do away with a good deal of the trou-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">we at last managed to find a method of repairing the</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">with the metal of the flyer and we were nearly giving up</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in despair when one day, Halvus Tar, who had been an</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> We told him, more out of courtesy than for any other</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">he understood what was wrong. I think in his own queer</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">way he was genuinely fond of us. At any rate he asked</seg>

        </ab>
        <ab>
            <seg type="columnLine"> Then haltingly he explained that such a substance was</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not altogether unknown on Neptune. The inhabitants,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">however, not being great metal workers, and finding little</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">or no use for it, had done next to nothing with it. It</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">possessed peculiar properties that rendered it more or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">less useless for most of their purposes. One was that it</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was found almost always in a liquid state, and it rapidly</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">hardened before it could be worked. Oncc it had been ex-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">posed to the air no amount of heat applied to it could</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">render it malleable. A good deal of this, however, may</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">have been due to the fact that the Neptunians possessed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">no electric furnaces; their ideas of heat were radically</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Halvus Tar, however, told us that many of their ancient</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">of this metal, and that any attempt to mine it would result</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">in the balance of Neptune being disturbed. Whether or</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">not there was anything in the last part of this suggestion,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">the first part of it seemed quite feasible. It was in a way</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">merely a variation of the osmotic theorem, and if it were</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">correct it would no doubt explain why Neptune's mass</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was not in proportion to its size. Until within the last</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">half century or so the greater proportion of the astron-</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">omers of the Inner Planets had reasoned that the lesser</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">launched at his head, retaliated with a stiff right and left</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">to the stomach and closed. Hugging O'Grady closely,</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">he hooked his leg back of the detective's knee and threw</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">with a straight right in the face before he was well on his</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">feet. As he staggered off balance, O'Grady's left chopped</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> They rose once more to their feet, and for a split second</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">escaped. This time, however, the lieutenant was not so</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">anxious to renew the conflict. O'Grady had absorbed</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> Near at hand was a desk. In the top drawer, he knew,</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">a revenge, which I desired only a little less than my half-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine">maelstrom that tossed her about for a while, then crashed</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">her down upon the ice. No lives were lost, but the ship</seg>
            <seg type="columnLine">was wrecked beyond repair. Even the wireless was de-</seg>

            <seg type="columnLine"> The expedition had been well provisioned, and its mem-</seg>
